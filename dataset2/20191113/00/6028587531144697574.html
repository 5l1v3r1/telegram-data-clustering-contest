      <p>The Ninth Circuit has recently managed to muck up copyright law with several remarkable rulings that effectively strangle the music industry and will likely impact the film industry. Here are the key rulings and their implications:In its latest foray, a panel of the Ninth Circuit allowed a claim to go forward that Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off,” which has the words, “Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play / And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate,” violated the copyright to an earlier rap song that had the rather mundane phrases “The playas gon’ play / Them haters gonna hate.” The lower court had thrown out the case based solely on the pleadings based on established law holding that short phrases could not be copyrighted, for the obvious reason that it would give a plaintiff a monopoly on the phrase, but the Ninth Circuit ruled that the issue of copyright infringement was a question of fact that could not be resolved at the pleading stage. Not surprisingly, counsel for the plaintiff in this case believes that the issue involves more than a short phrase and that there is infringement in repeating the concept that haters are going to hate and players are going to play, although it seems rather obvious that that is what haters and players do.  In any event, as a practical matter, questions of disputed facts must be decided by a jury, so it may no longer be possible to resolve similar claims even at the summary judgment stage.</p>
      <p>Just last year, the Ninth Circuit upheld a jury verdict holding that a Marvin Gaye song had been infringed by a later song called “Blurred Lines” based solely on the testimony of an expert witness that a "constellation" of elements in both pieces of music — each of which alone were unprotectable — made the works substantially similar. As the dissent remarked, the decision effectively permitted a musical style to be copyrighted for the first time.</p>
      <p>In a similar ruling last year, a panel of the Ninth Circuit held that the mere combination of what would otherwise be unprotectable musical elements could be protected by copyright, so it reversed a jury verdict in favor of Led Zeppelin on the basis of what it viewed as incorrect jury instructions. This ruling has been accepted for en banc review by the entire Ninth Circuit, so with any luck it will be reversed.</p>
      <p>The net result of these cases is that it may now impossible to get a bogus copyright claim thrown out at summary judgment, and it will now require a full jury trial to resolve even completely meritless claims. The practical effect will be to force exorbitant settlements in the face of extortionate claims. These cases do not bode well for an appeal by Katy Perry of the recent jury verdict holding that her song “Dark Horse” infringed on a common fragment of a melodic phrase that the plaintiff has also used in an earlier song called “Joyful Noise.” </p>
      <p>There is nothing limiting the logic of these cases to music, so the damage will clearly spill over into the film industry, forcing settlement of endless nuisance claims unless these cases are reversed. So sad times are ahead for copyright litigation in the Ninth Circuit.</p>
