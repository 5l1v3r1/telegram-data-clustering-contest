      <h1>Faced with funding shortage, CBE extends boundaries, increasing bus costs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:56:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:56</time> by <a rel="author">Eva Ferguson</a></address>
      <p>Facing a $48-million budget shortfall, public school officials have been forced to extend their geographical boundaries, welcoming more students and higher busing costs.</p>
      <p>Because the City of Calgary has annexed large swaths of land along the city’s northwest, east and deep south edges over the past few years, the Calgary Board of Education must now follow suit and take in thousands of new residents into their system.</p>
      <p>Once the full community build-outs are completed over the next several years, the new “Haskayne” district in the city’s northwest will house 13,000 people, the new “Belvedere” district along the city’s east edge will house 61,000 people and the new “West Macleod” district in the city’s deep south can expect up to 35,800 residents.</p>
      <p>But taking new families also means taking on additional costs in transportation, a total of close to $500,000 over the next three years beginning next fall.</p>
      <p>“These are communities that are now within the boundaries of Calgary and now they’re being developed,” said Dany Breton, superintendent of facilities for the CBE.</p>
      <p>“Parents move to these areas thinking they’re going to be part of the CBE, not Foothills or Rocky View, so it just makes sense for us to take them in.”</p>
      <p>Breton added that transportation costs to bus students into schools farther into the city will also progress over time, but the CBE will look to recover those fees.</p>
      <p>“Every dollar counts, and we have to be stewards of the limited resources we have, so this is not insignificant.”</p>

      <p>But trustee Lisa Davis, who represents Wards 6 and 7, said the new boundaries present growing challenges as the CBE continues to face fewer families in the inner city, and continued growth in suburban areas.</p>
      <p>“When you look at the city’s strategy to encourage density, it’s fair to say we haven’t had the results we originally hoped for.”</p>
      <p>Coun. Ward Sutherland, who represents Ward 1, including inner-city areas such as Bowness and suburban communities such as Tuscany, said inner-city densification is tough because property values are unaffordable for ordinary families.</p>
      <p>But the city is working toward getting away from urban sprawl.</p>
      <p>“All the new communities that we have built in the past several years actually have higher densities than a lot of the inner city right now,” Sutherland said.</p>
      <p>“We are trying to build more in the inner city, like the massive housing development that’s just being finished at Kensington and Memorial.</p>
      <p>“But living in these places can still be cost-prohibitive.”</p>

      <p>The CBE is facing a massive funding shortfall after announcing last week that <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/cbe-looking-at-hundreds-of-job-cuts-because-of-ucp-budget">the UCP’s Budget 2019 left them with a $32-million cut</a> because of a change in grant funding.</p>
      <p>But that $32 million is expected to balloon to as much as $48 million since the new CBE budget isn’t expected until early January, and finance officials predict the costs will be higher as more teachers have to be paid out until December.</p>
      <p>The UCP government has sent a message to all boards asking them to find further efficiencies, or charge more fees if necessary.</p>
      <p>Right now, CBE students are already facing anywhere from $360 annually for yellow buses to as much as $750 a year for Calgary Transit, which takes an increasing number of students to middle schools and high schools.</p>
      <p>Board chair Marilyn Dennis agreed the CBE is facing a host of financial challenges and is now looking at a new funding model called the “Assurance and Funding Framework Review.”</p>
      <p>“We have a responsibility to make the dollars we receive stretch as far as we can, and we will continue to do that.”</p>
