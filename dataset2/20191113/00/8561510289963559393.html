      <h3>Immediate Aftermath</h3>
      <p>In September, the United States Navy <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/navy-confirms-ufo-videos-real">confirmed</a> the authenticity of footage of its fighter pilots encountering an “unidentified aerial phenomenon” in 2004.</p>
      <p>Now, several men who witnessed the strange event while serving in the Navy have <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a29771548/navy-ufo-witnesses-tell-truth/">come forward to speak</a> to <i>Popular Mechanics</i> about the experience — including what happened just after the sighting.</p>
      <h3>Men in Black</h3>
      <p>Gary Voorhis and Patrick “PJ” Hughes were stationed aboard the <i>USS Princeton</i> and the <i>USS</i> <i>Nimitz</i>, respectively, at the time of the 2004 UFO encounter. Both told <i>PopMech </i>they saw men they didn’t recognized arrive on their ships and take away drives containing the footage soon after it was recorded.</p>
      <p>“These two guys show up on a helicopter, which wasn’t uncommon,” Voorhis told <i>PopMech</i>, “but shortly after they arrived, maybe 20 minutes, I was told by my chain of command to turn over all the data recordings for the AEGIS system.”</p>
      <p>“They were not on the ship earlier, and I didn’t see them come on,” Hughes said of his encounter, adding, “We put [the hard drives] in the bags, [my commanding officer] took them, then he and the two anonymous officers left.”</p>
      <h3>More to Come</h3>
      <p>Perhaps even more intriguing than what happened with the hard drives is what could be on them — several witnesses told <i>PopMech</i> they believe there’s footage that’s even more impressive that what’s already been released.</p>
      <p>“I definitely saw video that was roughly 8 to 10 minutes long and a lot more clear,” Voorhis said — so perhaps we’ll get a better look at the Navy’s strange UFO encounter in the future.</p>
