      <h2>The Trussell Trust disclosed figures covering April to September showing the extent of hunger in the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:01:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Foodbanks gave away more than 7.4 million meals in just six months amid a 23% surge in demand, bombshell figures revealed today.</p>
      <p>Trussell Trust centres handed out 823,145 parcels from April to September during a record-breaking period for hungry Britons needing emergency aid.</p>
      <p>Each package contains enough rations for three meals a day for three days, meaning 7,408,305 meals were provided.</p>
      <p>Heartbreakingly, 301,653 parcels – equating to 2,714,877 meals – went to children during the six months.</p>

      <p>That was a 23% increase on the same period in 2018 – the sharpest rise the charity has seen for the past five years.</p>
      <p>According to the Trussell Trust, the main reasons for people needing emergency food were low benefit income (36%), and delays (18%) or changes (16%) to welfare being paid.</p>
      <p>Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “More people than ever before are being forced to foodbanks’ doors.</p>
      <p>“Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty, but currently thousands of women, men and children are not receiving sufficient protection from destitution.</p>

      <p>“This is not right. But we know this situation can be fixed - our benefits system could be the key to unlocking people from poverty.”</p>
      <p>The charity said one of the major issues faced by hungry families arriving at foodbanks is the five-week wait for a first <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> payment.</p>
      <p>It said that welfare recipients moving onto the new system have to wait at least five weeks – and often longer – with no money.</p>
      <p>While they can get an advance payment, this takes the form of a loan that must be paid back, often forcing people into debt.</p>

      <p>Ms Revie urged parties campaigning in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> to focus on easing poverty and making sure everyone has enough food to eat.</p>
      <p>She added: “This general election, all political parties must pledge to protect people from hunger by ensuring everyone has enough money for the basics.</p>
      <p>“We want our next government to start working towards a future where no one needs a foodbank by ending the five-week wait for Universal Credit; ensuring benefit payments cover the cost of living; and investing in local emergency support for people in crisis.</p>
      <p>“Together, these three changes will put money back into the pockets of people who most need our support.</p>
      <p>“It’s in our power as a country to end the need for foodbanks. This can change.”</p>
      <p>Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “It should be a source of shame for this government that foodbank use has risen so sharply yet again.</p>

      <p>“These figures show clearly how harsh, punitive Conservative policies like the five-week wait in Universal Credit are pushing people to the point of destitution.</p>
      <p>“When Universal Credit payments finally arrive they may not even cover the most basic living costs, leaving parents unable to feed their children.”</p>
      <p>A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “We spend over £95billion a year on welfare, and have simplified the benefits system through Universal Credit. </p>
      <p>“Free school meals are provided for 1.3 million disadvantaged children, and up to £26million is also being invested in a breakfast club programme.</p>
      <p>“People can get Universal Credit urgently if they need it and 95% of payments are made in full and on time.”</p>
