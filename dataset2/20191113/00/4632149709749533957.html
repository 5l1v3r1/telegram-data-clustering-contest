      <p><i>A new study says that many people have no idea whether they have a family history of certain illnesses. Here are the ways in which one can find out</i> <br/><br/>They say ignorance is bliss, but that certainly isn’t true when it comes to your health. A new study by UK firm ANCON Medical has found that 29 per cent of Britons have no idea whether or not they have a family history of cancer; 21 per cent know nothing about their parents’ medical history; while 57 per cent know nothing about the medical history of their grandparents. <br/><br/>So why is that knowledge important? According to the British Heart Foundation, a family history of heart disease is a key risk factor when it comes to developing the UK’s biggest killer. Also, your genes increase your chances of certain cancers. Inheriting the BRCA gene mutation led Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie to undergo a double mastectomy because the faulty gene gave her an 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer, which killed her mother and grandmother. <br/><br/>General physician and medical columnist Dr Rosemary Leonard says: “There are many gene mutations which increase your risk of diseases such as breast and prostate cancers. As always, early diagnosis and treatment is best, as it allows you to make lifestyle changes which can lower your risk. That’s why it is always good to know about the health of your family — not just your parents, but your grandparents, aunts and uncles as well.” <br/><br/>If you do discover a medical issue among your relatives, don’t panic. “Apart from some rare genetic disorders, a family history does not guarantee you will be affected,” says Dr Leonard. “Have a chat with your general physician. They will be able to give you more information.” <br/><br/>Here are the five questions you need to ask to know more about your family’s medical history: <br/><br/><b>What do you know about our family’s health?<br/></b><br/>A broad question such as this is a good way to get the conversation going. It’s especially important, given that your parents and their parents have the most relevant medical history to your future. <br/><br/><b>Are there any illnesses that keep cropping up among our relatives?<br/></b><br/>The most relevant conditions include stroke, kidney disease, diabetes and cancer. All of these have been shown to have genetic links, and so having a relative who has had the condition, could raise your own risk. Knowing you might be at a higher risk of high blood pressure or cholesterol is also important. <br/><br/><b>Has anyone in our family ever had a heart attack?<br/></b><br/>If you’re only going to ask one thing, make it this. Heart disease and heart attacks kill nearly 170,000 people each year. A general rule would be that the more generations removed, the less likely their health history will affect you. <br/><br/><b>When were our relatives diagnosed?<br/></b><br/>Timing is everything for certain diseases. Having some cancers at an early age can flag a genetic condition. If a relative died, ask how old they were when they passed. <br/><br/><b>How is your health at the moment?<br/></b><br/>Don’t just have the usual, “how are you?”, “I’m fine” exchange with parents, brothers and sisters — go deeper. Comparing your health to that of your siblings will give an idea of what you should look out for. You may have inherited the same risk factors — although this isn’t always the case.</p>
