      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - Atlanta United has dealt Darlington <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nagbe/">Nagbe</a> to the state where he grew up, trading the midfielder to the Columbus Crew.</p>
      <p>United will receive up to $1,425,000 in allocation money and a 2020 international roster spot from the Crew.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nagbe/">Nagbe</a> was acquired from the Portland Timbers after the 2017 season. In two years with Atlanta, he appeared in 56 league games, contributed two goals and seven assists, and was a key part of teams that won the MLS Cup, the Campeones Cup and the U.S. Open Cup.</p>
      <p>Atlanta gets $1.05 million in guaranteed allocation money, with the possibility of another $375,000 through performance-based incentives.</p>
