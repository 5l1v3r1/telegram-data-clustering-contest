      <p>If you’ve ever lost track of the sunlight, because you were fused to a cushioned chair with a titillating title in your hand, then raise your proverbial glass in the air and celebrate the hospitable bookshop that allowed you to read for hours on end, uninterrupted. Spending time in bookstores is especially easy when the environment is welcoming, and the space is unique. Take one step inside <a href="https://shakespeareandcompany.com/">Shakespeare and Company</a> in Paris, <a href="https://www.livrarialello.pt/en-us/">Livaria Lello</a> in Portugal, or <a href="http://libreriaacquaaltavenezia.myadj.it/">Libreria Acqua Alta</a> in Venice to understand the sentiment. America also has some pretty impressive bookstores, guilty of housing bookish fugitives. Read on to discover the most unique havens for bibliophiles because, after all, isn’t holding the binding of an actual book, where you can smell the pages and let the hardcover rest on your chest when you pause to ponder, better than the digital alternative?</p>

        <b>Chicago: Women and Children First</b>
      </p>
      <p>Feminist bookstores in America are few and far between and Chicago’s <a href="https://www.womenandchildrenfirst.com/">Women and Children First</a> is one of the largest feminist bookstores around, housing more than 30,000 titles by and about women.

        <b>Seattle: Secret Garden Books</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s not easy to keep an independent bookstore up and running, especially with heavy competition online, however there are a number of booksellers that have managed to thrive for many years in The Emerald City. University Book Store, Eagle Harbor Book Co., and Island Books are community stalwarts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.secretgardenbooks.com/">Secret Garden Books</a> is also a standout because for over forty years, they have been dedicated to promoting literacy for children. After all, getting younger generations to develop a love of reading contributes to the success of an independent bookstore, decade after decade.</p>

        <b>Denver: Tattered Cover Book Store</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tatteredcover.com/">Tattered Cover</a> has been around since 1971 and even though it’s a relatively large independent book store, it still maintains that cozy lose-yourself-in-a-chair feel that bookworms crave. Chances are, if you have a favorite author on a book tour, you’ll be able to get your book signed and hear them read here. You can relish the experience at four different locations, including one inside of Union Station, and if you must go online, check out their Indie Next List for new titles.</p>

        <b>San Francisco: City Lights Booksellers and Publishers</b>
      </p>
      <p>San Francisco is such a lovely walkable city, full of sensory delights, and a trip to <a href="http://www.citylights.com/">City Lights Booksellers and Publishers</a>, a landmark located on the edge of China Town, will not disappoint book lovers. Political and poetry books have long been the bread and butter of City Lights and the publishing arm still produces titles to this day. Beatniks, free thinkers, and artists were the clientele of the 50’s and it would appear that little has changed even to this day.</p>
      <p>City Lights co-founder and poet, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who turned 100 in March 2019, made headlines for publishing Allen Ginsberg’s <i>Howl and Other Poems</i> in 1956, which was part of an obscenity trial. He faced jail time and a fine in order to endorse free speech. This bookshop is all about creating an indelible space for open minded readers, thinkers, and speakers.</p>

        <b>Florida: Gene’s Books</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s something about seeing stacks of books everywhere, lining the walls, topping each surface, stored in every nook and cranny, that creates a lived-in feel. <a href="https://genes-books.business.site/">Gene’s Books</a> on Periwinkle Way in Sanibel, Florida, is such a place. The popularity of this gem has created a need for expansion—there’s a second building across the street. Both locations have a large selection of Florida-specific titles and visitors can often get discounts or receive free books.  </p>
      <p>Visiting independent bookstores, anywhere across America, gives us the opportunity to learn about diverse communities and local vibes. Ask the bookseller for a recommendation, kick up your feet on a lounger—preferably with a cup of coffee in hand, and stay awhile. A book purchased and enjoyed from a special destination is one of the best mementos you can have.</p>
