      <h1>Scottish Health Awards: Life saving amputee doc up for award</h1>
      <h2>Consultant Cieran has lost both his legs but his dedication to his profession meant he was back on the job within weeks.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Smith</a></address>
      <p>Like most consultants, Dr Cieran McKiernan is dedicated to his job.</p>
      <p>Three quarters of the time, he is saving lives in emergency medicine at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. The rest of the time, he works for patient transfer and retrieval service ScotStar.</p>
      <p>But Cieran’s case is slightly different – he’s a double amputee.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old has suffered from type 1 diabetes since the age of 13 and, due to complications with his lower legs, he had to have them amputated below the knee.</p>
      <p>Cieran, who is a finalist in the Doctor Award category at the Scottish Health Awards, said: “I  had problems with both of my legs for eight or nine years, dealing with multiple fractures. I lost my left leg in 2017 but was back at work within 12 weeks.”</p>
      <p>Cieran’s right leg was amputated in June of last year – and again he took very little time off work.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was back in the emergency department working full 10-hour shifts seven weeks and two days after the operation.”</p>
      <p>It took a little longer for Cieran to return to his retrieval post – but after a couple of assessments, he was back in the helicopter.</p>
      <p>He said: “I had a few risk assessments to do  to make sure work was safe for me as well as my patients. I have been back now <br/>for just over six months and so far there have been no issues.”</p>
      <p>Cieran’s job is massively rewarding and he’s often able to find out how his patients are doing months after saving their lives.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s uplifting to find out how patients are getting on and getting back to normal life.”</p>
      <p>Cieran said he was “surprised and humbled” to be nominated for a Health Award but added: “Being able to work as normal with a disability is a thing to celebrate.”</p>
      <p>The Health Awards winners will be announced tomorrow at the Corn Exchange, Edinburgh.</p>
