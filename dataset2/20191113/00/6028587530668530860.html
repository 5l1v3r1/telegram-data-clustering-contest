      <p>The text 2K provides in their frequent patch notes is seemingly shrinking faster than the playoff chances of my Chicago Bulls. It’s normal for a game to have less expansive fixes after it has been released for a few months, but some of the verbiage in the patch notes don’t match the length of the communication.</p>
      <p>Here are the latest notes, per <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/nba-2k/patch-8/10156665814227267/">NBA 2K’s Facebook page</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved performance for PS4 Pro users.</li>
        <li>Improvements to the MyPLAYER Nation feature in MyCAREER. Help lead your team to the title!</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that would sometimes prevent users from joining their friends in the Neighborhood, and/or would sometimes load the invited friend into the wrong location.</li>
        <li>Many, many more fixes included to improve the overall experience of NBA 2K20!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let’s take this from the top.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>“Improved performance for PS4 Pro users.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Can we expound on this a bit, please? What part of the PS4 Pro experience was improved? Like many others, the 2K community is a tech-savvy group. Much of the technical jargon that could be used to offer more detail may not go over some of the fans’ heads. Even if it does, 2K could use this as an opportunity to educate its consumers further on their product. This education will likely lead to an even deeper buy-in from the customer.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>“Improvements to the MyPLAYER Nation feature in MyCAREER. Help lead your team to the title!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Again, what improvements? We all know there were some issues with MyPlayer Nation when it rolled out. One of the biggest ones was the scant explanation and seemingly low fan comprehension of the new feature. I know people who have played 2K for well over a decade who have told me they still aren’t entirely sure of the purpose of MyPlayer Nation.</p>
      <p>I conclude this is a result of two things: lack of a detailed explanation on the new feature, and low overall fan interest. In both cases, the onus is on 2K to fill those gaps.</p>
      <p>Also, I know 2K is a marketing machine, and that’s why it has become so successful overall. However, the “help lead your team to the title” part of that bullet point feels misplaced.</p>
      <p>The ABS (Always Be Selling) approach can be taken negatively when delivered in the midst of what is already being viewed as an unsatisfactory communication about a product fix.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>“Fixed an issue that would sometimes prevent users from joining their friends in the Neighborhood, and/or would sometimes load the invited friend into the wrong location.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the only 100-percent appropriate bullet point in the notes. It’s detailed and explains exactly what was fixed in the game. Granted, it seems this is an issue that has been plaguing the game since launch, but still, I know what the developer is saying here.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Many, many more fixes included to improve the overall experience of NBA 2K20!</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is the worst line in the patch notes. Not one, but two “manys,” yet the update only includes three bullet points? Something about that just doesn’t seem right. Why are 2K fans still left to guess what aspects of their game has been changed?</p>
      <p>I cannot speak to 2K’s motivation for offering such a modest amount of text in recent notes, but I can say this style of communication comes off poorly to the fanbase.</p>
      <p>It makes it appear that the folks who sign off on these patch notes don’t believe the fanbase is intelligent enough to comprehend or interested in reading a detailed list of what was fixed in the game. It’s hard to believe it’s the latter when so many people have taken to social media to complain about the brevity of the patch notes these days.</p>
      <p>These comments are on Facebook just below the post:</p>
      <blockquote>I love how they stopped listing the fixes and instead go for nebulous "a lot of fixes were introduced". Soon we'll just get patch with trump-esque notes "A lot of fixes. Great fixes. We've got the best fixes. All of them"</blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>So for the 8th time in a row there has been many, many more fixes?</blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>Wow such a descriptive explanation on the patch thank you 2K!!</blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <p>It also makes it appear that 2K is trying to escape accountability in specific areas. It’s almost as if there is a school of thought that believes a lack of information creates more mystery, which leads to fewer specific questions about the game’s issues.</p>
      <p>That might work in marketing, but not in maintenance.</p>
      <p>EA falls short in several areas, and I still believe 2K makes better sports games overall. However, 2K could learn from EA as it pertains to communicating with its community. Recently, EA Madden NFL 20 had a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2019/11/09/madden-20-online-franchise-update-latest-info-on-disabled-mode/">major server issue that led to a shut down of its Online Franchise mode</a>.</p>
      <p>The publisher took a beating for this issue and endured accusations that it prioritized Ultimate Team (a money-making mode with microtransactions) over its franchise feature. While we can debate that issue for years, the fact is, EA communicated effectively and specifically about its issue and swiftly worked to get it resolved.</p>
      <p>The notes that were released were detailed and inclusive. After reading them, you didn’t get the feeling that something was being left out. If 2K would employ this approach to the communication around its patches, it would remove most of the reasonable criticism the game receives.</p>
      <p>No game is perfect.</p>
      <p>Everyone reasonable gamer knows this is true. There is no such thing as releasing a “finished” game as some would suggest. Every game these days needs patches because of the number of variables online play creates.</p>
      <p>That said, publishers and developers would be best advised to be transparent with their communications. It’s better to openly discuss the cracks than to have fans making negative assumptions that affect the publisher’s perceived integrity.</p>
