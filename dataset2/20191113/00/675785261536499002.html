      <h2>Khloe Kardashian has reportedly wished her ex husband Lamar Odom 'all the best' after his engagement to Sabrina Parr after just four months of dating</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:47:02+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:47</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Khloe Kardashian is reportedly "happy" that Lamar Odom has got engaged.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old former NBA star popped the question to his girlfriend Sabrina Parr after just four months of dating and the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is said to bear no malice towards her ex-husband.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old reality star is reportedly glad that Lamar "has found happiness again."</p>
      <p>A source told E! News: "Khloe wants Lamar to be happy. She has always had hope that he would find his way and live a long and healthy life.</p>
      <p>"She's happy for him if he has found happiness again. The chapter of her life that she shared with Lamar is closed and she has moved on. She harbours no ill will or jealousy."</p>

      <p>It is not the first time that Lamar has popped the question just weeks after meeting a new beau, as he did the same with Khloe.</p>
      <p>There were wedding bells for the pair exactly a month after they met in 2009.</p>
      <p>After the whirlwind marriage saw them walk down the aisle, their relationship had all blown out by 2013, at which point Khloe filed for divorce.</p>
      <p>There was a pause in the proceedings after Lamar had a near fatal drug overdose in 2015 and it wasn't until the end of 2016 that the divorce was eventually finalised.</p>
      <p>Time has been a great healer though and Khloe has admitted that she still has a special place for her ex.</p>
      <p>In a recent episode of the Kardashian's reality show, she admitted that she missed Lamar "all the time."</p>

      <p>It was revealed that Lamar had contacted Khloe while he travelled the US promoting his new memoir.</p>
      <p>Khloe revealed: "So, he called me and he was like, 'I just knew we were all gonna talk again at some point. I'm just so happy,'</p>
      <p>"He was like, 'I would love to see you. I've been dying to see you in person. I just feel like we have so much to talk about.'"</p>

      <p>Khloe had cut ties with Lamar after they were divorced and she explained: "I always felt after, I think this overdose, that I did everything in my power to be there through sickness and health.</p>
      <p>"Once I saw that he, you know, wasn't in the headspace to really want to change his bad situation then I was fine letting him go."</p>
