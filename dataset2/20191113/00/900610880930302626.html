      <p>The renovation, which began in May this year, focused on all of the hotels 194-guest rooms and suites.</p>
      <p>“While our overarching aim was to update each and every guest room in order to provide fresh and modern amenities, we also wanted to create an entirely different ambiance and experience for our guests from a wellbeing perspective. You may be in the heart of Parramatta, but the city’s hustle and bustle will feel like a distant memory once you step into these transformed guest rooms,” said Novotel Sydney Parramatta general manager, Ben Murphy.</p>
      <p>Novotel worked with interior design firm Stack Studio on its vision for the hotel’s rooms and suites. The hotel said it blended “chic, urban style with plush textures and soothing colours to create a sense of restfulness and calm”. In-room amenities include new bed linens and “desks illuminated by both natural and assisted light sources”, reads a press release from the hotel.</p>
      <p>“Cool and contemporary tones with modern decor provide an urban haven in our refurbished rooms, and we hope travellers are as happy with the result as we are,” said Murphy.</p>
