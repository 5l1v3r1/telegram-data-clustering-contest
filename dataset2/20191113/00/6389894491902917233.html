      <p>Oxford Street and the surrounding area is set to receive a total of £2.9bn in investment over the next two years, according to a new report. </p>
      <p>Westminster City Council has committed to investing £150m up to 2023 to transform the area, including a proposed public piazza at Oxford Circus, a public square at Marble Arch and more footpath space. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Extra investment is also expected after the council and the Mayor of London classified Bond Street, Oxford Street and Regent Street as an “international centre” in their draft city plans.</p>
      <p>The reclassification will allow the area to diversify from its mainly retail offering, according to a report by the New West End Company. </p>
      <p>An update to Sunday trading hours could also bring in an additional £260m to the area each year. </p>
      <p>Jace Tyrell, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: “London’s West End is not beyond the wider malaise of the retail sector.</p>
      <p>“However, the £2.9bn investment from public and private sectors will catalyse the birth of a new West End.</p>
      <p>“Additionally, the new deal will see the West End secure “International Centre” status which will lead to a generational shift in how Oxford Street is used.”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Crossrail is expected to be operational by 2021, which will bring an extra 60m visitors to the West End each year. </p>
      <p>Other investments that have already been announced include a £100m underground development at Cavendish Square and £350,000 to fund district-wide wi-fi connection. </p>
