        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is easy to buy into Mr. Tyrrell’s opinion that the Democrats are relying on stupid people to help them win the 2020 election (“Dems lure voters that believe America is anti-immigrant and racist,” Web, Nov. 12). However, it only speaks to one side of the equation. The other side is equally evident — those “moron leaders” who drip with venom, seeking to inflame and overturn the results of the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>I listened to a sermon last Sunday based upon Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, in which he warns, “[W]e wrestle … against principalities, against rulers of the darkness of this world, against wickedness in high places.” Reps. Adam Schiff and Jerry Nadler immediately came to mind.</p>
