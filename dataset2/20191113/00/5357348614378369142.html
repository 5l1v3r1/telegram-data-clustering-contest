        <b>HONG KONG, China (AFP) — Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters fought intense battles with riot police on a university campus and paralysed the city's upmarket business district yesterday, extending one of the most violent stretches of unrest seen in more than five months of political chaos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The confrontations followed a particularly brutal day on Monday, when police shot a protester and a man was set on fire, prompting calls from Western powers for compromise but further fury in China against any challenge to its rule.</p>
      <p>The city's universities emerged as a new flashpoint throughout yesterday, with sustained clashes at major campuses for the first time.</p>
      <p>The epicentre was the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where the usually placid hillside grounds were turned into a battlefield for hours.</p>
      <p>Police fired repeated volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of protesters who responded with bricks and petrol bombs.</p>
      <p>The clashes raged well into the night, despite faculty and staff trying to mediate, with flames lighting up the night sky and the dense clouds of acrid smoke.</p>
      <p>Police eventually used a water cannon truck and then began a retreat — although sporadic tear gas fire continued — and as midnight approached the campus remained in the hands of protesters behind their makeshift shield walls.</p>
      <p>A 19-year-old volunteer medic, who gave his first name Marco, said he had lost count of how many students he treated who had been struck by rubber bullets.</p>
      <p>“Most of the cases I received from the frontline had been shot above their chest,” he told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>As the chaotic scenes were broadcast live, protesters took over roads in dozens of neighbourhoods in a bid to keep the police stretched while volunteers flocked to the university to bring supplies.</p>
      <p>Jim Poon, a first-year student, said he raced back on a moped to join the protests.</p>
      <p>“It feels like being humiliated right to our face so I wanted to come back and help,” he told <i>AFP</i>. “When the petrol runs out, I will use my hands.”</p>
      <p>After months of largely confining their most disruptive protests to the weekends, online groups used by protesters have been pushing new tactics targeting the working week.</p>
      <p>For the last two days flashmob protesters have blocked roads during the morning rush hour, thrown objects onto rail tracks and held up subway trains, sparking transport chaos throughout the city.</p>
      <p>In Central, a district that is home to many blue-chip international firms and luxury shops, thousands of office workers occupied roads for hours yesterday chanting: “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong!”</p>
      <p>Hundreds of hardcore protesters threw bricks and other objects before retreating when riot police fired tear gas in the shadows of high-end stores.</p>
      <p>The scenes were a vivid illustration of how ordinary people are continuing to back the pro-democracy movement — even as the radicals adopt more violent tactics.</p>
      <p>Authorities have offered repeated condemnation but have been unable or unwilling to find a solution to the crisis.</p>
      <p>“Hong Kong's rule of law has been pushed to the brink of total collapse,” police spokesman Kong Wing-Cheung told a press conference yesterday as he defended the force against seething public anger.</p>
