      <p>It's not quite fall, but it's not really winter either. So will you be too hot or too cold? A great way to alleviate all that temperature stress is to chill out and get a scarf. And not just any scarf, but a wool one with a great print. Why so specific? Well, wool is not as insulating as cashmere but packs enough heat to moderate those brisk breezes. As for the whimsical pattern, the workday is bleak enough, so liven it up with a piece that will put a smile on your face.</p>

      <p>Designer Alexandre Mattiussi is great at inserting a bit of whimsy into his collection without succumbing to kitsch. Just take a look at the juxtaposition of the creamy wool with a mirrored knit of an “A” and a heart on this fringed scarf. It is both elegant and playful. And should you want to add some fun to your ensemble before you walk out the door, look no further than this ace up your sleeve—or, in this case, neck.</p>

      <p>Don’t look at having fun with fashion as an alien concept. There are ways to add charming elements to your wardrobe and still impart a dapper vibe. Case in point: this scarf by Valentino. Cast in black with a subtle cerulean blue etching of a UFO, this accessory, in terms of style, will put you lightyears ahead of others in the office. Indeed, it is truly out of this world.</p>

      <p>The cool, swinging vibe of the late ’50s and early ’60s is a period that many menswear brands fall back on. It was when the Rat Pack were at their peak and James Bond was born in print—and onscreen. It is also when sleek futurism took hold of the fashion industry. Encapsulating all these qualities in this slick wool scarf by Coach. Wear it out to your next cocktail party, where you should order a martini—shaken, not stirred, of course.</p>

      <p>There are things that the English take very seriously: their royals, fashion and football. Combining all these attributes is Burberry’s Kingdom Football Scarf. Emblazoned with the brand’s name, and designed in a way that resembles the lettering of their sporting teams, this item is perfect for Anglophiles. Take it to your next trip across the Atlantic, or to your local pub for a pint of Jaipur IPA.</p>

      <p>Of all the scarves here, this one by Todd Snyder is the most classic. Indeed, it’s a vintage item by Drake’s, a storied purveyor of British menswear, so timelessness comes with the territory. Also, the red, orange and yellow colors, done in a check pattern, is as autumnal and collegiate as it gets—two descriptors that are perfect for the season.</p>
