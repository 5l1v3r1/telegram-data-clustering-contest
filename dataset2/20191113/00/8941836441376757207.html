      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - The city of Atlanta is seeking an artist to create 30 drawings or paintings of the victims of the Atlanta child murders that terrorized the city in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-atlanta-journal-constitution/">Atlanta Journal</a>-Constitution reports the exhibit honoring the victims, mostly black boys, will be displayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The Mayor’s Office of Cultural Affairs is sponsoring the project, which will net the artist $18,000.</p>
      <p>Eligible artists must live in Fulton or DeKalb counties and submit a digital photo and drawing of 13-year-old Clifford Jones. Clifford’s death led city police to recognize the slayings were connected and part of a pattern. Wayne Williams was convicted in two of the deaths. Many of the cases remain unsolved. Applications are due by Nov. 22.</p>
