      <h1>Farage Under Pressure To Pull Back In Labour Seats</h1>

      <p>Give an inch in politics, and you risk losing a mile. Just ask Nigel Farage. He adopted the Brexit high ground on Monday, pledging to stand down candidates in Conservative held seats for fear of splitting the Leave vote. But now they want more. Joined by some of Brexit’s biggest bankrollers, senior Tories are calling on Farage to forfeit his foremost electoral target: Labour’s Leave-backing heartlands.  Brexit Party candidates would contest 600 seats in the coming election, Mr Farage declared last week. Some Tory votes might be siphoned off in the process, but so be it - Leave backers deserve better than the Prime Minister’s EU divorce deal. This was the thrust of Farage’s argument, and it fell on deaf ears in Downing Street. </p>
      <p>He had hoped to strongarm the government into Brexit concessions - but all he got was a backroom browbeating. From both within and outside his own party, Farage was pressed to pull back in all 317 Tory held constituencies. Too great was the threat from the resurgent Liberal Democrats, who - with their anti-Brexit bluster - threaten to snatch victory should the Leave vote split.</p>

      <p>And so he announced a ‘unilateral’ alliance with the Conservatives earlier this week. One the government hadn’t agreed to, but would surely welcome nonetheless. Why wouldn’t they? It was about “putting country before party”, Mr Farage claimed. But for the Tories, it meant only one thing: 317 seats they’ll find easier to retain. </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister needs to <i>gain </i>seats though, lest the Conservatives suffer another parliamentary term with no majority. His live-and-breathe Leave campaign will play well in the Brexit-backing North, he hopes. In places like Hartlepool - where Mr Farage delivered Monday’s news - Boris Johnson plans to court long-time Labour voters confounded by Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit ambiguity. </p>
      <p>But so too does the Brexit Party leader. His anti-establishment message often strikes a chord with working class communities, many of which are furious at Westminster’s failure to get Brexit done. Farage hopes to capitalise on this sentiment, snapping at Labour heels in the likes of Crewe and Nantwich, where the Red majority is paper thin. </p>

      <p>If expediting Brexit is the goal, it’s a high risk strategy. Having withdrawn from the Tories’ current constituencies, Mr Farage is free to pour all resources into the fight for Labour’s heartland. There, he’ll be battling Conservative candidates for the same Leave-leaning electors. Farage’s forgoing of the South might, therefore, simply shift the vote split Northward - right where the Tories are focusing fire. </p>
      <p>It’s a gift to Mr Corbyn then - and in more ways than one. Not only might Labour profit from a divide in Brexit support, but Farage’s alignment with Johnson - however ‘unilateral’ - speaks to the spectre of a right-wing cabal. Lump the Leave-backing leaders together, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alasdairlane/2019/11/01/boris-bruised-by-trumps-brexit-interventionbut-corbyn-is-buoyant/#7cb0b35e1fa2">throw in an endorsement from Mr Donald Trump</a>, and you have a prospect perhaps too toxic for any one-time Labour voter, Brexit-backing or not. </p>

      <p>It’s a tactic the Opposition has employed before, blunting UKIP’s Northern hopes in past elections. No coincidence then that a veteran backer of that group, Arron Banks, has implored his old pal Farage to rethink. “The Brexit Party needs to stand down more candidates and focus on the 40 to 50 seats where the Tories have no chance at all,” Banks - who helped bankroll the Brexit campaign - told Reuters. </p>
      <p>But Mr Farage is undeterred, stating simply that he intends to “take the fight to Labour”. It seems an illogical move, recalling several hundred candidates to bolster the Tories’s Brexit bid - only to fight them in the most crucial of seats. But politics is a strange business at the moment, so who knows - it might just be a masterstroke. </p>
