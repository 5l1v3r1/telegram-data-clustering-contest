      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - An Ohio county’s commissioners have approved a $350,000 contract to purchase kits meant to help civilians handle injuries from mass shootings or other violent attacks.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/columbus-dispatch/">Columbus Dispatch</a> reports the Franklin County commissioners approved the contract Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Franklin County Emergency Management and Homeland Security plans to purchase 900 to 1,000 trauma bags from citizenAID North America to distribute to emergency responders in 15 central Ohio counties.</p>
      <p>The bags are being covered by a state grant that follows the Aug. 4 mass shooting in Dayton that left nine dead, and more than two dozen injured.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the kits is to provide basic supplies that can be used to stop bleeding in mass casualties.</p>
