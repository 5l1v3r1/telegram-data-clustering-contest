      <p>There are many alternatives to opiate therapy, and in fact, outside of the United States, opiate use for pain control is very limited. For data available from 2013-2015, in the U.S. one daily dose of opioids was prescribed for every 20 people, while in Japan the dose was one for every 800 people. U.S. opioid use for pain control is the highest of any country in the world. It is more than 50% higher than that in Germany, the second-ranked country, and nearly 4000% higher than that in Japan, the third-ranked country. (UN International Narcotics Control Board).</p>
      <p>In the less developed world, perhaps due to limited availability of the most modern medical techniques, physicians and patients have developed methods to find the source of the pain and to cope with and overcome pain rather than masking it with opiates.</p>
      <p>Some current alternatives to opiate therapy for pain control include physical therapy stretches and exercises, acupuncture, nerve block injections or nerve ablations, and TENS stimulation to “confuse” the nerves and decrease the pain signal. The latest therapies, some of which are done in western Europe and healthcare tourism clinics in central America due to current lack of FDA approval, are prolotherapy, where a solution is injected into the painful area to recruit and activate the body’s own repair cells to the area. PRP (platelet rich plasma) draws up the patient’s own blood and injects back the plasma portion, which contains substances to heal the painful area. Stem cell therapy is also at the forefront of the pain treatment. Stem cells are either harvested from the patient or from amniotic fluid or embryos and then injected into the injured tissue to help with repairs.</p>
      <p>Lifestyle change is also important for decreasing pain in the Western world. The rate of obesity, stagnant work environment, and inflammatory western diet of red meat and processed foods prevent the body from naturally working to heal itself.</p>
