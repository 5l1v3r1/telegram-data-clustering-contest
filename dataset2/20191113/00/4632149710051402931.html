      <p><i>The dubbing for the film gets over today. Director promises Kaage Bangara right after<br/></i><br/>"Even the most common man if asked to describe himself will have at least half an hour of story to tell. Popcorn Monkey Tiger is the saga of two characters; Devi and Seena. I cannot describe it in two lines. I need at least two hours," says Suri, as he wraps up the dubbing for his 10th film as director. <br/><br/>Popcorn Monkey Tiger was announced early last year and has had a protracted shooting schedule. There were nine major shooting schedules for the film. "I had to shoot what I had written. There was no other go. I would not give up or compromise. The story is such. The way it has to be narrated such a long shooting programme. It is a big saga. I am satisfied with what we have shot. The dubbing work was also neat. There were a few newcomers and we took time to get things right. With dubbing complete, I can focus on other things," said Suri. <br/><br/>At the current pace of work, Popcorn Monkey Tiger will be ready to go before the Censor Board sometime in December. Dhananjaya and Smitha (Niveditha) play the lead roles with a "houseful of characters". The title does not refer to particular characters but to three stages of a life, says Suri. "I have conceptualised Popcorn, Monkey and Tiger as the three stages of life. These are visualised through the characters. Much of it has to be experienced as visuals rather than me trying to explain it. It is almost impossible for me to do that in words alone," says Suri. <br/><br/>About the long shooting schedules, he said, "there are films you can shoot in 40-50 days. Each film has its own demands. Not just the scale, but the requirements of this film were unique. At times we had no option but to wait for a month or two to get an actor in the right shape. Each one of the actors has put in additional effort and time on this film." <br/><br/>Suri also promises the prequel to the 2015 Ginimari Case right after Popcorn Monkey Tiger. Kaage Bangara is the first of the three-part Kendasampige series. Ginimari Case, the second part was shot and released first. "In give years many of the locations have transformed beyond recognition. We are coping with the changes. Shooting for Kaage Bangara will start immediately after Popcorn Monkey Tiger is released," he said.</p>
