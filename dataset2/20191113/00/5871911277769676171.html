      <p>The segment between Aldis and Tim Storm from last week is shown.</p>
      <p>Aldis is then introduced to the crowd.  He says in response to Storm’s claims, this business, the NWA, the people owe him nothing.  Everything is earned.  He also says there’s a reason why he presented Dory Funk Jr. with the Lou Theiz award, that there’s a reason why he was allowed to stand next to Harley Race with their championship belts.  Aldis says he does things the “right way”.  He also says the NWA is where they’re at because of him.</p>
      <p>Aldis will be sitting at ringside for the NWA World Tag Team Championship match.  He said he wants to make sure things are done the right way.</p>
