      <p>PAX provides the easiest and most packable portable vaporizers hands down.

Made from natural plant oils and water, it’s effective in removing the scent of smoke quickly and is completely safe for use around plants, animals, and people. <a href="https://www.cannabolish.com/"><i>cannabolish.com</i></a></p>
