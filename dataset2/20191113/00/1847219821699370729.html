        <b><i>Harmony</i> political party may agree to continue working in the coalition of Riga City Council under the condition <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> terminates cooperation with the <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, said vice-chairperson of Riga City Council Anna Vladova after meeting with Harmony’s faction on Wednesday, 13 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harmony has collected signatures to organize the next extraordinary meeting of the city council to dismiss Vadims Baraņiks from his posts as Vice-Mayor of Riga and board member of Riga Freeport.</p>
      <p>This decision is justified with Baraņiks’ loss of trust, meaning he can no longer continue working in the coalition.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If <i>Honour to Serve Riga</i> no longer cooperates with <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i>, they are left with 28 votes together with <i>Harmony</i>. There is also For Riga bloc, which unites non-party deputies. Until now this party has cooperated with the Independent Deputies Faction.</p>
      <p>The <i>Independent Deputies Faction</i> unites city council deputies Valērijs Petrovs, Vitālijs Dubovs, Rosļikovs and Baraņņiks. They were excluded from <i>Harmony</i> in June 2019 after refusing to vote for Sandris Bergmanis as the next vice-mayor.</p>
