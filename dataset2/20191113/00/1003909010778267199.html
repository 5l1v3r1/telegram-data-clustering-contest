      <h1>Calgary Tower re-opens after four-month elevator malfunction closure</h1>

      <p>Nearly four months after an elevator failure that trapped eight people forced its closure, the Calgary Tower began welcoming visitors Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On July 14, an elevator cable inside the 191-metre-tall landmark snapped, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/elevator-malfunction-prompts-closure-of-calgary-tower">forcing the rescue of passengers suspended</a> 12 storeys above street level.</p>
      <p>No one was injured.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, its operators announced the reopening of both the observation deck and Sky360 Restaurant.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to welcoming our many local and international visitors, and remain committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience,” tower general manager Katie Urness said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Elevator service contractor ThyssenKrupp Elevator Canada said they ensured the system was meticulously assessed and retooled before being put back into use.</p>
      <p>“Following the incident over the summer, we conducted a thorough and comprehensive inspection of the elevator system,” said company CEO Blaine Coupal.</p>
      <p>“Safety is and always will be of utmost importance and we have taken every precaution to ensure the elevators are in full operating condition.”</p>
      <p>He said the servicing meets government and industry safety standards following inspection and certification.</p>
      <p>The tower’s elevators had failed in mid-June, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/calgary-tower-remains-closed-due-to-elevator-repairs">nearly a month before the July malfunction</a> closed the attraction.</p>
      <p>In the June 18 incident, a group of seniors in frail health descended the tower by stairway.</p>
      <p>One of the seniors, a visitor from Germany, said if that malfunction had been addressed then, the July rescue by city firefighters might not have been necessary.</p>
      <p>Owners and operators of the tower, Aspen Properties, wouldn’t comment for this story.</p>
      <p>The Calgary Tower celebrated its 50th anniversary last year.</p>
