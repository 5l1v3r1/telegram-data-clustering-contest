      <h1>Classmates Join Together to Support 'Super Nicholas' Waiting for Kidney</h1>
      <h2>Nicholas Corapi is fighting for his life — and Hopedale Memorial Elementary School is standing with him on the battle lines.</h2>

      <p>“We’re just waiting — waiting for a kidney to become available for him,” <a href="https://www.ksbw.com/article/classmates-rally-to-support-super-nicholas-as-he-awaits-new-kidney/29766086">said</a> his mother, Kim Corapi. The ten-year-old soldier was born on April 15, 2009, with both kidneys in critical condition, and had one of them removed by his first birthday. It was not enough.</p>
      <p>Complicating the case is Corapi’s type O blood. In a cruel irony, he would be able to donate organs to just about anyone who needed them — but can only accept organs from other donors with the rare blood type. And even if the rigorous testing produces a match, insurance only covers the procedure itself. It will not pay the household bills piling up during this journey.</p>
      <p>Corapi’s remaining kidney is now in <a href="http://kidneyfailureweb.com/chronic-kidney-failure-stage-4/">stage 4</a> failure, and only the three days of dialysis he suffers a week is keeping him alive. Still, his dad boasts of his son’s relentless courage. “Even when he’s sitting in dialysis, he’s like ‘I love it here.’ He’s always positive.”</p>
      <p>Nicholas’ Dad is far from alone in the sentiment. Last week, Nicholas Corapi’s classmates lined the halls of his school to cheer him on in his life-long battle, holding up a banner cheering their “Super Nicholas.” They have also united to raise an unspecified amount of money in support of his treatment.</p>
      <p>“They’re so wonderful here,” his mother said. “It’s like another family. They’re very supportive, and they love him — probably as much as we do.” Principal Brian Miller has demonstrated just that, speaking with words of empathy to frame their collective effort. “That’s got to be taxing on a family, raising kids and how busy life is, so if there’s a little thing we can do to help out, we’re happy to do that.”</p>
