      <p>Pulses and products recorded an inflation of 11.72 percent in October against 8.4 percent in September.</p>
      <p>India is in the throes of an economic slowdown. GDP grew 5 percent in April-June 2019, buffeted by weak household spending and muted corporate investment.</p>
      <p>To combat the slowdown, Sitharaman in September had announced a cut in corporate tax rates, bringing it down to 22 percent from 30 percent for existing companies, and to 15 percent from 25 percent for new manufacturing companies.</p>
      <p>Sitharaman on November 6 also announced that the Cabinet on approved the creation of a 'professionally managed' Rs 25,000 crore fund for boosting stalled middle and low-income RERA registered housing projects that are net worth positive.</p>
      <p>The move is aimed to relieve financial stress faced by a large number of homebuyers and to also release funds stuck in these projects for productive use in the economy.</p>
      <p>To boost growth, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in October slashed the primary lending rate by 25 basis points to 5.15 percent. This was the fifth consecutive rate cut since February.</p>
      <p>The RBI also slashed its GDP growth estimate for the current fiscal to 6.1 percent from its earlier forecast of 6.9 percent during the August policy review.</p>
      <p>The national income data have reinforced deceleration signs that were emanating from a slew of shop-end data, such as car and consumer goods sales, often seen as proxy indicators to gauge trends in household spending.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
