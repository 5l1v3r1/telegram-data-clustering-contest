      <p>The City of White Rock will be looking for a new chief administrative officer in the new year.</p>
      <p>The news follows the announcement that CAO Dan Bottrill will leave the post at the end of March.</p>

      <p>Bottrill, who has held the city’s top staff position since 2012, will assist the city with a transition period over the next several months, which will see the hiring of a new CAO, the announcement states.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, as of March 31, 2020, Mr. Bottrill will be completing his service to our community and moving on in his career to undertake other endeavours.”</p>
      <p>The announcement says that Bottrill has made significant contributions to the betterment of the organization and the community of White Rock.</p>
      <p>“Dan has steadfastly made himself available to Mayor and Council and provided professional advice and perspective when asked of him,” Mayor Darryl Walker said in a news release.</p>
      <p>“His experience, knowledge and professional approach were always appreciated, and, on behalf of Council, I would like to thank him for his service to our community and for agreeing to assist us during this time of transition.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the City, we wish him all the best in his future endeavours.”</p>
