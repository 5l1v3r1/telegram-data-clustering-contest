      <p><a href="https://news.err.ee/1002278/committee-decides-society-is-not-ready-for-legalization-of-cannabis">Estonian public broadcaster ERR reports</a> on Wednesday, November 13, that the proposal with over 1,000 signatures asks the state to regulate the cannabis market, impose taxes and an age limit on sales of 21 years.</p>
      <p>EKRE MP Oskar-Aleksander Lesment estimated in his own research of the Estonian black market that it is worth around EUR 170 million and said taxing it would benefit the state budget and regulate access to cannabis for minors.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the Riigikogu Social Affairs Committee Tõnis Mölder (Centre Party) disagreed.</p>
      <h3>«The economic aspect or the benefits we get from it do not outweigh the health damage,» Mölder argued.</h3>
      <p>He added that in Estonia’s current political direction there are no plans to legalize or relax the rules concerning around the use of cannabis, ERR reports.</p>
