      <p>Now that we know exactly<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/11/here-are-the-12-launch-day-games-for-google-stadia/#727795281483"> which games will actually be available and playable on Google Stadia when the streaming platform launches</a> later this month, my first thought was to look at what’s still yet to arrive. The full game list is quite long and most of it is forthcoming, even after launch. Notably, the only true MMORPG on the list, <i>Elder Scrolls Online,</i> will not be there at launch and isn’t making its way to Stadia at all until sometime in 2020.I reached out to Bethesda for comment on the timing of <i>ESO </i>on Stadia and heard back that even though it’s not hitting the platform until 2020, Matt Firor, president of ZeniMax Online Studios, has confirmed that the game will feature functioning cross-play for Stadia and all PC players on both the EU and NA megaservers.</p>
      <p>“This works in exactly the same way that Steam users and regular <i>ESO </i>PC users play on the same servers,” says the spokesperson.</p>
      <p>Which is great news for <i>ESO </i>players because that means if you’re already on PC or Mac then you won’t need to start fresh on new servers. However, it does raise the question of whether or not you’ll need to make a new account with new characters, or if your existing Steam and/or Bethesda account will work with the Stadia version.</p>
      <p>When I asked that same representative about how accounts will work, all I got back was, “We don’t have anything new to say about Stadia just yet,” so the wait continues.</p>
      <p>Personally, I play on PC using the native Bethesda client version of the game in the NA megaserver so I’m hoping the Stadia edition will just leverage those same accounts. I’m far from an expert on <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i>, but I am at the level cap and quite like my Argonian Warden. I don’t want to lose him if I can help it!</p>
      <p>Earlier this year I spoke with Rich Lambert, Creative Director on <i>ESO </i>at ZeniMax Online Studio, and he told me <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjagneaux/2019/06/19/cross-play-support-is-not-on-the-roadmap-for-elder-scrolls-online-right-now/#7af037283a8d">cross-play was not on the road map right now</a>, but that comment was in regards to PS4 / Xbox One / PC / Mac cross-play all together, rather than Stadia, which is technically just the PC version streamed to the player’s device.</p>
