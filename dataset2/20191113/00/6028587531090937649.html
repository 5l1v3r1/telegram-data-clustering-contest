      <p>Technical glitches marred Tuesday’s thunderously promoted<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2019/11/12/disney-plus-launches-capstone-bob-iger-tenure/#50fddec02dd1"> launch of the Disney+ streaming service, </a>as consumers complained of problems logging in or watching movies or TV shows.Consumers turned to social media to vent their anger about their inability to connect, long waits to speak with customer support or problems playing one of the most hotly anticipated original TV series, <i>The Mandalorian,</i> The hashtag DisneyPlusFail began to trend early in the day on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“I paid for 3 year subscription and I couldn't log in using that email id. Waiting since morning to contact #DisneyPlus help center, still no response #DisneyPlusfail,” wrote Hari Prakash on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Reports of problems peaked at around 6 a.m. Pacific time, <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/">according to a site that tracks internet outages,</a> as West Coast subscribers roused and attempted to log in and joined the queue behind East Coasters who were attempting to do the same from home, work or school.</p>
      <p>The crush of people as they attempted to squeeze through the door—the digital version of the start of Black Friday sales at Walmart—may have contributed to the problem, said one expert in streaming technology. Indeed, this source described the Disney+ debut as a “massive launch” of such significant scale that it dwarfed other recent launches.</p>
      <p>“The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our highest expectations. While we are pleased by this incredible response, we are aware of the current user issues and are working to swiftly resolve them,” a Disney spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Within a matter of hours, the problem was traced to a third party and was resolved. </p>
      <p>Ahead of the launch, Disney+ executives talked about testing and retesting the system to prepare for a likely surge of interest. Joe Inzerillo, chief technology officer of Disney Streaming Services, told FierceVideo that the BAMTech technology had already demonstrated it could handle crowds of people who lined up to watch a UFC fight on another Disney-owned streaming service, ESPN+.</p>
      <p>“Because it’s a live event it causes this huge rally point where everybody, like 90% of the people are going to come in then no matter what you do,” Inzerillo told <a href="https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/how-disney-got-ready-its-final-month-before-launch">FierceWireless</a>. “Which is not all that different from dropping an episode of <i>Game of Thrones</i> when we were running HBO. You drop that episode, everyone shows up.”</p>
      <p>Michael Paull, president of Disney’s streaming services, told T<i>he Verge</i> that system overloads and crashes like the one HBO Now experienced in 2016 during the<i> Battle of the Bastards </i>episode of <i>Game of Throne</i> informed BAMtech’s thinking about Disney+.</p>
      <p>“We’re getting big bursts. We’ve built capabilities to sustain that, both in terms of processing the transactions that all come in—in a very, very short period of time—as well as the streams,” Paull told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20831284/disney-plus-overload-crash-hbo-now-espn-launch-day"><i>The Verge.</i></a></p>
      <p>Tuesday’s glitches appear to have been minor in terms of the overall volume of use. </p>
      <p>“Remember the launch of Obamacare? That’s the worst case scenario versus the typical hiccups on day one. This is a little closer to the typical hiccups on day one,” said Forrester Research media analyst James McQuivey. “Of course they're going to have massive traffic volume on day one precisely because it is Disney. They should have anticipated that. ... But the fact is, a week from now no one will remember this happened. They’ll all be busy watching the Mandalorian.”</p>
