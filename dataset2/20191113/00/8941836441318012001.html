      <p>MIDLOTHIAN, Va. (AP) - A <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> driver in Virginia is accused of sexually abusing a passenger.</p>
      <p>Citing a Chesterfield County police statement, news outlets report 51-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-w-sauvager/">Robert W. Sauvager</a> has been arrested on charges of aggravated sexual battery and object sexual penetration. Police say the passenger reported the assault at a hospital early last week, saying she’d been assaulted by her <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> driver a few hours earlier.</p>
      <p>Police Lt. Brad Conner says the woman had called a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lyft/">Lyft</a> ride to take her from Richmond to Chesterfield. He says the woman reported being assaulted at the end of the ride, just outside of her home. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-w-sauvager/">Sauvager</a> was later identified as the driver and arrested. He’s being held without bond at a regional jail. It’s unclear if he has a lawyer.</p>
