      <p>Stadia recently released a list of the 12 games that will be available when the service launches on November 19. Many have noted, and some have complained, that the list is loaded with games that are a year or more old. That’s true, but more importantly, the launch titles will adequately test whether Stadia can deliver on its promise of severing the connection between games of superior technical quality and the hardware the player needs to play those games at their highest technical levels.Games only play and look as good as the hardware they’re running on. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/11/10/assassins-creed-odyssey-vs-red-dead-redemption-2-a-graphics-comparison/#7fa86df76128">For example</a>, <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> renders at full 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) on the Xbox One X but only half that on the PS4 Pro (1920 x 2160). <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/11/11/assassins-creed-odyssey-vs-red-dead-redemption-2-a-performance-comparison/#50083661314f">In addition</a>, the One X maintains <i>RDR2</i>’s target 30 fps frame rate in high stress scenes better than the Pro even though it’s putting twice as many pixels on the screen. If you’re playing on console, you’re not getting all <i>RDR2</i> has to offer unless you’re playing on a One X.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Stadia promises to eliminate these hardware differences because games are running in a Google data center instead of on a player’s hardware. Every instance in a data center has more processing power than the One X and Pro combined and if that isn’t enough, multiple instances can be recruited as needed. With Stadia providing the processing power, players with 4K screens and high-bandwidth, low-latency internet connections should be able to experience games at the highest technical level.</p>
      <p>“Should be able to” is the key phrase here. Can Stadia divorce the player’s hardware platform from the game’s technical presentation as promised? The launch titles should go a long way toward answering that question.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t seen them yet, here are the games Stadia will have at launch.</p>
      <p>·       <i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Destiny 2: The Collection</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>GYLT</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Just Dance 2020</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Kine</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Mortal Kombat 11</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>SAMURAI SHODOWN</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Thumper</i></p>
      <p>·       <i>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</i></p>

        <figcaption>'Red Dead Redemption 2' will be a test case for Stadia<cite>Rockstar Games</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The key test case is going to be <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. There are currently three “top tier” versions of the game running on different platforms. In terms of technical presentation,<i> RDR2</i> is good on the Pro, better on the One X and best on PC.</p>
      <p>The recently released PC version is particularly interesting because it provides a wealth of parameters players can use to fine tune the game to get the most out of their system. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=317&amp;v=RUrbciPfX6k&amp;feature=emb_logo">Digital Foundry</a> points out that <i>RDR2</i> on PC not only performs well beyond what is achievable on console, it scales beyond what even the most powerful gaming PCs can currently produce. In Digital Foundry’s tests, frame rate averaged 55.1 fps on an Intel i7 8700K CPU coupled with an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti GPU when <i>RDR2</i> was run with Ultra graphics settings and resolution set at 1800p. Reducing graphics to High and increasing resolution to 2160p (4K) produced 54.9 fps which still falls short of a 60 fps target.</p>
      <p>Which version of <i>RDR2</i> will Stadia stream? We should get the PC version if Stadia can back up it’s claim that players will no longer be limited by their local hardware. If we don’t, Stadia better have a good reason why it’s streaming a lesser version when their hardware is supposed to be capable of so much more. If the PC version is streamed, will Stadia deploy the processing resources to set graphics to Ultra and resolution to 4K? If it does, what frame rate will we see? If it doesn’t, will it offer a compelling reason why not?</p>

        <figcaption>'Assassin's Creed Odyssey'<cite>Ubisoft/kevin Murnane</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</i> provides another instructive test case. It’s a technically demanding game, and like <i>RDR2</i> there’s a marked resolution difference between the Pro and the One X. <i>Odyssey</i> uses dynamic scaling to protect frame rate at the expense of resolution. Digital Foundry reports <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/11/10/assassins-creed-odyssey-vs-red-dead-redemption-2-a-graphics-comparison/#7fa86df76128">resolution averages 64% of full 4K on the One X and 44% on the Pro</a>. The more striking finding was that the One X at it’s worst (59% 4K) was marginally better than the Pro at its best (54% 4K).</p>
      <p>Unlike <i>RDR2</i>, <i>Odyssey</i> on PC is not much different from the One X version. This gives us a straightforward way to evaluate Stadia’s ability to divorce technical quality from local hardware without all the complications that follow from <i>RDR2</i>’s in-depth and future-looking PC implementation. Stadia should stream the One X version of Odyssey and if it doesn’t, we’ll want to know why.</p>
      <p>There’s another possibility. Ubisoft could take advantage of Stadia’s advertised processing power to lift the constraints from <i>Odyssey</i> and remaster the game so it runs at full 4K. That would be awesome and would go a long way toward making the argument that Stadia could become the platform of choice for technically demanding games.</p>
