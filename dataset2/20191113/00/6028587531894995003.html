        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Rybakov Foundation is a private philanthropic organization, created by Ekaterina and Igor Rybakov in 2015. The Foundation's mission is to create a tradition of developing society with our own hands. To carry out our mission, we have developed and adopted the concept of "School is the center of society" which will help to change the socio-educational environment in schools for the better. This kind of environment provides the background for a common, collective experience for all its participants. A school's teachers and parents, pupils and graduates, headteachers and associates are not divided into suppliers and consumers of information, knowledge, or services, but participate equally in the creation of a new educational experience. The creation of such an environment is not just a new way of doing things, but also a new way of thinking, about collective creativity, cooperation, and living together. To realize our mission, we have established the aim of providing high-quality education for everyone. This will be our investment into achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, set by the United Nations.</p>
