      <p><i>Otherwise, textbook orders will not be considered for academic year</i> <br/><br/>The state government has decided to go by the indents from the Students Achievement Tracker System (SATS) for printing textbooks next year. The department of education has also asked unaided (private) schools to pay 25 per cent of the cost of textbooks in advance for the next academic year. Their book order will be considered only after that. <br/><br/>The Karnataka Textbooks Society (KTBS), which handles the delivery and the production of the textbooks for the state syllabus, has informed the schools that data will be drawn from SATS this year to ensure accuracy in the collection of indents. But, asking schools to deposit the money six months prior to the start of the academic year is unfair, say private school managements. <br/><br/>Several private school managements took the matter up with the minister for primary and secondary education S Suresh Kumar and said that they cannot pay 25 per cent of the cost by November. D Shashi Kumar, principal of Blossoms school and general secretary of KAMS told BM, “There are a few schools that order do not take the books. The department should take action against those schools. But, the KTBS cannot ask for a 25 per cent advance as the parents haven’t paid us yet. How can we pay the KTBS when we do not have the money?” <br/><br/>He added, “Not just that, we haven’t received our RTE reimbursement money from the government. We have been waiting for two years and they have no paid us. How can they expect us to deposit this amount? We have written a letter to the department and also suggested them to accept postdated cheques so that this becomes possible.” <br/><br/><b>KTBS does not deliver books on time</b> <br/>Schools also questioned KTBS’s track record of not delivering the textbooks on time and that this process of asking advance deposit seems meaningless. Kumar added, “We have written to KTBS regarding several other concerns but they do not address our problems. They are strict when it comes to this and expect that the schools will pay it.” <br/><br/>Private schools also said that even though the state syllabus textbooks do not follow the NCERT and National Curriculum Framework, the government is imposing such rules on the schools. However, there are no such rules for the state government schools as they have set aside a certain portion of their budget for the textbooks. <br/><br/>Several academic sources also said that the government is running short of money. A source said, “Due to the floods this year, more than 11 lakh textbooks were reprinted and uniforms were reissued. This extra cost was borne by the department. It becomes a bit tough to print textbooks now as the budget management is difficult.” <br/><br/><br/><b><u>Onion use in midday meals not compulsory, despite menu suggestion</u></b> <br/><br/><i>The department of public instruction specifies that onion should be included in the midday meals. But it has said that the non-government organisations can take prior permission not to use onion and garlic in the meals. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, KG Jagadeesha, commissioner for public instruction said that one of the clauses in the order stated that if they wish to make any changes to the menu, they need to approach the government. “There have been institutions who have already taken permission from the government for their menu, like Akshaya Patra Foundation (APF),” he said, adding that the National Institute of Nutrition had stated that the menu by APF was in compliance with the nutritional guidelines mandated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). According to MHRD norms, food supplied to lower primary school students should have 450 kcal energy and 12 grams of protein, while food supplied to upper primary classes should have 700 kcal and 20 grams protein. <br/></i><br/><br/><b><u>Edu min dodges question on Class 7 exam<br/></u></b><br/><i>State primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar, who announced re-introduction of public examinations for class 7 from the current academic year a month ago, refused to clarify about the same as the government order has not been issued yet.<br/>In a press conference on Tuesday, when he was asked to clarify whether public examination will be conducted for class 7 this academic year or not, he replied, “I cannot answer.” This statement by the minister has spread rumors that public examination for Class 7 from the current academic year is doubtful as the government hasn’t cleared the proposal.</i></p>
