      <p>Devastated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> coach Eddie Jones says he made selection mistakes for the rugby World Cup final.</p>
      <p>The high profile Jones said he should have reinvigorated his team for the clash against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in Tokyo, after the stunning semifinal win over the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t watched it and I probably won’t watch it,” <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/all-blacks/news/article.cfm?c_id=116&amp;objectid=12284694">the Australian told the <i>Telegraph</i></a>.</p>

      <p>“It’s replayed every day. Every time I wake up the World Cup is there in front of me.</p>
      <p>“But I know in my head where we could have probably made improvements.</p>
      <p>“One of the areas was that I probably made a mistake in terms of selection. That’s all with the benefit of hindsight, but I should probably have refreshed the team for the final.</p>
      <p>“Apart from that, it was one of those days. Sometimes they start the game brilliantly and things come off for them.</p>
      <p>“We start the game a little bit off, lacking a tiny bit of energy because we’d played four big games in a row. That’s the reality of it – we just came unstuck.”</p>

      <p>Jones is staying on for at least two more years – that’s when his current contract concludes – and says he will immediately make selections with the development of the next World Cup team in mind.</p>
      <p>The tournament review will be concluded this week, and former All Black coach John Mitchell is expected to stay on as an assistant.</p>
      <p>Jones, a former Springboks assistant coach, said there was one silver lining to England’s World Cup final disaster.</p>
      <p>“I’m so pleased for those South African players,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You can see what a galvanising effect it’s had on the country. That dampens the hardship a bit.”</p>
