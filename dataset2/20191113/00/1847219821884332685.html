        <b>On Wednesday, 13 November, Latvia’s Saeima approved amendments in the final reading to the Law on Lotteries and Gambling Fee and Tax. Amendments include a new proportion for the division of the aforementioned tax between the state and municipal budgets.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the review of the legislative draft, deputies argued over the fight against gambling. Opposition members criticized the New Conservative Party for its failure to move from word to action in this area.</p>
      <p>The majority of Saeima deputies did not support the proposal from the Union of Greens and Farmers member Viktors Valainis to refuse changing the ratio of revenue for the state and municipal budgets.</p>
      <p>According to Finance Ministry, amendments to the law, which are added to the state budget for 2020, were developed to divert the tax burden from labour force to consumption and capital, as well as increase revenue for the state budget to help cover certain state expenditures.</p>

      <p>Until now the law stated that the state budget received 75% from gambling tax revenue and 25% went to budgets of municipalities in which gambling is organized.</p>
      <p>In the first reading it was initially suggested increasing the state budget’s portion of revenue to 90%, reducing the portion that would go to municipal budgets.</p>
      <p>In search of funding to increase wages for doctors, the coalition reached an agreement to increase the state budget’s portion from the tax even more.</p>
      <p>This means the state budget will receive 95% of revenue from the gambling tax, whereas municipalities will receive 5%.</p>
      <p>Approved amendments to the law also state that starting with 2020, gambling tax rate for roulette games , card and dice games will be increased from EUR 23 400 to EUR 28 080 a year.</p>
      <p>The tax will also be increased for gambling machines – from EUR 4 164 to EUR 5 172 per calendar year.</p>
