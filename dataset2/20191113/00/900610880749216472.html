      <p>Hyatt Hotels Corporation has announced a series of initiatives to reduce waste at Hyatt hotels globally.</p>
      <p>The following initiatives will be introduced at all Hyatt properties in the world by June 2021:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increasing the number of water stations in key public spaces at hotels for guests who wish to refill reusable water bottles.</li>
        <li>Transitioning to large-format bathroom amenities to replace traditional small bottles of shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion.</li>
        <li>Serving water in carafes or other containers for meetings and events; bottled water will be available by request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“At Hyatt, our purpose – we care for people so they can be their best – guides all business decisions, including our global sustainability framework, which focuses on using resources responsibly and helping address today’s most pressing environmental issues. Plastic pollution is a global issue, and we hope our efforts will motivate guests, customers and, indeed, ourselves to think more critically about our use of plastic,” says Mark Hoplamazian, president and CEO, Hyatt.</p>
