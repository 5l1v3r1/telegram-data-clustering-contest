      <p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) - Frankfurt captain David Abraham has been banned for all the club’s remaining Bundesliga games this year after knocking over an opposition coach.</p>
      <p>The defender body checked Freiburg coach Christian Streich with his shoulder during Sunday’s league game while trying to gather a ball which had gone out of play.</p>
      <p>Freiburg players and staff then chased Abraham onto the field, sparking a mass brawl.</p>
      <p>The German soccer federation banned Abraham for seven weeks through Dec. 29, ruling him out of six upcoming Bundesliga games, and fined him 25,000 euros ($27,500).</p>
      <p>Freiburg player Vincenzo Grifo has been banned for three games after the video assistant referee system spotted him targeting Abraham for retaliation in the melee.</p>
