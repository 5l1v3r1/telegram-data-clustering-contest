      <p>Nigeria came from behind to beat Benin 2-1 at the start of the final stage of qualifying for the 2021 African Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>Semifinalists at this year’s African Cup, Nigeria went 1-0 down in the third minute at home in Uyo on Wednesday to Stephane Sessegnon’s goal.</p>
      <p>Victor Osimhen converted a penalty on the brink of halftime and Samuel Kalu scored the winner in the second half to put Nigeria top of Group L.</p>
      <p>Cameroon, the 2021 host, started the decisive group stage with a 0-0 draw at home to Cape Verde in Group F. Cameroon has already qualified as host but is playing in qualifying for match practice.</p>
      <p>The top two in each group will qualify for the 24-team finals except in Cameroon’s group, where just one other team will make it through.</p>
