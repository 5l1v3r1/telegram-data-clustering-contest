      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - The founder of a now-defunct private school in North Carolina has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hiding foreign student-athletes from federal immigration authorities.</p>
      <p>News outlet report 65-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evelyn-mack/">Evelyn Mack</a> was sentenced Tuesday after previously pleading guilty to conspiracy to harbor aliens. Court documents say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evelyn-mack/">Mack</a>, owner and schoolmaster of Evelyn Mack Academy, forged enrollment and immigration records for the student-athletes in return for bribes from coaches and recruiters.</p>

        <p>She’s believed to have gotten $1,000 kickbacks on about 75 students, most from Africa. Prosecutors say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/evelyn-mack/">Mack</a> lied about the students attending her academy, which qualified for the student-visa program. They say the students were actually shipped across the country to schools not in the program, allowing them to avoid detection by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
