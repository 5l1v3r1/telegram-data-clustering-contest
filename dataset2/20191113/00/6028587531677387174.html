      <p><b>Topline: </b>As Disney+ continued to stream its archive of beloved movies and TV shows to its new nearly <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawnchmielewski/2019/11/13/disney-app-downloaded-10-million-times-mandalorian-leaks-to-pirate-networks/#20dd495a535c">10 million users</a>⁠, viewers <a href="https://www.mic.com/p/thanks-to-disney-people-are-noticing-all-of-the-racist-stuff-in-disneys-vault-19343921">discovered</a>, in a sign of the times, that disclaimers warning of “outdated cultural depictions” have been added to a number of its classic animations.Here are 5: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/dumbos-crows-song-south-disney-characters-racist-return/"><b><i>Dumbo</i></b></a><b><i> </i>(1941):<i> </i></b>Contains a scene of a group of cigar-smoking crows, with their leader named Jim Crow, referring to the racist segregation laws of the South, and voiced by a white actor.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/racist-history-peter-pan-indian-tribe-180953500/"><b><i>Peter Pan</i></b></a><b><i> </i>(1953): </b>Has been criticized for the way its Native American characters were portrayed, including when they sing the song “What Made The Red Man Red,” and for the way white characters appropriate headdresses and apparel.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/dumbos-crows-song-south-disney-characters-racist-return/"><b><i>Lady And The Tramp</i></b></a><b><i> </i>(1955): </b>Features a pair of Siamese cats that sing “The Siamese Cat Song” in stereotypical Asian voices. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/how-to-adapt-em-the-jungle-book-em-and-not-make-it-racist/280292/"><b><i>The Jungle Book</i></b></a><b><i> </i>(1967)</b>:<i> </i>Has been criticized for its orangutans, which are seen as a racist caricature of black Americans.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/dumbos-crows-song-south-disney-characters-racist-return/"><b><i>The Aristocats</i></b></a><b><i> </i>(1970):<i> </i></b>Has also been condemned for its Siamese cat, which plays the piano and talks about Asian food in a stereotypical accent. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the disclaimers.</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> Some Disney+ movies also have tobacco usage warnings, including <i>The Three Caballeros</i>, <i>Pinocchio</i>, <i>Hercules</i> and <i>The Sword &amp; The Stone</i>. Although TV and movies have had drug use warnings for decades, 2019 has seen an <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/11/06/776397270/more-teens-than-ever-are-vaping-heres-what-we-know-about-their-habits">all-time high</a> of teen vaping. </p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>The pinnacle of Disney’s problematic movies would be 1946’s <i>Song Of The South</i>, set in the post-Civil War years below the Mason-Dixon Line. Despite winning an Oscar for the song “Zip-Ah-Dee-Doo-Dah,” <i>Song Of The South</i> was <a href="http://picturethis.museumca.org/pictures/song-south-protest">resoundly</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/business/media/not-streaming-on-disney-plus.html">panned</a> by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for its “impression of an idyllic master-slave relationship.” It has remained off the market and unavailable for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/business/media/not-streaming-on-disney-plus.html">over 30 years</a>. (You can, however, catch the song and some of the movie’s characters at the Splash Mountain ride in Disney’s Florida, California and Tokyo theme parks.)</p>
      <p><b>Tangent: </b>Twitter users <a href="http://picturethis.museumca.org/pictures/song-south-protest">pointed out</a> that Warner Brothers, which owns <i>Looney Tunes</i>, has its <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/09/exploring-the-hidden-racist-past-of-the-looney-toons.html">own share</a> of racist content and acknowledged it with a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-29427843">stronger warning</a> than Disney, but without editing cartoons, stating they “are being presented as they were originally created, because to do so otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.” </p>
