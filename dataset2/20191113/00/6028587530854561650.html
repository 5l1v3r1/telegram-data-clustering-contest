      <p>Plant-based burgers are becoming more mainstream, or at least more available (see the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2019/04/01/plant-based-protein-comes-to-burger-king-meet-the-impossible-whopper/">Impossible Whopper</a>). The Good Food Institute says it won’t be long before meat alternatives taste better than meat (and are more nutritious). This seemingly shocking statement comes from Liz Specht, associate director of science and technology at the nonprofit institute in Washington, D.C., which supports plant-based and cultivated alternatives to conventional meat products. Specht says in a post at <a href="https://scienceblog.com/511599/is-the-future-alternative-meats/">ScienceBlog</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>In the near future, we’ll begin to see meat alternatives that outperform their animal-based counterparts at multiple levels, from taste to nutrition. We have barely scratched the surface in terms of what’s possible for plant-based and cultivated meat. Once we decouple the means of meat production from the biological limitations of the animal itself, anything becomes possible.</blockquote>
      <p>This sounds like a misprint ... to a meat-eater, at least. Matt Ball, senior communications specialist at <a href="https://www.gfi.org/">The Good Food Institute</a>, says it most certainly is not.</p>
      <p>“Meat from animals is about as good as it can be—and in some cases, <a href="https://atlasofscience.org/the-woody-breast-condition-affects-texture-characteristics-of-both-raw-and-cooked-chicken-breast-meat/">worse</a>,” Ball says. “Most of the meat today, though, is determined by economics, not taste—meat companies producing the cheapest meat they can.</p>
      <p>“But with both <a href="https://www.gfi.org/gfi-is-open-sourcing-plant-based-meat-innovation">plant-based</a> and cultivated meat, we aren't limited by an animal's biology and physiology. This gives us enormous freedom to explore new types of meat.”</p>
      <p>What would a better non-meat taste like to make it better tasting than meat? This can make your brain hurt.</p>
      <p>Ball says to think about the absolute best tasting meat you ever had. Mmm. Has every bite of meat you’ve ever had been that good?</p>

      <p>“Probably not,” he says, “because currently, meat companies have to sell every part of the animal, not just the best-tasting portion. Just as importantly, almost all meat comes from animals bred to be efficient at converting feed to meat, not because their meat is the tastiest.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gfi.org/images/uploads/2018/08/LizSpechtIFTFuture.pdf">Cultivated meat</a> allows producers to use the best quality meat cultivated from cells sampled from the best animals, Ball says.</p>
      <p>“We can cultivate meat that is all upside–no gristle, no bone, no skin, no tendons ... We can tweak the ratio of anything in the meat, or even combine things that would never occur in a single animal.”</p>
      <p>This is getting interesting, going <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelpellmanrowland/2019/10/29/ceo-of-beyond-meat-has-key-ingredient-to-beat-competition/">Beyond Meat</a>, to borrow the name of one plant-based brand.</p>
      <p>Back to Specht, who started this conversation.</p>
      <p>She says awareness is growing about the negative impacts of conventional meat products, from land and water use to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2019/11/04/blue-ocean-barns-seaweed-supplement-makes-cows-burp-less-cuts-greenhouse-gas-emissions/">greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>
      <p>And increasing interest in plant-based meat is due in part to a rise in “<a href="https://www.greenmatters.com/food/2018/11/05/ZEN4sH/flexitarian-flexible-vegetarian-diet">flextarians</a>,” or people who still eat meat but are trying to reduce their meat consumption. That means the newer products need to deliver on taste and texture, and not just be meatless.</p>
      <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JUMBfHa2E4MgX7EVt5SVrSTqP2JKKwZVELYIf8wMmI0/edit#gid=698328806">Several dozen startups</a> are working on bringing cultivated meat to the market in the next few years, Specht says.</p>
      <p>But what about the Frankenstein factor of “making” cultivated meat from animal cells? Or the processed part, or implication at least, of plant-based meat? <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/leghemoglobin">Leghemoglobin</a> protein is used in the Impossible Burger, for instance.</p>
      <p>Ball points to an <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-friedrich-ivmeat-20180725-story.html">LA Times opinion piece</a> from Bruce Friedrich, the institute’s co-founder and executive director. Basically, the response is that “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2018/09/26/3-million-offered-for-the-next-delicious-plant-based-clean-meat-burger/">clean</a>” or cultivated meat will take some time to gain acceptance, just like other technologies, and is akin to clean energy: better for the environment.</p>
      <p>As for the processed part, “The question isn’t if a food is processed, but how it is produced,” the institute says in statement. “Compared to animal-based meat, plant-based meat companies are entirely transparent” and must list all their ingredients. That’s not so with ground beef, for instance.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking for information on where to find meatless meat, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/10/20870872/where-to-buy-impossible-foods-beyond-meat">Vox has a rundown</a>. The list of where to find better-than-meat meatless meat will be here in the near future, if the institute’s predictions come true.</p>
