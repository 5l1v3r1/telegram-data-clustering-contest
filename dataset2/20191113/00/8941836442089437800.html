        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>All hail the big day — the Democrats’ big ah-ha, gotcha, Mr. President moment, when open hearings on Capitol Hill with key Witnesses In The Know would provide the final quid pro quo proof, leading to impeachment of Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Or, as Ambassador Bill Taylor might painfully <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/13/778824788/read-william-taylors-opening-statement-in-public-impeachment-hearing">put</a> it — umm, the way I see it is I feel like the way everybody understood it is that the president may have thought about that thing, that quid pro quo thing.</p>
      <p>‘Cause that’s how Taylor’s Q&amp;A with Daniel Goldman, the counsel for the majority for the House Intelligence Committee, pretty much went.</p>
      <p>Decisive, it ain’t. </p>
      <p>You can’t impeach a president based on what you think others may have thought about the president’s thoughts. Or worse, based on what you feel the president felt.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Here’s one of Taylor’s remarks: “There was a feeling by President Trump … that he had a feeling of having been wronged by Ukraine and so this was something that he felt they owed him to fix the wrong.”</p>
      <p>And from that, Goldman tossed in ye olde quid pro quo, drawing shaky, shady conclusions where conclusions couldn’t — shouldn’t — possibly be drawn.</p>
      <p>“You understood that to mean …,” Goldman said.</p>
      <p>But therein lies the problem — the huge problem. How can Taylor, or Goldman, or any of the other witnesses Democrats have primed and ready to go for this charade of a hearing possibly, accurately, truthfully testify to Trump’s motivations, outside his actual words?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Goldman tried; he really did.</p>
        <p>“The president repeatedly says there was no quid pro quo,” Goldman said. “But regardless what you call it …”</p>
        <p>No. It’s not regardless what you call it. It’s either a quid pro quo, or it’s not. And if it’s not, what’s left is a case of making a case for impeachment based on personal thoughts and feelings — or on the thoughts and feelings of others.</p>
        <p>Look, when an attorney asks questions (to paraphrase) that go like this — What did you understand it to mean? What did you think it to mean? What did you feel he understood that to mean? — it’s time to acknowledge, hey now, facts may be a bit on the slim side.</p>
        <p>The slim-to-none side, even.</p>
        <p>Testifying on what someone else said and believed is hardly the stuff of rock solid impeachable evidence.</p>
        <p>Either Democrats come up with some cold hard facts — or move on. America has put up with cries for impeachment for too long as it is.</p>
