      <p>Craig Counsell lost his All-Star closer before the season even started, watched his Opening Day starter slog with way to a 5.68 ERA before getting released with a month left to play, saw another All-Star reliever get released, dealt with two of his best sluggers from previous years struggle to find any sort of groove at the plate and to top it off, lost the reigning National League Most Valuable Player to a season-ending injury with three weeks to play.None of that was enough to keep the Milwaukee Brewers out of the playoffs for a second straight season but yet, it wasn't enough for Counsell to earn the National League Manager of the Year Award.</p>
      <p>Counsell finished second to Cardinals manager Mike Shildt, who received three fewer first-place votes but finished with seven more overall points to take home the honor.</p>
      <p>It was the second consecutive runner-up finish for Counsell, who finished his fourth full season at the Brewers' helm and has led the team to a 405-381 record since replacing Ron Roenicke in May 2015. </p>
      <p>He was edged out last season by Atlanta's Brian Snitker despite leading the Brewers to within a game of their first World Series since 1982. Milwaukee reported to camp with almost everyone back from that squad with a legitimate goal of closing the one-game gap in 2019.</p>
      <p>That goal took its first hit late in spring training when Corey Knebel was sidelined with an elbow injury that ultimately resulted in Tommy John surgery. Milwaukee also saw All-Star reliever Jeremy Jeffress shelved with an injury and he would be released before the season's end.</p>
      <p>Coming off a career season, Jhoulys Chacin took the mound on Opening Day but managed just four quality starts and was released in late August. </p>
      <p>Chacin's struggles were exacerbated when young starters Corbin Burnes and Freddy Peralta struggled to duplicate their success a year ago. Brandon Woodruff emerged as a bona fide ace out of that group but was lost for nearly two months with a strained oblique.</p>
      <p>Offensively, two of Counsell's most imposing sluggers — first baseman Jesus Aguilar and third baseman Travis Shaw — never found their footing and combined for just 19 home runs. Aguilar was dealt to Tampa at the deadline while Shaw spent a majority of the season at Triple-A San Antonio.</p>
      <p>As a result, his team went into September just three games over .500, 6 1/2 games back of St. Louis in the NL Central and four back of the second Wild Card spot but proceeded to win 20 of 27 games to clinch a Wild Card berth and flirt with a shot at the division crown going into the final weekend of the season.</p>
      <p>And most notably, the Brewers did that despite losing reigning NL Most Valuable Player Christian Yelich, who suffered a fractured kneecap on Sept. 10 and did not play again the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>The Brewers went 13-5 without Yelich.</p>
