      <h1>Hyatt launches three initiatives to reduce single-use plastics</h1>

      <p>Hyatt Hotels is set to introduce “large-format” bathroom amenities, reduce single-use water bottles and increase the number of water stations in key public spaces at its hotels.</p>
      <p>The hotel group said all Hyatt brands worldwide will adopt these three sustainability initiatives by June 2021 in an effort to “reduce waste at Hyatt hotels globally”.</p>
      <p>The news follows a number of hotel groups moving towards reducing single-use plastics in their properties. Last month, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/10/30/mandarin-oriental-to-eliminate-single-use-plastic/">luxury hotel group Mandarin Oriental</a> rolled out plans to eliminate all single-use plastic by the end of March 2021. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/07/30/ihg-to-phase-out-mini-plastic-toiletries-across-entire-portfolio/">Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG)</a> announced that it will switch to bulk-size bathroom amenities in guest rooms across its entire portfolio of hotel brands.</p>
      <p>The large-format bathroom amenities will replace traditional small bottles of shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Secondly, the hotel said it would increase the number of water stations in key public spaces at hotels so that guests can refill reusable water bottles. Water will be served in carafes (glass containers without handles) or other containers for meetings and events and bottled water will be available by request.</p>
      <p>“At Hyatt, our purpose – we care for people so they can be their best – guides all business decisions, including our global sustainability framework, which focuses on using resources responsibly and helping address today’s most pressing environmental issues,” said Mark Hoplamazian, president and CEO, Hyatt.</p>
      <p>“Plastic pollution is a global issue, and we hope our efforts will motivate guests, customers and, indeed, ourselves to think more critically about our use of plastic,” he added.</p>
      <p>Hyatt’s other recent initiatives have included removing plastic straws and drink picks and making alternative options available only by request at its hotels; and increasing the use of compostable, recyclable, or recycled content packaging for to-go food containers.</p>
      <p>The hotel group said the following sustainability initiatives have already been introduced:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In-house water bottling plants that reuse glass bottles and replace single-use bottles. Hotels with this solution currently include Alila Villas Koh Russey, Alila Manggis, Alila Ubud, Alila Villas Uluwatu, Alila Bangsar, Alila Jabal Akhdar, Hyatt Regency Addis Ababa, Hyatt Regency Delhi, Andaz Costa Rica Resort at Peninsula Papagayo and Park Hyatt Maldives Hadahaa.</li>
        <li>Reusable bottles distributed to all guests at check-in at resorts such as Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa, Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort &amp; Spa, Hyatt Ziva Cancun, Miraval Arizona and Miraval Austin.</li>
        <li>Filtered water spouts installed in all guest rooms at Park Hyatt Istanbul – Macka Palas to provide fresh drinking water.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hyatt Hotels Corporation, headquartered in Chicago, is a global hospitality company with a portfolio of 20 brands. As of September 30, 2019, the company’s portfolio included more than 875 properties in over 60 countries across six continents.</p>
