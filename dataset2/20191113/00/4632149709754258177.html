      <h1>As kidnap plot failed, they turned arsonists</h1>

      <p>Two persons, who had set a businessman’s house and vehicles ablaze, and threatened to kidnap his son, were caught within a few hours of committing the crime on Tuesday. Police found the duo hiding in a eucalyptus grove on Hessaraghatta Road. They shot the culprits on their legs to arrest them. <br/><br/>The two accused, Mohammed Riyaz, 21, and Mohammed Basit, 23, from Tamil Nadu set Srinivas’s house and four vehicles parked near it on fire and then called him to come out and see what they had done. They had earlier demanded a ransom of Rs 50 lakh from Srinivas and threatened to kidnap his son, and when Srinivas refused to indulge them, they committed the arson around 1.30 am on Tuesday. <br/><br/>Srinivas owns a water distillery plant in Dasarahalli and is also a political party office bearer. His son, Sharath, was helping with the business. <br/><br/>“Sharath used to post his pictures with expensive bikes and cars on social networking sites and had projected himself as a rich kid. The accused two who were working in a rice dealer’s shop in Dasarahalli had come across the pictures and had hatched a plot to kidnap him. The shop where the two were working was near the victim’s distillery unit,” said an officer. <br/><br/>The two had a loan of Rs 15 lakh and so they decided to kidnap Sharath to demand a ransom from his father. The two are alleged to have made a futile kidnap attempt around 10 days back too.</p>

      <p>In the wee hours of Tuesday, they made repeated calls to Srinivas on his mobile phone. After around 15 missed calls, Srinivas answered one call, and the accused demanded the money. They threatened to kidnap his son if they are not paid the money. <br/><br/>When that plan came to a naught, they set fire to the house and vehicles belonging to Srinivas and his tenants. After this they hid at the eucalyptus grove on Hessaraghatta Road. Soladevanahalli police got credible information on their whereabouts and arrested them hours later. <br/><br/><br/>“We doused the fire on our own. My wife and I sustained injuries in the incident. After I refused to pay them the money, the accused set fire to my building and the vehicles. We struggled for nearly 45 minutes to completely douse the fire. The exact reason for the incident is not known. I do not even know who the accused are,” Srinivas told Mirror. <br/><br/>Two policemen were also hurt when they went to arrest the two accused. <br/><br/><br/>Riyaz was shot on his right leg while the other accused has sustained bullet injuries on his left leg.</p>
