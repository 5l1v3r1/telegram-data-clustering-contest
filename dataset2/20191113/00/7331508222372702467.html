      <p>Fresh off its victory in Tuscaloosa on Saturday, <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/99/lsu-tigers">LSU</a> finds itself atop this week's edition of the College Football Playoff rankings, while No. 4 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/61/georgia-bulldogs">Georgia</a> edged No. 5 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> to break into the top four.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide are outside the top four for only the fifth time in the CFP era (since 2014).</p>
      <p>No. 2 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/194/ohio-state-buckeyes">Ohio State</a> and No. 3 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/228/clemson-tigers">Clemson</a>, both coming off dominant victories to remain unbeaten, round out the top four.</p>
      <p>No. 6 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2483/oregon-ducks">Oregon</a> and No. 7 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/254/utah-utes">Utah</a> both moved up one spot from last week's initial rankings, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/135/minnesota-golden-gophers">Minnesota</a>'s victory over <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State</a> vaulted the Golden Gophers nine spots to No. 8. It's the largest jump into the top 10 in the CFP era and the second-biggest week-to-week jump in CFP rankings history.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, we're looking at the full résumé," committee chair Rob Mullens said of Minnesota. "As we mentioned last week, nonconference schedule wasn't as strong as some. And then they only played one team in their league with a winning record, until Penn State. But, when you watch the game last week, they beat a Penn State team that was then ranked No. 4. It impressed the committee until that point, we were really impressed with what Minnesota did."</p>
      <p>The loss knocked the Nittany Lions down to No. 9, followed by <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/201/oklahoma-sooners">Oklahoma</a> at No. 10.</p>
      <p>No. 11 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/57/florida-gators">Florida</a> and No. 12 <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers">Auburn</a> are still linked at the hip, while <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/239/baylor-bears">Baylor</a>, the only other unbeaten team in the CFP rankings, comes in at No. 13 after struggling to beat <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2628/tcu-horned-frogs">TCU</a> in three overtimes. Baylor is the lowest-ranked Power 5 team at 9-0 or better in the CFP era.</p>
      <p>"... When you look at Baylor's nonconference schedule, their two nonconference opponents have won a total of six games," Mullens said. "Obviously, Baylor has some great wins, they've certainly figured out how to win in close games. But at this point the committee felt they belonged at No. 13."</p>
