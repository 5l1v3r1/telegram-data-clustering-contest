      <p>To be a successful entrepreneur you have to identify a problem you feel passionate about. That certainly was the case for Galen Karlan Mason who, as a graduate student, was passionate about making healthy, ethical, and sustainable food choices at the supermarket, but couldn’t find a tool to help solve this problem. And that’s exactly why he decided to take the entrepreneurial leap and start his own company. I recently invited Galen onto our <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/dormroom"><i>From the Dorm Room to the Board Room</i></a> podcast to chat about his company GreenChoice, his overall career trajectory, and the advice he has for young professionals interested in starting their own company. The following short excerpt from that interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.<b>Andy Molinsky:</b> I know you went to business school, but you probably didn't train to be the CEO of a company and all the things that that entails. What unforeseen challenges have you faced.</p>
      <p><b>Galen Karlan-Mason:</b> I definitely didn't train to be a CEO or founder. But you learn as you go. And if you are willing to embrace the risks associated with the unknown, I truly believe anyone can start a company.</p>
      <p><b>Molinsky:</b> Did you make mistakes early on? </p>
      <p><b>Karlan-Mason:</b> Absolutely. We probably spent too long building the product. We probably could have started much simpler, giving people a PDF or a newsletter helping match products with their values. But we went right to the mobile app, which wasn’t the easiest path towards solving the problem.  </p>
      <p><b>Molinsky: </b>What leadership lessons have you learned from starting a company?</p>
      <p><b>Karlan-Mason:</b> One of the biggest lessons has been the importance of work ethic – both for hiring and also founding a company. If something really inspires you and lights you up, you’re going to work harder. And that’s a real differentiator: it gives you the upper edge. </p>
      <p><b>Molinsky:</b> So how do you then discover what you're passionate about? What advice would you give to someone who's struggling with that?</p>
      <p><b>Karlan-Mason:</b> One key thing is to put passion in context. You don’t necessarily need to discover your life long calling to start a company. Ask yourself what you are passionate about now? What excites you now? It’s unrealistic to think too far out in the future. As you grow, you change, your interests change, and your passions may change. And so, it's about finding what excites you right now, embracing that, and seeing where it takes you.</p>
