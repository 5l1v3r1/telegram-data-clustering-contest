      <p>Many people have dreams of being financially independent, however, none of us were born knowing how to make that financial dream become a reality. Through life experience, we learn how to earn and manage money, however, most of our knowledge comes from past mistakes. Too many adults are left feeling insecure when it comes to their finances, and too many adults lack the financial expertise needed to grow. Bank of America recognizes this issue, and through their <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en">Better Money Habits</a> financial education platform, they are fully committed to helping people lead better financial lives.  In partnership with BuzzFeed, Bank of America hosted a dynamic Better Money Habits Financial Wellness Retreat that helped equip a group of young adults with the resources, knowledge, and confidence needed to not just survive financially but also to thrive. With group sessions and expert advice, Bank of America provided attendees with a wide range of personal finance guidance on topics like home ownership, investing, saving, debt management, and more.  Consider the following key takeaways as you embark on your new financial journey:<b><u>Investing</u></b></p>
      <p>It is essential to save, but unfortunately, you cannot save your way to financial independence.  However, you can, in fact, invest your way there. Daniel Bochnia Stapff, a Financial Advisor at Merrill Lynch, believes that “investing is a crucial factor needed to grow your money, however, it is extremely easy for our brains to live in fear.” So often, many individuals find the reasons for why he or she can’t or won’t invest, when in fact they should focus on the reasons why they can and will invest.</p>
      <p>During the Bank of America Better Money Habits Retreat, Stapff dedicated his time, ensuring that attendees left with the confidence that would help remove the fear many people have about investing. If you are just starting out and recognize concerns around investing, you might be interested in the three key areas Stapff wants you to focus your attention on.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Understand the power of compounding interest.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When people think of the term interest, they often think of credit card and loan debt. This type of interest can work against you, however, compounding interest on investments can work for you. It is possible to gain interest when investing, and it is important to understand that with time, true wealth can be created. Time is the one thing that makes compound interest effective, so start now with what you have. Starting early can help grow your money faster. While it may seem like setting aside small amounts of money isn’t much, small investment contributions, each month, can compound over time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="2">
          <b>Focus on you.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>It is imperative to know where all your money is, so dedicate time to learning about your current investments as well as future additions to your portfolio. There are many social media gurus, but you cannot dedicate your time and energy to what they are doing.  Focus on your goals, your dreams, and your financial plan.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="3">
          <b>Diversity.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you continue to build your financial plan, spread your risk across different types of investments. By diversifying your investments, you can increase your odds of investment success. This will allow you to minimize the risk of loss to your overall portfolio.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Home Ownership</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Purchasing a home could possibly be the most significant financial decision of your life. There are tons of important factors that everyone should take into consideration during this process. Here are 3 key areas that Bank of America mortgage experts shared during the Retreat:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Get educated.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When going through the home buying process, it is imperative that you learn everything you can. “Understanding the differences between a <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership/fixed-vs-adjustable-rate-mortgages">fixed and adjustable (ARM) mortgage rates</a> are extremely useful,” says Anthony Corona, Vice President Mortgage Loan Officer at Bank of America.  The home-buying process can, at times, be an intricate experience, so do not go about the home buying journey alone. Work with an experienced realtor who has been in the business for a while. Take your time, trust the process, and learn all that you can.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="2">
          <b>Gather all the mortgage materials you need and continue to save.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>“It is best to prepare for the mortgage process before getting pre-qualified,” says Corona. Before getting pre-qualified, have all your documents in order. As you plan and learn more about the mortgage process, make sure that you start saving early. Do not let the down payment discourage your journey. Most first-time home buyers are <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership/buying-a-house-with-low-down-payment">putting down less than 20%</a>, and some are even putting down 3% or less (depending on their loan). Keep your options open and continue to save throughout your process. The more you save, the more options you’ll have.</p>
      <ol>
        <li data-num="3">
          <b>Pay down your debt, and do not add to it.</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>It is possible to purchase a home while in debt, however, pay close attention to your <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en/home-ownership/mortgage-debt-to-income-ratio">debt to income ratio</a>.  As you prepare to buy a home, focus on adding more income and reducing your current debt. Do not take on any more loans, use your credit cards, or co-sign for any additional loans. This can drastically impact your approval amount and interest rate.</p>

          <u>Vision</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to providing a plethora of financial tools and support, Bank of America also realized that it is possible to obtain financial resources and lose sight of the most crucial piece of one’s financial journey: Their Vision.</p>
      <p>During the Retreat, Tonya Rapley, best-selling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/198761478X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0">The Money Manual</a> and founder of <a href="http://www.myfabfinance.com/">MyFabFinance</a>, reminded everyone that their financial journey requires “The Marathon Mindset.” Building wealth isn’t just about learning everything you can about money, but instead following your North Star.  You need a vision, a purpose, and a why behind everything you do. Rapley encouraged all attendees to “ask yourself these 3 questions: What habits do I need to change? What is guiding me?  What mental blocks are stopping me from believing?”</p>
      <p>After thinking through each question, understand that having the tangible resources are great. However, everyone still needs the intangibles that live within. Do not just hope for financial success, develop a direction. Know what you want and keep an open mind.  Rapley reminded everyone to “be honest with yourself. Accept where you are and know where you’re lacking.  When the awareness is there, your ability to change becomes stronger. “</p>
      <p>“Every day, people are juggling an overwhelming number of near- and long-term financial priorities – from paying off debt to saving for the future. The Better Money Habits Retreat offered guidance, resources, and peer support to help attendees identify, map out, and achieve their financial goals,” says Meredith Verdone, Chief Marketing Officer at Bank of America.  In fact, the entire <a href="https://bettermoneyhabits.bankofamerica.com/en">Better Money Habits</a> resource center is filled with tons of support and resources needed to help everyone build a solid financial foundation.  As you close out the year 2019, finish strong. Finish this year knowing that you are the most significant tool you have. With the right mindset and better money habits, you can obtain the true financial independence you deserve.</p>
