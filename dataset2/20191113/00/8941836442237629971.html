      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - Broadband workshops are planned in New Mexico as the rural state looks to boost high-speed online access.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Agriculture Department’s rural development division is working with the state and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to host meetings this week in Truth or Consequences and Albuquerque.</p>
      <p>Census figures show almost 30% of New Mexico residents have no internet subscription of any type while 55% of residents have a subscription such as fiber, cable or DSL at home.</p>
      <p>Officials say that means nearly half the homes in New Mexico don’t currently benefit from a high-speed broadband connection.</p>

        <p>A recent report by legislative analysts found that state and federal investments totaling over $300 million have succeeded in connecting schools, hospitals and other institutions, but many rural areas remain unserved.</p>
