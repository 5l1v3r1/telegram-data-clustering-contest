        <b>East Kilbride...1 Tynecastle...0</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jim Paterson has thrown his hat into the ring for the East Kilbride job after leading them to victory over Tynecastle in the East of Scotland Qualifying Cup last night.</p>
      <p>The former Dundee United and Motherwell midfielder watched Ruari Paton score the only goal of the game late in the first half to secure Kilby's progress to round three.</p>
      <p>Paterson and Dean Shanks will remain in caretaker charge for Saturday's Lowland League visit of Gretna, as the club mull over who will succeed Stuart Malcolm in the hot-seat following his move to League One Forfar.</p>
      <p>Civil Service Strollers boss Gary Jardine and former Dumbarton duo Stevie Aitken and Ian Durrant have been linked to the post at K-Park this week.</p>
      <p>But Paterson wants to prove to the Kilby board he is the man to take the club forward after a nightmare start to the season that's left EK eighth in the table and 16 points off leaders Kelty Hearts.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old said: "Deano and I will prepare the team for Saturday and we'll speak to the board again after that.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy in the sense that a close friend of mine [Malcolm] has moved on to pastures new, but at the same time I've said to the club I've been an assistant at Stenhousemuir when we won promotion under Brown Ferguson [in 2018] and now here, so I'm looking to step up and take the reins somewhere.</p>
      <p>"It's a great opportunity and one I wasn't expecting, but if the club want me to take charge for the short term, I'll just keep doing my job until I'm told otherwise.</p>

      <p>"But at the same time, if I want a shout for the job I need to start putting wins on the board and start climbing the table.</p>
      <p>"I'm not stupid, so I know that's the priority for me and I want to get the team back playing the way we know they can play."</p>
      <p>In a game of few chances, Kilby struggled to string much together in freezing conditions, with Paton curling a free-kick narrowly wide in 27 minutes and Graeme Holmes seeing his shot across goal tipped round the post.</p>
      <p>But in 36 minutes it was the one real bit of quality in the game that led to the decisive goal. Dean Cairns collected the ball in the middle of the park and when his clever through ball with the outside of his right boot sent BJ Coll down the wing, Paton was on hand to meet the cutback and fire the ball into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>In the second half, the K-Park pitch started to freeze up, making for difficult conditions and it was the visitors from the East of Scotland League who looked the most threatening.</p>
      <p>Jordan Smith came close to an equaliser when his curling free-kick flashed wide in 62 minutes, as Matt McGinley scrambled across his goal.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes later Smith was at it again when his low drive across goal whizzed past the far post.</p>

      <p>The introduction of youngster Sam Jamieson from the bench almost gave Kilby a second when he cut inside and fired at goal, but his effort was straight at Tynecastle keeper Murray Jackson.</p>
      <p>It wasn't a performance to get excited about, but after EK saw the game out, Paterson hopes this result will be the start of a Kilby revival.</p>
      <p>"We want to get back to playing the football we know we can," he said.</p>
      <p>"The way this season has gone, there's boys who are short and confidence and it's up to me to try and re-instill that in them.</p>
      <p>"The pitch wasn't the greatest and if your pass was accurate, it skips away from you but it was encouraging to see a bit of positivity.</p>
      <p>"A win last Saturday, a win here and we take a bit of momentum into this weekend.</p>
      <p>"We like to pass the ball, but sometimes we can overpass it and sometimes when the opportunity is on we don't move it quick enough.</p>
      <p>"But the goal was an instance where we were patient and picked the right moment to play it to BJ, he cuts it back and Ruari gets his goal.</p>
      <p>"It's just about getting them on the same page.</p>
      <p>"It will be slightly different to Stuart. I spoke to my wingers about how I want them to play, so we can get counter attacks and always have an option in the middle of the pitch, so that if we win it back we can break and have that option.</p>
      <p>"A couple of times coming down the left late on, we had that width, we just could have done better with the opportunities, but that's the next step to work on.</p>
