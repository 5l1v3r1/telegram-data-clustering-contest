      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Nine privacy, social justice and consumer groups are calling for the U.S. government to block <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a>’s $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness-gadget maker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fitbit/">Fitbit</a>, citing antitrust and privacy concerns.</p>
      <p>They say in a Wednesday letter to the Federal Trade Commission that the deal would consolidate <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a>’s dominance over internet services like search, advertising and smartphone operating systems.</p>
      <p>They also worry it’ll add to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a>’s store of consumer data. Health information is of particular concern. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> has hired health care executives, hinting at a health-data business to come.</p>
      <p>Politicians and regulators have been scrutinizing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/google/">Google</a> and other Silicon Valley companies for how they use customer data and leverage their size to thwart competitors.</p>
