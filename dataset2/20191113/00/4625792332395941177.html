      <h1>Senate Democrat calls for activists to ‘believe in climate change as though it’s a religion’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:50:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:50</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Sen. Mazie Hirono urged attendees during a discussion on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals that they need to start treating their activism against climate change religiously.</p>
      <p>The Hawaii Democrat said the activists needed to march and get people out to vote so that they can be "committed to human rights, environmental rights, climate change — believe in climate change as though <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/nbc-news-builds-confessional-for-climate-change-zealots">it’s a religion</a> (it’s not, it’s science)."</p>
      <p>Hirono, 72, <a href="https://www.hirono.senate.gov/news/press-releases/hirono-markey-ocasio-cortez-introduce-green-new-deal-resolution-">co-sponsored</a> Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal resolution, which proposed an economic overhaul of the United States economy to fight climate change.</p>
      <p>"From committing to 100% renewable energy, to embracing a carbon neutral economy, Hawaii has taken aggressive action to combat climate change because of the threat it poses to our way of life," Hirono said in support of the resolution. "Confronting the challenge of climate change requires a comprehensive approach to transforming our country in a way that prioritizes environmental health and wellness."</p>
      <p>Hirono's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/sen-mazie-hirono-of-hawaii-is-writing-memoir-due-in-2021/2019/11/12/51848064-0554-11ea-9118-25d6bd37dfb1_story.html">comments</a> come the same day it was announced she is working on her memoir.</p>
