      <p>Asian stocks and Wall Street futures fell on Wednesday on growing worries US-China trade talks are stalling after President Donald Trump failed to deliver any new information about when the two countries would sign a trade deal.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 percent. Australian shares were down 0.17 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index slid 0.38 percent.</p>
      <p>The dollar drifted in Asia after Trump said a trade deal was “close” but gave no new details on when or where an agreement would be signed, disappointing investors in what was billed as a major speech on his administration’s economic policies.</p>

      <p>Trump also rattled some investors by threatening China with even more tariffs if they do not sign a deal.</p>
      <p>Oil prices fell as diminishing prospects for an immediate resolution to a 16-month long trade war between the world’s two-largest economies suggested less demand for energy in the future.</p>
      <p>Expectations for a “phase one” trade deal some time this month have been a key factor supporting stocks and riskier assets recently. However, the lack of material progress on an agreement has only increased doubts about whether a trade deal will take place at all.</p>
      <p>“I’m absolutely concerned. The clock is ticking,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“Markets are now expecting substantial progress in the next week or so, and if not then confidence could crumble. There are diverging interpretations of Trump’s comments. I tend to go with commodities like oil and copper because they are plugged in to global demand, so their fall is significant.”</p>
      <p>US stock futures fell 0.14 percent in Asia after the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.16 percent gain on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs during trading on Tuesday but stocks ended off session highs after Trump's speech.</p>
      <p>Washington and Beijing have imposed tariffs on each other’s goods in a bitter dispute over Chinese trade practices that the Trump administration says are unfair.</p>
      <p>The standoff has roiled global financial markets and raised the risk of recession for some economies as global trade slows.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, both sides have indicated they were making progress toward an agreement that would potentially scale back some tariffs, but a lack of additional information is starting to unsettle some investors in equities and other riskier assets.</p>
      <p>In a reminder of the potential for further friction, Trump said on Tuesday he would raise tariffs on Chinese goods “very substantially” if China does not agree a deal. “And that’s going to be true for other countries that mistreat us too,” he added.</p>
      <p>In currencies, the dollar was just a shade lower at 108.99 yen pulling away slightly from a five-month high reached no November 7.</p>
      <p>The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose slightly to 1.9277 percent but is likely to move in a narrow range before data due later Wednesday that is forecast to show US consumer prices accelerated slightly in October.</p>
      <p>US crude dipped 0.25 percent to USD 56.66 a barrel do to worries about weakening demand for oil.</p>
      <p>LME copper traded down 0.4 percent at USD 5,854 a tonne by 2337 GMT, having earlier reached the weakest since November 1 at USD 5,842 a tonne. Copper, widely used in power and construction, is seen as a gauge of economic health.</p>
      <p>In addition, China accounts for about half of the world’s demand for copper, and many other metals.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
