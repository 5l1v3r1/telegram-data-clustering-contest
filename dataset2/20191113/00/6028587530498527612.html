      <p>A U.K. police force has stated on Twitter that cyclists do not have to use cycleways when they are provided. “Not all cyclists will use them all the time, and that is their right,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MPSWinchmoreH/status/1194268148129771520?s=20">wrote the Enfield policing team</a>, part of London’s Metropolitan Police. The statement posted on November 12 was in response to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/222922441084321/videos/436294017043161/?v=436294017043161">road rage incident published on Facebook</a> in which a car passenger filmed a cyclist riding on a road and shouted: “Oi! Use the f*****g bike lane!”</p>
      <p>The passenger claimed the cyclist—who did not respond to the rant—was riding on a “£42 million” cycleway when, in fact, that figure is for people-friendly road changes across the whole borough.</p>
      <p>The Facebook video, published November 11, is captioned: “So they spent millions on a bike lane, made our roads more narrow, took away parking spots for t*** like this to still ride on the f*****g road.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The road in question is Green Lanes in Enfield. The cycleway off to one side of this road crosses many residential streets but offers no protection at junctions. On <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5wCzcDdDSB8u8VW29">Google Street View</a>, a refuse lorry can be seen turning into the side street featured in the Facebook rant, and for many cyclists, it would be safer to ride on the road here because even though the Highway Code says motorists are supposed to cede priority to non-motorists on such main-road-to-side-road junctions, many do not.</p>
      <p>According to rule 170 of the Highway Code, motorists are supposed to “take extra care at junctions” and “should ... watch out for cyclists ... and pedestrians as they are not always easy to see.”</p>
      <p>The Highway Code adds that if pedestrians “have started to cross they have priority, so give way.” Rule 63 advises cyclists that cycleways “can make your journey safer” but adds that their use is “not compulsory.”</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, that “cyclists have to use cycleways” is a frequent complaint on social media and in the real world, with many motorists not understanding that there are often compelling safety reasons for cyclists not to use the infrastructure “provided for them.”</p>
      <p>There are a great many excellent—and well used—cycleways in the U.K., but these are outliers, designed by specialists.</p>
      <p>Instead, let’s imagine a car journey designed by a non-specialist cycleway designer. British motorways would become minor roads and then back again before ending at brick walls. At every traffic light, you would have to exit your car to press a button then hop back in to wait for a flashing car symbol. Bollards would be placed smack-bang in the middle of travel lanes. Broken glass—from the smack-bangs—would remain on the road, unswept. “Motorists dismount” signs would be everywhere. And forget speedy A to B access, with roads designed by an old-school British cycle path designer, you would have to travel ten miles to get somewhere two miles away. And you’d also have to share the road with cows.</p>
      <p>British cycleways tend to be indirect, narrow, strewn with glass, and littered with obstacles such as lamp posts. “Cyclists dismount” signs are commonplace. Cycle paths are often blocked with barriers making them difficult to use. Despite quite large differentials in speed, cyclists often have to share narrow spaces with pedestrians. Council “cycling budgets” are often <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2019/04/16/painted-white-lines-are-not-cyclist-protecting-forcefields-agree-experts/#6b624b43fbd0">blown on pots of white paint</a> due to the widespread belief that magically marked-out cycle lanes have protective properties.</p>
      <p>Things are very different in the Netherlands. Dutch motorists have direct, well-surfaced, fast roads all to themselves, and cyclists are provided with similar. The two transport modes have extensive, separate networks; everybody’s safe, everybody’s happy.</p>

      <p>In recent years a small number of British cycleways have been built to Dutch-standards. They are crowd-pleasingly wide, protected, and direct, and, importantly, they get used. The cycleways that don’t get used often have one or more of the faults listed above.</p>
      <p>A cycle advocacy group has been uploading photographs of <a href="http://www.warringtoncyclecampaign.co.uk/facility-of-the-month/">“crap cycle lanes”</a> since 2001—the Warrington Cycle Campaign published a 2007 book featuring <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crap-Cycle-Lanes-Warrington-Campaign/dp/1903070589">fifty of the most egregious examples</a>—and while the postings feature the worst of the worst similarly duff cycleways can be found almost everywhere in the U.K.</p>
      <p>The Enfield Facebook rant has been picked up by British tabloids, including <i>The Sun </i>and the <i>Daily Mail</i>. Both depict the incident as a clash between motorists and cyclists. <i>The Sun</i> headlined its report: “Furious motorist berates cyclist for not using £42m bike lane – but who’s in the right?”</p>
      <p>The question was moot: the video clearly shows the motorist committing a public order offense, and the cyclist had every right to be riding where he was riding.</p>
