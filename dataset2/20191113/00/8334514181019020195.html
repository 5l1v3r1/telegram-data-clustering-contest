      <p>The 26-year-old world number five blazed 50 winners, many of them jaw-dropping backhands, to beat the five-time champion 6-7(5) 6-3 7-6(5) in front of a spellbound O2 arena crowd.</p>
      <p>He battled back from 4-1 down in the final set tiebreak to claim a fourth win in five against the 16-time Grand Slam champion and has already booked his semi-final spot.</p>
      <p>“Probably the best match I ever played,” he said. “It was a real classic and epic match which will happen from time to time at these big tournaments.</p>
      <p>“It had everything that a match like this needs. He was up; I was up. He was playing amazing points; I was playing amazing points. It’s only about luck, and it was a little bit more on my side today in the third-set tiebreak.”</p>
      <p>Djokovic played his full part in an exhilarating contest but could not quite match Thiem’s firepower.</p>
      <p>Thiem also made 44 unforced errors but it would be churlish to criticise that tally when he was playing such risky tennis.</p>
      <p>Having never got past the group stage in three previous appearances at the tournament, he has now beaten Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic back-to-back to book his place in the semi-finals and appears to be the man in form.</p>
      <p>“I knew that I had to play like this to beat him. Against everybody who qualified for this tournament here, there is a special effort necessary to win,” said the 26-year-old.</p>
      <p>“I did it against Roger, and I did it also today. Probably Novak is the best player in the world right now, so I had to do something outstanding, something unusual, and that’s what I did.</p>
      <p>“I mean, I was hitting really, really hard.”</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who faces a decisive clash with Federer on Thursday with the loser guaranteed an early exit, was generous in his praise of Thiem.</p>
      <p>“I know that he can play in a high level, but tonight was just phenomenal,” he said. “He just played very courageous tennis and (was) just smacking the ball. He went for broke.”</p>
