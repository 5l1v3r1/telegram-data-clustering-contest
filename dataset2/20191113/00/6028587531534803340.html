      <h1>Highest-Paid Country Acts 2019: Lil Nas X Debuts; Luke Bryan Tops List</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Zack O'Malley Greenburg</a></address>
      <p>T<b>he Country Music Awards</b> are billed as Nashville’s biggest night, but this year’s event buried the genre’s most significant breakthrough of the past 12 months, offering up just one nomination for 20-year-old musician Lil Nas X, whose “Old Town Road” spent a record 19 weeks atop the singles charts.That run helped Lil Nas X notch a different honor, debuting on the <i>Forbes</i> list of top-earning country acts this year with an estimated pretax income of $14 million. The Atlanta native claims the No. 18 spot thanks to the fiendishly catchy country-rap track he released through indie music service Amuse in December 2018. The song clocked 1.8 billion spins by summer despite being <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8530110/inside-the-old-town-road-charts-decision">booted</a> from the <i>Billboard </i>country charts. The snub—and a bevy of remixes—helped “Old Town Road” broaden the genre’s audience more than any track in recent memory. </p>
      <p>“It was on viral charts in countries where no country song has ever positioned itself,” says Amuse cofounder Diego Farias. “Everything from Southeast Asian markets to eastern European markets. I mean, I’m talking about places that you don’t necessarily associate with cowboy hats and boots.”</p>
      <p>Lil Nas X isn’t the only high earner to come up short at the awards ceremony: Luke Bryan claims the top spot on our list for the second consecutive year with $42.5 million but didn’t receive a single nomination. That’s mostly because the Georgia native, who favors baseball caps over cowboy hats, hasn’t put out a new studio album since 2017. Instead, he spent his time grossing more than $1 million per tour stop and serving as a judge on <i>American Idol.</i></p>

      <p>The genre-bending Zac Brown Band ranks second, pulling in $38.5 million on the strength of 50 live performances and a new album, <i>The Owl</i>, which peaked at No. 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album charts. Other crossover acts on the list include Canadian songstress Shania Twain (No. 7 with $29 million) and hip-hop-tinged duo Florida Georgia Line (No. 8 with $26 million).</p>
      <p>“Country’s more of a lifestyle,” the group’s cofounder Brian Kelley <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2015/01/05/country-fireball-inside-the-rise-of-florida-georgia-line/#10cdd1b75997">told</a> <i>Forbes </i>in 2015. “The music’s always going to evolve.”</p>
      <blockquote>“It was on viral charts in countries where no country song has ever positioned itself. Everything from Southeast Asian markets to eastern European markets. I mean, I’m talking about places that you don’t necessarily associate with cowboy hats and boots.”</blockquote>
      <p>Plenty of the CMAs’ stars did make our list, including performers Eric Church (No. 6, $30 million) and Miranda Lambert (No. 20, $13 million), as well as two of the hosts—Dolly Parton (No. 15, $17 million) and Carrie Underwood (No. 14, $16 million). A third host, Reba McEntire, narrowly missed the cut.</p>
      <p>Overall, the top ten acts in country earned $311.5 million, up 2% from last year’s $304.5 million. Our list of the genre’s top earners measures estimated pretax earnings from June 1, 2018, through June 1, 2019. Fees for agents, managers and lawyers are not deducted. Figures are generated with the help of numbers from Nielsen Music, PollstarPro and interviews with industry insiders.</p>
      <p>Although our rankings typically reflect country’s woeful lack of diversity at the top, this year’s list offers at least a glimmer of hope that things are changing. There are 6 women in the top 20—the least lopsided ratio in the seven years <i>Forbes </i>has published the list—and Lil Nas X is both the first openly gay act and the first person of color to make it.</p>
      <p>Though he declined to comment for this story through a representative, Lil Nas X is clearly taking his role as a trailblazer seriously, regardless of how much CMA hardware he takes home. As he <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-48880817">told the BBC</a> earlier this year: “I feel like [I’m] opening doors for more people.”</p>
