      <h1>Southwest tests boarding from rear of planes</h1>

      <p>Many passenger aircraft have two doors, but typically are boarded using only one. Southwest Airlines is experimenting with a new boarding system using both doors that is facilitated by its system of not assigning seats to passengers.</p>
      <p>USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/11/07/southwest-airlines-dual-boarding-sacramento-long-beach-burbank/4122183002/">reports</a> that the airline is testing out the system at several airports, including Sacramento International Airport. A reporter on one flight noted that she was in the airport terminal four minutes after her plane reached her gate despite having a seat in the rear of the aircraft; the quick debarkation was aided by her use of the rear door.</p>
      <p>Southwest officials said that “turn times” — the amount of time it takes to debark passengers at the gate, load new passengers, and depart — have been quicker at airports where the airline can use both aircraft doors to load and unload passengers.</p>
      <p>Passengers using the front door of Southwest’s 737 jets typically debark onto a jetbridge, whereas those who exit from the rear use stairs and have a brief walk across the airport tarmac to the terminal.</p>
      <p>Gate attendants offer travellers the option of boarding from the front or rear; some choose the latter in hopes of getting a preferred seat or bin space for luggage. Passengers are advised, however, not to use the rear door and try to rush to seats in the front of the plane.</p>
