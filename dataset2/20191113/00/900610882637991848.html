      <h1>Aviation industry sceptical about Boeing 737 Max return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sanchita Nambiar</a></address>
      <p>According to industry reports, Boeing’s 737 Max, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/03/14/boeing-737-max-now-grounded-globally/">which was grounded globally following two fatal crashes</a>, is expected to resume flying in January 2020. Final safety checks have been carried out, and the leading aircraft manufacturer is now hoping to get the due clearance before year end.</p>
      <p>However, seems like the global aviation market is not ready for the aircraft return yet. Reuters reported that last month, Boeing took ten new plane orders, but noticed some customers swapping the grounded 737 MAX planes in favour of more expensive wide-body models. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) too has requested some further software changes that Boeing is currently working on.</p>
      <p>As far as the airlines are concerned, many of them have taken MAX out of their flying schedule until March next year. These include American Airlines and Southwest Airlines who have delayed the return of Boeing 737 Max into their fleet.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Indian aviation sector is also unlikely to allow 737 Max in the Indian skies by early next year. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Indian pilots are unsure of the re-certification as very little information has been provided on the new design.</p>
