      <p>They’re often promoted as healthier alternatives to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/smoking">cigarettes</a>, but a recent study has shed new light on the dangers of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/e-cigarettes">e-cigarettes.</a></p>
      <p>Researchers from the University Medical Centre Mainz have revealed that e-cigarettes can damage the brain, heart, blood vessels and lungs - particularly when used by young people.</p>
      <p>In the study, the researchers looked at the effect of e-cigarette vapour on blood flow in the brachial artery in the upper arm in 20 healthy smokers both before and after they vaped.</p>
      <p>The results showed that vaping just once increased the participants’ heart rates and caused their arteries to stiffen.</p>
      <p>In a follow-up study, the researchers then exposed 151 mice to e-cigarette vapour over one, three or five days for 20 minutes, six times a day.</p>

      <p>The results showed that an enzyme called NOX-2 was responsible for damage to the mice’s blood vessels, including those in the lungs and the brain, as a result of e-cigarette vapour.</p>
      <p>Professor Thomas Munzel, who led the study, said: “The results of the present studies identified several molecular mechanisms whereby e-cigarettes can cause damage to the blood vessels, lungs, heart and brain.</p>
      <p>“This is a consequence of toxic chemicals that are produced by the vaping process and may also be present at lower concentrations in the liquid itself.”</p>

      <p>The researchers hope their findings will discourage young people to take up vaping as an alternative to smoking.</p>
      <p>Professor Munzel added: “The e-cigarette epidemic in the US and Europe, in particular among our youth, is causing a huge generation of nicotine-addicted people who are being endangered by encouragement to switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>“Research like ours should serve as a warning about their dangers, and aggressive steps should be taken to protect our children from health risks caused by e-cigarettes."</p>
