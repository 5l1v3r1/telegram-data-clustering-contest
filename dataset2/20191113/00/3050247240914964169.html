      <h1>Bitfinex Looks to Launch Options Trading As Soon As Q1 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:20:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:20</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>According to an executive, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is planning to launch options and a gold-backed stablecoin, among a host of new products.</p>
      <h3>New range of products</h3>
      <p>In a Nov. 12 appearance on the Scoop, Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Bitfinex and Tether, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/46594/bitfinex-to-launch-options-and-gold-backed-stablecoin">told</a> the Block that Bitfinex is considering launching options trading, while also taking a closer look at prospects for a gold-backed stablecoin, dubbed Tether Gold.</p>
      <p>Although Ardoino didn’t reveal any additional details about Tether Gold, he did reveal that the company is currently eyeing a Q1 2020 launch of options tradign, and that they are working with external market makers to ensure liquidity. </p>
      <p>Ardoino further mentioned that Bitfinex will enable its clients to buy a variety of items with cryptocurrency using a gift card. Reportedly, Bitfinex has plans to collaborate with a well-known partner who will provide the gift cards. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>"It's important that people can see the farther value of having cryptocurrencies rather than just trading back and forth between Bitcoin and USD or whatever.”</blockquote>
      <p>Cointelegraph contacted Joe Morgan regarding these latest developments but had yet to receive a response as of press time. This article will be updated if new comments come in.</p>
      <h3>Bitfinex moves $1.5 milion to Bitcoin Sidechain</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of November, Ardoino <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-crypto-exchange-moves-15m-of-stablecoin-to-bitcoin-sidechain">announced</a> that Bitfinex had moved 1 .561 million Tether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tether-price-index">USDT</a>) from the Omni Protocol to the Liquid Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) sidechain. The conversion reportedly increases the quantity of USDT available on the network after the stablecoin was first launched on the Liquid sidechain at the end of July.</p>
      <p>Also in November, Bitfinex abruptly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-cancels-8m-kim-dotcom-ieo-citing-regulatory-clear-risks">canceled</a> its token sale for K.im, Kim Dotcom’s Bitcoin content sharing service. Executives said that they had agreed not to go ahead with the sale, an initial exchange offering with a planned fundraising goal of $8 million, due to the changing face of regulatory scrutiny over such tokens, posing potential difficulties for both issuers and investors.</p>
