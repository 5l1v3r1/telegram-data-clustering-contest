      <p>A photo illustrating the old saying about “grabbing life by the . . . ,” by photographer Sarah Skinner, has been selected as the overall winner of <a href="https://www.comedywildlifephoto.com/">Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</a> and is an invitation to enjoy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/09/11/15-funniest-finalists-of-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-2019/#3239d3d1631c">the lighter side of animal life</a> on our endangered planet.Taken in Botswana, the winning photo shows a cub playing with an adult lion. It’s the thought of what might have happened next that makes it so funny.</p>
      <p>Now, we all know that animals can feel sorrow, guilt, anger, joy and even display a sense of humor. Some can laugh or at least giggle and be nutty and mischievous.</p>
      <p>With wild animals there’s less video evidence than with domestic pets, whose antics swarm the internet. But it’s been demonstrated that apes such as gorillas, bonobos and chimpanzees can chuckle and that rats and dolphins can giggle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2019/05/12/12-humorous-animal-photos-of-2019-comedy-wildlife-photography-awards-first-cut/#61a1450f430c">Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards,</a> celebrates funny antics of animals in the wild and comic scenes in their lives, like the 12 winners of this year’s contest. It’s your turn to decide if some of the protagonists are having fun ‘for real’ or if they have simply been caught in what we consider to be a humorous act by the photographer who happened to be at the right place at the right moment.</p>

      <p>Working with the <a href="https://www.bornfree.org.uk/">Born Free Foundation</a>, CWPA encourages some lighthearted relief at the same time that it aims to highlight the extremely important message of wildlife conservation in an engaging and positive way: raising the profile of endangered species while at the same time triggering a smile. </p>
      <p>“Every little bit helps to get people started on the right road, and you’ve got to start somewhere, right?” the organizers suggest. Here are some tips to help you start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shop responsibly: Try to shop locally and avoid buying unrecyclable products and one-use plastics/packaging.</li>
        <li>Restrict water use at home: Each time you flush the toilet you send some 20 liters of water down the drain. Take shorter showers. Water your garden less. Stop flushing the toilet every single time. These actions will save fresh water that could support our environment as well as supply homes and food for wildlife around the world.</li>
        <li>Become a “Wild Influencer:” This is a special person who may be not a mega activist but really cares about the environment and wants to do something to help.</li>
      </ul>
