      <h1>Shopping complex puts Jogupalya in a twist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Amit Kumar</a></address>
      <p>Traffic jam is a regular sight on one of the city’s busiest road. The Jogupalya main road (Ward No - 89) in Ulsoor faces traffic havoc every day as street vendors have acquired the main road to run their businesses and have blocked the path for free vehicular movement. <br/><br/>Over 50 stalls have been setup by various vendors on the footpath at Jogupalya, forcing pedestrians to walk on the roads. Despite the new Mayor, Gowtham Kumar himself representing the Jogupalya Ward, the hawkers have not been bothered. Several complaints from local residents have also seen no reaction from the concerned authorities. <br/><br/>In a bid to curb the traffic menace, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had constructed a market building to accommodate the street vendors, but failed to shift the hawkers from the main road. Now the market has been turned out into a yoga centre with over 30 yoga enthusiasts in attendance every day.</p>

      <p>The shopping complex for street vendors is now used for conducting Yoga classes in Jogupalya</p>
      <p>“The yoga centre was started two years ago, and Mayor Goutham Kumar, the then corporator himself had inaugurated the centre,” said a resident of Jogupalya. <br/><br/>The street vendors have complained that the space allotted to them at the building centre is not enough. “We are residents of Jogupalya and have been running our businesses on the streets for many years. In 2014, we were promised a space in a building complex by the BBMP officials but that was too small to fit all the street vendors. How can we move there, this is a matter of our bread and butter,” said a vegetable vendor who refused to be named.</p>

      <p>–A street vendor<br/><br/><br/>Some allege that as the vendors belong to the Jogupalya ward, they have not been disturbed as it could have a negative effect on the vote bank of the elected representatives. <br/><br/><br/>When Bangalore Mirror tried to contact Mayor Goutham Kumar, he was unavailable for comment.</p>
