      <p>Money moves across boarders as freely as never before. In today's world, any whisper of war or pugnacious policy and wealth is withdrawn a country, as cash taken from an ATM. There is a very real threat of just that happening in the U.K. if the Labour Party wins the election on December 12th, say business and wealth advisors. The Party’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverwilliams1/2019/11/07/the-uk-election-campaign-will-be-a-battle-over-billionaires/#4500f7024e29">increasingly hostile </a>rhetoric towards wealth, manifest through proposed increases to income and corporation taxes, could see individuals and money leave the U.K.</p>
      <p>"If the wealth taxation initiative is aggressive enough, it will drive affluent investors, of whom many are entrepreneurs, away from the U.K. and subsequently end up as a massive failure," says Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, a London-based investment manager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/john-caudwell/#1d332cfa5e24">John Caudwell</a>, a billionaire and the founder of Phones4U, has already said he would leave the country if Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister. Others could follow.</p>

      <p>"I already have clients planning on leaving the U.K. if Corbyn gets in", James Quarnby, a partner and head of Private Wealth at law firm Stephenson Harwood, told the Henley &amp; Partners Global Citizenship Conference in London. "They are going to Portugal, they are going to Italy. I have hedge fund managers going to Jersey’’.</p>
      <p>The boom in golden visas means that individuals can attain citizenship or residency in other European countries through a simple investment. Italy has created its own version of the U.K.'s non-domicile scheme, and, earlier this month, Greece announced it was following suit with a €100,000 ($111,000) flat tax rate for qualified investors who shift their residence to the country.</p>
      <p>“The wealthy are very mobile; they always have been and always will be”,adds Baluszynski.</p>
      <h3>France's Lesson</h3>
      <p>To doubters of capital flight, many advisers point to France's once 75% wealth tax on earnings above €1 million ($1.1 million). Former president François Hollande was forced to drop the policy in 2017 after an exodus of wealthy individuals and businesses.</p>

      <p>While a wealth tax has not been proposed by the U.K.'s opposition Labour Party, their intended policies include nationalisation of companies in several sectors such as rail and utilities. Public companies will also see 10% of their stock taken from them and put into a fund to benefit workers. Corporation tax would likely rise from its current 19%.</p>
      <p>A <a href="http://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/12081_19-Land-for-the-Many.pdf">report</a> commissioned by the Party recommends increasing capital gains taxes on second homes as well as adding an extra fee if they are left empty.</p>
      <p>Even the private schools (known as "public schools" in the U.K.), where the wealthy send their children will face higher taxes as the Labour Party plans to abolish their charitable status.</p>
      <p>Although opposition parties are trailing in the polls, the prospect of these policies are so unpalatable to many British business owners and wealthy individuals that they are seriously assessing their options. Leaving the country is the most drastic of those being considered, though advisers say that second citizenships are a good “insurance policy”.</p>
      <p>Even if individuals themselves do not leave if Corbyn becomes the next prime minister of the U.K., many advisors say preparations are in place for companies to “re-headquarter” themselves or assets to be liquidated should that happen.</p>
      <p>But many of their clients have seen this all before says Leigh Philpot, head of Client Proposition at Kingswood, a U.K. wealth manager. “We are seeing much less concern from clients about the prospects of a Corbyn government than previously and certainly in the immediate aftermath of the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>"A number of clients were looking to move all of their assets offshore. This is now almost entirely absent. Whether this reflects a greater focus on the Brexit saga or the current poor position of Labour in the opinion poll is unclear. It may well reverse should Labour rally as they did in 2017.”</p>
