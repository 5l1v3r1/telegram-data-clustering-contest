      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/drake">Drake</a> had a few words for his critics after he was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/drake-booed-offstage-at-camp-flog-gnaw-and-tyler-the-creator-responds">booed offstage</a> at the Camp Flog Gnaw music festival.</p>
      <p>In a Monday evening Instagram post, the 33-year-old rapper joked that he'd be performing at the event for years to come.</p>
      <p>"Plot twist...just signed a 10 year residency Camp Flog Gnaw," he teased. "Sorry kids see you EVERY SINGLE YEAR till you are 30."</p>

      <p>The post included three behind-the-scenes photos from Drake's time at the festival, featuring Internet personality Yung Taco.</p>
      <p>The crowd at the festival turned on Drake Sunday, apparently upset that the Toronto-born rapper was performing rather than rumored headliner <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rb-star-frank-oceans-manager-apologizes-for-implying-target-rejected-singers-album-over-his-sexual-orientation">Frank Ocean</a>.</p>

      <p>“You know, Imma tell you, like I said, I’m here for you tonight. If you want me to keep going, I will keep going,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">Drake</a> said onstage. The audience responded with more booing.</p>
      <p>“It’s been love. I love ya. I go by the name of Drake, thank you for having me,” Drake said, ending his set 20 minutes earlier than expected, according to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8543212/drake-booed-off-stage-tyler-the-creator-camp-flog-gnaw-festival">Billboard</a>.</p>
      <p>Following the negative crowd reaction, the festival's creator, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment">Tyler, The Creator</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tylerthecreator/status/1193946903278280704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1193946903278280704&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffpost.com%2Fentry%2Fdrake-claps-back-being-booed_n_5dcaad3fe4b0fcfb7f6cd19d">spoke out on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>“I THOUGHT BRINGING ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARTIST ON THE F---ING PLANET TO A MUSIC FESTIVAL WAS FIRE! BUT FLIPSIDE, A LIL TONE DEAF KNOWING THE SPECIFIC CROWD IT DREW," the tweet read. "SOME CREATED A NARRATIVE IN THEIR HEAD AND ACTED OUT LIKE A--HOLES WHEN IT DIDNT COME TRUE AND I DONT F--- WITH THAT.”</p>

      <p>“Frank Ocean’s new music has been so underwhelming. Def not worth booing Drake off stage. Clowns,” <a href="https://twitter.com/gunclezach/status/1193976203788423168">one user wrote</a> on Twitter.</p>
