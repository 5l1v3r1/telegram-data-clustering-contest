      <p>The biggest transformation in more than 50 years is about to be unleashed on Oxford Street.</p>
      <p>In the next 1,000 days some £2.9billion is set to be spent to "catalyse the birth of a new West End", the New West End Company has said.</p>
      <p>The organisation - which represents Oxford, Bond and Regent Street businesses - said the money will go to ensure Oxford Street and the shops around it retain their place as a global shopping and leisure destination.</p>
      <p>New West End Company chief executive Jace Tyrrell said: "The new deal will see the West End secure ‘International Centre’ status which will lead to a generational shift in how Oxford Street is used.</p>
      <p>"Customers will be so spoilt: the rise of brand temples will offer more than just products but experience and reasons to visit; new green pedestrian spaces will emerge; a super speed Crossrail will connect Heathrow Airport to the West End in less than 30 minutes; a vibrant Oxford Street will allow visitors to experience the very best retail, leisure and hospitality."</p>

      <p>The move to “International Centre” classification is set to be ratified in 2020 - allowing big changes in how businesses can use the street.</p>
      <p>That could mean the arrival of showrooms, cultural spaces, food and leisure activities as well as the traditional shop fronts - and allow community events and evening attractions too.</p>
      <p>A quarter of a billion pounds is set to be spent on two new public piazzas at Oxford Circus and Marble Arch as well as "vastly wider and more comfortable" footpaths.</p>
      <p>Another £1 billion is being spent in new developments and refurbishments on Oxford Street shops.</p>
      <p>Then there's Derwent London’s Soho Place - the first new theatre in the West End for 50 years - alongside Selfridges’ planned permanent cinema in Oxford Street West offering experiences beyond shopping.</p>

      <p>There's also the arrival of Crossrail and the Elizabeth Line in 2021 - meaning Oxford Street is just two hours from Paris and Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>"The next five years will see extraordinary change in the district, more than in the last 50 years," Tyrrell said.</p>
      <p>"We are truly witnessing a transformative moment for the most renowned shopping destination in the world.”</p>
