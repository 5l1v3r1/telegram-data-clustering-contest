      <p>Last week McKinsey released their annual report on the asset management industry. The report, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/beyond-the-rubicon-asset-management-in-an-era-of-unrelenting-change?cid=other-eml-alt-mip-mck&amp;hlkid=bf7a317f0d7b4221a1dd82edf34b81eb&amp;hctky=9284161&amp;hdpid=39d5232e-1536-4f7a-805c-fdb139eb7f96">“Beyond the Rubicon: Asset management in an era of unrelenting change”</a>, continues their recent focus on themes creating a difficult environment: continued challenge to active management of public securities, power shift in favor of distributors and intermediaries, and enduring importance of scale and scope. An interesting new theme is also identified – the emergence of a developing pricing paradigm. McKinsey notes that although pressure on fees has been a consistent theme over the past few years, there was a record decline in fee levels in 2018, bringing the 5 year average decline in management fees to the 6-to-9 percent range. And as fee levels have increased in importance in client purchase decisions, the familiar winning formula of “good performance at a fair price” is now shifting to the new value equation of “good performance at the best price.”</p>
      <p>According to the report, North American assets under management for the year totaled $43 trillion, a 7 percent increase from the previous year, but overall industry profits (excluding alternative investments) fell 3.7 percent from the year before to $42.6 billion.</p>
      <p>Even with this decline in industry profitability, asset management firms have continued the 12 year trend of outperforming other sectors in financial services, the report says. They have achieved faster revenue growth than banks and insurers, while also sustaining margins exceeding 30% during those 12 years.</p>
