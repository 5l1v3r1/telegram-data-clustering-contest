      <p>Hamburg - Hamburger Hafen und Logistik AG, HHLA, the company that operates <b>three out of four of Hamburg’s container terminals</b>, continued its positive performance in the first nine months of 2019.</p>
      <p>According to its press release, the company recorded another significant increase in revenue and saw strong growth in its operating result. Container throughput increased moderately due to the successful <b>integration of the Estonian terminal operator HHLA TK Estonia</b>, which was acquired last year, and improved slightly at the Hamburg terminals.</p>
      <p>A significant rise in container transport was achieved. Including a significant increase in revenue from the Logistics segment and <b>a once again moderate increase in revenue from property management</b>, this led to total revenue of € 1,044.6 million (+ 8.3 percent). The operating result (EBIT) improved strongly by € 19.3 million, or 12.4 percent, to € 175.4 million. The positive effects of the initial application of IFRS 16 in the EBIT amounted to approximately € 10.6 million.</p>
      <p>“As encouraging as our business trend is this year, we must still keep a realistic view of the <b>changing conditions </b>in which we operate,” said Angela Titzrath, Chairwoman of HHLA’s Executive Board. “The challenges facing the entire transport and logistics industry remain significant. We are approaching these challenges with confidence and vigour and are continuing to work towards our aim and mission of making HHLA ready for the future.”</p>
      <p>The listed Port Logistics subgroup recorded an <b>8.6 percent increase in revenue </b>to € 1,020.2 million in the first nine months. It was able to grow its operating result (EBIT) by 13.3 percent to € 162.7 million. The EBIT margin improved by 0.6 percentage points to 15.9 percent.</p>
