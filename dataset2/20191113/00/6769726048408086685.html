      <h1>Cardinal Pell gets another day in court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:52:46+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:52</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>CARDINAL George Pell has been granted a last-gasp bid for freedom after the High Court agreed to hear appeal arguments against his child sexual abuse conviction.</p>
      <p>Justices James Edelman and Michelle Gordon on Wednesday agreed the matter be referred to a full court of the High Court “for argument as on an appeal”.</p>
      <p>It is understood the decision paves the way for the court to make one of three decisions, which would be delivered in a single judgment or order:<br/>* Refuse special leave.<br/>* Grant special leave and dismiss the appeal.* Grant special leave and allow the appeal.</p>
      <p>Pell, 78, was found guilty by a jury of the rape of a 13-year-old choirboy and sexual assault of another at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996, but he has always denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The Victorian Court of Appeal in August upheld a jury verdict convicting Pell in a 2-1 ruling.</p>
      <p>Pell is serving a six-year jail term and is ineligible for parole until he has served three years and eight months of his sentence.</p>
      <p>The High Court matter is expected to be heard in 2020.</p>
