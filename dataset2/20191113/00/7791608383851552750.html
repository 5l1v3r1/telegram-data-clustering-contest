      <h1>Artists At A Brooklyn Art Fair Offered To Draw Naked Portraits Of Participants</h1>

      <p><b>The sixth edition</b> of The Other Art Fair was held in Brooklyn, with a daring project known as <i>Get Nude Get Drawn</i>. The project sought willing participants to pose naked for artists, and in return they took home a free nude portrait of themselves. <br/><b>Artists Mike Perry</b> (animator for <i>Broad City</i>) and Josh Cochran were behind the project. Back in 2011, they held a similar event where models on Craigslist took part in a two-day nude portrait sketch that eventually produced hundreds of drawings in two 12-hour sessions, per <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/youre-willing-get-naked-artists-brooklyn-art-fair-will-draw-portrait-1698051?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Artnet</i></a>. <br/><b>Perry also told</b> the publication that the artists had many opportunities to sketch a variety of people, from “exhibitionist” types to their artist friends, and even a “pregnant art director.” <br/><b>He added that</b> he began “figure drawing” at the age of 15, and found out more “about humanity” each time he sketched the human body. Cochran also saw his sketches as a way to find “new ways” of “working and seeing.” <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The artists</b> constructed a private studio to be used for their project at the fair, and have decided to keep the poses short so models do not find it too challenging. Perry explained that a prolonged pose might cause one’s quads to “shiver” and sweat to “drip down.” <br/><b>Eight other artists</b> also participated in the project. Every model received one nude portrait drawn by each artist. The remaining works were showcased at the fair, and cost US$20 each. <br/><b>The Other Art Fair</b> took place from 7 to 10 November this year.
