      <p>Nominations for the upcoming Grammy nominations aren’t slated to be announced until November 20, but the Recording Academy works months in advance, and the long list of potential nominees for one of the most prestigious awards was leaked some time ago.The roll call features well over 100 acts, all of whom are vying for one of the eight spots in one of the most competitive races in the industry, and a single name stands out from the bunch as one that could make history if it ends up being featured.</p>
      <p>Blackpink, one of the most successful K-pop girl groups of all time, has <a href="https://hitsdailydouble.com/critics_choice&amp;id=318094">reportedly</a> been selected as a potential Best New Artist nominee. The odds may not be in their favor of earning a nod (to say nothing of actually winning), as they face tough competition from breakout stars like Lizzo, Lewis Capaldi, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Nas X and the presumptive winner, Billie Eilish. The K-pop quartet doesn’t need to take home the trophy in order to claim a major victory, they just need to be included.</p>
      <p>If Blackpink is one of the eight lucky finalists, they will make history as the first K-pop act to be nominated for Best New Artist at the Grammys. In fact, it appears they would be the first K-pop group nominated for the biggest honor in music in any category (BTS’s album <i>Love Yourself: Tear</i> was up for a prize last time around, but it was an art director who was credited, not the musicians themselves).</p>
      <p>While there are many artists who deserve to be nominated for Best New Artist later this year, there is a case to be made that Blackpink not only has the artistic chops, but the numbers to back up that they are about to break in a huge way. Their recent EP <i>Kill This Love</i> peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 back in April, and it’s lead single (of the same name) barely missed sneaking into the top 40 on the Hot 100, stalling at No. 41. Not long ago, their previous smash “"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du,” one of their three Hot 100 hits, was certified gold by the RIAA, making them one of only a few K-pop figures who have received that recognition in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Grammy voters, who typically skew older, might not be too familiar with Blackpink and their work, but they may take this as an opportunity to rectify past mistakes. K-pop has been skipped over time and time again at the awards, and even names like BTS and Psy, both of whom scored undeniable hits and moved millions of albums and singles, never earned proper recognition.</p>
      <p>Fans of Blackpink might not want to get too excited just yet, but the fact that they have been ruled eligible is an encouraging sign, even if it only suggests people in the industry are paying attention.</p>
