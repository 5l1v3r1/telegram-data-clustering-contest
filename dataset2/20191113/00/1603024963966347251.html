      <p>Samsung is rumoured to launch its Galaxy A-series 2020 early next year. Amongst the next-generation Galaxy A-series smartphones, the Galaxy A51 is the most-leaked smartphone so far.</p>
      <p>The latest report has released some press renders that reveal the Galaxy A51’s design and some specifications.</p>
      <p>Popular tipster OnLeaks, in collaboration with the website Pricebaba, has <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-images-punch-hole-display-quad-cameras-exclusive">shared</a> 5K renders of the  Samsung Galaxy A51. The renders, along with the 360-degree video, reveal the design and specifications of the Galaxy A51.</p>
      <p>On the front, the Galaxy A51 will have a Galaxy Note 10-like punch-hole display. The earpiece is located on the top edge above the punch-hole.</p>

      <p>At the bottom edge, there’s the 3.5mm headphone jack, a USB Type-C port and speaker grille. The power and volume buttons are located on the right corner, making room for the SIM-tray on the left edge.</p>
      <p>The rear panel houses a quad-camera setup, as <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/leak-suggests-2020-samsung-galaxy-a-series-smartphones-would-feature-up-to-108mp-camera-sensor-4342231.html">previously reported</a>. There is no rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, so we can expect the Galaxy A51 to feature an in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>Past reports claim that Galaxy A51 will have an L-shaped quad-camera setup, which falls in line with OnLeaks’ renders. The Galaxy A51 is said to get a 32MP primary camera with a 12MP wide-angle lens, a 12MP 2x optical zoom lens and a 5MP depth sensor.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the display, the Galaxy A51 will reportedly get a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display. The phone will also come packed with a 4,000 mAh battery and will boot on Android 10 based One UI 2.0 out-of-the-box, according to the DroidShout report.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy A51 with the model number SM-A515F allegedly visited the Geekbench website. The listing revealed it would get powered by Samsung’s in-house Exynos 9611 Octa-core SoC clocked at 1.74GHz. The same processor is found on the recently-launched Galaxy A50s and Galaxy M30s.</p>
      <p>Samsung has reportedly begun the <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/samsung-has-begun-the-production-of-galaxy-a51-in-india-report-4593651.html">Galaxy A51 production at its Greater Noida</a> facility.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
