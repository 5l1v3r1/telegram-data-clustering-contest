      <h1>One year on since Calgary 2026 plebiscite, city's Olympic legacy in flux</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:42:39+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:42</time> by <a rel="author">Sammy Hudes</a></address>
      <p>A year after Calgarians said ‘no’ to the 2026 Winter Games, leaders in the city’s sporting community say they fear Calgary’s Olympic legacy is at risk of continuing to fade.</p>
      <p>Around 56 per cent of voters in last year’s plebiscite <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/what-went-wrong-pro-olympic-organizers-pick-up-pieces-after-pricey-campaign-fails-to-win-over-calgarians">rejected moving forward</a> with a bid for the Games, which were later awarded to Milan-Cortina, Italy.</p>
      <p>Three months later, WinSport <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/winsport-warns-sliding-track-could-close-indefinitely-without-more-money-for-upgrades">announced it would shutter its sliding track</a> — used for bobsled, skeleton and luge — indefinitely, halting plans for renovations due to a funding shortfall. The organization said the project was $8 million shy without funds that would have flowed through a bid for the 2026 Olympics.</p>
      <p>So far, $17 million has been secured from the provincial and federal governments for upgrades.</p>
      <p>“The legacy was tremendously successful, but the simple fact is it’s end of life, so we are very much at a crossroads,” said WinSport president and CEO Barry Heck.</p>
      <p>Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton president Sarah Storey said the track closure has already been challenging for competitors in the sliding sports.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that the closure of the track is going to impact our ability to develop those elite athletes and bring home more medals for Canada, but that’s really only part of the story,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This is about the athletes, the coaches, the medical staff, the people who work on the track. This very much has been part of the evolution of Calgary’s community.”</p>

      <p>Since hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics, Storey said Calgarians have benefited from a “special legacy” through sporting facilities such as the track, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/winsport-faces-8m-funding-gap-to-renovate-sliding-track">which will require upgrades</a> as the years pass.</p>
      <p>“Calgary has done such an excellent job of making it part of the fabric of the community that I think sometimes people take that for granted,” she said.</p>
      <p>Calling it “a long game,” Heck said government funding is the only option to cover the remaining costs of the track project, as well as other capital upgrades needed at Canada Olympic Park.</p>
      <p>“It’s no different than building community sport arenas and swimming pools,” he said. “When you’re part of the social fabric and a charity in and of itself, you can’t do it without public funding.”</p>
      <p>Heck called the proposed 2026 bid a “silver bullet” that would have prevented the situation in which WinSport now finds itself.</p>
      <p>“There’s no denying that without the catalyst of these Games that the legacy and Calgary’s standing as a world-class Olympic level hub is at risk,” said Heck.</p>
      <p>“It’s under fire, but it’s up to all of us working together to do what we can to preserve it in whatever form that looks like going forward.”</p>
      <p>But Jason Ribeiro, who was a community organizer for the pro-bid group Yes Calgary 2026, said Calgary’s reputation as a winter sports city “is still entirely within our wheelhouse.”</p>
      <p>“I think just because voters said no . . . to this particular decision, what I heard often was that doesn’t mean we’re not a sports city and we don’t like being active and we don’t like being on the world stage,” he said.</p>

      <p>Ribeiro said he still believes amateur sport and recreation is a worthy priority, particularly at the municipal level, but that he follows an “adapt or die philosophy.”</p>
      <p>“I’m open about thinking about our infrastructure priorities, thinking about what we can reasonably fund and making tough choices about where we see the best high growth potential and where we allocate funds,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If our conversations continue to be about re-creating something from the past . . . then I think we’re not playing the right game.”</p>
      <p>Seyi Smith, who competed for Canada in bobsled at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, said he moved to Calgary specifically because of the sports facilities and other resources the city offers.</p>
      <p>“From a grassroots perspective, there’s going to be less people getting involved in sliding sports in Calgary,” he said, adding athletes will have to move to Whistler — home of Canada’s only other such facility — to train.</p>
      <p>“If this track situation doesn’t get solved, then you just can’t slide in Calgary,” he said. “If that dies away, I guess we just move on. There will be another hub of sport in Western Canada, whether it’s Vancouver or somewhere else.”</p>

      <p>Since 1988, Luge Canada executive director Tim Farstad said there’s only been a handful of years that Canada didn’t host a world cup event in the sport.</p>
      <p>With the track closed, the 2020 Luge World Championships, which were to be held in Calgary, have been relocated west. Such events bring in upwards of 250 people for weeks at a time, he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of money that comes to Calgary from being an international sport capital,” said Farstad.</p>
      <p>“It’s like if you had two ice rinks in Canada for hockey and suddenly you took one away, and now everyone’s got to go to Whistler.”</p>
      <p>Since last year’s plebiscite, Farstad said he’s grown concerned about Calgary’s future as a centre for amateur sport.</p>
      <p>“I was very surprised by the vote. I’ve lived here for a long time and I always thought Calgary is the Olympic city,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a different feel here now, a different feeling that sports isn’t as strong as it used to be.”</p>
