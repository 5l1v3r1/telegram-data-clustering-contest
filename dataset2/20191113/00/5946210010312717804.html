      <h1>Crazy for Trump: On the G.O.P. Plan to Keep Impeachment Partisan</h1>
      <h2>The hearings open with diplomatic gravitas—and nutty conspiracy theories.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/susan-b-glasser" target="_blank">Susan B. Glasser</a></address>
      <p>It didn’t take long for the crazy to start. Even before the first two witnesses in the public impeachment hearings of Donald Trump had been sworn in to testify at the House Intelligence Committee Wednesday morning, the panel’s top Republican, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/devin-nunes">Representative Devin Nunes</a>, was going on about various <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-invention-of-the-conspiracy-theory-on-biden-and-ukraine">conspiracy theories</a>. First, he talked about a “three-year-long operation by the Democrats, the corrupt media, and partisan bureaucrats to overturn the results of the 2016 election.” A few sentences later in his opening remarks, he mentioned an alleged Democratic plot to obtain “nude pictures of Trump” from Russia. Soon after that, he blasted the Democrats for creating a “cult-like atmosphere” in their private depositions of witnesses.</p>
      <p>None of it had anything to do with the matter at hand in the House’s impeachment investigation—President Trump’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-mounting-scandal-over-what-trump-said-to-ukraines-president">pressure campaign</a> to force Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit his personal political interests. Nor had a single word yet been uttered by either George Kent or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/william-taylors-unspinnable-testimony-against-donald-trump">William Taylor</a>, Jr., the career diplomats who sat waiting patiently to testify in the storied but frigid House committee room, where the impeachment hearings—only the fourth in American history—will take place over the next two weeks. Still, Nunes attacked both their integrity and that of the State Department, accusing them of “undermining the President” “who they are supposed to be serving,” along with people in the F.B.I. and the Justice Department who launched the earlier <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mueller-investigation">Mueller investigation</a> of Trump and Russia’s 2016 election interference. The message from Nunes was confusing, in that it did not make sense to anyone who had not been tracking the murky conspiracies reported on by Fox News and an array of conservative Web sites. But, at the same time, Nunes was making a simple, easily understandable point: This impeachment is a nefarious plot against the President. The details don’t matter, whether it be the specifics of “the Russia hoax” or “its low-rent Ukrainian sequel,” as Nunes called it.</p>
      <p>But, oh, those details. There were many of them in the subsequent six hours of testimony by Kent and Taylor, and they are increasingly difficult for even Trump’s most ardent defenders to explain away. From the moment that the two diplomats were sworn in, soon after 10:30 <i>A.M</i>., it was clear they came from a different world than that of Nunes and Trump, a world where America’s actions have consequences beyond the public spectacle that our politics have become. Both Kent and Taylor appeared to have travelled to the hearing in a time machine from America’s recent past. They oozed rectitude and establishment expertise as they recounted their amazement and dismay at discovering Trump’s plot to withhold congressionally appropriated aid from Ukraine and a coveted <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/a-ukrainian-push-for-a-white-house-visit-gave-trump-leverage-over-volodymyr-zelensky">Oval Office meeting</a> from Ukraine’s new President, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>, unless he agreed to investigations into the former Vice-President <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and his son <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign">Hunter</a>, as well as a debunked conspiracy theory, à la Nunes, that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that actually meddled in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
      <p>Taylor’s voice bore such a resemblance to that of Walter Cronkite that the late CBS anchor’s name was soon trending on Twitter. Kent’s bow tie and three-piece suit seemed straight out of the Truman era. Both men insisted, with wonkish precision, on substance, offering a master class on Ukraine and the stakes involved in withholding American military assistance, as Trump tried to do, from a struggling democracy that has lost fourteen thousand of its citizens fighting Russian aggression on its territory. Taylor, who is now the senior diplomat in Kiev, since Trump fired the previous ambassador this spring, spoke of visiting the Ukrainian front line in the Donbass, in Eastern Ukraine, just last week, on a day when one Ukrainian soldier died and four were injured. This is where the nearly four hundred million dollars in military aid that Trump held up was going.</p>
      <p>Taylor—a silver-haired Vietnam veteran who had been called back into service by the Trump Administration and had reluctantly accepted an assignment he knew to be fraught with politics—looked and sounded like a Hollywood version of an American ambassador as he recounted his own incredulous, dawning awareness of what he memorably called the “irregular policy channel” that took over from the regular policy channel in Ukraine at Trump’s direction. Partway through his opening statement, Taylor offered the major news of the day, revealing that one of his aides had come forward to tell Taylor about a call he had overheard between the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-own-donor-diplomat-blows-up-his-impeachment-defense">Gordon Sondland</a>, and Trump. The President could be heard inquiring about the investigations he had been seeking from Ukraine. After the call, Taylor testified, when Taylor’s aide asked Sondland what the President had said, “Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden” than Ukraine.</p>
      <p>It was powerful, serious, damning. Seven times in his opening statement, Taylor said that he found the events “concerning.” He called them “alarming.” He told one of his congressional questioners that he had never, in his decades in the Foreign Service, seen any other example of American policy being changed by a President in order to benefit his personal interests. And yet, somehow, the country still heard only what it wanted to hear. Many of those who watched were comparing Taylor with Cronkite, but the days when one gravelly-voiced anchor could shape how Americans heard the news are long gone. As Taylor read his testimony, MSNBC highlighted Taylor’s concerns about what he had called the “crazy” plan to withhold aid from Ukraine and his “clear understanding” of the linkage Trump had made between that aid and the investigations. On Fox News, meanwhile, a graphic simply displayed Trump’s talking points about Taylor, saying that the President had dismissed the diplomat, his own Administration’s choice for the job, as a “Never Trumper” and noting that the White House had called his testimony “hearsay.” The Fox graphic made no mention of what that testimony was.</p>
      <p>There seemed to be little appetite on the part of Trump’s defenders to actually argue the facts. Nowhere in his opening statement had Nunes so much as mentioned Trump’s case for himself, which is that his actions toward Ukraine were not only proper but “perfect.” As the rest of the long day wound on, not a single Republican made the case for Presidential perfection. Instead, they decided on a safer course: trying to convince the country to tune out. Taylor’s testimony wasn’t dramatic, they said; it was a snooze. At midday, the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, tweeted that the “sham hearing” was both “boring” and a waste of taxpayer money. Representative Mark Meadows, one of Trump’s closest allies, had been sitting in the committee room for the morning session, and he, too, came out to tell reporters that he didn’t think it amounted to anything. “I don’t know about you, but it’s hard for me to stay awake and listen to all of this,” Meadows said. Soon, Trump appeared before the cameras. First, he said that he was “too busy” to watch the hearings, then he proceeded to comment on them in detail.</p>
      <p>Wherever this impeachment is headed, it was hard to find even Republicans who thought that the first session of the hearings was good for the President. On Fox News, the anchor Chris Wallace, well known for his sharp-edged questioning of politicians from both parties, called Taylor a “very impressive” witness and his testimony “very damaging” toward Trump, though the Fox Web site was more skeptical. “<i>Bombshell or hearsay?</i>” its headline read. Over at the Washington <i>Post</i>, the bombshell interpretation carried the day. “<i>New Testimony ties Trump more directly to Ukraine pressure</i> campaign” its headline said.</p>
      <p>The Republican playbook here is a time-honored one: delay, deny, obfuscate, and, if that fails, beg Americans to turn off the TV. In his opening statement, the House Intelligence chairman, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/trump-impeachment-hearing-adam-schiff-emphasizes-the-constitutional-stakes">Adam Schiff</a>, had contended that there was not much debate over the facts. Throughout the long day, I did not hear much, if any. Although they are very different Presidents faced with very different accusations, this was the case with the impeachment of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-bill-clinton-and-how-presidents-view-impeachment">Bill Clinton</a>, too—a proceeding that began in the House of Representatives almost twenty-one years ago to the day. In Clinton’s case, it was pretty clear all along that the President had had an affair with his former intern, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/still-here-2">Monica Lewinsky</a>, and lied about it under oath. The issue was what, if anything, Congress should do about it.</p>
      <p>In this case, Trump is accused of what appears to be a much more serious abuse of the power of his office to extort a foreign leader into acting in the President’s personal interest, rather than the national interest. “If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?” Schiff asked. Ultimately, this is what the debate will come down to, when the articles of impeachment are drawn up, and when the Senate has to deal with the President’s conduct in a trial. Trump appears to have done what he is accused of doing. The question is whether any Republicans will join Democrats in arguing that it is impeachable and warrants his removal from office.</p>
      <p>Faced with this, Republicans have been left making endless arguments about an unfair process, calling it a sham, a star chamber, a kangaroo court. At Wednesday’s hearing, they pointed out, correctly, that neither Taylor nor Kent directly interacted with Trump and that they had received their information about the scheme secondhand, from people like Sondland, who were dealing with the President. But the hearsay argument seems weak and certainly not designed to last: Sondland will testify next week, and he is a key witness, a political appointee of the President who has admitted, if apparently reluctantly, that Trump sought to make American policy toward Ukraine conditional on Zelensky doing “everything” Trump wanted. The reason that there is not more direct evidence yet of Trump’s actions is that the President has ordered his aides not to testify or to participate in any way in the impeachment inquiry. His demand did not stop the two career diplomats and the other witnesses who will appear in the coming days from defying his order and complying with the House’s subpoena, but, when it comes to the political loyalists who surround the President, the stonewalling has—so far—worked.</p>
      <p>Five hours into the hearing, Jim Jordan, the combative Ohio Republican who had just been assigned a seat on the House Intelligence Committee a few days earlier, in order to participate in the questioning, unintentionally captured the absurdity of the situation. Jordan, having given up even the pretense of asking the long-suffering witnesses Kent and Taylor a question, was going off about the many injustices of the impeachment process, a “whole darn sham,” including the Democrats’ refusal to call the anonymous intelligence-community <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-is-trump-obsessed-with-outing-the-whistle-blower">whistle-blower</a>, whose complaint triggered the investigation in the first place. Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, followed Jordan, and he quickly responded to him. “I’d say to my colleague, I’d be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify. President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there,” Welch said, to laughter in the committee room. It was one light moment in a heavy day but a reminder, too, that partisanship is a self-fulfilling prophecy in this impeachment proceeding. Donald Trump, a partisan President for a partisan time, cannot have it any other way.</p>
