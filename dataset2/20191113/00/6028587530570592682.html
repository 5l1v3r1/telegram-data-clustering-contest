      <p>Right now we live in a universe swimming with stars, full of life, warmth, and vitality. It's a beautiful place to live in - well, it's the <i>only</i> place to live in because there's only one universe, but it also happens to be beautiful, which is nice.There's all sorts of stars out there. Big giant red ones. Big giant blue ones. Little red ones. Medium white ones like our son. Like the lights on a Christmas tree, these stars shine for billions of years, giving off the heat and light that illuminate our cosmos.</p>
      <p>But as our universe ages, some strange things will begin to appear. Some creatures that seem impossible now will slowly start to emerge in the far distant future.</p>
      <p>Stars live by fusing elements deep in their cores, and the biggest stars are able to fuse the heaviest elements. When they die, they explode in extremely violent and mildly gory deaths, spilling their ashes all over their vicinities, which eventually ends up dispersing throughout the galaxy, finding its way inside of new generations of stars.</p>
      <p>Generation after generation in our universe, stars go from a mix of almost pure hydrogen and helium to getting a higher and higher proportion of heavier elements.</p>
      <p>And while they donâ€™t play a large role now, in the far distant future when these heavier elements become more commonplace inside of stars, they can mess with their fusion reactions. In particular, a lot of iron inside a star can lower the temperature needed to make fusion occur. With a lower temperature threshold, stars can become smaller and smaller, not needing as much gravitational weight to ignite fusion in their cores.</p>
      <p>Eventually, trillions of years from now, we'll get to the point where some stars can be born with such small size that they can have nuclear fusion occurring in their cores but radically lower temperatures on their surface. As in, temperatures low enough to allow water to settle as ice on the surfaces.</p>
      <p>They're called Frozen Stars. And while they're impossible now, it's only a matter of time before they appear.</p>
