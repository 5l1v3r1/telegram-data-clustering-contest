      <p>Netflix must have faith in upcoming fantasy epic <i>The Witcher. </i>The streaming TV show, based on the books by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski, is already confirmed for a second season. That’s great news for fans and for star Henry Cavill who plays the lead, Geralt of Rivia.</p>
      <p>Cavill is a big fan of the books and the video games, apparently, and stars alongside Freya Allan as Ciri, Anya Chalotra as Yennefer and Anna Shaffer as Triss–not to mention his trusty steed(s) Roach.</p>
      <p><i>The Witcher </i>looks terrific–a fantasy-horror-monster-hunting-epic that’s quite a bit different than something like <i>Game Of Thrones, </i>but should appeal to the same audience.</p>
      <p>Netflix revealed on Twitter today that new episodes would land in 2021:</p>
      <p>I don’t know how you can carry a season on a horse, but okay funny guys at Netflix. I’m digging the two swords–steel for humans, silver for monsters.</p>
      <p>Here’s the Season 1 trailer #2:</p>
      <p>I get shivers each time I watch this trailer. I’m beyond hyped. I just wish Netflix didn’t release all these at once so I could do weekly episodic reviews, and we could all stand around having amazing water cooler conversations about the latest episode, and eagerly await the following week’s.</p>
      <p><i>C’est la vie. </i>Binge-watching is fun, too. <i>The Witcher </i>hits Netflix the same day as <i>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker </i>lands in theaters: December 20th, 2019. Happy Holidays, you filthy animals.</p>
