      <h1>James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher Will Square Off Again on ‘Jeopardy!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:30:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Jacobs</a></address>
      <p>He was a record-setting “Jeopardy!” giant who captured the imagination of fans earlier this year with his high-value bets and complete domination of the game. She was the only player who could beat him.</p>
      <p>Now comes the sequel. This week, James Holzhauer and Emma Boettcher will face each other again, this time in the final round of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/arts/television/james-holzhauer-jeopardy-tournament.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fjulia-jacobs&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=collection">the show’s Tournament of Champions</a>.</p>
      <p>Each won their semifinal round that aired this week, with only about $500 separating their final scores: Boettcher won the Monday’s game with $29,601, and Holzhauer ended up with $30,156 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Five months ago, Holzhauer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/arts/television/james-holzhauer-jeopardy.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">a sports bettor</a> from Las Vegas, had a shot at surpassing the $2.52 million Ken Jennings won during his record 74-game winning streak in 2004. But in Holzhauer’s 33rd game, Boettcher, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/arts/television/emma-boettcher-jeopardy.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">a Chicago-based librarian</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/arts/television/james-holzhauer-jeopardy.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">dethroned him</a> and reaped <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryScarf/status/1194005405917204484">game show glory</a>. She went on to win the next two games, losing the third.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer and Boettcher will go up against a third finalist, to be determined in Wednesday’s semifinal, in a two-game match that will air on Thursday and Friday. The winner, determined by the highest total for the two games, will take home $250,000. The runner-up will win $100,000 and the third-place finisher gets $50,000.</p>
      <p>During his 32-game streak, Holzhauer, 35, set the record for the most money won in a single episode and then surpassed that total three more times. (The new record, which he set on April 17, is $131,127.) Holzhauer’s statistics far exceeded those of the other players in the Tournament of Champions, a regular “Jeopardy!” event in which recent big winners compete against one another. Close watchers of the show had debated online whether Boettcher’s winnings, which amounted to just under $100,000, were low for a champions contestant. Some fans speculated that the show chose her for the potential ratings bump that would come with a rematch.</p>
      <p>After Boettcher’s semifinals win aired on Monday, Holzhauer tweeted a photo of Boettcher’s triumphant smile, poking fun at her detractors. Boettcher, 27, had carefully and intensively trained for the show, tracking her success with clues in a notebook and building the confidence it took to bet large Daily Double wagers.</p>
      <p>Boettcher’s semifinal was also notable for a competitor’s answer that <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeopardy/status/1194102519229628416">made the longtime “Jeopardy!” host</a> Alex Trebek — who revealed in March that he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer — choke up. The contestant, Dhruv Gaur, a Brown University student, responded to the Final Jeopardy item about famous phrases with a response that was clearly incorrect, but sweet: “What is we &lt;3 you, Alex!”</p>
      <p>His voice cracking, Trebek responded, “That’s very kind of you,” and went on to tell Gaur, who had no chance of winning, that the response would cost him $1,995.</p>
      <p>In September, Trebek said he was undergoing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/arts/alex-trebek-cancer.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline">a new round of chemotherapy</a>. A spokeswoman for “Jeopardy!” said the show is currently taping episodes and that Trebek, 79, is hosting as usual.</p>
      <p>In the episode that aired on Tuesday, all of the contestants, including Holzhauer, responded incorrectly to a <a href="https://thejeopardyfan.com/2019/11/todays-final-jeopardy-november-12-2019.html">Final Jeopardy clue about United States demographics</a>. Holzhauer, who in typical fashion had already put the game out of reach, wagered only a few hundred dollars, ensuring that he would come out on top and return for the final round.</p>
