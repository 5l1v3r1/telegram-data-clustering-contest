      <p>Zomato's biggest shareholder, Info Edge, has said that the food delivery platform cut its monthly expenditures to Rs 143 crore ($20 million), The Times of India <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/zomato-cuts-monthly-burn-to-20m-says-top-investor/articleshow/72030324.cms">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>This is a significant reduction of around 44 percent from the company's Rs 322 crore ($32 million) March spend. The cut was managed despite the start-up expanding operations across 500 more Indian cities, it noted.</p>
      <p>After announcing its September quarter earnings, Sanjeev Bikhchandani, the co-founder of Info Edge. told analysts that cutting down on discounts and instances of people abusing discounts, and reducing marketing spend brought down the monthly expenditure.</p>

      <p>He added that Zomato would continue to reduce monthly spend and increase volumes. It will be a tough fight as Bengaluru-based rival Swiggy is going all-out at $40-50 million per month to gobble market share.</p>
      <p>According to Bikhchandani, Amazon’s planned entry into the food delivery space and said that Zomato is “well-positioned to protect its market” as food delivery differs from any other product delivery due to its shelf-life.</p>
      <p>“While we are obviously watching the interest (by Amazon in food delivery), we are confident Zomato will continue to grow and defend its turf,” he added.</p>
      <p>Info Edge holds 26 percent majority stake in the Gurugram-based food start-up.</p>
      <p>Zomato expanded its food delivery services to 500 cities across states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Daman, Meghalaya and Maharashtra, among others. It has arrangements with 1.5 lakh restaurant partners and a delivery fleet of 2.3 lakh partners.</p>
      <p>Zomato CEO Food Delivery Mohit Gupta said the company's emerging cities now contributed 40 percent to business.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
