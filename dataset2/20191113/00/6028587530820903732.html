      <p>Almost precisely one year from Disney CEO Robert Iger’s Disney+ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/disneys-new-netflix-rival-will-be-called-disney-plus-and-launch-late-2019.html">announcement</a>, the entertainment giant launched its ballyhooed streaming service this week. With several other new entrants in the wings from NBCUniversal’s Peacock to Warner Media’s HBO Max, what kind of pathway has Disney+ forged for these erstwhile competitors? The lessons are there for the taking.  <b>Keep your content promises</b></p>
      <p>Disney+ unquestionably delivers on what a consumer would expect to find from Disney. First you have the iconic Disney animated princess collection – from Beauty and the Beast to The Little Mermaid to Cinderella and more. But it is hardly limited to the traditional notion of what was once the Disney brand. There are five category “buttons” that sit atop the Disney+ app, and four of them represent strategic acquisitions by Disney over the last 10 years: Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars (from Lucasfilm) and National Geographic (from Fox). You couldn’t expect much more as two other crown jewels have their own streaming outlets: ESPN launched ESPN+ roughly 18 months ago, and FX, one of the key cable brands acquired from Fox, will be a direct OTT producer for Hulu.</p>
      <p>I once heard Netflix’s Ted Sarandos say of that service: “We don’t have everything there is to watch, but there is always something to watch.” When it comes to Disney’s content assets, Disney+ provides much the same. No, there are no dark, violent thrillers here. But who would expect that from Disney+? This is a fair test of any other media brand: does your OTT offering provide the consumer with the depth and breadth of your content that they logically would expect to find?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leverage all your promotional assets</b>
      </p>
      <p>We live in a world of information saturation and it’s often very difficult to break through that clutter to deliver your marketing messages. But you would have had to be in self-imposed news blackout for most of the last year to have missed the Disney+ launch. As Disney execs I spoke to made clear, Disney put the full weight of its promotional might behind this effort. Whether you were glued to ESPN sports events or heading to a Disney theme park during the period of run-up to the Disney+ launch you couldn’t miss what was coming.</p>
      <p>Unlike Disney, Apple didn’t have its own broadcast and cable networks or a suite of theme parks around the world to promote the AppleTV+ launch, but it does have a dominant smartphone ecosystem. For Disney’s media competitors, who have far more of their own media assets to rely upon, the lesson here is that you can’t afford to have internal battles about the dedication of promotional resources to your own direct-to-consumer launch. Like the “Boys in the Boat,” every element of your company needs to be rowing in the same direction.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lean into nostalgia - it drives consumer behavior</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t have any “kids” in my house by the conventional demographic measurement. But there was a heavy dose of loving childhood media memories flowing in our family at the launch of Disney+, and judging by the 10 million subscribers day one, I don’t think we are alone. I don’t want to in any way dismiss the importance of original programming, and certainly Disney spared little expense in creating the new Star Wars’ series <i>The Mandalorian</i>. AppleTV+ is nothing but originals, but that’s a problem rather than a benefit. The connective tissue between consumers and content libraries is going to play a significant role. Remember that the future envisioned by Disney+ and its new media company-backed competitors is one in which they need to reach millions of consumers who are cord-cutters or more likely cord-nevers. For those folks it doesn’t matter if some of the beloved library content is showing up in broadcast and cable syndication – they may never go there anymore. These content libraries are repositories of consumer memories and future binge watching. Securing these rights and marketing these properties properly is essential.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Remember Murphy’s Law? If Disney can’t avoid it, neither can you</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was a part of the team at NBC Cable when we launched MSNBC. Like Disney+, that was a traditional media company leaping into a new realm – blending TV and the internet. But when noon came on July 15, 1996, and NBC CEO Bob Wright hit the metaphoric start button, the cable network came on seamlessly and the website (run by Microsoft I’ll note) crashed almost immediately after being overrun with more traffic than it could bear. Ouch.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Disney+ didn’t have a problem-free day of launch. It was well-reported (and tweeted) that it was difficult to sign on for quite some time, and there were plenty of delays to get to content after that. I can’t imagine Disney didn’t game plan for virtually any contingency of a flood of first-time users, but it still couldn’t avoid this hiccup. As Murphy’s Law says, whatever can go wrong…will.</p>
      <p>I’ve always loved Lorne Michaels’ description of going live with SNL every week: “We don’t go on when we’re ready, we go on at 11:30.” When you announce your launch date, you’re on the hook. As a friend who has managed an OTT launch for another media company told me: “It’s not like launching a show. If that bombs, you cancel it. We can’t cancel this!” No, a media company can’t walk away from its self-inflicted problems – but a consumer can. Future OTT launchers take note.</p>
