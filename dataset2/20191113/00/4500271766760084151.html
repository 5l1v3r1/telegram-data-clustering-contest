      <p>A statue of an Indian pilot whose plane was shot down by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) over Indian-occupied Kashmir earlier this year has been put on display in Karachi, invoking the ire of India's media.</p>
      <p>The life-sized statue of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman — complete with his signature moustache — has been installed in an exhibit at the PAF Museum in Karachi.</p>
      <p>Varthaman's plane was shot down in a dogfight over the disputed Himalayan region in February during clashes which brought nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to the brink of a new war.</p>

      <p>After his capture, the Pakistani military released a <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1466413">video</a> showing him sipping a cup of tea and politely refusing to answer questions.</p>
      <p>His stoic and courteous demeanour — and comment that the tea was “fantastic” — catapulted him to hero status in India.</p>
      <p>He was released several days later in a peace gesture from Pakistan aimed at defusing tensions.</p>
      <p>The statue stands in a gallery named Operation Swift Retort.</p>
      <p>The exhibit includes parts of the fuselage and tail of Varthaman's aircraft, a Mig-21, as well as a tea mug — though apparently not the same one the pilot was seen sipping from.</p>
      <p>The gallery also contains images re-enacting the moment his plane was shot down, and photographs showing him being handed back to India at the Wagah border crossing.</p>
      <p>A mess receipt jokingly charging Varthaman for the tea — at the cost of one Mig-21 — is also framed in the exhibit. Images of the mocking receipt went viral in the days after his capture.</p>
      <p>The museum stands inside a recreational park for young people in Karachi, complete with decommissioned aircraft and other military hardware.</p>
      <p>“I feel very proud of my country seeing Abhinandan's statue at the gallery,” said Samiullah Bari, a 10th grade student visiting the museum on a school trip.</p>
      <p>Indians were less enthusiastic, however, with the <i>Times of India</i> newspaper calling the exhibit “a new low”.</p>
