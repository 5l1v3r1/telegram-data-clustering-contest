      <p>Businesses have conducted change management programs for 20-30 years. Even so, change management programs are systematically ineffective in delivering results. Unfortunately, the ineffectiveness is much worse today. That’s because companies are engaged in digital transformation, where the degree of change is much greater than in the past. What causes the ineffectiveness, and what is the remedy?</p>
      <h3>Why Change Management Programs Are Often Not Helpful</h3>
      <p>Change management programs aim to facilitate something, such as implementing a new IT system or change to a company policy or procedure. The focus in change management techniques is to try to persuade people as to why they should change. Therein lies the problem: most reasons given focus on the gains to the organization and the betterment of the company.</p>
      <p>The reason people fail to change is because of what they must give up. Usually, the benefits accrue to the company, but the price or cost of the impact is paid by the individual employees. No wonder people don’t want to change.</p>
      <p>The price paid by employees starts with having to move into areas that are uncertain, especially in digital transformation journeys where the company moves toward a new operating model and business model. At a minimum, here’s what change management programs ask people to do, especially when the company is on a digital transformation journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn new skills and techniques</li>
        <li>Do things differently</li>
        <li>Learn new technology</li>
        <li>Potentially lose control</li>
        <li>Operate in an ambiguous environment in which all the issues are not yet thought through</li>
        <li>Work toward a new company vision and mind-set</li>
        <li>Work within new policies and new procedures</li>
        <li>Potentially work within a new organizational structure with new leaders and different performance metrics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All these things inevitably get set in motion, and once that chain reaction is started, the employees face a great deal of uncertainty and clarity around what the future looks like. Complicating this picture is the fact that digital transformation is a journey. The company starts the changes and then reacts to them, understanding gaps not anticipated and, as a result, often implementing additional new technology and starting the change process all over again.</p>
      <p>This high degree of change is fundamentally disconcerting to employees. They have very little confidence in the new world because of all these changing components. And the benefits of the changes are often remote accrue to the broader organization or the customers and not to the individual employees. No wonder there is so much resistance to change!</p>
      <h3>How To Remedy The Problem</h3>
      <p>The inconvenient fact is that people don’t change unless they want to. Often, change management programs are largely messaging and workshops. To combat the ineffectiveness of a change management program, companies must make sure they provide clarity around two factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The fundamental nature of the need for the change</li>
        <li>Be realistic about what employees will give up and provide clarity around “What’s in it for me?” aspects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s the thing about the “What’s in it for me” aspect. I’ve blogged before about the stakeholders in digital platforms. In a change management program, companies must give <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterbendorsamuel/2019/10/01/digital-platforms-must-meet-needs-of-all-stakeholders-not-just-customers/">each stakeholder group</a> a  reason to want to change. Bottom line: each stakeholder must be given a better experience because of the change.</p>
      <p>If the customer gets a better experience but the experience of the people in the organization is worse, they will resist the change. It is not good enough to say, “our customer will benefit” if you ask the individual employees to pay a personal price for that journey and their future is not clear and better.</p>
      <p>Companies need to look at each individual stakeholder group and engineer their specific experience so that it’s better for them. But they need to go further: the tradeoff between what individuals will be forced to give up and what they will get in return for the change must be clear and advantageous for them.</p>
      <p>When conducting messaging or workshops to try to persuade employees to change, the company must be very structured and very clear about the experience they will have. Don’t ignore or rush over this aspect of messaging. And don’t focus just on how the change will be better for customers and the company. Make sure the messaging takes into consideration all the stakeholders that will have to go through the change.</p>
      <p>The employees must believe and trust what is happening. They don’t want to be manipulated. So, it’s important to be very transparent about what is going on.</p>
