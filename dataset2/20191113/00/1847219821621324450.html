      <p><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-tesla-to-build-car-and-battery-factory-in-berlin-area/a-51218101">German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports</a> that Musk is visiting Berlin for the annual Goldene Lenkrad (Golden Steering Wheel) automotive awards organized by car magazine Autobild.</p>
      <p>According to the German daily Bild, Musk said the factory would be built near the construction site of the unfinished Berlin airport. Musk made the announcement after the Tesla Model 3 snatched the award for the best car in the middle/upper vehicle class.</p>
      <p>Musk also said that Tesla would be opening a design and engineering centre in Berlin, reported the Electrek magazine, a publication specializing in E-mobility. They also cited Musk as saying that the factory would be built in the «Berlin area.»</p>
      <p>The Tesla compound in Berlin would be designated as Gigafactory 4, following the Gigafactory 1 in the U.S. state of Nevada, Gigafactory 2 in the state of New York, and the yet-unfinished Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, DW reports.</p>
