      <p>The last time Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer squared off, it was during an epic Wimbledon final in which Federer <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamzagoria/2019/07/14/wimbledon-novak-djokovics-championship-win-over-roger-federer-by-the-numbers/#7a5127fd6f50">blew two match points before Djokovic ultimately prevailed in a historic fifth-set tiebreaker for his 16th Grand Slam title.</a></p>
      <p>Now they will meet again on Thursday with a spot in the semifinals of the Nitto ATP Finals in London on the line. The match is set for Thursday evening in London, 3 p.m. E.T.</p>
      <p>Both men are 1-1 in round-robin play entering the decisive third match on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Federer handled Italy’s Matteo Berrettini, 7-6(2), 6-3 on Tuesday afternoon after losing his first match to Dominic Thiem.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, Thiem completed a remarkable 48-hour period by taking out Djokovic in a three-set epic, 6-7(5), 6-3, 7-6(5) in 2 hours, 47 minutes for his first hardcourt win over the Serb. Thiem, now 2-0 in group play, assured his first-ever spot in the semifinals of the ATP Finals.</p>
      <p>Now the winner of Djokovic-Federer will book a spot as well, while the loser will go home. Djokovic leads Federer 26-22 all-time and has won four straight.</p>
      <p>“We have played a lot of matches since [Wimbledon], and I think we both look back at a great match,” <a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/federer-nitto-atp-finals-2019-tuesday-reaction">Federer said</a>. “I think we both can take away some confidence from the match. Him, obviously a lot. Me, maybe a tad bit less.</p>
      <p>“But at the end of the day, I wasn't hoping [for] him not to be in my section or in my draw. I didn't hope I was never going to play him again.</p>
      <p>“Actually, it's good for me to play him again, and maybe that all helps to get a chance to get him back or whatever it is... I'm personally excited to play against Novak on Thursday.”</p>
      <p>Federer, the 20-time Grand Slam champion, has won this event six times and has taken home $15.7 million at the tour finals. The only time he failed to reach the semifinals was in 2008.</p>
      <p>Thiem, meantime, became the first Austrian man ever to reach the final four after beating Djokovic and Federer in back-to-back outings.</p>
      <p>He twice led by a break in the third set against Djokovic, only to have the Serb earn the break back.</p>
      <p>Thiem then roared back from a 4-1 deficit in the third-set tiebreak, finally winning it when Djokovic hit a forehand into the net. The Austrian then collapsed on his back on the court. He’s now 8-3 against Top 10 players in 2019.</p>
      <p>“It’s just unbelievable and a match I will probably never forget,” Thiem said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Federer improved to 18-0 in second matches at the ATP Finals by handling the Italian Berrettini in straight sets. Berrettini has enjoyed a remarkable 2019, including reaching the semifinals of the U.S. Open, where he lost to Daniil Medvedev, who ultimately lost to Rafael Nadal in the final.</p>
      <p>After winning the first set against the Italian in a tiebreaker, Federer cruised in the second set, winning it when Berrettini hit a backhand into the net on match point.</p>
      <p>Asked how he came back from the loss to Thiem, Federer joked, “There’s plenty of ways to get rid of that loss. Just hang out with your kids will do that for me, so that’s what we did.”</p>
      <p>While Thiem and the Federer/Djokovic winner will move into the semis from the Bjorn Borg Group, things are still up for grabs in the Andre Agassi Group.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who lost to Alexander Zverev on Monday, will face Medvedev in one second match Wednesday, while Zverev will face Greek sensation Stefanos Tsitispas in the other.</p>
