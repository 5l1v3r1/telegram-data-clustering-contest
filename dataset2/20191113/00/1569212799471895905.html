      <h1>LinkedIn adds Data Validation to Sales Navigator</h1>
      <h2>In addition to new integrations and features, Data Validation will sync data between users' CRM and LinkedIn, keeping contacts up-to-date.</h2>

      <p>LinkedIn <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/blog/linkedin-sales-navigator/2019/sales-navigator-puts-data-to-work">launched</a> Data Validation, a feature designed to help users manage their contacts and ensure they have the most up-to-date contact data. Data Validation will automatically flag contacts who are no longer with the company listed in users’ CRM.</p>
      <p>Contacts who update their employer on LinkedIn will be automatically marked with a “Not at Company Flag” field in the CRM and can be used to trigger different CRM activities to keep records updated.</p>
      <p>The latest update to Sales Navigator also includes an integration with Bing geographic data design to help users identify the best prospects on a location-based level.</p>
      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>For sales and marketing teams that rely on Sales Navigator, the combining of LinkedIn and CRM data through data validation could positively impact their efforts by proactively keeping accounts updated.</p>
      <p>Syncing account data between LinkedIn and the CRM will help users identify opportunities at risk due to prospects leaving a position during an open opportunity. It also identifies contacts from past customers or opportunities who have started roles at new companies. These factors, along with a report flagging potential contacts that need to be updated, are all included in out-of-the-box reports from Sales Navigator.</p>
      <h3>More on the news</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn is also adding new capabilities to Sales Navigator for administrators, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>InMail performance stats: Admins will have the ability to see reps’ InMail acceptance rates, measured by positive responses from LinkedIn members.</li>
        <li>Expertise levels: Admins will be able to have insight into each team member’s performance and level within Sales Navigator to identify team members in need of additional enablement.</li>
        <li>Additional filters and exports: Improved CSV exports give administrators the ability to filter out inactive users and organize charts by custom date ranges, groups and users.</li>
        <li>Data update: LinkedIn has also added the ability for Saved Leads and Accounts to include all save actions to provide an accurate view of activity on a specific day.</li>
