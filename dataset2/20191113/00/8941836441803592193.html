        <p>Maren Morris is walking to the 2019 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/country-music-association/">Country Music Association</a> Awards with a lot of feelings.</p>
        <p>As the most-nominated act at an event for a music genre dominated by its male performers, Morris has become one of the key female faces of country music. She will pay tribute to her producer busbee, who died in September at age 43 and shares nominations with Morris for his work on her acclaimed project, “GIRL.” And Wednesday night’s show will mark the pregnant singer’s “kid’s first awards show” - as she put it.</p>
        <p>Morris says, “Dolly Parton touched my stomach earlier when we were rehearsing, so he’s been touched by an angel.”</p>
        <p>The CMAs will air live on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bridgestone-arena/">Bridgestone Arena</a> in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
