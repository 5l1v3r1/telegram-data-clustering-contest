      <p>The waiting may be about to come to an end. <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple’s</a> mythical 16-inch <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbookpro">MacBook Pro</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/02/apple-macbook-pro-new-leak-rumor-16inch-macos-catalina-launch-date/">is about to become a reality</a>. As Tim Cook and his team <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/12/16-inch-macbook-pro-expected-by-tomorrow/">reportedly brief journalists on its secretive plans</a>, what can you expect from the <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/191112/p25#a191112p25">upcoming</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/30/apple-macos-catalina-10-15-1-update-new-macbookpro-macbook-imac-mac-emoji-security-airpods-pro/">MacOS Catalina</a> powered laptop?</p>

      <p>Let me preface all of this by noting that ‘this week’ comes with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2012/02/18/the-apple-ipad-3-rumor-industry-and-the-taniyama-shimura-conjecture/">a hefty slice of Taniyama-Shimura</a> - but there are enough signals that the new MacOS powered laptop is coming.</p>
      <p>Note that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/29/apple-macbook-pro-cancelled-launch-event-tim-cook-specs-release-date/">Apple has refused to put on a huge launch event for the MacBook Pro</a>. Neither has it put on a ‘round robin’ event in October that could have shown of key products (including the MacBook Pro, the public availability of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/06/04/apple-mac-pro-macos-expensive-silly-ridiculous-cost-smart-clever/">Mac Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/09/23/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-upgrade-tags-tile-find-phone-ios-hidden-feature-update/">the activation of Apple Tags</a>, and a moment to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/09/09/apple-iphone11-iphone11max-iphone11maxpro-predictions-leak-september-10th/">reinforce the PR messages from the September iPhone and Apple Services event</a>.</p>
      <p>Instead <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/16-inch-macbook-pro-hands-on-event/">Apple is inviting a hand-picked group of journalists and community members to New York</a> to be briefed on new hardware before it is launched, which at least means that the ultimate indignity - an update to the store listing with a single press release posted online - will not happen. The MacBook Pro can reassure itself it is not at the very bottom of Tim Cook’s Christmas List.</p>

      <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/02/17/apple-plans-new-16--to-165-inch-macbook-pro-in-2019-aimed-at-gamers-pro-designers">Whenever the new MacBook Pro appears</a>, many will be looking to this machine to address many failings of the current MacBook Pro options, and bring it in line to more accomplished laptops powered by Windows 10.</p>
      <p>The first is the screen. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/21/apple-macbook-pro-16inch-new-leak-rumor-macos-catalina-escape-key/">The long-rumored upgrade to a 16-inch screen</a> is expected to be achieved by a narrowing of the bezels around the current 15-inch screen, allowing the increased real estate on the screen to be placed into the same footprint as the current 15-inch model. With so many Windows 10 laptops already sporting edge to edge screens, Apple is going to be late to this party, but it will have finally arrived.</p>
      <p>While that change will be obvious, look out for two knock-on effects. Will Apple retain the 15-inch MacBook Pro, or is this the new ‘big’ model that replaces the current biggest model. And if so, will Apple retain the same price, or will the new screen see Tim Cook and his team raise the price once more? The current entry level 15-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2399.</p>
      <p>Also, will this open up the 13-inch MacBook Pro to a potential 14-inch replacement? I think it highly unlikely that two models will be launched. Instead there’s going to be another obvious gap in the portfolio that could Osborne the current 13-inch laptops in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Then there is the keyboard. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2018/06/23/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-broken-free-repair/">Apple’s butterfly keyboard has been plagued by problems since it launched in 2015</a>. our years and various iterations later, it has become a totemic source of frustration for MacBook users. With analysts expecting a move to a scissor-switch styled keyboard, will Apple acknowledge the issues with the existing design and return to something more familiar and robust?</p>
      <p>Staying on the keyboard, it’s unlikely that function keys are coming back - <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/the-16-inch-macbook-pro-huge-change-controversial-feature-3951469">the touch bar is here to stay</a> - but watch out for the TouchID sensor to be isolated on the right hand side to allow for a physical escape key to return in a symmetrical spot on the left hand side.</p>
      <p>Finally, watch out for the actual specifications of the machine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro">The 15-inch MacBook Pro is currently specced</a> with Intel’s Coffee Lake (9th generation) Core processors, with i7 and i9 variants available. Memory is 16 GB or 32 GB, but this needs to be decided at the point of purchase, there are no user serviceable parts inside the chassis. It’s a similar story with SSD storage, starting at 256 GB going up to 4 TB, with no option to upgrade the storage once you have purchased the machine.</p>

      <p>Will Apple push the boat out on the specifications of this 16-inch laptop and finally earn the ‘Pro’ designation that the MacBook Pro represents? Or will it stay very close to the specifications that powered the machines available earlier this year and be a tepid ‘will this do’ exercise to match the competition but not push the envelope?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints">If the papal smoke is right</a>, we’ll know the answer to all of these questions, and more, by 'the end of the week’.</p>
