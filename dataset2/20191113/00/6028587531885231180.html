      <p>He’s back. They always come back. Insert any WWE or entertainment-related saying that feels appropriate. The bottom line is CM Punk returned to WWE programming on Tuesday night at the close of the Fox Sports 1 program WWE Backstage.Here’s how the return happened:</p>
      <p>Here is how the wrestling community responded to the appearance:</p>
      <p>It was a strong and compelling beginning to what WWE fans can only hope will be a successful run and return for one of the most beloved stars in the promotion’s recent history.</p>
      <p>Punk is coming back to be a part of the new studio show’s panel, but according to the WWE on FOX Twitter account, Punk will only be making periodic appearances.</p>
      <p>Obviously, fans will hope and pray for an in-ring return for Punk, but who knows if that will happen soon, or even at all. You’d have to think he might be down for a WrestleMania match which would be a huge spot for him and his opponent.</p>
      <p>How amazing would a Fiend-vs-Punk angle be over the next six months? Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, it looks as if Punk will only be bringing his wit to the table for now. If you were present for Starrcast in Chicago this summer, then you know he is more than capable of captivating an audience just speaking his mind.</p>
      <p>If you give him a little rope to play with in a professional wrestling environment and we could see something pretty special during his segments on WWE Backstage. Clearly, that is the plan. Fox has been looking to add meat to its WWE coverage to go with Smackdown on Friday nights. With Punk in the fold, for at least a week, it appears they have delivered a dose of much-see TV for wrestling fans.</p>
