      <h1>Google's Latest Venture: Checking Accounts</h1>

      <p>Google will offer consumer checking accounts next year, according to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601?mod=hp_lead_pos1">Wall Street Journa</a>l.It's the latest example of Big Tech companies venturing into finance, including Apple Inc.'s credit card and Facebook's work on a digital currency. Amazon Inc. has held discussions with banks about offering checking accounts. It's seen as a way to get closer to customers - and gather more of their data, the Journal said.</p>
      <p>Google's checking account project is code-named Cache. Citigroup and a credit union at Stanford University will manage the accounts, the Journal said. Customers would access their checking accounts through Google Pay, which is projected to have 100 million users by 2020.</p>
      <p>“Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,” Google executive Caesar Sengupta told the Journal.</p>
      <p>Checking accounts contain "a treasure trove" of information on customers including how much they earn and where they shop, the Journal reported. At the same time, there have been growing concerns by the public about how big tech companies are using personal data. Just this week, documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/11/11/google-ascension-project-nightingale-electronic-medical-records/#f21fa607a0ae">Forbes</a> revealed that Google  and one of the largest health-care systems in the U.S. have been using personal health information on millions of patients in 21 states, in part to develop new medical software.</p>
