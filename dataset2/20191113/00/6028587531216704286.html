      <p>In 2017, the Yankees arrived back to prominence earlier than anticipated, winning a wild-card spot, the subsequent play-in game and winning three elimination games over the Cleveland Indians to advance to the ALCS. The only thing standing in their way were the Houston Astros, whom like the Yankees assembled a young core but unlike the Yankees were willing to badly lose while embarking on a rebuild.The Yankees lost two one-run games to start the series in Houston, sandwiched a comeback win in Game 4 around two fairly easy wins to get within a game of the World Series. Then Houston dominated the final two games by a combined 11-1 margin to get the AL pennant.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, details of what unfolded in 2017 for the Astros on their way to their first World Series title surfaced in <a href="https://theathletic.com/1363451/">an explosive report in the Athletic</a>, which got Mike Fiers to discuss it on record and say the Astros had a system of stealing signs.</p>
      <p>Fiers admitted that during the 2017 season, the Astros used the aid of electronics to steal the signs by opponents at home games. The plot involved an electronic camera positioned in the center field whose purpose was to fixate on whatever signs an opposing catcher was flashing. The camera was hooked up to a monitor set up on a wall near the Astros dugout where personnel watched and attempted to decode signs by a primitive communication method.</p>
      <p>The method was typically done via a noise, often banging a bat on a trash can. The loud bang assuming it could be deciphered over crowd noise indicated a breaking ball or off-speed pitch was next.</p>
      <p>These are not new developments, but it does appear the Yankees, who also lost the ALCS to the Astros last month, are annoyed.</p>
      <p>Evidence of their dismay comes from this tweet from Aaron Judge:</p>
      <p>And further insight could be derived from comments made by Brian Cashman to reporters at the General Managers meetings in Arizona when he said: "I don’t think it’s a technological question alone. It’s just conduct. You decide to play by the rules, or you don’t. And if you don’t, there’s consequences. You’re putting yourself at risk whether it’s future employment, current employment, or sanctions or what have you. It’s not a technology question as much as how you want to operate.”</p>
      <p>Sign stealing is hardly new as it always has been an aspect of gamesmanship and even in the infancy of the game there were some elaborate schemes.</p>
      <p>One of practices included electrical pulses with a different buzz signaling what pitch was coming (one for fastball, two for curveball and three for changeup). <a href="http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-Baseball_Research_Journal-20.pdf">It was a practice that occurred in 1900 in a game between the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds according to an edition of the SABR Baseball Research Journal.</a>  </p>
      <p>Another and possibly more famous instance occurred in 1951 when the Giants stormed back to force a playoff with the Dodgers and won the NL pennant on Bobby Thomsen's "Shot Heard Around The World".</p>
      <p>As revealed in the 2005 book "The Echoing Green," the Giants led by former Dodgers manager Leo Durocher devised a plan to steal signs by putting a spy near the clubhouses in center field. From nearly 500 feet away, the Giants used high-powered binoculars and sent signals to the bullpen. The Giants won 37 of their last 44 games and reached the World Series when Thomsen connected off Ralph Branca.</p>
      <p>Teams often attempt to gain an edge, figure if there is a pitcher tipping his pitches. It was believed the Astros felt James Paxton was doing so, especially in Houston.</p>
      <p>It also was believed by the Yankees that the Astros were using the ability to whistle during Game 1 of the ALCS. While it did not impact the Yankees from easily winning that game, it influenced Paxton and Gary Sanchez to frequently change signs, work slower and that could have impacted the rhythm of Paxton, whom often works quickly when he is pitching well.</p>
      <p>When the series shifted back to New York, Astros manager A.J. Hinch was presented with the accusations in a pregame press conference. His answer denied the accusations and he shrugged it off and everyone moved on.</p>
      <p>“Man, I'm glad you asked that question, and I thought it would come up today. We talked about this the other day, and in reality, it's a joke, but Major League Baseball does a lot to ensure the fairness of the game," Hinch said. "There's people everywhere, if you go through the dugouts and the clubhouses and the hallways, there's like so many people around that are doing this.</p>
      <p>“Then when I get contacted about some questions about whistling, it made me laugh because it's ridiculous. Had I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training, because apparently it works even when it doesn't happen."</p>
      <p>By now, it's difficult to decipher if the Yankees were impacted by what was reported. If anything it provides them and teams to further vigilant about protecting those signs from those who might steal them.</p>
      <p>Teams can accept it to a degree, such as if a pitcher is mechanically off and doing something that serves as a tell to demonstrate what pitch is coming. They can accept it if a player can correctly guess from that way.</p>
      <p>Once electronics get involved, the acceptance level is diminished, especially when trips to the World Series are on the line.</p>
      <p>"All 30 Clubs have been notified that future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions, including the possible loss of draft picks,” Manfred said in a statement in 2017 when allegations of the Red Sox using an Apple Watch to attempt to beat the Yankees surfaced.</p>
      <p>The Yankees struggled to beat the Astros for many reasons, poor clutch hitting, a hideous performance in Game 4 at home, the pitch Aroldis Chapman threw to Jose Altuve. Whether they could overcome those things are unknown, but for now their next step is to figure out how to become a better team than the Astros.</p>
