      <h1>Justice Democrats: Pete Buttigieg has flip-flopped on ‘Medicare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/seth-mclaughlin/" target="_blank">Seth McLaughlin</a></address>
      <p>The far-left group that helped give rise to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says South Bend, Indiana, Mayor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pete-buttigieg/">Pete Buttigieg</a> has flip-flopped on “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> for All” in the 2020 Democratic presidential race purely for political reasons.</p>
      <p>Justice Democrats blasted out an email Wednesday that accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pete-buttigieg/">Mr. Buttigieg</a> of moving away from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> for All after recognizing that Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts owned the issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pete-buttigieg/">Buttigieg</a> was for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> for All before he was against it,” said Waleed Shahid, spokesperson for Justice Democrats.</p>
      <p>“He realized he was never going to beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Warren</a> and Sanders as a progressive,” Mr. Shahid said. “He got scared of the fight. He realized he could raise tons of cash from corporate executives in the pharmaceutical and insurance industry.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pete-buttigieg/">Mr. Buttigieg</a> has distanced himself from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Ms. Warren</a> and Mr. Sanders by running on a “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> For All Who Want It” plan that would provide a public option while keeping employer-sponsored and private health care plans.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Ms. Warren</a> and Mr. Sanders, who has been endorsed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, would basically abolish private insurance coverage.</p>
      <p>The Buttigieg campaign announced Wednesday it released a new television ad in Iowa in which voters praise him for giving them a choice on health care and for not promising something that he likely could not deliver in Washington.</p>
      <p>The issue has become a dividing line in the 2020 presidential race and appears to have boosted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pete-buttigieg/">Mr. Buttigieg</a> in Iowa, where a Monmouth University poll released this week found that he has knocked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Ms. Warren</a> out of first place.</p>
      <p>It also found he had the most favorable rating in the field.</p>

        <p>A New York Times/ Sienna College poll released this month, meanwhile, found that 56% of likely caucusgoers favor a candidate who “promises to improve the existing health insurance system” compared to 42% who want a candidate who “promises to replace the current health care system with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> for All.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Buttigeig says his proposal carries a $1.5 trillion price tag over 10 years, making it less costly than <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> for All, which is estimated to cost upwards of $34 trillion over 10 years.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elizabeth-warren/">Ms. Warren</a> says her plan will cost $20.2 trillion over a decade.</p>
