        <b>Dear Mr Brown,</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>I read about the quality of Canada's education system. It seems to be very high, but I also think that the standard of the Caribbean Examinations Council's (CXC) Caribbean Secondary (CSEC) Education Certificate and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE) are extremely high in comparison. Are these qualifications accepted in Canada?</b>

        <b>Dear MAP:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In recent years, Canada has been regarded as belonging to the top tier of international rankings in relation to education. A major study of educational performance by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggests that teenagers educated in Canada are among the best educated in the world.</p>
      <p>At the university level, Canada has the world's highest proportion of working-age adults who have been through higher education.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Provincial jurisdiction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canada does not have a national education system. Instead, education is under the jurisdiction of each province and territory. Moreover, Canada has a high level of immigrants in its school population, who seem to integrate well in the system.</p>
      <p>One conclusion drawn by OECD is despite the different policies in each province, Canada has shown a commitment to equality and equity in school, which is deemed the central theme influencing the success of education in Canada.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Equity in the classroom</b>
      </p>
      <p>Studies have shown that the children of new migrants have scores as high as the rest of their schoolmates, which is a relatively uncommon result in contrast to other nations. Moreover, Canada's teachers are well paid by international standards, which attracts high-quality faculty and sufficient funding for corresponding high standards and special education.</p>
      <p>Although there is a narrow socioeconomic gap in Canada, studies found that there was little variation for educational results based on wealth or district.</p>
      <p>In response to your statement, I agree that CXC/CAPE have very high expectations of students. However, the high standard of Canada's system is more based on a systematic way of ensuring that all students in the nation meet the established standard, regardless of the capacity of a particular student or teacher, the nature of a particular school or location in a particular district.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Canadian experience</b>
      </p>
      <p>It can also be argued that many immigrants are highly educated and extremely motivated to utilise opportunities to succeed in Canada.</p>
      <p>Many immigrants enter Canada as students, as priority is given under the economic immigration system for those with Canadian education and work experience because it leads to a smoother transition based on marketable employment. In Jamaica, foreign experience can enhance marketability, whereas in Canada, it is Canadian experience that is valued.</p>
      <p>I am trying to place emphasis on this distinction, so that you can understand that although qualification can be accepted and recognised based on an evaluation by World Education Services, priority is intentionally given to Canadian experience (education and work).</p>
      <p> </p>
