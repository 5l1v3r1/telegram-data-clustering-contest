      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/motorola/">Motorola</a> is bracing for the future by returning to the past. The company is adapting its historical flip-phone design for a smartphone with a foldable screen.</p>
      <p>Samsung, Huawei and others have phones that fold like a book and offer a double-sized display when unfolded.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/motorola/">Motorola</a>’s new Razr phone, on the other hand, will be smaller than a regular smartphone until unfolded to its full 6.2 inch size. The idea is to make the phone more compact for carrying and storing when folded and not in use.</p>
      <p>People have been upgrading smartphones less often as innovation slows down. The phone industry has been looking to foldable screens as a way to revive sales, though they are still niche products.</p>

        <p>The phone will launch in the U.S. in January starting at $1,500.</p>
