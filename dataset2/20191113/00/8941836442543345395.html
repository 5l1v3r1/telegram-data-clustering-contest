      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a> is the first state to release the names of medical facilities that have treated patients with a deadly, drug-resistant fungus that is spreading.</p>
      <p>The New York Times reported Wednesday that 64 hospitals, 103 long-term care nursing homes, a long-term care hospital and three hospice units in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a> have cared for patients with an especially virulent germ called Candida auris (can-DEEH’-dah OH’-ris). Most of the patients were in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
      <p>The Times says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a> health officials disclosed the names of the facilities because Candida auris has been spreading quickly.</p>

        <p>Michael Craig, an antibiotic resistance expert for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the newspaper that someone in the United States dies of a resistant infection every 15 minutes.</p>
