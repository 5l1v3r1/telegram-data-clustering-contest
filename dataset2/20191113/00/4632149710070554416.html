      <h1>Easynomics: The wrong obsession with $5 trillion GDP</h1>

      <p>I was at a literature festival recently. The one question I got asked the most by people was what does India need to do to become a $5 trillion economy. <br/>This made me happy and sad. Happy, because a few people were at least interested in economics. And sad, because they were asking the wrong question. <br/>As Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo write in Good Economics for Hard Times: “The key ultimately is to not lose sight of the fact that GDP is a means and not an end. A useful means, no doubt, especially when it creates jobs or raises wages or plumps the government budget so it can redistribute more.” <br/><br/>Economic progress happens because of increasing GDP. But there is a lot more to it than just that. As Banerjee and Duflo write: “The ultimate goal remains one of raising the quality of life of the average person, and especially the worst-off person. And quality of life means more than consumption.” <br/>What does this mean? As life goes on, earning a higher income and spending more, is a very important part of peoples’ lives, but it’s not just about that. <br/><br/>As Banjeree and Duflo point out: “While better lives are indeed partly about being able to consume more, even very poor people also care about health of their parents, about educating their children, about having their voices heard, and about being able to pursue their dreams.” <br/><br/>f course, a higher GDP is one way of doing that. But it’s not the only way. In fact, the quality of life varies quite a lot between middle-income industries. Banerjee and Duflo offer the example of Sri Lanka and Guatemala. <br/><br/>As per World Bank data, in 2018, Sri Lanka had a per-capita income of $4,103 and Guatemala had a per-capita income of $4,549. So, the average income of a Sri Lankan was around 10% less than the average income of a Guatemalan. <br/><br/>But when it comes to social indicators, which are a good measure of quality of life, Sri Lanka is way-ahead of Guatemala. Take the case of infant mortality which measures the number of deaths of children before reaching an age of 1, per 1,000 live births. In case of Sri Lanka, the infant mortality rate in 2018 was 6, the same as the United States. In case of Guatemala, the infant mortality rate was 22. <br/><br/>Further, let’s take the case of child mortality, or the number of children dying, before they reach the age of 5, per 1,000 live births. In case of Sri Lanka, the child mortality rate was 7, again, the same as the United States. In case of Guatemala the rate was at 26. <br/><br/>What this clearly tells us is that good social-outcomes can be achieved, even in case of the not-so-rich countries. <br/><br/>In fact, this is a trend that is visible within India as well. The richer states are not the ones which necessarily have better health outcomes. Take the case of Haryana, which is the richest Indian large state (There are smaller states like Delhi, Goa and Sikkim, which are richer than Haryana). The per-capita income of Kerala is less than that of Haryana. In 2017-2018, the per-capita income of Haryana was Rs 2.03 lakh and that of Kerala was Rs 1.84 lakh. <br/><br/>But when it comes to the infant mortality rate, Kerala is way ahead of Haryana. In 2016, the latest data currently available, infant mortality rate in Kerala was 10 per 1,000 live births. In case of Haryana, the infant mortality rate was 33 per 1,000 live births. The state of Jharkhand, which has a per-capita income of a little over a third of that of Haryana, had an infant mortality rate of 29 per 1,000 live births. <br/><br/><br/>As Banerjee and Duflo write: “The best bet, therefore, for a country like India is to attempt to do things that can make the quality of life better for its citizens with the resources it already has: improving education, health, and the functioning of the courts and the banks, and building better infrastructure (better roads and more livable cities, for example).” <br/><br/>As boring it may sound, progress is about doing these things in a better way, than fussing and obsessing over a GDP number, and when and how will we achieve it. If we do these things well, we will eventually get to $5 trillion sooner rather than later. <br/><br/><br/><b>(Vivek Kaul is the author of the Easy Money trilogy).</b></p>
