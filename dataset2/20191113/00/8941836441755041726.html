      <p>STORRS, Conn. (AP) - The NCAA has denied an appeal from UConn that would have allowed Tennessee transfer Evina Westbrook to play for the Huskies this season.</p>
      <p>UConn argued that issues at Tennessee, which fired coach Holly Warlick in March, met the NCAA’s recently revised standards for a waiver of the rule requiring the 6-foot guard to sit out a season.</p>
      <p>Westbrook was a co-leading scorer for Tennessee last season. She averaged 14.9 points and 5.3 assists.</p>
      <p>UConn said it provided more than 100 pages of supporting documentation and Tennessee didn’t oppose the waiver application.</p>
      <p>UConn Athletic Director David Benedict says he believes the system failed.</p>

      <p>The fourth-ranked Huskies (1-0) received the news just before their game at Vanderbilt on Wednesday. Westbrook will have two years of eligibility remaining when she suits up for UConn next season.</p>
