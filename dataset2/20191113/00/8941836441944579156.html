      <p>DENVER (AP) - A Muslim civil rights group is protesting after a Colorado arena security guard told a woman to remove her hijab before she could enter to see her 8-year-old daughter sing the national anthem with her school choir at a Denver Nuggets basketball game.</p>
      <p>Gazella Bensreiti (ben-SRAY-tee) said Wednesday that the guard told her to “take that thing off of my head” at the Pepsi Center box office on Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>Bensreiti said she explained the scarf was for religious purposes. She said the guard replied that she didn’t care.</p>
      <p>After speaking with a supervisor, the guard ushered her inside.</p>
      <p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations protested the incident.</p>
