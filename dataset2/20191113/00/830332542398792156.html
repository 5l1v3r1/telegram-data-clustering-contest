      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The former executive director of NAMI Wisconsin is facing theft charges from the nonprofit company on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to an incident report from Madison police, a Madison police detective began an investigation earlier this year on Jessica L. Gruneich, 40, after staff members at the company called and showed concern. </p>
      <p>The National Alliance on Mental Illness is a nonprofit agency that specializes in promoting recovery for those affected by mental illness. Its Wisconsin branch is based in Madison.</p>
      <p>The detective discovered that Gruneich used a NAMI Wisconsin credit card to purchase a number of items and services, including hotel rooms, rental cars, moving expenses and restaurant bills.</p>
      <p>Gruneich has been tentatively charged with 18 counts of misappropriation of personal identifying materials as well as one count of felony theft from a business.</p>
      <p>In a statement from NAMI Wisconsin, company president Kay Jewell said they discovered "some serious discrepancies" in their accounts. </p>
      <p>"We are disappointed that someone we trusted took actions that could have harmed our mission to help, serve, educate and advocate for consumers and families living with mental health conditions," said Jewell. "We have taken additional steps to secure our internal processes to ensure this can't happen in the future. We were relieved to learn that our insurance has covered the potential financial loss to our small organization. Our leadership and organization are strong and we look forward to serving our community."</p>
