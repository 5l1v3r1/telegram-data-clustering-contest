      <p>The Houston Astros have become Major League Baseball’s version of the New England Patriots.And Jeff Luhnow, the team’s general manager, on Tuesday called the continued tumult “disappointing.”</p>
      <p>The Astros, who recently lost the World Series in seven games to the National League’s Washington Nationals, were caught in another controversy smack in the middle of this week’s annual meeting of general managers at a resort hotel in Paradise Valley, Arizona.</p>
      <p>This time, it’s over a report that the Astros electronically stole signs during the 2017 season, which ended with their victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in another seven-game World Series.</p>
      <p>Just after the start of the most recent Fall Classic, Luhnow’s assistant, Brandon Taubman, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrymbloom/2019/10/24/brandon-taubman-fired-by-houston-astros-for-inappropriate-conduct/#2fa23d046d80">was fired because of insensitive comments</a> he made in the presence of female reporters in the home clubhouse at Minute Maid Park after the Astros clinched the AL Championship Series over the New York Yankees.</p>
      <p>“I know in the last couple of weeks there’s been a lot of news surrounding the Houston Astros and it’s not been good news. I’m disappointed in that,” Luhnow told reporters during an afternoon media session with the collective GMs. “I think these incidents and topics are not tied together, but they obviously have come one after another, it seems like.</p>
      <p>“It is disappointing, and if there is an issue we need to address, we will address it.”</p>
      <p>The news of the sign-stealing comes shortly after Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan and his son, Reid, were ousted by the club. The younger Ryan was re-assigned from his role as team president while the right-hander with the career record of 5,714 strikeouts left his position as a consultant.</p>
      <p>The continued chaos is reminiscent of how the National Football League accused the Patriots of illegally filming other teams’ practices and later deflating the air from footballs so quarterback Tom Brady would be more comfortable throwing them during playoff games.</p>
      <p>The Patriots, one of pro football’s top teams, with six Super Bowl wins, were penalized for the incidents.</p>
      <p>As far as the Astros are concerned, <i>The Athletic</i> claimed that four people who had been with the club in 2017 said members of the organization set up a camera in center field at Minute Maid and stole catcher signs, relaying them to screens near the club’s dugout.</p>
      <p>Although sign stealing has been a hallmark of baseball larceny for time immemorial, it’s specifically prohibited to do so electronically or by any other method outside the dugout or playing field.</p>
      <p>The Astros have been assisting MLB with its investigation of the club’s culture since the Taubman incident. But that now may encompass the recurrence of sign stealing, which is becoming a major theme surrounding an organization that has won one World Series, two AL pennants and three AL West titles in the past three seasons.</p>
      <p>“Teams are competing with each other, and we’re all trying to get an edge,” Luhnow said. “But we all have to follow the rules, and the rules are set by Major League Baseball. We all agree to follow it, and if you don’t, there’s obviously ramifications to that.”</p>
      <p>There have been claims that Houston stole signs during the past two postseasons, with the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox complaining to MLB in 2018 that an Astros employee was seen taking photos near their dugouts. MLB found no evidence of a conspiracy.</p>
      <p>This year, in Game 1 of the ALCS, the Yankees charged that the Astros were stealing signs, relaying the information to the batter through a series of whistles from the dugout.</p>
      <p>That led Houston manager A.J. Hinch to say that the allegation made him laugh because “it was ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>“And had I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training,” he said.</p>
      <p>But the Dodgers, who lost the World Series in 2017 and 2018 to the Astros and the Red Sox, respectively, aren’t so sure. Going into the 2017 World Series, “there was a lot of talk and suspicion about it,” Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers’ president of baseball operations, said Tuesday. </p>
      <p>“When you do these things, people are going to find out about it,” he added. “Going in, our advance team on Houston talked about it. There had been a lot of speculation and innuendo over the last few years.</p>
      <p>“From my prospective, you want a sign system that doesn’t create mass paranoia because we want our players to go out and play the game. We don’t want it to be a distraction. I think we’re way better about it now than we were in that year.”</p>
