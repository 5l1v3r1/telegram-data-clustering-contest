      <p>MOON TOWNSHIP, Pa. (AP) - A double-digit deficit on the road. A capacity crowd in full throat. Pittsburgh has been there plenty over last two-plus years. And faltered each and every time.</p>
      <p>For once, the Panthers pushed back, a small sign of growth for a program hoping to take another step toward respectability in head coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-capel-iii/">Jeff Capel</a>’s second season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">Trey McGowens</a> scored 25 points and Terrell Brown added eight points, nine rebounds and a career-high five blocks as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a> spoiled the unveiling of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a>‘ sparkling UPMC Events Center in a 71-57 win on Tuesday night. Three days after getting upset at home by Nicholls State, the Panthers (2-1) responded by snapping a 24-game road losing streak that stretched back nearly three years.</p>
      <p>The Colonials (0-3) used an 18-0 run in the first half to take an 11-point lead. Six-plus years after upsetting defending national champion Kentucky in a National Invitational Tournament game at the since-demolished Sewall Center, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> again staggered a Power Five conference team.</p>
      <p>The Panthers, however, recovered behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">McGowens</a>‘ relentlessness and the 6-foot-10 Brown’s dominance in the lane as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a> earned its first true road victory since beating Boston College on Feb. 8, 2017.</p>

      <p>“When they made their run, it was loud, we could have folded,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-capel-iii/">Capel</a> said. “We have to understand the importance of each day. We are not a program and we don’t have the type of talent where you can just show up.”</p>
      <p>A lesson the Panthers learned painfully against Nicholls State, a game in which <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a> led for just 35 seconds against a team picked to finish 11th in the Southland Conference. The Colonials, perennial contenders in the Northeastern Conference under coach Andy Toole, represented a bit of a step up in class. Throw in the debut of their new $45 million, 4,000-seat gym - a building that’s a testament to both the program Toole has built and the rapid expansion at the school of more than 5,000 students located 20 miles west of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a>’s Oakland campus - and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> had all the intangibles required to beat the Panthers for the first time in 31 meetings.</p>
      <p>The Colonials just didn’t have the tools necessary to slow down <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">McGowens</a> or overcome Brown’s size.</p>
      <p>“Terrell Brown was really the difference in the game,” Toole said. “His ability to protect the rim, and make it hard for our guys to finish around the basket had a huge impact on us offensively.”</p>

        <p>Josh Williams led <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> with 12 points, Jalen Hawkins added 11 off the bench and Yannis Mendy had 10 points and six rebounds, but the Colonials - who didn’t have a player over 6-feet-8 - couldn’t keep pace over the final 20 minutes. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a>, which scrambled back from the early hole to tie it at halftime, opened the second half with a 22-10 surge that broke it open.</p>
        <p>The Panthers outrebounded <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> 39-27, dominated <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> in second-chance points (14-2) and kept the Colonials off the free throw line. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> didn’t even attempt a free throw in the second half and finished with just six for the game. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">McGowens</a>, by comparison, made 8 of 10 at the line after getting to the stripe just nine times total over his first two games.</p>
        <p>“I was just letting it come to me,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">McGowens</a> said.</p>
        <p>PACKED HOUSE, NEW DAY?</p>
        <p>Toole hopes the response to the debut of the Colonials’ glittering new venue - particularly from a raucous student section - is a sign of things to come. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> has averaged 20 wins a season over the last 12 years but all that success didn’t necessarily translate to a rowdy atmosphere at the Sewall Center. He thinks that can change going forward.</p>
        <p>“I think this could become a great home court for us if we can get the campus and community support that I think these guys deserve,” Toole said. “It was a fun environment for them to come and cheer and be connected as a university community. I think that’s something to build upon. There’s a great source of pride being able to be in this building finally.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a>: The Panthers need to find some sort of identity on offense if they’re going to take another step forward in coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-capel-iii/">Jeff Capel</a>’s second season. Through three games, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a> has relied heavily on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trey-mcgowens/">McGowens</a> and Xavier Johnson getting to the basket. When they’re either finishing at the rim or getting fouled, the Panthers are competitive. When they’re not - as they weren’t against Nicholls State - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/pitt/">Pitt</a> will struggle to generate offense.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a>: The Colonials will have a chance to make some noise in the NEC. Picked to finish fifth, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-morris/">Robert Morris</a> should be plenty battle-tested thanks to a nonconference schedule that includes games against Marquette and UNLV before league play begins.</p>
