      <h1>Beckham’s Miami team to play MLS home opener March 14</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T00:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">TIM REYNOLDS</a></address>
      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a>’s new MLS team will play its first home match against his former club.</p>
      <p>Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> officials announced Wednesday that the club’s home debut will be March 14 at 2:30 p.m. against the LA Galaxy. That means Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> will begin its inaugural season on the road, since the 2020 MLS season is set to begin in late February.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy are a fitting home debut opponent for Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-beckham/">Beckham</a> has his new team in large part because of an arrangement he struck when playing in Los Angeles. A contract he signed with the Galaxy in 2007 gave <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-beckham/">Beckham</a> the right to start an expansion franchise for $25 million, and in 2013, he announced that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> was where he wanted to put that team.</p>
      <p>“What we are bringing to South Florida on March 14 is a club that unites fans and visitors from all over the world together for the love of the game,” Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> chief business officer Jurgen Mainka said. “This is a historic day that our community has waited for, and we look forward to experiencing it together.”</p>
      <p>The full MLS schedule for next season - 17 home, 17 away matches for each club - has yet to be announced.</p>

      <p>Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> is building a 18,000-seat stadium and multifield training complex in Fort Lauderdale at the site of the now-demolished Lockhart Stadium, where the Miami Fusion of the MLS played from 1998 through 2001. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-beckham/">Beckham</a>’s team will play in Fort Lauderdale for at least its first two seasons and is still planning to build a stadium in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>. Inter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s complex at the Lockhart site will be permanent, remaining the training home for the franchise’s MLS, USL League One and academy teams.</p>
