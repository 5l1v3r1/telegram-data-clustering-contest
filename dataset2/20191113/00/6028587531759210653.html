      <p>There was a time when we didn't think twice about the security of our election systems. We trusted that when we cast our votes, they would be accurately counted.That has changed. During the 2016 election, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hack-of-elections-system-was-far-reaching-report-finds.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">powerful threat</a> appeared from outside our own borders – the shadow of other governments hacking and attempting to unduly influence our election systems.</p>
      <p>If we care about voting and election security, and if we still believe that every voter and every vote counts, then there is a big existential question that we must be willing to address: Is cybersecurity fundamental to the health, if not the very existence, of a democracy today?</p>
      <p>I say absolutely yes. The issue is not significantly different from the challenges that businesses face as they try to protect their data and digital assets. It's the ramifications that are so much bigger.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Targets Of Cyberattacks And Election Hacking</b>
      </p>
      <p>States are responsible for election systems and the security needed to prevent and address the various kinds of attacks that can occur within their systems.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Attack on voting system software at the vendor</b>
      </p>
      <p>A "left of boom" attack focuses on penetrating the networks of private companies that develop election technology. Attackers could quietly install a back door that enables them to hack the software before and after deployment. While no reported instance of this kind of hack exists, a leading voting machine maker <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mb4ezy/top-voting-machine-vendor-admits-it-installed-remote-access-software-on-systems-sold-to-states">installed remote-access software</a> on election-management systems sold over a period of six years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Direct and lateral attacks on voter registration databases</b>
      </p>
      <p>Attackers can use malware to compromise voting records by deleting or corrupting voter registration for a portion of the population. This attack can be initiated laterally through systems connected to the voter registration database. This type of attack was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-motor-voter-problems-investigation-20190409-story.html">attempted</a> on the California DMV’s "motor voter" system in April 2018.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Direct attack on vote casting and counting</b>
      </p>
      <p>This kind of attack can occur before or on Election Day. <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/internet-voting.aspx">Some states</a> use email and fax for casting early votes, and these votes can be intercepted. The system can also be injected with fraudulent votes cast by fake identities created by breaching voter databases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rethinking The State Election Environment: Attitudes, People And Technology</b>
      </p>
      <p>The state election process is not currently treated like a business system. It should be. Voter information is as valuable as the customer information and data assets of a business.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The need to change attitudes about election security </b>
      </p>
      <p>While most state and local governments understand that a security threat exists, they don't necessarily understand its nature or magnitude. I find that too often there is a "we’re small — who really cares?" response when the potential for hacking is raised. When security technology is brought in as the solution, it is often relied on too heavily, with the false assumption that it's working as promised. Cyber hygiene is a top challenge in business, and it should be the same in election systems.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. The state CIO and CISO: New roles and relationships for election cybersecurity</b>
      </p>
      <p>In <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_election_agencies">38 states</a>, the secretary of state has at least some responsibility for election administration. This includes testing and certifying voting equipment for security, accuracy, reliability and accessibility. Each state also has a chief information officer (CIO) and a chief information security officer (CISO). Currently, these employees don’t have formal direct reporting relationships with the secretary of state. They should, in order to address systemic election security and track threats daily.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Technology and the election ecosystem </b>
      </p>
      <p>Three elements in the election ecosystem have their own sets of cybersecurity challenges.</p>
      <p>• Election system: A small network of private companies create the hardware and software used in voting machines and election management systems. They face <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/22/us-voting-machine-private-companies-voter-registration">little oversight or regulation</a>. With source code and hardware design claimed as trade secrets, the mechanism for ensuring the secure casting, counting and transmission of ballots lacks transparency and quality assurance.</p>
      <p>• Election administration: This includes the websites and databases of state and local officials, electoral registers, elections and commissions. If voter registration systems are hacked, voters could be turned away at the polls. There have been cases of both <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/water-hole-replacing-spear-phishing-as-state">strategic compromises (watering holes) and spear phishing activities </a>associated with hacking activities around these systems.</p>
      <p>• Election campaign organizations: Cybersecurity measures vary greatly across news organizations, political parties, social media platforms, political action committees and donors. Compromises are not necessarily rare, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/13/timeline-how-russian-agents-allegedly-hacked-the-dnc-and-clintons-campaign/">as was the case</a> with the Democratic National Committee email hacking during the 2016 presidential election campaign.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Evolving Role Of Cybersecurity</b>
      </p>
      <p>Proactive cybersecurity technology and policy must take center stage to address the growing security threats found in the broader election ecosystem.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Cybersecurity hygiene </b>
      </p>
      <p>Greater transparency and data-driven evaluation of the cybersecurity hygiene of individual commercial providers of election system technology is necessary. Increased monitoring of the integration and implementation of technology in election systems is also needed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. ‘Layered defense’ cybersecurity architecture </b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the interrelated nature of many government databases and systems, cybersecurity measures need to address the likelihood of lateral attacks. Implementation of the principle of least privilege would limit an individual's access to certain portions of a system. When full access is more difficult, successful hacking is less likely.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Continuous and quantified evaluation and validation of security controls </b>
      </p>
      <p>Organizations involved in the election ecosystem can no longer assume that security technology and protocols work as promised. There are too many changes to software elements, settings, network and access that are made every day. This creates a dynamic IT environment where a constantly changing risk profile is a natural outcome. Managing the security of this environment requires quantifiable and independent proof of vulnerabilities that can be checked at any time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moving Election Cybersecurity From Conversation To Action</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many different actors are responsible for bringing trust, accountability and security to our elections. The state must lead, with others equally engaged. That includes federal and local government, citizens and commercial technology companies. We all need to work together to ensure that in our democracy, every vote counts.</p>
