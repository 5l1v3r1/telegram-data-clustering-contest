      <h3>Google Checking</h3>
      <p>Some of the biggest tech companies in the world, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/steve-wozniak-apple-card-discriminated-against-wife">including Apple</a>, have been trying to break into the personal banking space by offering credit cards and checking accounts to their customers.</p>
      <p>Now, according to an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601?mod=rsswn">exclusive report</a> by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, Google is joining those efforts — with a plan to start offering checking accounts to its billions of users.</p>
      <h3>Tech Bank</h3>
      <p>Google competitor Facebook has struggled to break into the financial space. Its plans to establish <a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency">Libra</a>, an international cryptocurrency, have been met with <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/french-government-barred-facebooks-cryptocurrency">criticism</a> from governments around the world. A large number of partners and investors have <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/facebooks-cryptocurrency-collapsing">already backed out</a> prior to a planned 2020 launch.</p>
      <p>Google’s plans are not quite as ambitious as Libra. The idea is to have users access their checking accounts through Google’s digital wallet, Google Pay, according to <i>WSJ </i>— the same app that allows customers to pay for stuff using their Android smartphones. So far, the service has almost 100 million users.</p>
      <p>But there’s one massive hurdle Google will have to inevitably cross to make its banking services a real choice to consumers: it will have to convince them their personal data is safe.</p>
