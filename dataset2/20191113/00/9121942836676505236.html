      <p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand lawmakers have voted in favor of a bill to legalize euthanasia, a watershed moment that ended a contentious two-year debate.</p>
      <p>But the final decision will rest with New Zealand voters, who will need to approve the bill in a referendum next year for it to go into effect. Polls have indicated a majority of voters support the measure.</p>
      <p>In the bill’s final vote Wednesday, 69 lawmakers supported it while 51 were opposed. People in the public gallery cheered and clapped when the results were read out.</p>
      <p>The bill applies only to people who are terminally ill and likely to die within six months. To be eligible under the bill, a person must be in irreversible physical decline and experience “unbearable suffering” that cannot be relieved.</p>
