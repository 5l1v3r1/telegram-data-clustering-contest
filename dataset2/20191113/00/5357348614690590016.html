        <b>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AFP) — Evo Morales vowed yesterday to continue “the struggle” after arriving in Mexico where he has been granted political asylum, as Bolivia's Senate seeks to end civil turmoil and fill the power vacuum left by his abrupt resignation as president.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morales thanked Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a left-wing ally, saying “he saved my life”, and insisted he would remain in politics.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers in Bolivia, meanwhile, were summoned to ratify Morales's resignation and appoint Deputy Senate Leader Jeanine Anez as interim president.</p>
      <p>“That's the intention, I hope we can do it. We can't remain without Government,” said Anez.</p>
      <p>She has found herself next in line after the resignations of Vice-President Alvaro Garcia Linera, the Senate president and the speaker of the lower house of Congress.</p>
      <p>Grinning and waving as he disembarked from the Mexican military plane that flew him out of Bolivia Monday night, Morales was welcomed to Mexico by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard.</p>
      <p>Morales told reporters he was the victim of a “coup” before defending his record of bettering living conditions for poor and indigenous Bolivians.</p>
      <p>“There will only be peace when social justice is achieved for all,” he said.</p>
      <p>After nearly 14 years in power, Morales left behind a rudderless country beset by turmoil.</p>
      <p>He resigned after losing the support of the military. Dozens of officials and ministers also stepped down, some seeking refuge in foreign embassies.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the armed forces pledged to help police take back the streets from violent groups that have wreaked havoc since the controversial October 20 election that saw Morales win an unconstitutional fourth term.</p>
      <p>Anez has already pledged to call fresh elections to end the political crisis.</p>
      <p>However, the senators must first reach La Paz for her to be sworn in as interim president.</p>
      <p>Public transport has been virtually paralysed since Sunday night when protesters torched 64 municipal buses. The cable car system that serves La Paz has also ground to a halt.</p>
      <p>Anez, 52, said she was confident that enough senators would reach the Senate to open a session — 19 of the 36 are needed to do so.</p>
      <p>She said even senators from Morales's Movement for Socialism (MAS) party “want to end this uncertainty, vandalism and instability that we have in the country”.</p>
      <p>“I think the people are crying out for there to be an elected president on January 22,” she said.</p>
      <p>The crisis touched off by Morales's resignation on Sunday — after three weeks of protests over his disputed re-election — deepened on Monday as gangs unhappy with his departure attacked police stations and civilians, triggering panic in the streets.</p>
