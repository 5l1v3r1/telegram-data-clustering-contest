      <p>In our illogical world, we often equate productivity and working long hours as a package deal. As in, the harder we work, the more successful we will be, even if we push ourselves to the point of exhaustion. However, burnout isn’t a badge of honor. If you have suffered from burnout, you know how truly awful it can be. The stress, depression and lack of control can take a toll on your health. According to a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/237059/employee-burnout-part-main-causes.aspx">Gallup study</a>, 23% of employees reported feeling burned out at work very often or always, while an additional 44% reported feeling burned out sometimes. That means that two-thirds of full-time employees experience burnout on the job. Despite awareness and well-intentioned workplaces, employee burnout continues to rise. <a href="https://www.workplacestrategiesformentalhealth.com/managing-workplace-issues/burnout-response">Burnout</a> is more likely when employees expect too much out of themselves, feel inadequate or incompetent, feel unappreciated for their work efforts, or are in roles that are not a good job fit. Employee burnout is a problem that affects people working in organizations of all sizes.</p>
      <p>Burnout not only affects the employee, but it can take a toll on the organization as a whole. When employees become burnt out, they often miss work frequently due to reported illness, not getting enough rest, or just going home early not feeling well. The psychological and physical problems of burned-out employees cost an estimated $125 billion to $190 billion a year in healthcare spending, according to <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/employee-burnout-is-a-problem-with-the-company-not-the-person">Harvard Business Review</a>. Issues like Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems, and depression all have strong links to employee burnout.</p>
      <h3>Deloitte Tackles Burnout </h3>
      <p>One company that is working to address burnout is Deloitte. With over 94,000 employees in 100 locations across the U.S., Deloitte provides services in audit and risk, consulting, financial advisory, and tax. As a professional services organization, Deloitte is a performance-drive culture. </p>
      <p>“We have a very high-performance culture, and we believe that well-being is not mutually exclusive to delivering value to clients. In fact, we believe that it’s vital in any high-performance culture to also focus on well-being,” said Jen Fisher, US Chief Well-being Officer at Deloitte. </p>
      <p>With a vast company like Deloitte, it’s no surprise that they have a sizable amount of road warriors and remote employees. So with that in mind, they created a well-being strategy that is relevant and has components that all employees can take advantage of, regardless of where they are working, or how they are working.</p>
      <p>“We understand and believe that well-being is different for every single person. If you ask 30 people what well-being means to them, they will probably give you 33 different answers. So it’s really important for us to have a flexible framework for well-being with various tools, resources and benefits that support people along their life and their career journey with us at Deloitte,” said Jen. </p>
      <p>Deloitte created an interactive, user-friendly dashboard called Vitals that aggregates information from a variety of internal systems to see when people may need a break. Employees can see a complete picture of how many hours they are working—during the week and on weekends—how much of that time they’re spending away from home, how many flights they have taken in the past week, and when they last took PTO. It also allows employees to share their energy levels with their coach. </p>
      <p>According to Jen, the Vitals platform was designed to give coaches and individuals real-time information around how they are doing, and share metrics that may be impacting their well-being. One of the biggest benefits of the tool is that it serves as a conversation starter, it’s a way for coaches to look at data and say to the employee, you’ve been on the road for quite a while now, how’s everything going? It provides data to identify people at risk of burnout well before they crash. The dashboard also incorporates training in a number of areas, including meditation.</p>
      <p>While Jen acknowledges the Vitals dashboard is a critical component of their strategy, technology is just one piece of the well-being puzzle. “I think it’s really important to look at existing culture norms that might be holding people back and try to address those first. Then, later on, look at how technology can further enhance those culture changes that you are trying to make. Your program won’t have the stickiness if cultural elements haven’t been addressed,” said Jen. </p>
      <h3>Seven Ways to Prevent Burnout </h3>
      <p>Even if you don’t have the resource to create your own dashboard. There are several ways that employers can prevent employee burnout in their organization. </p>
      <p><b>Encourage time off.</b> Time off from work is crucial for employees’ mental health and well-being. Employers should encourage employees to take a step away from their work when they need a break. This includes encouraging employees to take regular breaks from their desks throughout the workday and supporting employees who <a href="https://info.totalwellnesshealth.com/blog/bid/353100/this-is-why-employees-shouldnt-waste-another-vaction-day-0">regularly use their PTO</a>. Help employees forget about their work worries by limiting the number of tasks waiting upon returning from vacation.</p>
      <p><b>Check-in.</b> Your team should always feel comfortable with the idea of talking to their manager. Keeping the communication channel open will give them a chance to let someone know if something is going on. This shows employees that what they have to say matters and will allow for a plan to be made if there is something that needs to be addressed.</p>
      <p><b>Make Sure Employees Have What They Need</b>. Employees should have the proper resources to ensure their success. Asking employees what they need to perform at their best could make their work more effective. This could be a new tool, a need to hire someone new, or simply some extra training.</p>
      <p><b>Give Clear Roles</b>. The easiest way to avoid burnout in the workplace is to give each person a specific role and let them know exactly what is expected from them. Without specific roles, it can be difficult to point out where a problem has occurred. This can create frustration within the team and lead to burnout.</p>
      <p><b>Give Feedback</b>. Many people just want to feel that they belong in their company. Giving them feedback on their work is the best way to make them feel included. Also, let them be a part of the decision-making process. It’s essential to let them say what they have to say. Asking questions and getting them involved will give them a sense of ownership.</p>
      <p><b>Create a Positive Work Environment</b>. Working in a <a href="https://info.totalwellnesshealth.com/blog/7-tips-for-promoting-positivity-in-your-workplace">positive environment</a> presents many benefits to both employees and the company. Encouraging healthy behaviors, offering an employee assistance program (EAP), and willingness to make alterations to the environment such as seating arrangements, noise levels, and lighting and temperature can give employees the boost they need.  </p>
      <p><b>Offer flexibility.</b> Flexible hours, schedules, and the ability to work from home eliminate a lot of the challenges for full-time employees (especially working parents). As an added benefit, studies have shown that <a href="https://info.totalwellnesshealth.com/blog/annual-survey-shows-employees-want-work-flexibility">flexibility in the workplace</a> often leads to more productive, loyal, and happier employees.</p>
      <p>With the increased awareness regarding mental health at work, <a href="https://info.totalwellnesshealth.com/blog/heres-how-to-spot-burnout-in-the-workplace-and-what-to-do-about-it">employee burnout</a> is being recognized as a major health problem and more employers are realizing they need to address burnout.</p>
      <p>“As we move into the future of work where AI and robotics are co-working with humans, I think that well-being is going to become even more important. The reason I say that is because the things that make you human – like creativity, empathy, complex problem solving and storytelling – those types of things require us to be well. In order to have continued high-performance, we must take care of ourselves,” said Jen. </p>
