      <p>The Indonesian Film Festival (FFI) has announced this year’s nominees for the prestigious Piala Citra motion picture awards, with Garin Nugroho’s arthouse film <i>Kucumbu Tubuh Indahku </i>(Memories of My Body) receiving a total of 12 nominations, including Best Feature-Length Film, making it a leading contender despite the controversy surrounding its theatrical run.</p>
      <p><i>Kucumbu Tubuh Indahku </i><i>was also nominated for Best Original Screenplay and Garin for Best Director. </i>Muhammad Khan, who plays the lead protagonist in the film, is competing in the Best Actor category.</p>
      <p><i>Kucumbu Tubuh Indahku </i>had a rocky journey to the Piala Citra awards, as it was banned in several regions, including Depok in West Java and Palembang in South Sumatra, because of its allegedly homoerotic nature. Despite the backlash, the film was chosen in September to represent Indonesia at the 2020 Academy Awards.</p>
