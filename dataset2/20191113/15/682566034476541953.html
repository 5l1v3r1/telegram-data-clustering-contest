      <p>Cape Town - <b>Rhulani Mokwena</b> has been thrown in at the deep end at <b>Orlando Pirates</b> but <b>Steve Komphela</b> believes the experience will be crucial for his development.</p>
      <p>Mokwena is leading the Soweto giants in his very first job as a head coach on an interim basis and he is currently struggling to get the Buccaneers firing on all cylinders as they hover around mid-table.</p>
      <p>Komphela is convinced that the high-intensity environment will help Mokwena become a better coach, in the same way, the Kaizer Chiefs job helped the current Golden Arrows boss grow.</p>
      <p>"Rhulani is in an environment where it is not easy. I know very well what he is going through," Komphela said as quoted by <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/sport/soccer/psl/komphela-believes-mokwena-can-only-get-better-37114000">IOL</a>.</p>
      <p>"It is not easy, but we always talk. We tell him to listen and focus. It is a great honour and a privilege to be there.</p>
      <p>"So, enjoy it and do your job so that after two years, you can say 'I was at Pirates'. You don't sleep there (at Pirates). If you sleep, you are lucky."</p>
      <p>Reflecting on his own experiences, Komphela added: "When I left the environment I was at (at Chiefs) I had grey hair. When I went there, I was pitch black... but by the time I left it wasn't the same. But that's growth.</p>
      <p>"The greatest growth happens in discomfort. If you don't want to grow, be comfortable. But if you want to grow, get into a territory that is uncomfortable."</p>
