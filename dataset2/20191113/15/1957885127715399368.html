      <p>At the risk of showing my age here, remember when console games launched at £30? What a time to be alive. Well, in an attempt to replicate that feeling for you, I've gathered up a number of top console games that are now at that price or less. Ah, yes, it feels just like the good old days already!</p>
      <p>Let's start things off with the Dark Souls Trilogy, which has fallen to its lowest ever price on PS4 at £29.99. Because why have just one tough-as-nails RPG when you can have three? I say good luck to you if you try to play all three back-to-back!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MG7Y4CB?tag=eurgam-m-21">Dark Souls Trilogy on PS4 for £29.99 from Amazon UK</a>
        </li>

        <figcaption>I bet he's got an eye for a good deal.</figcaption>

      <p>Sticking on a similar theme, you can also get Code Vein on PS4 and Xbox One for £29.99. The influence of the Souls series on this Bandai Namco action-RPG is unmistakable, with Edwin calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-01-10-code-vein-gameplay-bloodborne-souls">anime Bloodborne with added buddy bonding</a>". A decent shout, then, if you've mastered From Software's entire back catalogue and are itching for something similar.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/code-vein-2022755">Code Vein on PS4 for £29.99 from GAME</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/code-vein-1330175">Code Vein on Xbox One for £29.99 from GAME</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For an RPG that isn't going to be quite as punishing but no less gruelling in terms of length, you can get the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0082-CUSA12025_00-KINGDOMHEARTSALL">Kingdom Hearts All-In-One Package for £29.69 from the PSN Store</a>. This version comes with every single game in the Kingdom Hearts series so far, with all their unnecessarily complex subtitles. I'll see you in a few hundred hours.</p>
