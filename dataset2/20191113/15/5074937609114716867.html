      <p>Ho, Nov. 13, GNA - Seyram Agbodemegbe, 42, a driver, has appeared before a Ho Circuit Court for allegedly misappropriating a cash sum of GH¢46,194.63 belonging to the National Investment Bank (NIB), Ho Branch.</p>
      <p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge and was granted bail to reappear on December 3, 2019.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Police Inspector Stephen Atidzon told the court presided over by Madam Priscilla Dikro-Ofori, that the complainant was Prince Kofi Adzah, Operations Manager of the Bank, whilst the accused is a driver in-charge of “On Site” delivery van of the Bank.</p>
      <p>He said the accused also has responsibilities of conveying cashiers with monies to the Bank or collecting physical cash sales from those institutions to the Bank for deposit.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said during the month of October, 2019, the Bank reviewed transactions of some of its top clients where it was detected that the GH¢46,194.63 collected by the accused from one of the institutions was not deposited at the Bank.</p>
      <p>He said the accused was therefore issued with a query and he admitted dishonestly appropriating the money and a complaint was lodged with the police and he was arrested.</p>
      <p>Inspector Atidzon said during police investigations, the accused admitted stealing the money in his cautioned statement and alleged that he used it for his father’s funeral and was therefore charged.</p>
