      <p>It has been revealed that a Chinese is Meath's favourite takeaway meal according to a survey carried out by Just Eat. By reviewing the number of orders placed for each type of takeaway, data reveals the favourites of each region.</p>
      <p>While Chinese is  Meath's favourite takeaway meal much like those in the capital,  their most frequent order is chicken balls, our go-to takeaway treat is a spice bag. </p>
      <p>It’s actually pizza orders that take the top spot with 16 regions across the country ordering their carb cravings from pizza takeaway restaurants. Chinese follows in second spot whilst only eight cities order the takeaway the most - if you’re not buying pizza then it’s likely that Chinese is to be your choice.</p>
      <p>In order of preference, we're most likely going to be ordering our meals from;</p>
      <p>1. Chinese</p>
      <p>2. Pizza</p>
      <p>3. Fish<br/>&amp; Chips</p>
      <p>4. Indian</p>
      <p>5. Kebab</p>
      <p>6. Thai</p>
      <p>7. Turkish</p>
      <p>8. Burger</p>
      <p>9. Italian</p>
      <p>The classic Friday favourite of Fish &amp; Chips, maybe it’s a curry from your local Indian, or possibly Chinese is your favourite every time.</p>
