      <h1>Khabib Nurmagomedov's message to Floyd Mayweather about potential boxing fight</h1>
      <h2>Nurmagomedov has been linked with a fight with Mayweather since he beat McGregor last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:13:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has dismissed the idea of fighting Floyd Mayweather in a boxing ring.</p>
      <p>The UFC's lightweight champion has been linked with a clash against the retired superstar since his win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> last year.</p>
      <p>His father recently said his son would be willing to face Mayweather after he defends his 155lb belt against Tony Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov said: "Floyd, I respect your wish to fight Khabib.</p>
      <p>"At the moment we have our most crucial moment, when he have to hold the best fight in the history of the UFC.</p>

      <p>"Twelve against 12 in a series of victories (in the UFC) and all the fans are waiting for this fight.</p>
      <p>"We’ve been preparing for this fight for more than a year. Five months and the fight (with Ferguson) should take place.</p>
      <p>"First of all we will need to do some boxing training and we need a camp – with Lomachenko Sr for half a year. Why not!!!"</p>
      <p>And the UFC champion has reiterated that stance.</p>
      <p>"I think it would be better for me to fight Tony Ferguson rather than Floyd at this stage of my career," Nurmagomedov said. “I’m more focused on MMA.</p>

      <p>"If he moved to MMA we would fight but I don’t think it’s possible. I don’t have plans to have a boxing fight next year."</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov was last in action in September when he choked out Dustin Poirier in the third round.</p>
      <p>He is expected to face Ferguson in April or May and may not fight into 2021.</p>
      <p>"My retirement is coming. A couple of fights more," he said.</p>
      <p>"It would be wrong to talk about what I’m going to do after that because I’m currently working on different projects.</p>

      <p>"I’ll work on them later. I won’t get lost for sure."</p>
      <p>He also named his preferred successor as the 155lb champion.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to leave my belt for any Tom, Dick or Harry. I want the succession of generations to happen," he added.</p>
      <p>"I want to leave the belt and Islam Makhachev to take it.</p>
      <p>“It would be great if my retirement coincided with Islam’s title shot.”</p>
