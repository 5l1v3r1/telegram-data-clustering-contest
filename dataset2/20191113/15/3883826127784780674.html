        <b>Belgium's Gerben Thijssen is in intensive care after being injured in a heavy crash in the first night of racing at the Ghent Six Day.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lotto Soudal rider, 21, suffered three small brain haemorrhages and fractured three ribs and a collarbone.</p>
      <p>He will have further examinations on Wednesday and is expected to remain in intensive care for up to three days.</p>
      <p>"Gerben remained conscious at all times," <a href="https://www.z6sdaagse.be/en/update-on-the-condition-of-gerben-thijssen/">said team spokesperson Philippe Maertens.</a> "His condition is stable."</p>

      <p>Thijssen crashed on the last lap of the supersprint after making contact with Denmark's Oliver Wulff Frederiksen.</p>
      <p>He was attended to on track and, after a request by the other riders, the crash brought an early halt to the night's racing.</p>
      <p>Britain's Mark Cavendish, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/38043726">won the event with Bradley Wiggins in 2016,</a> also crashed during the one-lap time-trial.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, who this year is partnered with seven-time winner Iljo Keisse, was not seriously injured but had to withdraw from the remainder of Tuesday's racing.</p>
      <p>After the first day, Jules Hesters and Otto Vergaerde lead with 46 points, one point ahead of 2018 runners-up Kenny de Ketele and Robbe Ghys.</p>
