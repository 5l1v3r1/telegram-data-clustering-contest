        <b>KISUMU, Kenya, Nov 13 – A candidate in the ongoing Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examinations is recuperating at the Kombewa Sub-County Hospital in Seme after he was allegedly burnt by a chemical while doing practical paper.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hospital Medical Superintendent David Okeyo Wednesday said the patient who is a student at St Peters Mixed Secondary School will continue writing the remaining exams while in hospital.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The student was reportedly burnt while handling Xylene, a solvent candidates were expected to heat and observe the reaction, exploded.</p>
      <p>Hospital authorities said they have been directed not to grant access to the student given that he is also still writing exams.</p>
      <p>Kisumu County Director of Education Isaac Atebe promised to issue a comprehensive statement regarding the incident.</p>
      <p>Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha on Monday defended Kenya National Examination Council’s (KNEC) decision to deploy Xylene – a colorless, sweet-smelling liquid solvent – in the ongoing Kenya Certificate for Secondary Education (KCSE) exams.</p>
      <p>Magoha who was responding to safety concerns raised by Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET), said chemistry instructors had been trained on safe handling of the chemical.</p>

      <p>“Most of chemicals used in chemistry are harmful, Xylene in this case is not as dangerous as Chlorine and Bromine and have been used since when I was in high school,” the CS pointed out.</p>
      <p>“Those people trying to make noise and misinforming the public may have expected a different substance.”</p>
      <p>He urged examination centres to take standard precautionary measures.</p>
      <p>The chemical was used by the students who sat for Chemistry Paper III – practical exam – and reportedly caused some teachers health complications, KUPEET had stated.</p>
      <p>KUPPET Secretary General Akello Misori vowed to sue for damages on behalf of two teachers he said had developed breathing complications after handling the harmful chemical.</p>
      <p>“Many students and teachers have complained of the side effects after exposure the chemical,” he said.</p>
