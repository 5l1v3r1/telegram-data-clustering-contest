      <p>Arsene Wenger has landed a new job as FIFA's Chief of Global Football Development.</p>
      <p>The legendary <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss will be the "leading authority on technical matters, as a member of the Football and Technical Advisory Panels involved in IFAB's review and decision-making process on potential changes to the Laws of the Game."</p>
      <p>The Frenchman said: "I look forward to this important challenge.</p>
      <p>"The new FIFA we have seen emerging has the sport itself at the heart of its objectives. I know I can contribute and will put all my energy into this."</p>
      <p>Reacting to the appointment, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said: "Arsene's profound knowledge and passion for the different aspects of our game sets him apart as one of the most respected personalities in football.</p>

      <p>"His arrival is another example of how we keep strengthening our purpose to bring FIFA back to football."</p>
      <p>Wenger has been out of work since leaving Arsenal in 2018 after 22 years in charge of the north London club.</p>
      <p>He has worked sporadically as a pundit for beIN SPORTS, and has hinted he would like to return to football management.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old was most recently linked with the vacant Bayern Munich job following Niko Kovac's sacking.</p>
      <p>Wenger confirmed that the German giants did approach him, but claims he was never in the running to get the job.</p>

      <p>He told beIN SPORTS: "First of all, I was never a candidate, I was approached but not in the running for the job.</p>
      <p>"That is clear and definite, but it does not necessarily mean I am done with management."</p>
