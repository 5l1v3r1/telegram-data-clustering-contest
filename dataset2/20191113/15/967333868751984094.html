          <figcaption>Sarah Skinner with her 'Grab Life By The...' photo has become the winner of the 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography.&lt;br /&gt;"I had been watching the younger members of the Savuti Marsh pride in Botswana frolic and play for a while at one of the waterholes. As the heat started to rise one of the two dominant adult males of the pride decided to move from his position to seek shade. As the male stood and started walking off, one of the young cubs, who is blind in one eye ran toward the male, leaping up at him. Rather than leaping onto his back as we expected, the cub's focus appeared to be directed towards the adult male's nether regions, with claws fully protracted! Who knows if it was intentional or just slightly misguided aim. Had the cub been successful in his target there would have been an unhappy male lion, and we suspect a scolded lion cub. Fortunately for the cub and the male, he narrowly missed the 'crown jewels' and the male walked off, with all body parts unscathed!" she said. © Photo: Sarah Skinner / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>

          <figcaption>'Family Disagreement' by Croatian photographer Vlado Pirsa, winner of the Spectrum Photo Creatures in the Air Award in the 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.&lt;br /&gt;Here Two birds were captured during courtship and before nesting. They struck strange poses and seemed to be arguing between themselves. Imagine that a bird couple is having a spat -maybe her husband was out too late, with the boys last night - drinking at some pub, the Mrs is pretty angry - as it's not the first time. He tries to explain "there was only one drink after the last one". © Photo: Vlado Pirsa / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>

          <figcaption>'Deer - What Deer?' by British photographer Mike Rowe, has been praised for his entry in the 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.&lt;br /&gt;"Shooting the Red Deer route in Richmond Park, I noticed this deer covered in bracken. It's not unusual for them to adorn themselves with bracken and grass, but this one's taken it to the extremes", he said. © Photo: Mike Rowe / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>

          <figcaption>'Oh, My!' photo by Harry M. Walker won in the category: Affinity Photo People's Choice Award. &lt;br /&gt;"Unlike most other marine mammals, sea otters have no blubber and rely on exceptionally thick fur to keep warm. As the ability of the fur to repel water depends on its utmost cleanliness, sea otters spend much of their time (while they are not sleeping or eating) grooming, offering photographers an unlimited number of anthropomorphic opportunities", he said. © Photo: Harry M.

          <figcaption>'Laid Back' by American photographer Thomas D. Mangelsen has been highly praised at the 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards. &lt;br /&gt;"On the last day in Gombe Stream National Park, magic happened when a family group of a dozen chimps came down from the trees into a clearing. It was almost as if to offer a greeting to their most passionate human advocate, Dr Jane Goodall. This photograph is of a ten-month-old chimp named Gombe, grandson of Gremlin the chimp that Jane studied and knew well. Gombe was leaning against his mother, Glitter. This image speaks to similar behaviours between our closest relatives in the animal world", he said. © Photo: Thomas D. Mangelsen / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>

This penguin was standing in the water all by himself when the water started churning, then to splashing and then a full eruption. When it was all done, the penguin looked around and carried on with the rest of his day" he said. © Photo: Eric Keller / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>

          <figcaption>'Waltz Gone Wrong' by British photographer Alastair Marsh was praised at the 2019 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards.&lt;br /&gt;"I spent a few days at a well-known site near Amsterdam in Holland watching and photographing foxes. These two females were actually having a scrap with each other, clearly not happy with being close. People keeping saying to me that the series of photos make them look like they're doing the 'waltz' dance. This image always makes me smile given the pose!" he said. © Photo: Alastair Marsh / Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards 2019</figcaption>
