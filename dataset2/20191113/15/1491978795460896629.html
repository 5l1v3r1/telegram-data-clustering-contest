        <i>The tale of a desperate young fighter in Lisbon features a soulful performance but is dogged by boxing movie cliches</i>
      </p>
      <p>There are echoes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ken-loach">Ken Loach</a> in this Portuguese drama about a young immigrant boxer, a decent kid with no job prospects and few opportunities. Igor Regalla gives the film a heart with his disarmingly warm central performance as a young fighter from Cape Verde, a former colony. But the film’s claim to uncompromising realism is let down by a few cliched scenes that feel recycled from earlier boxing movies about plucky kids fighting for a place in the world.</p>
      <p>The film opens with Gabriel (Regalla) in a boxing ring, dazedly absorbing ferocious blows. Why isn’t he defending himself? Flash back a few months, and he’s arriving in Lisbon to live with his aunt Alice (Mina Andala) and her son in a rundown estate of high-rise flats. Gabriel is drawn to the local boxing gym where his dad, who came to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/portugal">Portugal</a> years ago, used to train, but he’s nowhere to be found.</p>
      <p>Alice tells him to keep his head down, but one night Gabriel punches a local thug (José Condessa) whose drug dealer boss, sensing the opportunity to make a few bucks, sets up a boxing match between the two young men. Naturally, both fall for the same girl, Elisa (Ana Marta Ferreira), which only aggravates the grudge. Meanwhile, a kind-hearted sex worker helps Gabriel to track down his dad.</p>
      <p>Regalla’s soulful performance is the main reason to watch. And director Nuno Bernardo deserves credit for keeping the stakes low – the boxing match at the end of the film is not a title fight; just neighbourhood guys betting a few euros on kids who’ll only ever be famous in their own postcode. Still, the film’s shuffling of boxing cliches is hard to get past – and none of the performances from the bad guys feels remotely threatening, though the script doesn’t shy away from the everyday racism Gabriel faces on the streets.</p>
      <p>• Gabriel is released in the UK on 15 November.</p>
