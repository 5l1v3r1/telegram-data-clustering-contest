      <h1>Hyundai Grand i10 now sold as petrol-only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:45:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jaiveer Mehra</a></address>
      <p>The Grand i10 is now available with only a petrol or CNG option; limited to just two trim levels.</p>
      <p>Hyundai has silently removed diesel-powered variants of its Grand i10 hatchback.  At the time of the launch of the new Grand i10 Nios, we had reported that <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/hyundai-to-discontinue-grand-i10-diesel-ahead-of-grand-i10-nios-launch-413797"><b>Hyundai would discontinue the diesel Grand i10 and reduce the number of variants offered</b></a>. Also in line with our previous story, the hatchback is now only available in the mid-spec Magna and Sportz trims.</p>
      <p>Priced from Rs 5.83 - 6.50 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the Grand i10 is now sold with the existing 1.2-litre petrol engine in standard and bi-fuel (CNG and petrol) spec. The standard petrol iteration is good for 83hp and 114Nm, while the bi-fuel motor develops 81.6hp/110Nm and 66.3hp/98Nm when run on petrol and CNG, respectively. The automatic gearbox is also no longer available, with a 5-speed manual being the sole unit on offer. The Sportz trim is the only variant to get the CNG option. It is not yet known if the car has been updated to meet BS6 regulations.</p>
      <p>The deletion of the fully-loaded model now helps reduce overlap with the newly launched Grand i10 Nios. It also means that the Grand i10 now does not get equipment like alloy wheels, rear wash wiper, push-button start, auto climate control and a height adjustable driver seat. The Sportz trim though continues to come with a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, a rear parking camera and power-folding wing mirrors.</p>
      <p>The revision means that the prices for the Grand i10 now start just above the Santro (Rs 4.30 - 5.79 lakh) and end in line with a mid-spec petrol Grand i10 Nios.</p>
