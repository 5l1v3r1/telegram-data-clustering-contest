      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Duke</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/">Duchess of Sussex</a> have reportedly told the Queen that they won't be spending Christmas with the royal family at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>The couple were originally due to head to the States with son Archie for a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/meghan-and-prince-harry-plan-to-take-six-weeks-off-before-christmas/">six-week break</a> from the limelight.</p>
      <p>It was thought they would spend Archie's first Thanksgiving in his mother's homeland, before heading back to his father's for his first Christmas.</p>

      <p>Royal biographer Ingrid Seward added that Christmas at Sandringham can be "quite stressful" and the couple may not want to go with Archie at such a young age.</p>
      <p>She said: "I think it’s sad they don’t want to be part of the family gathering, particularly now the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are in their dotage."</p>

      <p>Ingrid also revealed that Harry's grandmother may be upset that he hasn't decided to spend the festive season with his family, but her "stiff upper lip" will stop her from showing it.</p>

      <p>She added: "The Queen might be a little hurt but she’s far too gracious to ever let it show or be known."</p>
