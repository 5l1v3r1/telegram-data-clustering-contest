      <p>DHAKA: Some 25 people, many members of Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League party, were charged with murder Wednesday over the brutal killing last month of a university student who criticized the government on social media.<br/>The battered body of 21-year-old Abrar Fahad was found in his dormitory hours after he wrote a post on Facebook slamming Dhaka for signing a water-sharing deal with India.<br/>Police said he was beaten to death by fellow students — many members of the ruling Awami League’s university branch. Others had links to the pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL).<br/>“Murder charges have been pressed to the court against 25 men,” police spokesman Monirul Islam told AFP.<br/>“According to the CCTV footage, at least 11 were directly involved in beating Fahad to death.”<br/>He said the accused had created an “environment of fear” on campus, with physical abuse and other coercive behavior.<br/>“They were using their political identity as shelter,” he said, referring to their links to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s party.<br/>Fahad’s death sparked widespread protests among students in the country, prompting Hasina to promise his killers would be severely punished.</p>
