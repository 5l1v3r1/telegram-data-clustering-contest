      <p>The only <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470448/apparently-the-twilight-movies-are-hits-on-hulu?pv=search"><i>Twilight</i> duo</a> is making out pretty well for themselves these days. While Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have both made a wide variety of films since their vampire romance, both are currently focused on major franchise properties. Stewart is about to bow in the most recent <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2484492/charlies-angels-review-the-female-centric-origin-story-expertly-adapts-to-the-modern-world"><i>Charlie's Angels</i></a> movie, and Pattinson is getting g ready to jump in front of cameras as <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483707/see-how-robert-pattinson-has-started-training-for-the-batman?pv=search">the new Batman</a>.</p>
      <p>The topic of Batman actually comes up in <i>Charlie Angels</i> which led <a href="https://twitter.com/Fandango/status/1194041438935244801">Fandango</a> to ask the cast about their favorite Batman. Pattinson's name, of course, came up, even though opinions obviously have to wait on that one. Kristen Stewart admits a particular affinity for Michael Keaton's Batman, and she hopes that Robert Pattinson gets to use one of his iconic lines. Check out the video below.</p>

      <p>When Batman made his big screen debut with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475445/watch-michael-keaton-pull-a-tom-holland-by-spoiling-batman-right-before-it-opened?pv=search">Michael Keaton</a>, in the very opening scene, we got the moment that is probably most famous from that film. A Thug asks Batman what he is, and he responds with the simple "I'm Batman." It's not a line that has been repeated in every Batman movie, but Christian Bale also used it in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Batman-Begins-993.html?pv=search"><i>Batman Begins</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Because it has been done before. It's certainly possible we could here Robert Pattinson say "I'm Batman." It depends how much a writer/director like <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474244/apparently-matt-reeves-batman-movie-could-include-robin?pv=search">Matt Reeves</a> goes in for those "fan service" sort of moments. The only reason to include the line will likely be for the recognition from the audience.</p>
      <p>From everything we've been told, this Batman movie will not be an origin story, and so there likely won't need to be any sort of introduction scene in the movie. It's likely everybody will already know who Batman is. The previous times that "I'm Batman" has appeared, it's literally been done as an explanation, because Batman is new and nobody knows who he is yet.</p>
      <p>If you've somehow never seen the iconic Michael Keaton Batman sequence, or just want a reminder, check it out in the video below.</p>

      <p>Whether or not Robert Pattinson gets to say "I'm Batman," he certainly will have the opportunity to make the role his own. He'll probably have a few lines that might become iconic in their own right. The movie has put together an impressive cast with Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman, Paul Dano as Riddler and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483912/looks-like-the-batman-has-found-its-penguin?pv=search">Colin Farrell as Penguin</a>. Jeffrey Wright is also taking the role of Commissioner Gordon and Andy Serkis is reported to be taking the part of Alfred the butler. It's unclear if there are any other major roles to be cast, but even if that's the complete core of the movie, it looks incredible.</p>
      <p>If only we didn't have to wait for <i>The Batman</i> until 2021.</p>
