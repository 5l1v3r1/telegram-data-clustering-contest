      <p>If you're a social media fiend, then Voxi's Black Friday SIM only deals with extra data will be just the thing for you.</p>
      <p>Or for some teen in your life who can't be trusted with a pay monthly plan at least. Voxi - Vodafone's youth brand - has two pretty good looking deals on right now, offering prospective customers 8GB data for £10, rather than the usual 6GB, and a whopping 20GB of data for £15, up from 15GB.</p>
      <p>The added benefit of Voxi is that you can use social media apps and their websites without eating into your data, including Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. I'm no youth, but this looks like it was made for me.</p>
      <p>If that looks appealing to you also, you'll be pleased to know that you can switch to the network and keep your number to boot.
