      <p>A taxi driver told how he took two fare dodgers to their parents' houses when they refused to pay for a £46 journey.</p>
      <p>Cabbie Kev beeped his horn at a passing police van in Liverpool after claiming two passengers tried to make a run for it after their friend left.</p>
      <p>Video footage taken by Kev and shared with his fans on social media, shows the moment he flagged down police officers and told them: "£46 on the clock and they haven't paid me", the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Liverpool Echo</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Kev said: "I turned around and the woman was saying the man who had walked off had the money.</p>
      <p>"I said to them at the end of the day I've got to get paid, I've got a family to feed."</p>
      <p>Kev said the two passengers who went searching for their missing friend, eventually got back into the cab but told him they couldn't pay until "they had got some stuff from the shop."</p>

      <p>He said: "I didn't want stuff, I just wanted the money I was owed on the meter.</p>
      <p>"One's f***ed off - excuse the language"</p>
      <p>"Then I saw a police van at the lights so I beeped my horn.</p>
      <p>"They pulled up further down the road and I said to them they're not paying their fare."</p>
      <p>Kev and the officers then took the passengers to their parents' house to get the fare he was owed.</p>
      <p>He added: "The police were brilliant. They took them to their parents' houses and I followed behind in my cab.</p>
      <p>"The parents were the ones that paid me in the end, I can't thank the police enough for their help."</p>
      <p>Kev, who regularly posts videos taken in his cab to fans on social media, filmed what happened on his phone and uploaded it to Youtube.</p>

      <p>The footage shows the moment he beeped his horn at the passing police van and pulled up to speak to an officer.</p>
      <p>In the video Kev can be heard saying to the officer: "£46 on the clock and they haven't paid me they're going round the shop and god knows what, there was three of them but one's f***ed off - excuse the language.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to blow them up but I've got a family to feed, I don't want to be a grass but I want my money."</p>
      <p>While speaking to the passengers Kev said: "I've given you loads of chances and you've f***ed up."</p>
      <p>Kev said: "I was fuming, I just want to make an honest living.</p>

      <p>"Sometimes if someone is a bit short of a pound or two I'll say It's okay but I would have had to stay out for three or four hours to make that back.</p>
      <p>"People don't realise that you're on the front line as a black cab driver.</p>
      <p>"I love this city and that's why I film what I do because I like to show what goes on everyday as a real life taxi driver."</p>
