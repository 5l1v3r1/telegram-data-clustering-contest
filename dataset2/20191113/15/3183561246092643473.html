      <p>If you're a fan of <i>Stargate SG-1</i> but wished it looked a little prettier in 2019, a citizen hero has got your back.</p>
      <p>Before you get too excited, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjOmqCVYQYb9XFkapcpoVqA">YouTuber CaptRobau</a> has not upscaled all 10 seasons. That would breach copyright just a tad. But he has uploaded an 8 minute video to show some samples of his home-grown remastering efforts.</p>
      <p>He has also given the same treatment to the likes of <i>Babylon 5, Star Trek Deep Space Nine</i> and <i>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</i>.</p>
      <p>This is super cool, because despite the popularity of <i>SG-1</i>, and even though it <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/stargate-sg1">appears on streaming services</a>, it has never been scaled up to 1080p, let alone 4K.</p>
      <p>You may find it a little difficult to not a lot of difference if you're watching it on a phone or even laptop. CaptRobau recommends giving it a whirl on a 4K screen if you can.</p>

      <p>It looks quite good and makes me wonder how long before an official remaster is done.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, this has given me the urge to do a full 214-episode re-watch.</p>
