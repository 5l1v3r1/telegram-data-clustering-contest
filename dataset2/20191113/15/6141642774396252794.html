      <p>A trial relating to the theft of millions of pounds worth of art from a cider-making family’s home has been dropped, prosecutors have confirmed.</p>
      <p>Fifteen paintings and a safe containing £400,000 worth of jewellery were taken from the home of Esmond and Susie Bulmer while they were away in March 2009.</p>
      <p>During the raid, the couple’s house-sitter was hooded and tied to banisters by burglars wearing balaclavas who entered the sprawling property known as the Pavilions.</p>

      <p>In 2018, eleven men went on trial at Bristol Crown Court in connection with the burglary and an alleged subsequent insurance fraud.</p>
      <p>Judge Julian Lambert ruled there was insufficient evidence against the defendants on a number of charges in July 2018, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal in February this year.</p>
      <p>A second trial on the remaining counts was due to take place in January but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided there is “no longer a realistic prospect of conviction” and offered no evidence in the case.</p>
      <p>It can now be reported that Judge Julian Lambert, who presided over the trial in Bristol, described the prosecution’s case as based on “fragments of suspicion and coincidences”.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the CPS said: “As in all complex cases, we have a duty to keep all material under review.</p>
      <p>“Developments in this case meant that after serious and extensive review, we concluded there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction against any of the defendants and so the prosecution had to be stopped.”</p>
      <p>It is understood that the CPS applied to amend the indictment against defendants in the second trial but that this was refused.</p>

      <p>New information led to a further review in the case, which led to prosecutors offering no evidence during a hearing at Bristol Crown Court last week.</p>
      <p>Judge Lambert ruled that six of the 11 defendants had no case to answer in the first trial, which started in June 2018.</p>
      <p>They faced charges of conspiracy to commit burglary on the Bulmer’s home, conspiracy to defraud Mr Bulmer and the family’s insurer Hiscox, becoming concerned in a money laundering agreement and conspiracy to handle stolen goods.</p>
      <p>The second trial was due to feature four defendants who faced charges of storing stolen goods, and one defendant accused of perverting the course of justice.</p>

      <p>A force spokesman said Mr Bulmer, a former MP, and his wife were visited by the chief constable following the initial investigation.</p>
      <p>The chief constable “accepted that errors were made” and apologised to the couple.</p>
      <p>“The investigation has been regularly reviewed and in 2015 a further line of enquiry was identified resulting in a new robust police investigation being launched,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>“All but one of the paintings taken in 2009 were recovered and arrests made.</p>
      <p>“This was a complex, detailed and long-running investigation and we presented a comprehensive file for the CPS, who decided to prosecute.</p>
      <p>“We share the obvious disappointment of the Bulmer family and their house-sitter in not being able to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.”</p>
      <p>During the trial, Mr Bulmer told how he raised concerns about the original police investigation with the chief constable as well as then-Home Secretary Theresa May.</p>
      <p>In one letter, he described officers as “brain-dead, incompetent, of a low calibre and deplorable” but told jurors the quality of the later investigation was “of a wholly different order”.</p>
      <p>Private detectives organised a £175,000 reward for the return of 14 of the paintings in 2015.</p>
