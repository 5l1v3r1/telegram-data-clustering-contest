      <p>PRAGUE, Nov 13 — Czech Davis Cup champion Tomas Berdych plans to announce his retirement from tennis in London on Saturday ending 17 years as a professional.</p>
      <p>Berdych’s father Martin broke the news to the Czech tabloid <i>Blesk</i> today and Berdych himself then recorded a tweet confirming the retirement.</p>
      <p>“Hi guys, if you want to have a little surprise, just don’t see any media and social networks, but you and I know it’s impossible these days,” Berdych told his fans, sitting in a car.</p>
      <p>“I had it planned as a little surprise on Saturday when I’m going to be in London but now it’s not even possible because it’s all over but it’s fine.”</p>
      <p>“More information is going to come on Saturday so stay tuned,” said Berdych.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old current world number 103 has won 13 ATP titles, reaching a career-high fourth rank in 2015.</p>
      <p>Berdych was in the ATP top 10 nonstop between July 2010 and January 2017.</p>
      <p>He has never won a grand slam title, coming closest at Wimbledon in 2010 where he beat Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic before falling at the hands of Rafael Nadal in the final.</p>
      <p>Together with doubles specialist Radek Stepanek, he led the Czech Republic to Davis Cup wins in 2012 and 2013. — AFP</p>
