      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s union of bank employees said its members would continue to strike on Thursday, extending industrial action that has shut banks across the country this week.</p>
      <p>George al-Hajj, president of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees, told Reuters that Lebanon’s banking association would talk to the interior ministry to find a way to provide more security. It remained unclear when the banks would reopen.</p>
      <p>The union called for the strike over fears for the safety of bank staff, as protests sweep the country and customers demand access to their deposits after banks imposed new curbs.</p>
