      <h1>Kieran Tierney is an Arsenal transfer 'steal' as £25m star backed to come alive after international break</h1>
      <h2>Tierney was brought to the Emirates by Unai Emery to help shore up Arsenal's leaky defence but didn't feature against Leicester.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:06:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>Lifelong Arsenal fan Darren Bent insists the signing of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> has been a 'steal'</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> left-back was one of five summer arrivals for the Gunners alongside Nicolas Pepe, David Luiz, Gabriel Martinelli and Dani Ceballos</p>
      <p>Tierney was brought to the Emirates by Unai Emery to help shore up <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> 's leaky defence for £25million and is finally start to make an impact after double hernia surgery.</p>
      <p>Nacho Monreal departed in the summer and Sead Kolasinac has never passed the eye test during his stay with the Gunners.</p>

      <p>Tierney eventually made his debut in Arsenal's 5-0 Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest and is trending in the right direction despite starting on the bench against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Former Aston Villa and Sunderland striker Bent has been impressed by the full-back's impact but believes there is still more to come.</p>
      <p>He told <i>Football Insider</i> : "He has been a steal and he's only going to get better and better.</p>
      <p>"You can understand why Arsenal paid the money for him, he's a very good player, he's an exciting player.</p>
      <p>"At the same time, you can't push him too much and expect too much from him because he's just come back from injury, he's adapting to the Premier League - the Premier League is a tough, gruelling league.</p>

      <p>"He needs time to develop but at the minute he's going along really, really well."</p>
      <p>Tierney  wasn't selected for Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifying squad to aid his return to full fitness from that hernia problem and national team boss Steve Clarke revealed it was at the behest of Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Clarke said: "Kieran's got an ongoing issue that Arsenal are keen to address in the next international break and Arsenal asked us not to select him.</p>
      <p>"It's a little bit frustrating and it's obviously frustrating for Kieran as well."</p>
      <p>This is a major blow to Scotland who are also without Liverpool star Andy Robertson , and ex-international Barry Ferguson has blasted Arsenal over the issue on the latest <i><b>Fergie Time</b> </i>podcast.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think that's out of order from Arsenal</p>
      <p>"Tierney is one of the best players in the squad ... but Arsenal are obviously calling the shots."</p>
