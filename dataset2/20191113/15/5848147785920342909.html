      <h1>Crisis talks over ABC Olympics coverage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:57:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/eamonnt/" target="_blank">Eamonn Tiernan</a></address>
      <p>Crisis talks are being planned between the Australian Olympic Committee and the ABC in a bid to broadcast the 2020 Tokyo Olympics live on radio.</p>
      <p>The ABC has said its budget is too stretched to afford the $1 million needed to send commentators to Japan and set up its broadcasting system.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/sport/rio-olympics-2016/2019/11/11/abc-tokyo-olympic-radio/">shock decision ends 67 years of live Olympics coverage from the public broadcaster</a>.</p>
      <p>The AOC labelled the decision short-sighted and a “great let-down to Australians”.</p>
      <p>AOC boss Matt Carroll wrote to ABC chairwoman Ita Buttrose on Tuesday afternoon requesting a meeting to discuss a solution.</p>
      <p>The ABC confirmed on Wednesday that Ms Buttrose had received the letter and would look to meet with the AOC at “the earliest opportunity”.</p>
      <p>It is understood the AOC are keen to explore all avenues that could help raise the funds needed to fund the broadcast.</p>
      <p>An indexation freeze on the ABC in the 2018 budget led to $83.8 million in cuts, while 600 jobs have been lost in the past five years.</p>
      <p>Financial restrictions placed on the ABC by the federal government since 2014 mean by 2022 the public broadcaster will have lost $783 million in funding.</p>
      <p>Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said the Olympics decision would disappoint many Australians but added it was the ABC’s responsibility to explain the decision.</p>
      <p>ABC programming director Judith Whelan said the budget was “running hot”.</p>
      <p>“Our budget is very tight. It has been tightened tremendously over the past five years and we are facing more budgetary pressure at the moment,” Ms Whelan said.</p>
      <p>The AOC has also written to the Sports Minister Richard Colbeck and Health Minister Greg Hunt.</p>
      <p>The ABC still intends to provide daily Olympic updates on ABC News and ABC Grandstand.</p>
