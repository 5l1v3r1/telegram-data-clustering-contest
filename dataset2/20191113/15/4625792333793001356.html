      <h1>'Subpoena Colada': DC bars open early and offer specials for impeachment hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:14:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:14</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Bars and restaurants across Washington, D.C., are cashing in on the impeachment hearings against President Trump, opening both their establishments and their bottles.</p>
      <p>The first public impeachment hearings <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democratic-impeachment-push-goes-on-public-trial">begin Wednesday morning</a> with testimony from Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. After weeks of closed-door testimony, a bevy of figures are expected to testify openly during the public phase of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Duffy’s Irish Pub will be serving special drinks named the “Subpoena Colada” and “James and the Giant Impeachment,” <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/470140-dc-bars-to-open-early-for-impeachment-mania">according</a> to the <i>Hill</i>. The restaurant boasts eight large TVs for patrons to watch the hearings as they imbibe on the bar’s “happy hearing hours” deals, featuring $5 rail drinks and $2 off wine and beer.</p>
      <p>Hawk ‘n’ Dove will open at 10 a.m. to air the hearings. In addition to all of the bar's TVs tuning in to what is happening on Capitol Hill, the locale will serve its happy hour menu all day.</p>
      <p>Union Pub opens at 9:50 a.m. and will feature specials that play off an "im'peach'ment" theme. The peach-flavored cocktails will be available for $7 apiece and include “Impeachment Please,” a drink that contains peach-flavored Jim Beam, orange bitters, and simple syrup. Another drink, “I got 99 Problems but Impeachment Ain’t One” contains Sobieski peach vodka, orange juice, peach Schnapps, Sprite, and lemon libation.</p>
      <p>The pub will also be serving $15 Budweiser and Bud Light buckets.</p>
      <p>The Midlands Beer Garden opens the earliest, at 9:30 a.m., and will air the impeachment hearings on two 100-inch projectors. Six-dollar Irish coffees will be around for those who need a bit of caffeine with their alcohol, and mulled ciders will also be available for $6.</p>
      <p>Entrepreneurial bars in the District have tied their beverages to politics in the past. One bar <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/dc-bar-offers-drink-specials-every-time-trump-fires-white-house-staffer">offered drink specials</a> every time a staffer left Trump’s turbulent White House. Late last year, during the partial government shutdown, some bars offered food and drink “ <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-shutdown-starts-with-spirits-as-furloughed-employees-get-discounts">shutdown specials</a>.” Local bars and restaurants <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/comey-hearing-packs-washington-bars-this-is-peak-dc">also capitalized off</a> of former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony and the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller.</p>
