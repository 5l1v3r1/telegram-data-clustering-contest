      <p>Angela Griffin is keen to make a permanent <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> comeback.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old actress, who played hairdresser Fiona Middleton from 1993 to 1998 before making a brief cameo return earlier this year, would love to step out onto the cobbles again full-time.</p>
      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a> newspaper: "It's very tempting to go back and just stay there forever and a day. I'm open to the idea of that.</p>

      <p>"My character isn't dead so the door is open. There was talk about making it happen this year but it couldn't because the dates didn't work out. But it could happen in the future."</p>
      <p>The former soap star admitted the ITV show holds a special space "in her heart", and despite not appearing regularly for more than two decades she still loves being back on the cobbles.</p>
      <p>She added: "Corrie holds such a big place in my heart. I was my daughter's age when I first started on it. But even now after all these years I still absolutely love it."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/angela-griffin-is-returning-to-coronation-street/">Angela appeared on the soap once again as Fiona</a>, as the character, who now lives in Australia, chatted to her on-screen daughter Emma Brooker on Skype.</p>

      <p>"But there's no plans at the moment. I think they are just going to let that storyline play out and see what happens."</p>
