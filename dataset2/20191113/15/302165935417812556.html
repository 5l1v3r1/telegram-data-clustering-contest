      <p>LONDON, Nov 13 — British pop stalwart Rod Stewart has spent decades laying down tracks of a different kind thanks to a little-known lifelong hobby — building model railways.</p>
      <p>The gravel-voiced singer has spent the past 23 years creating an imaginary American city and railway in his Los Angeles mansion.</p>
      <p>He opened up about his “addictive” hobby to <i>Railway Modeller</i>, bagging the cover page of the British hobbyist magazine’s December issue.</p>
      <p>“When I take on something creative like this, I have to give it 110 per cent,” Stewart told the publication in an exclusive interview.</p>
      <p>“If I’d have realised at the start it would have taken so long, I’d have probably said ‘No!’”</p>
      <p>The father-of-eight — whose hits include <i>Maggie May</i>, <i>You Wear It Well</i> and his cover of <i>Downtown Train</i> — said he began his latest project soon after he built his LA home in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>He earmarked the attic for his intricate cityscape, which he named “Grand Street and Three Rivers City”.</p>
      <p>It features skyscrapers, warehouses and hills, alongside railway infrastructure like tracks, stations, tunnels and bridges.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to see flat backdrops, they spoil the illusion, so I went for more buildings and streets than tracks. Just to give it a great depth,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘I got hooked’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The roots of Stewart’s hobby date back to his childhood in Britain, and a family holiday aged eight to Bognor Regis on the English south coast.</p>
      <p>The ageing rocker recalled seeing a model railway shop’s window display and thinking “if only I could get paid to build a model railway like that”.</p>
      <p>But Stewart, who grew up in Archway, north London, opposite busy railway tracks, did not have enough room in the family home for a model train set.</p>
      <p>Only by the mid-1960s and his late teens, when the family had moved to a new house, was he finally able to go full steam ahead with the pastime.</p>
      <p>“I got my own bedroom and built a layout all around the perimeter walls. Even across the window,” Stewart said.</p>
      <p>Fast-forward three decades and he had become an international star, but he had not lost his enthusiasm for replica train sets.</p>
      <p>Now living in the United States, he decided to embark on his most ambitious layout yet based on American scenery, becoming a regular customer at two shops selling model railroads in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The music icon acknowledged he was so hooked that he would keep working while on the road touring — even booking an extra room in hotels to serve as his model-making workshop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘It’s the landscape I like’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 74-year-old, who revealed earlier this year he has been given the all-clear after developing prostate cancer, added he was more of a landscape artist than a train geek.</p>
      <p>“I can’t tell a Niagara from a Hudson,” Stewart said, referencing well-known US locomotives.</p>
      <p>“It’s the landscape I like. Attention to detail, extreme detail, is paramount. There shouldn’t be any unsightly gaps, or pavements that are too clean.”</p>
      <p>Stewart is not the only celebrity to have revealed a passion for model railways.</p>
      <p>Entrepreneur and film director Walt Disney, singer-songwriter Neil Young, crooner Frank Sinatra and “The Who” frontman Roger Daltrey are all said to have been fellow enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>Daltrey was quoted by music publication the <i>NME</i> in 2014: “The great thing about model railways is you can be doing a bit of woodwork, a bit of painting, a bit of this, a bit of that, and having fun with your mates and you can listen to the radio.” — AFP</p>
