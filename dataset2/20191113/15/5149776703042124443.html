      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:28:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>Where do you find a unique gift for the hard-to-please relative who has everything? Nottinghamshire's wealth of Christmas markets are a good start.</p>
      <p>Nottingham <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/winter-wonderland">Winter Wonderland</a> is sure to be busy, especially after the kudos of being <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/whats-on-news/style-bible-vogue-ranks-nottinghams-3459426">named one of the best in the UK by Vogue</a>.</p>
      <p>So if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle in the Old Market Square - not to mention the hefty city centre parking fees - the alternative is to visit some of the other Christmas markets and festive fairs around the county where crafts, jewellery, art, clothing and accessories that you won't find on the high street are begging to be snapped up.</p>
      <p>And for the foodies in your life there's an abundance of scrumptious presents to surprise them on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>November 22 to 24 is stacking up to be the main weekend with events at several venues - but there's plenty of other dates besides.</p>
      <h3>Holme Pierrepont Hall</h3>

      <p>Around 1,000 people flock to the annual event in the grandeur of the hall, taking place on Thursday, November 14.</p>
      <p>There will be a variety of individual, design-led and artisan stalls, handpicked to offer a broad range of unique gifts.</p>

      <p>Stalls include small batch gin and rum from the award-winning A Little Luxury Distillery, cashmere from Bird of Paradise, and beautiful homewares from Chloe Jonason Interiors.</p>
      <p>Taking place all day, from 9.30am to 4pm there's plenty of time to peruse at leisure. The event will once again raise funds for Rainbows Children's Hospice, which last year amassed £9,500.</p>
