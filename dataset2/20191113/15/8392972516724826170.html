      <p>Victoria wasn't the only Spice Girl to share a message for her followers on World Kindness Day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/mel-b-goes-to-war-with-tesco-after-store-uses-her-image-on-an-advert/">Scary Spice Mel B</a> took the opportunity to urge her fans to take a quiz and see how healthy their relationship is.</p>
      <p>She posted a quote that read, "Should, would, could. Did" and wrote in the caption: "It's #WorlddkindnessDay today and this is really important to me and @womensaid.</p>
      <p>"Take this quiz to see how healthy your relationship is. Please be honest. I spent so many years in denial about the abusive relationship I was in, you owe it to yourself â€“ and your family - to do this."</p>
