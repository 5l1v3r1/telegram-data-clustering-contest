      <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) in areas of the national capital city spiked to the “hazardous” category, 500 in some areas, with 425 being the overall level on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Netizens also joined lampooning the government over its inefficiency to control the situation. Some also condemned voters for choosing the government on the basis of caste, creed and religion while negating important issues like health and education.</p>
