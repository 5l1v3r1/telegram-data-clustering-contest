      <p>The <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/video_oh_boy_sonics_movie_redesign_is_revealed_in_brand_new_trailer">new Sonic movie design</a> sure has gobbled up a lot of column inches over the past few days. After the launch of the initial <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/sonic_the_hedgehog_movie_gets_its_first_official_trailer_and_its_definitely_something">trailer</a>, fan reaction was so hostile that the movie was <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/sonic_movie_director_promises_to_change_controversial_design">delayed and retooled</a> – with help from <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania's</a></b> <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/yes_the_sonic_movie_redesign_was_led_by_sonic_mania_animator_tyson_hesse">Tyson Hesse</a> – and we now have a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/gallery_sonic_movie_trailer_comparison_pics_-_check_out_before_and_after_sonics_redesign"><i>much</i> more agreeable look</a>.</p>
      <p>TV's Conan O'Brien has taken a rather amusing swipe at the whole episode by running a skit on his show which 'introduces' a new-look design with a rather large new feature – which isn't addressed at any point during the piece.</p>
      <p>However, fun is had by pointing out that, despite all of the injustice in the world, people actually took the time to complain about the look of a make-believe animal character from a '90s video game. It's a pretty funny piece, and well worth a watch.</p>
