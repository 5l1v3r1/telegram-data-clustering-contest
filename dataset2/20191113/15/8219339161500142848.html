      <h1>16-inch MacBook Pro: Early hands-on demos compare size, keyboard, speakers, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:11:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>We’re seeing our first hands-on impressions of the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as orders have opened up after Apple announced the notebook this morning. iJustine has shared a look at the new MacBook Pro with a comparison looking at the 16-inch size vs. the old 15-inch model, the new keyboard, speakers, and more.</p>
      <p>The two biggest changes that arrive with the new MacBook Pro are the 16-inch display and the scissor switch Magic Keyboard that replaces the troublesome butterfly keyboard.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y35rTrnO60I">iJustine</a> has a hands-on look at how the physical footprint of the 16-inch and 15-inch compare as well as what the screen real estate looks and feels like.</p>
      <p>She also dives into other improvements like the new six-speaker system saying “this sounds incredible.”</p>
      <p>As for the keyboard, she says: “you actually feel like you’re pressing a real key as opposed to the butterfly keyboard…”</p>
      <p>Check out the full hands-on below:</p>
