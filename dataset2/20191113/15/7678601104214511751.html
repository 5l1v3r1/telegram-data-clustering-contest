      <h1>BLACKPINK's Lisa is Asia's most beautiful woman, actor Xiao Zhan rated most handsome</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:48:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Loh Keng Fatt</a></address>
      <p>BLACKPINK are proving to be head-turners in the beauty chart too.</p>
      <p>Two members of the South Korean girl group are in the top five of TCCAsia's Most Beautiful Faces in Asia 2019 list, with Lisa sitting pretty at No. 1.</p>
      <p>Jennie is at No.3 while the other two members of BLACKPINK are not that far back, at positions 13 (Rose) and 22 (Jisoo).</p>
      <p>The other slots in the top five are filled by Japanese actress Sakura Miyawaki (2), Chinese actress Angelababy (4) and Chinese model Sui He (5).</p>
      <p>In the ranking of the top 100 faces, two relatively more famous names fail to make much of an impression with the selectors, with South Korean actress Song Hye-kyo listed at No. 85 and Jay Chou's wife Hannah Quinlivan at No. 87.</p>
      <p>TCCAsia's parent company is TC Candler, which has rated the world's top male and female lookers since 1990.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, TCCAsia also unveiled the list of Most Handsome Faces in Asia 2019, with Chinese actor Xiao Zhan at No.1.</p>
      <p>K-pop star Sehun, Japanese actor Tomohisa Yamashita, K-pop artist Jackson Wang and Chinese actor Deng Lun round up the top five, in descending order.</p>
      <p>In a list dominated by Chinese, Korean and Japanese, top Indian actor Aamir Khan is at No. 20.</p>
      <p>Xiao has seen his fortunes rise after he was cast in Chinese TV drama <i>The Untamed </i>( 2019 ), which has riveted viewers both in China and abroad.</p>
      <p>After the TCCAsia win, the hashtag #XiaoZhan drew nearly 20 million views on Weibo.</p>
