      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/depeche-mode/">Depeche Mode</a> has released the trailer for a new documentary that follows the band on their most recent <i>Global Spirit</i> tour and shares the stories of six special fans around the world that have a strong connection to the group.</p>
      <p><i>Depeche Mode: Spirits In The Forest</i> will be released on November 21 in more than 2,400 theaters in over 70 countries. According to Depeche Mode, that will reflect the grandeur of their tour where they played for over three million fans at 115 shows.</p>
      <p>The doc follows the tour, but hones in on six fans that have come to love the group for different reasons and different ways. It captures what the band has meant to them over their lives. All six are at the band’s final show on the tour at Berlin’s iconic Waldbuhne venue. </p>
      <p>Martin Gore said in a press release, “In today’s world of turmoil and divisiveness, music really can be a force for good and bring people together.” </p>
      <p>Photographer and film-maker Anton Corbijn directed the film. </p>
