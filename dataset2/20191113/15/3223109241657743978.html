      <h1>ASICS Reveals Japan-Exclusive Collaboration With ‘Transformers’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:55:36+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/tresdean/" target="_blank">Tres Dean</a></address>
      <p>There’s more than meets the eye going on with the latest collaboration popular shoe brand ASICS is putting together. Fans of the <i>Transformers</i> world will be stoked to see the second <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/an-ode-to-the-kyrie-5-and-a-preview-of-the-kyrie-6-1809910/">sneaker collaboration</a> the brand has been involved in this year, with the first being a small capsule dropped with Puma earlier in 2019 – although it looks like for now, this one may be exclusive to Japan (still anything is possible, especially in the world of hunting down sneakers, with the internet today). This time around the collaboration is focused on the <a href="https://www.billys-tokyo.net/shop/g/g6000280001051/">ASICS Gel-Lyte 5</a>, a classic silhouette with some new Cybertronian flair.</p>
      <p>The big draw here is the customizability of the collaboration. Having trouble choosing between <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/why-transformers-still-resonates-35-years-later-1793535/">Autobots and Decepticons</a>? You can switch it up daily with this one. The shoe builds from a simple gray base and a white sole (made from ASICS classic GEL cushioning, perfect for shock absorption when walking or running) so that the customizable options don’t create color-clashing issues.</p>

      <p>Each shoe comes with a reversible panel that straps on over the laces and down the sides of the shoe. If you’re feeling the Autobots, you can go with the sides that feature the classic Autobots logo, one in Optimus Prime red and the other in Bumblebee yellow. You can also stick similar panels on the heels in order to create a cool sort of stripped-down version of Optimus and Bumblebee’s faces (when paired with the sole of the shoe it’s actually pretty impressive how dead-on the designs are).</p>
      <p>But hey, sometimes you gotta go bad on ‘em, and for times like those, just flip the panels over. On the other side you’ll find panel logos and coloring that line up with those of the Decepticons, including a recognizable gray tone for Megatron himself. There are also heel panels to accomplish the same optical trick used for Optimus and Bumblebee that in this case will turn your heel into Megatron’s head.</p>

      <p>It’s certainly an interesting take on a <i>Transformers</i> collaboration, and customizability is always a huge draw in the sneaker world. The only thing <i><a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/toy-tuesday-the-most-incredible-transformers-toys-1776069/">Transformers</a></i> fans might want to keep in mind ahead of the shoes’ drop date of Nov. 22  is that it may be a little tricky to secure a pair.</p>
      <p>Right now it looks like the only online retail outlet that will have the shoes in stock is <a href="https://www.billys-tokyo.net/shop/g/g6000280001051/">Billy’s Tokyo</a>, a Japanese retailer. They’ll be available for purchase at midnight EST, so copping a pair might mean a late night is in order. Still, it’s worth it – even with what are sure to be insane shipping prices – for a dope pair of kicks.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.billys-tokyo.net/shop/g/g6000280001051/">ASICS x Transformers Gel-Lyte 5</a> rolls out Nov. 22 and will be retailing for $130.</p>
