      <p>A MAYO Oireachtas member has revealed Department of Health figures released to Sinn Féin show that there are 1,323 children on hospital waiting lists to see a specialist at Mayo University Hospital.</p>
      <p>Senator Conway Walsh elaborated:“The information regarding children’s waiting lists released to Sinn Féin by the Department of Health leaves the Minister for Health and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) with huge questions to answer over how they present the number of children on hospital waiting lists.</p>
      <p>“The figures released to Sinn Féin have shown that there are actually 86,625 children waiting to see a specialist in hospitals across the state - almost double the supposed official figure of 46,000.</p>
      <p>“In Mayo hospital there are a staggering 1,323 children waiting to see a specialist with 467 of these waiting over a year.</p>
      <p>“The release of this information justifies the questioning of many parents, campaigners, and politicians who questioned the official figures and said there were many ‘hidden children’ awaiting to see a specialist but were being counted on adult hospital waiting lists.</p>
      <p>“In particular, there are huge problems regarding Otolaryngology (ENT) speciality with 576 children waiting to be seen.</p>
      <p>“The waiting lists for children in Mayo University hospital are huge and it is only now we are seeing their true extent.”</p>
