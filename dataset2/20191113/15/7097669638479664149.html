      <h1>George Conway mocks Republicans' 'ridiculous' impeachment arguments in rare cable news appearance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:15:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Brendan Morrow</a></address>
      <p>MSNBC is getting ready for the historic first impeachment hearing of President Trump with a very special guest making a rare appearance on cable news.</p>
      <p>George Conway, who is married to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, appeared on MSNBC Wednesday morning in the lead-up to the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry. Though Conway has been a vocal critic of Trump, <a href="https://twitter.com/brianstelter/status/1194622705057902592">CNN's Brian Stelter notes</a> he has declined all TV interview requests until now.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the testimony of William Taylor, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Conway told MSNBC that Trump "always sees himself first" and that this scandal is all about Trump having used "the power of the presidency in its most unchecked area, foreign affairs, to advance his own personal interests as opposed to the country."</p>
      <p>Conway also said Congress needs to "do its duty" for the country and that he's "horrified" at how Republicans have come to the president's defense.</p>
      <p>"Take that Republican hat off and look at it neutrally," he said. "Or look at what you would have done if Donald Trump was a Democrat. Would you be making these ridiculous arguments about process ... or 'it wasn't corrupt, he was really talking about corruption.' All these things that they don't really believe or couldn't possibly believe."</p>
      <p>Conway was, evidently, a reluctant guest, <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1194625521000337408">telling MSNBC</a>, "I don't frankly want to be on television."</p>
