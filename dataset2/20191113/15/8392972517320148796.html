      <p>As Eva explained that a confrontation between her then-partner and her dad resulted in her partner hitting her dad, breaking his nose, Holly reached for the tissues.</p>
      <p>Struggling to continue with the interview, Holly's co-host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> took over the reins of the chat and asked Eva what advice she'd give to viewers going through a similar ordeal.</p>
