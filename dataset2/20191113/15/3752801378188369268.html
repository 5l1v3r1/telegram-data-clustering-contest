      <h1>BLF, AfriForum members clash in court as swear words fly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:10:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>A fight broke out between Black First Land First (BLF) and AfriForum members at the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>AfriForum has taken BLF leader Andile Mngxitama to court over alleged racist remarks he made during a speech in Potchefstroom last year.</p>
      <p>During a rally, Mngxitama threatened to kill five white people for every black person killed in the country. He also said that white women and children would be killed if a black person was murdered.</p>
      <p>After the court watched a video on farm murders submitted by AfriForum, BLF members made remarks about the video.</p>
      <p>An AfriForum member then took a picture of the BLF members making the remarks and a fight ensued.</p>
      <p>While swear words flew around the courtroom, officials struggled to separate the two groups. Some BLF members would not let AfriForum leave the room until they deleted the picture.</p>
      <p>The magistrate has barred photographs from being taken by anyone present inside the courtroom.</p>
      <p>The scuffle came to a head when Mngxitama approached one Afriforum legal representative and began swearing him, telling him to go back Holland.</p>
      <p>The BLF has since approached the magistrate to remedy the situation.</p>
