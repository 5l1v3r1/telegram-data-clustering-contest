      <p>Best Buy currently has the Lenovo Yoga C940 gaming laptop <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> for just $1499, this is likely the same price it will be on Black Friday, but a bit earlier.</p>
      <p>The Lenovo Yoga C940 is a pretty high-end laptop, and at $1499, you really can't afford to miss this one.</p>
      <p>Inside the Yoga C940, you'll find the ninth-generation Intel Core i7 chipset, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. There is also the NVIDIA GeForce GTX1650 inside for some really great gaming performance.</p>

      <p>This is a 2-in-1, which is a bit surprising for a gaming-centric laptop. But it does make for a pretty powerful tablet. There is also support for using a stylus.</p>
      <p>The hinge has Dolby Atmos speakers, which do swivel around, so that you can still get a great audio experience, even if you are using it in tablet or tent mode. Instead of the traditional laptop mode. Which is definitely really great to see.</p>
      <p>All of this while keeping the Lenovo Yoga C940 pretty thin and lightweight. It comes in at just under an inch thick and around 4.34 pounds. Meaning that this isn't going to weigh down your backpack, if you are a student and carrying this back and forth to school.</p>

      <p>There is also a built-in fingerprint sensor for Windows Hello, making it super convenient for logging into your computer.</p>
      <p>This is a really great PC to pick up for those that are into gaming and want something that's pretty powerful, without spending a boat load of cash. Though at $1499, this is still a pretty expensive PC, but with these specs, you could easily spend a few grand.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the Lenovo Yoga C940 from Best Buy <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-yoga-c940-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1650-512gb-ssd-iron-gray%2F6367793.p%3FskuId%3D6367793%26irclickid%3DQpqTukSJixyJWD70MKVSfWfHUkn1UHzNyXV7zU0%26irgwc%3D1%26ref%3D198%26loc%3DQpqTukSJixyJWD70MKVSfWfHUkn1UHzNyXV7zU0%26acampID%3D614286">by clicking here</a>, though this Black Friday price won't last long. So you're going to want to grab it before it's gone.</p>
