      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/13/20961309/pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield-review-nintendo-switch-nov-15-release-date"><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Pokémon Shield</i></a>, developer Game Freak’s first new game for Nintendo’s latest console,<i> </i>will be released on Nov. 15 for Nintendo Switch. There’s a lot of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20959420/pokemon-sword-shield-pokedex-game-freak-trending">anticipation</a> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947933/pokemon-sword-shield-full-pokedex-cut-pokemon-nintendo-switch-game-freak">and controversy</a> — ahead of its release date. <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> largely follow tradition as a Pokémon franchise game, but add new elements that make it fresh and open.</p>
      <p>We’ve known for some time that it’s out on Nov. 15, but a Nintendo spokesperson told Polygon the game will go online at midnight “in all local time zones” where the Nintendo eShop is available. The U.S., however is getting its launch countrywide: <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield </i>will be available right when the clock strikes midnight EDT, meaning it’s available at 9 p.m. PDT.</p>
