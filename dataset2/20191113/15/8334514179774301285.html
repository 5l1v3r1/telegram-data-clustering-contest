      <p>PRAGUE (Reuters) - Prague’s Charles University has closed its Czech-Chinese Centre, rector Tomas Zima said on Wednesday, after local media reports that some of its staff had failed to declare payments from the Chinese embassy intended to support its programmes.</p>
      <p>The reports, published in October, prompted the secretary of the center to resign. Zima made his announcement in a statement posted on the university’s website.</p>
      <p>The Czech Republic has recently been trying to attract Chinese money after years of criticizing China’s human rights record. However, the push has not generated the expected billions of dollars in Chinese investment.</p>
      <p>Last month, Prague city council canceled a partnership agreement with Beijing.</p>
      <p>And a year ago, the Czech cyber-security watchdog warned against using equipment made by China’s Huawei and ZTE in critical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>The Czech-Chinese Centre had been intended to promote academic and cultural exchange through some of the Charles University’s faculties.</p>
