      <h1>Apple’s AirPods Pro are on sale just weeks after their release</h1>
      <h2>You can save $14 on Amazon, but you may have to wait months for them to arrive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:40:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/christine-fisher" target="_blank">Christine Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Less than a month after Apple released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/apple-airpods-pro-review/">AirPods Pro</a>, they're on sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=a9089061979d1d9040198cd39c4a6aaf&amp;creativeASIN=B07ZPC9QD4">$235</a> on Amazon. That $14 savings is a little surprising. It's unusual to see these things go on sale so soon, and it might irk some of the folks who bought them at full price a couple weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Normally $249, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/apple-airpods-pro-announced-active-noise-cancellation/">AirPods Pro</a> are Apple's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/29/apple-airpods-pro-hands-on-noise-canceling-preview/">best and most expensive</a> true wireless earbuds yet. They offer refined design, better sound and more features, like active noise cancellation (ANC). They add transparency mode, on-board controls and silicone ear tips. They're rated as sweatproof (IPX4), and of course, they have hands-free Siri.</p>
      <p>There are still a few drawbacks to this model: the touch controls are a bit awkward, the settings are buried in iOS and not everyone is a fan of the silicone tips, which are essential for ANC.</p>
      <p>While you might save $14 ordering through Amazon, the listing says these usually ship between one and three months. That will likely be a deal breaker for most people. You could also tempt fate and wait for any Black Friday sales that may or may not materialize.</p>
