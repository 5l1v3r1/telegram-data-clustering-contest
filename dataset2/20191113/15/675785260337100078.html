      <h1>Furious Man City decide against Bernardo Silva appeal over fear of increased ban</h1>
      <h2>Bernardo Silva is facing a one-game ban - but furious Man city do not plan to appeal the punishment given for a controversial tweet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:23:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are furious with Bernardo Silva's one-game ban for sending a controversial tweet - but will not appeal for fear of the FA increasing the suspension.</p>
      <p>Silva was hit with a one-match ban, a £50,0000 fine and ordered to undertake an education programme after pleading guilty to an FA charge of misconduct.</p>
      <p>The ban means Silva, one of City's most influential players, will miss their huge Premier League clash at home against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> a week on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The charge related to a tweet Silva sent on September 22 to team-mate Benjamin Mendy, comparing the City left-back to a character depicted on a packet of Conguitos, a chocolate brand available in Spain and Portugal.</p>
      <p>Silva deleted the post 46 minutes after he published it, then tweeted: "Can't even joke with a friend these days."</p>

      <p>The FA charged Silva after stating the post constituted an “aggravated breach” of its rules on social media behaviour, because it appeared to reference Mendy's race.</p>
      <p>Although Silva accepted the charge, City are dismayed at the independent disciplinary commission's decision to ban him for one game, believing a fine and a warning would have been sufficient.</p>
      <p>Leicester's Hamza Choudhury was fined £5,000 by the FA after accepting a charge of misconduct for historic racist and offensive tweets earlier this year, but escaped a ban, with City angry at what they see as a lack of consistency from the game's governing body.</p>

      <p>City felt Silva's unblemished previous disciplinary record, combined with the fact that Mendy - his close friend - took no offence at the tweet, should have seen him escape a ban.</p>
      <p>Those feelings were made clear by City in their submissions and mitigation to the FA, on behalf of Silva, but the governing body felt a one-match ban was an appropriate sanction.</p>
      <p>The FA released a statement which read: "Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first team competitive fixture, fined £50,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> midfielder’s social media activity on 22 September 2019 breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin."</p>
