      <p>Attractive anime fighting game <i>Granblue Fantasy: Versus</i> will be arriving in the west early next. As announced by publishers Xseed Games and Marvelous Europe, the hand-to-hand spin-off of the <i>Granblue Fantasy RPG</i> series will hit North American and European shores in the first quarter of 2020, relatively close to its February release in Japan.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Versus will be available in numerous different physical releases, heralding the return of that most obnoxious of marketing tools: the Special Edition Checklist. The Premium Edition includes a physical copy of the game, redemption keys for bonus items in the original <i>Granblue Fantasy</i> RPG, a soundtrack CD, art book, a PS4 theme, and a customisable Color Pack DLC. This set is expected to retail for around $80/Â£60.<br/><br/>The digital Character Pass Set includes a digital copy of <i>Granblue Fantasy: Versus</i>, all of the extras from the Premium Edition, and the Character Pass DLC, which includes five new characters to be revealed at a later date. This set will launch exclusively on the PlayStation Store, again for around $80.</p>

      <p>Still with me? For those willing to spend a little more, the Digital Deluxe edition includes all contents of the Character Pass Set, plus a digital soundtrack, digital art book, and Premium Edition's artwork as a PS4 theme. This edition will be launch exclusively on the PlayStation Store for around $100.<br/><br/>Of course, if you just want the game itself, then <i>Granblue Fantasy: Versus</i> will be able to purchase in digital and physical form from all of the usual outlets. This standard edition will still bag you the in-game items for<i> Granblue Fantasy</i>. <br/><br/>In related news, you can check out a new video of the game in action in the tweet below.</p>
