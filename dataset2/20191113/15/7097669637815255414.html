      <h1>Apple’s New AirPods Pro Are Already on Sale at Amazon</h1>

      <p>Apple launched its latest iteration of the popular AirPods just two weeks ago, and Amazon is already cutting $15 off of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4">new AirPods Pro</a>. Though you’ll have to pay more for their noise-cancelling technology and improved fit, this deal helps even out the price difference between the regular model and the Pro. But be quick—Amazon’s deal of $235 instead of the Pro’s usual $250 probably won’t last very long.</p>
      <p>In our <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a29687021/airpods-pro-review/">review of the AirPods Pro</a>, we were impressed with the AirPods’s new noise-cancellation technology, which even rivaled over-ear headphones like the Bose 700 on a flight. The original AirPods had an open-ear design—which didn’t fit in many people’s ears and allowed a lot of surrounding noise in. Those who previously took issue with the AirPods’ fit will be pleased to find that Apple now offers three silicone ear tip sizes, so that they can better seal your ear canal for when you don’t want to hear traffic or chatting coworkers.</p>
      <p>While the Active Noise Cancelation can limit outside sound, the Pros are also equipped with a Transparency mode that allows some ambient noise in. Though the AirPods can’t beat over-ear headphones’ battery life, they still boast a five hours of playback on a single charge with an extra 24 hours in the charging case.</p>
      <p>With Black Friday approaching, you can certainly score more impressive deals on other AirPods or wireless headphones. Though many may require the Pro model to get the right fit, we found more deals on wireless earbuds we’d recommend below.</p>
