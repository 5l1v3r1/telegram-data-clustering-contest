      <h1>Samsung partners with Watcha Play to expand its HDR10+ content</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:50:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:50</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has announced a new partnership with Watcha in a bid to expand its <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/hdr10-plus/">HDR10+</a> content. The latter company launched the online video streaming service Watcha Play in 2016 and it grew in popularity partly due to having a monthly fee lower than <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>With this new collaboration, Samsung aims to deliver more HDR10+ content to its customers. HDR10+ is supported by various <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/tv/">Samsung smart TVs</a> including its QLED lineup, the 2019 8K TV series, and all of its UHD models.</p>
      <h3>Watcha Play HDR10+ content will launch in H1 2020</h3>
      <p>More and more content providers are adopting the HDR10+ standard, but it won’t be until the first half of 2020 when Watcha Play will begin streaming HDR10+ content to Samsung TVs, according to Watcha CTO, Lee Tae-hyun.</p>
      <p>Watcha Play is available only in South Korea at the time of writing, and it may never be released outside the country. Nevertheless, there are other ways to enjoy HDR10+ content on Samsung smart TVs elsewhere. Samsung Electronics claims it will keep increasing its influence ‘<i>in the global television market by enhancing [its] leadership in the HDR specification industry</i>.’</p>
      <p>As proof of Samsung’s ambitions to expand its HDR content, the Disney+ on-demand video streaming service <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/disney-plus-will-launch-on-samsung-tvs-in-select-markets-starting-next-week/">just launched</a> in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands this week, boasting numerous titles that support the HDR10+ format along with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.</p>
