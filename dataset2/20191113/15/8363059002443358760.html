      <h1>You Won't Need Netflix to Watch The First Episode of Crown Season 3: It'll Be Free in the UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:00:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Netflix really wants people to sign up for its service, especially as there's a lot of increased competition from competing streaming services. The latest attempt to try and get people to sign up is to make the first episode of <i>The Crown's</i> third season available to watch for free. No subscription required.</p>
      <p>Obviously <i>The Crown</i> has been around for a while, but the third season will feature an all-new cast after a bit of a time jump. The characters are older than they were in the first two seasons, but the actors haven't quite caught up, so newbies were brought in.</p>
      <p>Obviously the trick here is try and get people invested in the series and make them sign up to Netflix to watch the rest - including the previous two seasons. And considering <i>The Crown</i> <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/the-crown-season-2-ratings-netflix-nielsen-1201908073/">mostly appeals to older audiences</a>, it's likely Netflix hopes to rope more of them into the world of streaming. After all younger people are probably subscribed to one or more services already, and would be a bit harder to bring in.</p>
      <p>The first episode debuts on 17th November (this Sunday) and will be free to watch until 15th December. Simply head to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/netflix-uk-first-episode-the-crown-season-3-free/netflix.com/thecrown">netflix.com/thecrown</a> to tune in.
