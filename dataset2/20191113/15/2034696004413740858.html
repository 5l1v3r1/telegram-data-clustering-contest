        <b>The redesign was unveiled yesterday (November 12)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The original creator of Sonic The Hedgehog has said that he’s still somewhat unhappy with the design of the character for the forthcoming movie.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/second-time-lucky-sonic-the-hedgehog-shares-redesign-in-new-trailer-2567042">A new, redesigned version of Sonic was unveiled yesterday</a> (November 12) after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-to-be-redesigned-following-fan-backlash-2483766">the critical response was so bad that the creators were forced to start again</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Yuji Naka, the original creator of Sonic, has now shared his thoughts on the redesign, and it sees a different take than the largely positive response to the new version.</p>
      <p>In a tweet (translated by <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/yuji-naka-comments-new-sonic-movie-redesign/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Dualshockers</a>), he says: “This is the new trailer with Sonic’s new design. The design is much more Sonic-like now that he’s wearing gloves.</p>
      <p>“However, his eyes still aren’t joined together, as expected. I can’t help but feel weird about that one point. But I’m looking forward to the movie’s release.”</p>

      <p>In a follow-up tweet, Naka surprisingly seems to show his appreciation for the original decision, and believes it’s a strange move to act like the contentious first version of the movie Sonic never existed.</p>
      <p>“It seems they’re making it as if the old design didn’t exist, as the movie official account’s old tweets were deleted,” Naka writes.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to see a special DVD version of the movie which used the old design. Too bad.”</p>

      <p>The movie, originally set for release this month, was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/new-sonic-hedgehog-movie-delayed-2020-2492217">delayed until February 2020</a> after the backlash while the movie’s producers worked on the new version of Sonic.</p>
