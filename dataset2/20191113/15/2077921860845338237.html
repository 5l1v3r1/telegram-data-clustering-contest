      <h1>Netflix's The Witcher Renewed Ahead of Season 1 Premiere</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Highly anticipated <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> series <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/07/the-witcher-trailer-netflix.html">The Witcher</a></i> has been renewed for a second season ahead of its premiere.</p>
      <p>Showrunner Lauren Hissrich and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> both tweeted the announcement on Wednesday, with Hissrich saying, “I could not be more proud of what the amazing cast and crew of <i>The Witcher</i> have accomplished, and can’t wait for the world to dig in and enjoy these stories with us.”</p>

      <p>The first season is slated to be released on Dec. 20, and stars <i>Superman</i>’s Henry Cavill as monster hunter Geralt of Rivia. Anya Chalotra (<i>Wanderlust</i>) plays Yennefer, along with Freya Allan (<i>Into the Badlands</i>) taking on the role of Ciri. It comes as no surprise that <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> has already ordered a second season of the show, with fans already hyped up over the first season. According to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/witcher-netflix-season-7-lauren-schmidt-hissrich-interview/"><i>GamesRadar</i></a>, Hissrich already has seven seasons mapped out and told SFX magazine that “right now it’s just about, ‘How do you set up stories that really capture audiences for years at a time?’ The worst thing we could do is put all of our energies into season one, and not be thinking about where these characters can grow to.”</p>
      <p>Based on the best-selling fantasy series, <i>The Witcher</i> is described as “an epic tale of fate and family” in which “Geralt of Rivia struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts. But when destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a dangerous secret, the three must learn to navigate the increasingly volatile Continent together.”</p>
