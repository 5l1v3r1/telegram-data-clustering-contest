      <p>A tenant allegedly inflicted £4,000 worth of damage by "trashing" his north Belfast accommodation in a row over a deposit, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Portuguese national Ladis Diouf is accused of ripping out sinks and toilets, smashing windows and cutting up furniture at the property on Eia Street.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old was returned to Northern Ireland after being detained in Great Yarmouth in England earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Diouf, of no fixed abode, is charged with criminal damage by damaging furniture, fixtures and fittings at the house on February 8 this year.</p>
      <p>During a bail application, a prosecution lawyer agreed with a judge's assessment that the allegations involved "trashing the premises".</p>
      <p>She claimed: "He ripped sinks and toilets off walls, broke two windows and slashed a sofa.</p>
      <p>"He cut cables on electrical items and kicked in doors and studded walls."</p>
      <p>The court heard that police were called by another tenant at the address.</p>
      <p>"The damage is estimated to be over £4,000," the Crown lawyer disclosed.</p>
      <p>Diouf, who is believed to have come to Northern Ireland in 2018, provided a statement to police after being brought back for questioning.</p>
      <p>"He outlined a dispute with the landlord over a deposit of £315 he said was owed to him," counsel said.</p>
      <p>"The reason for the delay between the incident and his arrest was that the applicant moved to Great Yarmouth."</p>
      <p>She claimed that if Diouf was allowed to go back there he could then move on to Portugal.</p>
      <p>Adjourning the bail application, Lord Justice McCloskey said he wanted checks carried out on an alternative address with a sister in Dungannon.</p>
      <p>He added: "The court is gravely concerned about this incident."</p>
