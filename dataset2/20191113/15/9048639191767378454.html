      <p><b>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - </b>A New Orleans judge has ordered Republican groups to remove their TV attack ad against Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards from the air, after a lawsuit challenged the ad’s claims as “demonstrably false.”</p>
      <p>The Wednesday ruling from Judge Nakisha Ervin-Knott gives a victory to the Democratic governor. Edwards is in a tight governor’s race against Republican businessman Eddie Rispone and only days away from Saturday’s election.</p>
      <p>The ad claims Edwards gave his West Point roommate favorable treatment in contracting for coastal project work. It was run by two GOP-backed groups, Truth in Politics and the Causeway Connection PAC. Causeway Connection intends to appeal the ruling.</p>
      <p>Truth in Politics tweaked the ad, changing some of its wording, after facing blowback about inaccuracy. Ervin-Knott ordered even the reworked ad to come down.</p>
