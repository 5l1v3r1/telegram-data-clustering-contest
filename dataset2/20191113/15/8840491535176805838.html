      <p>CHILDLINE, Ireland’s national listening service for children and young people, is now recruiting for volunteers in Mayo.</p>
      <p>Information sessions for anyone interested in finding out more about volunteering with the service will take place at the Childline unit at ISPCC Childline, Unit 14C, N5 Business Park, Moneen Road, Castlebar, at 7 p.m. on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>Childline offers a 24-hour free, confidential and non-judgemental listening service to every child and young person up to the age of 18 in Ireland. Each year, Childline answers over 310,000 contacts from children and young people who call, chat online, or text the service.</p>
      <p>Children contact Childline for a wide variety of reasons. They may feel lonely, anxious, scared or upset, or may simply wish to chat about their day.</p>
      <p>Volunteers do not require any prior experience or qualifications. They complete comprehensive training before answering their first contact and receive ongoing support and upskilling for the duration of their time as a volunteer. An excellent team atmosphere and spirit of camaraderie and peer support prevails at each Childline office throughout the country.</p>
      <p>Childline volunteers complete weekly four-hour shifts and facilitate Childline’s 24-hour phone line, live text and webchat services. References are available to volunteers upon completion of commitment.</p>
      <p>Childline volunteer Lorraine said: “There is nothing more fulfilling than knowing you have helped a child. Without Childline, these children may not have anyone to listen to them, but Childline is always there.”</p>
      <p>Volunteer Peter added: “When a child says thank you, I feel I have made a difference just by being there and listening to what they have to say. We should all have someone we feel we can talk to.”</p>
