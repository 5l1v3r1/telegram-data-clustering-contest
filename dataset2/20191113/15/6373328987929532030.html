      <h1>Some People Are ‘Genetically Wired’ To Avoid Vegetables</h1>

        <b>Picture the scene: you’re about eight years old and have rushed home from school, excited at the prospect of having pizza or something equally as unhealthy for tea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>You run into the kitchen and scream, ‘WHAT’S FOR TEEEEAAAAA’ with pure unbridled joy, slamming down your book bag onto the table as your thoughts immediately turn towards <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/tag/food">food</a>.</p>
      <p>Then, just as you’ve let your excitement reach uncontrollable levels, you hear the dreaded word: <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/food/mum-hides-her-secret-chocolate-stash-from-kids-in-frozen-veg-pack/">vegetables</a>. Obviously, other food was mentioned – your family weren’t monsters, for God’s sake – but your mind focused solely on the one causing you the most anguish.</p>

      <p>Kids hate vegetables, it’s a well-known fact (mostly). But it’s also a well-known fact as we grow up, we tend to grow out of our hatred as our taste buds adapt and vegetables become a part of life.</p>
      <p>Not for everyone though, as <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/sensitivity-to-bitter-tastes-may-be-why-some-people-eat-fewer-vegetables?preview=9180">new research has found</a> some people are ‘genetically wired’ to dislike some vegetables, with those who have two copies of a particular taste gene affected.</p>
      <p>US scientists suggested this could explain why some people find it difficult to include enough vegetables in their diet, as the excess gene provides a ‘ruin-your-day’ level of bitterness to foods such as broccoli and sprouts.</p>
      <p>The gene may also make beer, coffee and dark chocolate taste unpleasant.</p>

      <p>So which gene is actually responsible? Everyone inherits two copies of a taste gene called TAS2R38, which allows us to taste bitterness by encoding for a protein in the taste receptors on the tongue.</p>
      <p>However, there are different variants of the gene, with people who inherit two copies of a variant called PAV finding certain foods exceptionally bitter. These people are often referred to as ‘super-tasters’.</p>
      <p>In contrast, people who inherit two copies of a variant called AVI are not sensitive to bitter tastes in food at all, whereas those with one copy of AVI and one of PAV perceive bitter tastes slightly.</p>
      <p>The scientists studied 175 people and found those with two copies of the PAV variation of the gene only ate small amounts of leafy green vegetables.</p>

      <p>Dr Jennifer Smith warned this could prevent some people from eating their recommended five-a-day of fresh fruit and veg, with the doctor adding, ‘You have to consider how things taste if you really want your patient to follow nutrition guidelines.’</p>
      <p>Just as we had the <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/featured/theres-a-scientific-reason-why-some-people-hate-coriander/">coriander debate</a> a few months ago, this new research seems to have given all of us veg-haters an excuse as to why we’re maybe not being <i>as</i> healthy as we possibly could be.</p>
      <p>Sorry, doc.</p>
