      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb has on Wednesday said it is unconstitutional and illegal to make former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s departure abroad – for medical treatment – conditional.</p>
      <p>The PML-N leader maintained that the government is playing a dangerous game with Nawaz Sharif’s health as the erstwhile premier has been given high dose of steroids twice for travelling.</p>
      <p>Marriyum Aurangzeb said it is extremely risky to administer high dose of steroids to Nawaz Sharif again as his health condition is very critical</p>
      <p>The government has no realization of the PML-N supreme leader’s critical health despite the fact that all legal requirements have already been fulfilled, she said while urging the government to not create hurdles in the erstwhile premier’s treatment. </p>
