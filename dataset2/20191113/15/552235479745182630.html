      <h1>Scheme to buy homes amended to include properties that weren't council owned in West Dunbartonshire</h1>
      <h2>Councillors approved an amended scheme, which means other homes meeting certain criteria will now be eligible, at a housing and communities committee last week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T15:05:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>A housing buy-back scheme has been amended to include additional properties which are not former council homes.</p>
      <p>The initiative, which is used to add stock to the council’s housing portfolio, was previously only applicable to owners of former West Dunbartonshire Council homes sold through right to buy.</p>
      <p>Councillors approved an amended scheme, which means other homes meeting certain criteria will now be eligible, at a housing and communities committee last week.</p>
      <p>Under the scheme, the council would purchase up to 10 homes a year and rent them out to tenants.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This would happen if, for example, the existing housing stock does not have the type of house a particular tenant requires, such as a large family home.</p>
      <p>Each property will be assessed against a number of principles, developed in consultation with tenants, before a purchase goes ahead.</p>
      <p>Although the majority of homes bought back will be former council properties, if a specific need arises and cannot be met through existing stock or planned new-build, then a private home which meets the criteria can now be considered to provide the solution.</p>
      <p>The scheme has a budget of £1.384million for 2019/20 and £1m for 2020/21, which is expected to provide a return of between eight and 10 purchases each year.</p>
      <p>Councillor Caroline McAllister, vice convener of the committee, who chaired the meeting, said: “This slight amendment will give the council greater flexibility to meet housing needs and also help us to regenerate areas.</p>
      <p>“We are working hard to provide new housing that is the right type and size for the people in our communities who need it.</p>
      <p>“This has already positively contributed to regenerating these areas, and the extension of the buy back scheme will take this a step further.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes our existing housing stock does not have the type of size of house our tenants require, for example large family homes.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a report assessing the council’s housing service has highlighted a number of positive improvements in the past year.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Social Housing Charter report shows the service continues to make progress in areas including gas safety checks, re-letting empty properties and carrying out medical adaptations.</p>
      <p>It also highlighted a reduction in rent loss due to void homes, and an increase in compliance with the Energy Efficiency Standard for Social Housing.</p>
