      <p>Pen-and-paper role playing games, much like their digital counterparts, very often revolve around quests. You might need to protect some villagers from marauding goblins, say, or retrieve a lost treasure from a haunted catacomb. Or, as I discovered last week, five cockney iguanas might demand you smuggle vast quantities of cocaine into the condemned reptile house they call home.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say, in other words, that Grant Howitt and Nate Crowley's Reverse Beastmaster is not your average RPG. Comprised of a single page of rules, it casts the players as the titular Reverse Beastmasters - hapless individuals incapable of disobeying any command given to them by an animal. Over the course of their adventure across Saint Beef's Zoo for the Brave, the heroes encounter a number of demanding animals, each of which is controlled by a different player wielding a sock puppet. These animals lay down a series of challenges aimed at ultimately bringing down the zoo from the inside, all while avoiding the clutches of the absolutely gargantuan zookeeper.</p>

      <p>As you'll see for yourself if you watch the Let's Play we recorded over a couple of cider-soaked hours, it's a gleefully daft game. It's absurd in the extreme, which is normally cause for worry - out and out farces can be <i>painfully</i> unfunny if done poorly. The thing with Reverse Beastmaster, however, is that the design is whip smart. Challenges are undertaken by rolling between three and nine six-sided dice. Rolling a 4, 5 or 6 nets you one success (and sixes are rerolled as you enter Beast Mode). Rolling a 2 or 3 does absolutely nothing, but rolling a 1 gives you a problem. For every problem you take, you have to fill in a tick box on your character sheet - as these fill up, different pieces of misfortune befall you. You might lose social standing, for instance, or maybe you'll catch fire. It's a simple system that realises your failures in an immediate and very personal way.</p>

      <p>If you can gather some open-minded friends (and enough socks) then I'd heartily encourage you to give Reverse Beastmaster a go. You can pick it up <a href="https://gshowitt.itch.io/reverse-beastmaster">here</a> and you get to name your price, which is pretty nifty. Just watch out for those iguanas.</p>
