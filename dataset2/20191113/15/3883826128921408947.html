        <b>Former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is returning to football after he agreed to become Fifa's new chief of global football development.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The move ends speculation linking the Frenchman, 70, with a return to management as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50354757">Bayern Munich boss.</a></p>
      <p>Wenger left the Gunners in May 2018, after 22 years in charge, three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups.</p>
      <p>"I very much look forward to taking on this extremely important challenge," he said.</p>
      <p>Wenger's new role at the world governing body will help to develop men's and women's football, as well as technical aspects of the sport.</p>
      <p>He will now be a member of the technical panel of the International Football Association Board, and chairman of Fifa's technical study group.</p>
