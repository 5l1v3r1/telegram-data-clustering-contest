      <p>A group of men in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california">California</a> brazenly stole from a Nike store on Monday — simply walking out with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty">shoes and apparel</a> by the box load.</p>
      <p>The group of at least five men were at the Nike Factory Store at the Mountain Grove Shopping Center <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">in Redlands</a> around 8:30 p.m. when they took off, police said.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">shameless thieves</a> appeared unfazed as they took armfuls of merchandise and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">walked straight through the front doors</a> as metal detectors sounded alarms. A customer inside the store who filmed the incident <a href="https://ktla.com/2019/11/12/caught-on-video-suspects-sought-in-brazen-robbery-at-nike-store-in-redlands/">told KTLA</a> the group "knew exactly where they were going."</p>

      <p>Once they made it out of the store, the group hauled the merchandise into an SUV and fled the scene, <a href="https://abc7.com/suspects-captured-on-video-robbing-nike-store-in-redlands/5693781/">according to</a> KABC.</p>
