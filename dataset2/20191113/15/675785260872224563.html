      <p>"Sir Bobby has been a huge support for me personally, but for every single player. Whether it is a good result or bad result he comes and shakes your hand and tells you not to worry it’ll be better next week, or well done and more of the same next week, depending on the result."</p>
      <p>Carrick played for United between 2006-2018 before moving into his role as assistant, and the 38-year-old says it is vital for players to understand the heritage of the club.</p>
      <p>"It's part of the history and traditions of this club," he added. "It lives on. It’s kind of the perfect position at the moment for the group that we’ve got. It’s to understand what it takes, the ups and downs that life, not just football, can bring that you’ve got to overcome.</p>

      <p>"As a player myself I was hugely privileged and fully aware of the position I was in to be able to represent this club.</p>
      <p>"There is a responsibility that comes with playing for this club that probably doesn’t come with other clubs. It’s got that special nature about it.</p>
      <p>"I was fully aware of it and I’m sure the boys now are. Keep playing like that with a smile on your faces and that represents the club the best way you can."</p>
