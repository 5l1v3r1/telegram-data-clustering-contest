      <h1>Meet 'Narwhal,' the puppy with a tail on his forehead</h1>

      <p><b>CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) – </b>Narwhal the puppy has taken the internet by storm with his unique features.</p>
      <p>"He’s got an extra what looks like a perfect tail sitting in the center of his forehead,” said Dr. Brian Heuring, veterinarian at Cape Small Animal Clinic.</p>
      <p>Narwhal is a 10-week-old dachshund mix with as much energy as any other puppy would have.</p>
      <p>Narwhal was taken in by Rochelle Steffen, founder of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/macthepitbull/">Mac the pitbull</a>, a Facebook page and group that helps bring life back to dogs with special needs.</p>
      <p>Steffen said she was tagged in a Facebook post. When she saw Narwhal’s face, she knew she needed to save him.</p>
      <p>“I tell you what, he completely melted everything. He’s just ridiculous,” said Steffen.</p>
      <p>Heuring said there are no complications with the extra “tail" – no bony attachments and no vertebrae.</p>
      <p>“We went as far as shooting X-rays," he said.</p>
      <p>Steffen said they have heard backlash on why they aren’t removing his unique feature.</p>
      <p>“Why remove it and give him an undue surgery? And then why take away his specialty? He makes everybody smile,” she said.</p>
      <p>She said if they thought the extra tail would grow, they would take care of it.</p>
      <p>Steffen said Narwhal is up for adoption. They are just looking for the perfect home to give him to.</p>
