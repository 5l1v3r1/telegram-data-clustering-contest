If I had been considerate of the other party at least once, I wouldn't have caused them hurt. I really regret my foolishness. Though I deny parts of the case, I am apologetic on a moral level that I shamed them in KaKaoTalk chats and made them feel bad."<br/><br/></i>Jonghun stated, <i>"I gained popularity at a young age, and I did not live humbly. I'm embarrassed to apologize for my unscrupulous actions now. The crime of quasi-rape is too heavy, and I feel it's unfair." </i><b>Mr. Kwon</b>, who is also known as the brother of <b>Girls' Generation</b>'s <b>Yuri</b>, stated, <i>"It will be carved on my heart forever that I've made my fiancee, family, and sister, who has to live in the public eye, share this crime with me and that I caused pain."</i><br/><br/>The final verdict is expected to be revealed on November 29 at 11AM KST.<br/><b><br/></b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/jung-joon-young-facing-7-years-in-prison-jonghun-facing-5-for-group-sexual-assault">As previously reported</a> on November 13, Jung Joon Young, Jonghun, and 3 other men, including Kim and Kwon, attended their 9th trial for group sexual assault at the Seoul Central District Court.
