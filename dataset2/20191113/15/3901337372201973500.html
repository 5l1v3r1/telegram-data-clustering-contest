      <p>The Red Devils have endured an indifferent run of form in recent times, and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is reportedly set to shake things up in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>There could be a surprise arrival at Old Trafford too, after it emerged that the club retains a first option to sign a former player of theirs who has been in prolific form for his current team.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Olympique Lyonnais' official website, the French club's sporting director Juninho Pernambucano revealed that United had a priority deal in place for the signature of Netherlands star Memphis Depay.</p>

      <p>"Manchester has a priority if several clubs line up to buy it," Juninho revealed.</p>
      <p>"But we have not received any offers so far. He is really happy right now in Lyon. He deserves the armband like others."</p>

      <p>Depay spent a year and a half with United between 2015 and 2017, and scored seven goals in 53 appearances for the Premier League giants. He has since scored 50 times in 130 games for Lyon.</p>
