      <p>The private equity giant which is in the process of buying British defence firm Cobham for £4bn is said to be mulling a float of another of its UK assets.</p>
      <p>Advent International, the US investment firm, has reportedly hired advisers to prepare the stock market debut of Rubix Group, a distributor of industrial repair kits, that could give it a value of more than £2.5bn.</p>
      <p>An initial public offering (IPO) would most likely take place next year, however Advent’s potential exit from Rubix could also attract firms looking to buy it instead.</p>
      <p>Advent bought Brammer in late 2016, before merging it with French firm IPH and renaming it Rubix in 2018.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by Sky News.</p>
