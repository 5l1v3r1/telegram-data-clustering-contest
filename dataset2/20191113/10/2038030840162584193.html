      <h1>It’s the final countdown of Idols SA Season 15</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:48:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:48</time> by <a rel="author">Saara Mowlana - PARTNER CONTENT</a></address>
      <p>The time has come – the Idols SA Season 15 finale is drawing closer and while we'll miss the musical stylings, the glitz and the glamour on a weekly basis, the final showdown has us itching in anticipation. </p>
      <p>So, who are SA’s best stepping into the ring to take the title as the Season 15 Idols victor? </p>
      <p>After a gruelling 12 weeks, the top 2, who have sung their way into SA’s hearts and impressed the judges are - Sneziey Msomi and Luyolo Yiba.<br/><br/>We thought there’s no better way to get set for the finals than to revisit the best moments of their idols journey. </p>
      <h3>Sneziey Msomi </h3>
      <p>Sneziey touched us with her inspiring backstory and dreams of becoming a singer. Hailing from Durban, she was raised by her grandmother having lost her mother when she was quite young. Her grandmother believed her granddaughter was born to be star, and this was part of the reason Sneziey auditioned. Throughout the competition she has kept us all entertained with her rich jazzy vocals.  </p>

      <h3>Luyolo Yiba </h3>
      <p>Coming from Kimberly, Luyolo found his audition opportunity in the Mother City and won over the judges with his rendition of John Legend’s romantic You and I. </p>
