      <p>A domestic row proved costly for a man after police found a knife among the possessions he’d taken into the street.</p>
      <p>John Paul Quinn, 31, was jailed for 10 months at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>He admitted unlawful possession of the blade in Banavie Road, Newmains, on August 27.</p>
      <p>Quinn had been given bail in another case only 11 days previously.</p>
      <p>The court heard a neighbour called police about a disturbance at the home of his girlfriend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scott King, prosecuting, said: “They were directed to the rear of a block of flats.</p>
      <p>“The accused saw the officers and ran off, but was caught quickly. As he was being taken to a police car, he asked if he could retrieve three bags of possessions which he had dropped in a garden.</p>
      <p>“The officers were advised that Quinn might have had a knife. The bags were searched and a knife with a blade measuring 17cm was found among his clothing.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent John McLaughlin said Quinn is from Cambuslang and had moved into his girlfriend’s home two days earlier.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The solicitor explained: “There was an argument and he left to let matters calm down. When he returned he noticed his bags had been packed.</p>
      <p>“The knife was with his possessions when he moved in and he had forgotten about it.”</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Sheriff Thomas Millar told Quinn: “Custody is inevitable due to your record, but I’ll reduce the sentence from 15 months to ten because of your early guilty plea.”</p>
