      <p>Venice declared a state of emergency on Wednesday after "apocalyptic" floods swept through the lagoon city, flooding its historic basilica and inundating squares and centuries-old buildings.</p>
      <p>"These are the effects of climate change," the Venice mayor, Luigi Brugano, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>"Venice is on its knees," Brugnaro added on Wednesday. "The damage will run into hundreds of millions of euros."</p>

      <p>According to Brugano, the tide from Monday evening hit 187cm, which is just short of the overall record of 194cm set in 1966.</p>
      <p>He said schools on the city's islands would also remain closed on Wednesday as another high tide of up to 145cm was forecast for later in the morning.</p>

      <p>Pictures of the historic city showed many iconic places, such as Saint Mark's Square and Saint Mark's Basilica, underwater.</p>
      <p>It is the sixth time in 1,200 years that the basilica has been flooded, with four of those incidents happening in the last two decades.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, tourists were pictured wading through knee-deep water along the city's most popular routes, while others braved the flooding to sit outside the city's famous cafes.</p>
      <p>"A tide at 187 cm is a wound that leaves indelible marks," Brugano wrote in a later post. "Now the government must listen to Venezia."</p>

      <p>Venetians and local business owners have been asked to take a record of all the damages to their homes and businesses as a plan of action is written up.</p>
