      <p>A 20-year-old man suffered significant injuries after climbing a B.C. Hydro tower near Ladysmith, getting shocked and falling about 21 metres to the ground.</p>
      <p>He was airlifted to hospital and was listed in stable condition.</p>
      <p>Ladysmith RCMP, the Ladysmith Fire Department and B.C. Ambulance responded to the scene on Riverbend Road. The Nov. 9 incident led to power failures in the Ladysmith area, police said.</p>
      <p>“This type of activity is both illegal and highly dangerous,” said B.C. RCMP spokesman Cpl. Chris Manseau. “With the height of the tower you risk severe injury if you fall, and you’re very close to the high-power transmission lines and you risk being electrocuted and then falling.”</p>
