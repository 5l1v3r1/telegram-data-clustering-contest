      <h3>ONE of two armed robbers who held up a hardware store in Cagayan de Oro City early evening Tuesday was killed in a gunbattle with responding policemen, Police Regional Office 10 director, Brigadier General Rolando B. Anduyan said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>According to the official, the suspect engaged members of the Cagayan de Oro City Police Station 4 in a firefight outside the Columbia Hardware located at the Carmen Market on Ipil Street past 6:30 p.m. Tuesday and was killed in the process.</p>
      <p>An investigation showed that a concerned citizen went to the local police station to report a robbery-in-progress at the hardware store owned by one Jessie Co. Immediately, a team of policemen led by Major Ian Borinaga, Chief Master Sergeant Anatalio Mata and MSgts. Roy Balase and Francisco Tumanda rushed to the site where they learned that the two suspects were still inside the establishment.</p>
      <p>The officers later encountered the suspects and shot dead one of the two later identified as Archolito Palubon alias ‘Bingcol,’ a 29-year-old resident of Zone 1, Buara, Bayabas, Cagayan de Oro City.</p>
      <p>The slain suspect was found armed with a loaded caliber .45 pistol when he shot it out with the policemen along Lirio Street, right at the back of the Cagayan de Oro College. The suspect suffered a lone gunshot wound in his upper chest.</p>
      <p>The second suspect managed to flee on foot and is still being hunted as of press time.</p>
      <p>The suspects were believed to have stolen P20,000 in cash from the hardware before they encountered the local policemen. The second suspect was said to have thrown part of their loot in the air to attract the attention of the public and make good his escape.</p>
