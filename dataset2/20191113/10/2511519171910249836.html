      <p>A Paris screening of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RomanPolanski">Roman </a><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RomanPolanski">Polanski</a>’s new film <i>An Officer and a Spy </i>was shut down after protesters gathered at the event.</p>
      <p>There were around 40 people blocking the entrance to a premiere of the movie in the French city on Tuesday night, with <a href="https://www.francetvinfo.fr/societe/violences-faites-aux-femmes/avant-premiere-de-j-accuse-annulee-a-paris-on-appelle-tous-les-cinemas-a-ne-pas-projeter-ce-film-a-arreter-de-projeter-l-oeuvre-d-un-violeur_3700137.html"><i>France Info</i></a> reporting that the group were dressed in black, holding red smoke-generating canisters and signs bearing the names of women who have accused the director of rape. </p>
      <p>Demonstrations in front of the Le Champo cinema lasted approximately an hour before the screening was cancelled. </p>
      <p>The protests come in the wake of a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/roman-polanski-rape-accusation-valentine-monnier-legal-action-a9198836.html">new allegation of rape</a> against the director by French photographer Valentine Monnier, who accused him of assaulting her at his Swiss chalet in 1975. </p>
      <p>Polanski has denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>He is now considering legal action against <i>Le Parisien</i>, the French outlet that published the accusations.</p>
      <p>Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl and has been a fugitive from the US for four decades.</p>
      <p><i>An Officer and a Spy</i> premiered at the Venice Film Festival earlier this year, where it won the Grand Jury Prize.</p>
