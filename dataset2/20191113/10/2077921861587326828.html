      <h1>Hoops End Hiatus, Share Their First New Song Since 2017</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Russell  </a></address>
      <p>It’s been a little while since we’re heard from Indiana indie-pop trio Hoops—Drew Auscherman, Kevin Krauter and Keagan Beresford <a href="https://twitter.com/hoopsband/status/1019596373220642827?s=20">announced last summer</a> they were going “on indefinite hiatus,” and they’ve been quiet since (save for <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/06/kevin-krauter-new-song-pretty-boy.html">Krauter’s</a> and <a href="https://keaganberesford.bandcamp.com/releases">Beresford’s</a> respective solo releases, which you should check out). That ends today with a pleasant surprise: Hoops have reunited after what a press release refers to as “a short but necessary break,” sharing their first new song since the spring 2017 release of their debut album <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/hoops-routines-review.html">Routines</a></i>, the upbeat dance jam “They Say.”</p>
      <p>Hoops’ groovy comeback track foregrounds Beresford’s array of retro synths and Krauter’s deft bass playing, de-emphasizing the band’s trademark washed-out guitars for the most part. The result lands halfway between Earth, Wind &amp; Fire’s “September” and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Passion+Pit">Passion Pit</a>’s “Sleepyhead,” with a carefree Krauter singing, “They say / the very best in life is free / No need to compromise a thing / so, baby, wipe those tears away.” It’s good to have Hoops back.</p>
      <p>The trio have also set a reunion show for early next month: They’ll headline The Dance in Manhattan on Wednesday, Dec. 4. You can get tickets right <a href="http://hoopsband.blogspot.com/p/tour-dates.html">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Observant fans of the band likely saw this comeback coming, as Hoops teased a reunion on Twitter in late September by revealing they were in the studio:</p>
