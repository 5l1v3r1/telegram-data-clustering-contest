      <h1>Are you ready to Connect to a new career and help others reach their full potential?</h1>
      <h2>Hansel's new community service offers people with learning difficulties a day centre with a difference</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:18:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:18</time> by <a rel="author">Lorraine Howard, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lorraine-howard/</a></address>
      <p>Ensuring that people with learning disabilities and additional support needs have the same rights and choices as everyone else in the community is at the heart of Connect, an innovative service run by Hansel throughout Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>The community service offers a real alternative to traditional day services for people with learning difficulties by offering fun activities, learning opportunities and social networks.</p>
      <p>And Hansel is looking for enthusiastic recruits to join the Connect team to support and deliver the service programme and activities.</p>
      <p>Based within the Baird Centre at Hansel’s Broadmeadows estate in Symington, just off the A77, the Connect team work with around 130 customers seven days a week, daytime and evening, to enable each person to maximise their potential to become active citizens and contribute to the local community as well as develop independent living skills.</p>
      <p>The new roles offer a terrific opportunity for enthusiastic people looking to make a meaningful and positive difference in their daily work and enjoy helping people.</p>

      <p>Tom Wilson, Service Transition Manager with Hansel said: "Connect offers a pretty unique approach as it brings people together to enjoy shared interests which is hugely important as often we hear customers and their families say that they can feel very isolated in their communities.</p>
      <p>"We create opportunities alongside people to enable them to connect with others, make genuine friends and enjoy life more.</p>
      <p>"The support choices we offer have been well received and as a result we are looking to create a number of new jobs.</p>
      <p>"It’s really more than a job working at Connect, our whole ethos creates a very positive and energetic culture.</p>
      <p>"It’s a very active role we ask people to take on and we provide the potential of a rewarding career path in social care that is quite different.</p>
      <p>"Connect is ideal for anyone who enjoys working with a range of people in different places, is looking for a positive new challenge, enjoys a varied week and shares our vision."</p>
      <p>Connect is registered with The Care Inspectorate to support adults from 16 years upwards.</p>
