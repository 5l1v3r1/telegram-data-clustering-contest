      <p>The 16″ MacBook Pro is expected to arrive today<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>Subject of many rumors for several months, Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro was recently mentioned in the beta code of macOS Catalina 10.15.1. Now the US media Bloomberg is advancing a launch date for this new laptop. It will be revealed today, according to sources close to the company.</p>
      <p>Expected in the coming hours, this new MacBook would mark a first true evolution of the design used by Apple for three years for its MacBook Pro. In addition to a screen with larger dimensions in a slightly wider chassis and the presence of sharp edges planed around the slab, this 16-inch model would benefit from a remodeled keyboard, to replace the current butterfly keyboard. The MacBook Pro 16 would also replace the 15-inch MacBook Pro in Apple’s range, while the 13-inch model would remain unchanged for the time, believes <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <h3>A similar price to that of the 15″ MacBook Pro</h3>

      <p>From a technical point of view, the MacBook Pro 16 would have a resolution of 3072 by 1920 pixels and would be powered by Intel Core 9th generation chips. As with the MacBook Pro 15, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Apple">Apple</a> would rely on a Core i9 eight-core for the highest-end version of its product, intended primarily for professionals and creative. GSMArena also discusses the potential of a resized dissipation system. Especially to limit the thermal throttling observed with the huge Intel CPU on the current MacBook Pro 15.</p>
      <p>Price side, Apple would place this new model with the same price threshold as the MacBook Pro 15. Available from $2399. Overall availability would be expected during the week.</p>
      <h3>A Mac Pro expected before the end of the year?</h3>
      <p>Beyond the 16-inch MacBook Pro, whose launch seems finally to materialize. Apple plans to launch in December its new Mac Pro. Presented in detail during the brand’s last WWDC conference in June.</p>
      <p>Both devices would accompany the new products launched this year by Apple (new iPad, iPhone 11, Apple Watch 5…). Recall that the sales of the Mac still represent a steady cash flow for Apple. With an estimated annual income of $25 billion for this branch.</p>
