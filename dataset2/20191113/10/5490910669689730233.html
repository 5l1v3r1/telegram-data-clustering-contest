      <p>To mark the opening of its first online boutique in Japan, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/rihanna-savage-x-fenty-changing-lingerie-world-1203346655/">Dior</a> is offering five online exclusives, including a new Mini Book Tote, a Small Book Tote, a men’s T-shirt, a pair of sneakers, and an iPhone case.
