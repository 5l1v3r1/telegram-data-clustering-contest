      <h1>Six Indian restaurants in Notts shortlisted for prestigious curry 'Oscars'</h1>
      <h2>The celebrations will also address the continued concerns over Brexit delays</h2>

      <p>Some of Nottinghamshire's top Indian restaurants have been shortlisted for prestigious awards dubbed the curry 'Oscars'.</p>
      <p>Owners and staff will be heading to London later this month in the hope of being recognised as the finest in the region at the 15th annual British Curry Awards - the industry's foremost celebration.</p>
      <p>Curry lovers nominated their favourite restaurants and takeaways which were then vetted by an independent panel of judges.</p>
      <p>Three city centre restaurants - all on Nottingham's so-called 'curry mile' - are among the finalists. Another is in a village near the A1 and two are neighbourhood curry houses.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shortlisted for Best Restaurant in the Midlands are:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ashiana, Bathly Lane, North Road, North Muskham</p>
      <p>Calcutta Club, Maid Marian Way</p>
      <p>Lime Indian, Upminster Drive, Nuthall</p>

      <p>The awards, in association with Just Eat, will welcome a star-studded guest list from the worlds of politics, sport, film, television, showbiz and entertainment alongside celebrity chefs, who in the past have included Boris Johnson, David Cameron, the Duchess of York, David Seaman, Russell Brand and Heston Blumenthal.</p>
      <p>The ceremony will take place on Monday November 25 at Battersea Evolution.</p>
      <p>While celebrating the best in the industry, the British Curry Awards will also address the continued concerns facing local curry restaurants.</p>
      <p>While the staff shortage crisis welcomes a hopeful solution through the introduction of ‘vindaloo visas’ by Home Secretary Priti Patel before Brexit legislation is introduced, challenges continue for the local <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/top-curry-nottingham-citys-best-3442234">curry industry</a> in the face of further Brexit extensions and uncertainty.</p>

      <p>On average, 30 per cent of food imports for the UK curry industry comes from the EU and the Bank of England has raised concerns that food prices for produce such as fruit and vegetables could rise between 5-10 per cent once the UK leaves the European Union, a worrying prospect for the curry industry.</p>
      <p>The industry has raised its concerns about further Brexit delays and the uncertainty this brings, keen to ensure optimum trade deals are secured with the single market once the UK leaves the European Union, to avoid rising food supply costs having an impact on menu prices for local diners.</p>
      <p>British Curry Awards founder and the UK’s leading spokesperson and lobbyist for the curry industry, Enam Ali, said: "These are essential food supplies for our industry and we worry about this prospect and the impact it may have on our diners by way of a hike in menu prices.</p>
      <p>"As with all industries, we want to ensure the best Brexit deal is secured once we leave the single market, to safeguard against such issues. Continued Brexit extensions are prolonging the uncertainty that we and many other UK-based industries face.</p>
      <p>“I am so very grateful to local <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/new-nepalese-indian-restaurant-yak-3484674">curry restaurant</a> diners who, every year, take the effort to nominate their favourite restaurants for the British Curry Awards, and who provide us with their vital feedback, letting us know about the best service, the best curry cuisine and other factors for consideration.</p>
      <p>"Only with their feedback can their local restaurants also continue to optimise quality of the service they provide. It is the opinions and feedback of local diners that is paramount, and of far more significance than a critic’s review or a Michelin star rating."</p>
