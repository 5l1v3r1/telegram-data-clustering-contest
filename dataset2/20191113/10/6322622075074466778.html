      <p>KLANG (Nov 13): Bandar Bukit Raja Industrial Gateway (BBRIG), a joint-venture development by Sime Darby Property Bhd, Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Estate Co Ltd, has secured two major tenants, which will start operations there in 3Q2020.</p>
      <p>The tenants are Malaysian electrical appliances company Sen Heng Electric (KL) Sdn Bhd and Germany-based integrated logistics services provider Leshaco (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.</p>
      <p>The 39-acre freehold industrial development located in Bandar Bukit Raja, Klang will offer 10 Built-to-Suit (BTS) land plots with long lease options.</p>
      <p>Sime Darby Property Bhd acting group CEO Datuk Wan Hashimi Albakri said the company is currently in talks with a few interested business owners who plan to set up their facilities in BBRIG.</p>
      <p>Sen Heng has taken up 6.5 acres of land for its new Central Distribution Centre, while Leshaco’s facility will be built on a 3.6-acre plot, said Sime Darby Property acting group CEO Datuk Wan Hashimi Albakri at the groundbreaking ceremony of BBRIG today.</p>
      <p>Wan Hashimi said both facilities will have a combined built-up area of 385,000 sq ft.</p>
      <p>The construction of the facilities for both tenants is expected to start soon and the estimated construction work will take about 12 to 15 months.</p>
      <p>As its business nature requires, Leshaco (Malaysia) managing director Lothar Lauszat said the company has particular requirements for its warehouse design.</p>
      <p>“The BTS model offered by SDMIT Development enables us to build the facility that meets our criteria and the new facility will allow us to provide high quality logistics services to our customers, especially in the chemical industry, in Malaysia,” he added.</p>
      <p>Sen Heng Electric (KL) Sdn Bhd managing director Lim Kim Heng noted that the new Central Distribution Centre for the company will be used to handle over five million units of goods when the facility is ready in 2020.</p>
      <p>“The robust growth of e-commerce has changed the retail landscape, besides having 100 stores nationwide to reach out to consumers, our e-commerce business is also gaining momentum, hence we need to expand our distribution centre capacity,” said Lim.</p>
