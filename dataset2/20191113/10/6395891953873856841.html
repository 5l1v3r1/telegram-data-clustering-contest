      <p><b>COPENHAGEN, DenmarkÂ (AP)</b> - Police say two men, aged 27 and 38, have been arrested on suspicion of "gross vandalism" of gravestones in the Jewish section of a churchyard in northwestern Denmark.</p>
      <p>The men are suspected of dousing green paint on 84 gravestones and knocking over several of them.</p>
      <p>Police spokesman Klaus Arboe Rasmussen says their motive was to target "a particular group of the population based on their religion."</p>
      <p>Arboe Rasmussen added Wednesday that the men, who were not identified in line with Danish practice, also are suspected of throwing black and green paint on a building in Randers, some 177 kilometers (110 miles) northeast of Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>He added both incidents happened in the night between Friday and Saturday. Police want the men held in custody while they investigate the case.</p>
