      <h1>Netanyahu tells Islamic Jihad 'stop these attacks or absorb more blows'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:25:31+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Jerusalem (AFP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Islamic Jihad militants in Gaza must stop rocket attacks or "absorb more and more blows" as an escalation of violence raged for a second day.</p>
      <p>"They have one choice: to stop these attacks or absorb more and more blows. Their choice," Netanyahu said at the start of a cabinet meeting, adding that Israel was not seeking a further escalation.</p>
      <p>He reiterated his warning that "this could take time" and said Israel would respond to attacks "without mercy."</p>
      <p>The exchange of fire between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza began on Tuesday with an Israeli targeted strike killing an Islamic Jihad commander.</p>
      <p>Israel said the commander was responsible for rocket fire against it as well as other attacks and was planning more violence.</p>
      <p>Gaza militants retaliated with barrages of rocket fire and Israel responded with air strikes targeting what it said were Islamic Jihad sites and rocket-launching squads.</p>
      <p>A total of 18 Palestinians have been killed so far. No one has been killed in Israel, though rockets have caused damage and sent residents rushing to bomb shelters.</p>
      <p>The army says some 220 rockets have been fired into Israel since Tuesday morning, with dozens intercepted by air defences.</p>
