      <h1>Northampton boss Keith Curle insists Notts County are 'punching way below their weight'</h1>
      <h2>Cobblers manager ready to plot FA Cup downfall of his old club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:49:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Keith Curle insists his Northampton Town side will pay Notts County the "utmost respect" as he prepares to face his old club in the FA Cup second round.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> were drawn against the Cobblers in Monday's draw with the tie scheduled to take place on the weekend of November 30.</p>
      <p>Non-league Notts are the underdogs going into the clash with Curle having led the Cobblers to ninth in League Two, and there is hope of a promotion challenge at Sixfields this season.</p>
      <p>But Curle, who managed the Magpies from 2012-13, says the club's passage to the third round is far from guaranteed and is expecting Notts to be backed by considerable travelling support</p>
      <p>"It's against one of my former teams and they're a football club that you've got to say are punching way below their weight in terms of their stature and their history.</p>

      <p>"They're redeveloping themselves at the moment and putting foundations in place but it definitely won't be easy.</p>
      <p>"They'll have a fantastic following and it's local enough for their supporters to come down in their numbers.</p>
      <p>"They are a big club, have a very good history, a good stature and on the pitch they've got some good players who can be a threat.</p>
      <p>"We will show them the utmost respect and we'll see it as another opportunity for ourselves to represent Northampton Town."</p>
      <p>Notts made it through to the second round of the Cup with a thrilling 3-2 win at Ebbsfleet which continued a remarkable run for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Neal Ardley's</a> side who have lost just three of their last 19 games.</p>
      <p>But while Cobblers skipper Charlie Goode accepts Northampton are expected to be favourites given one league separates the two teams, he is expecting a difficult examination.</p>
      <p>"We'll go into the game as favourites being a league higher but it'll be a very tough game," he said.</p>
      <p>"They were in the Football League for a long time before this season so we know it'll be tough, but at the minute we're just focusing on Crewe this weekend."</p>
