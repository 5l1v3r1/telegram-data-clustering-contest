      <h3>A SERIES of anti-narcotics operations in Metro Manila conducted by agents of the National Capital Region Police Office led in the arrest of seven suspected ‘high-value’ drug targets and the confiscation of nearly P7 million worth of shabu and marijuana, NCRPO director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas announced yesterday.</h3>
      <p>The official said that one of the suspects identified as 26-year-old Monawara Pakiang alias ‘Mona,’ a vendor residing in Salas Street, Malate, Manila was arrested after she sold 50 grams of shabu worth PP340,000 to an undercover officer in front of Rizal Park in Malate, Manila at 3 p.m. last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Undercover officers of the NCRPO Regional Intelligence Division, Regional Drug Enforcement Unit and the Regional Special Operations Unit and the Manila Police District Station 1 conducted the entrapment operation which resulted in the arrest of Pakiang, a native of Talitay, Cotabato, Sinas said.</p>
      <p>A follow-up operation conducted by the same team of NCRPO anti-narcotics operatives led in the arrest of Sarah Sally, 22 and Sabel Gutierez, 25, both residents of FB Harrison Street in Estrella, Pasay City after they conspired to sell 50 grams of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ to an undercover agent in front of the Banco de Oro branch in Harrison Plaza.</p>
      <p>Both suspects are also natives of Talitay, Cotabato.</p>
      <p>Another anti-narcotics operation led in the arrest of Anowar Mocamad, 31, Tato Ameril, 21 and Fatima Garcia, 29, after they conspired to sell some 800 grams of shabu to a poseur in an apartment in Better Living Subdivision in Parañaque City.</p>
      <p>The 4th sting resulted in the arrest of Ilannie Reyes,48, a fish vendor from Basa Compound in Zapote, Las Piñas City. The suspect yielded some five kilograms of dried marijuana leaves with a market value of P600,000.</p>
      <p>All suspects are now being held at the NCRPO-RDEU lock-up facility in Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, Taguig City facing non-bailable charges for sale and possession of dangerous drugs under Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, said Sinas.</p>
