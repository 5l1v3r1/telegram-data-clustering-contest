        <b>Irish international defender Richard Keogh has reportedly submitted a formal appeal against Derby County after the club terminated his contract on the grounds of gross misconduct.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Derby club captain had his contracted terminated following his involvement in a car crash back in September that left him with serious knee injuries.</p>
      <p>Keogh had taken legal advice and according to multiple reports informed the Championship club on Tuesday that he would be opposing their decision.</p>

      <p>According to the Telegraph and Sky Sports, Keogh has submitted a formal complaint with the backing of the Professional Footballers Association (PFA).</p>
      <p>It is understood that Keogh feels treated unfairly in comparison to Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett who were driving the two vehicles involved in the crash. Both men are subsequently back playing for the Championship club.<br/><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11696/11854045/derbys-decision-to-sack-richard-keogh-sets-dangerous-precedent-claims-agent">Speaking to Talksport,</a> Keogh’s agent Cos Toffis outlined that he feels if Keogh’s dismissal is upheld, it could set a dangerous precedent for other clubs to follow.</p>

      <p>“I think it could be quite a big can of worms. If this goes in Derby’s favour there will be a lot of players in difficult positions at their football clubs.</p>
      <p>“Older players with less market value who are on a lot of money, these are scenarios you have at every football club in the world. Should they start wrapping themselves up in cotton wool to avoid any situations like this?”</p>
      <p>Quizzed on if Keogh should have known better than to get into the car with his team-mates after a night drinking, Toffis said: “I’m not going to accept that. I can’t really go into the events of the evening, but I do have a side of the events so I can’t accept what you just said.”</p>
