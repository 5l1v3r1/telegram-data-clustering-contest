      <h1>Hermes Shares Last Dates for Christmas Deliveries so You Can't Whinge About It</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:30:43+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>If you're wanting to arrange your Christmas deliveries, Hermes is getting its festive schedule out there well in advance for you.</p>
      <p>The courier has shared its last "recommended" dates, which I would treat as a solid cutoff if you don't want your loved ones sitting empty-handed while their gift wallows in a depot somewhere. If you're getting the courier to to come and collect a parcel from you, the last date you should really be aiming for is Thursday, December 19.</p>
      <p>If you're getting off your arse and sending parcels from one of Hermes' ParcelShops using the standard service, try not to do it any later than Saturday, December 21. The deadline is a little more generous for next day, extending to Sunday, December 22. Anything later than that, and you're really pushing it. So good luck explaining the lack of presents under trees.</p>

      <p>Hermes is also recommending that you give recipients the heads up so that they can track their package. It may ruin the element of surprise, but at least they'll be in when the delivery driver rocks up to the front door.</p>
      <p>But if you don't leave everything to the last minute, you should be just fine.</p>
