      <h1>Bitcoin Price Stays Static at $8,800 as NEO, BNB Steal the Limelight</h1>

      <h3>Bitcoin tracks sideways below $9K</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed another lackluster day for BTC/USD, with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/market-mostly-trades-sideways-as-bitcoin-price-hovers-around-8-800">little progress</a> over the past 12 or 24 hours. </p>
      <p>The week had begun with Bitcoin losing its foothold higher up, exiting a trading corridor between $9,000 and $9,500 and so far failing to reclaim it. </p>

      </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, analysts had remained broadly bullish on longer-term market prospects. Now, however, the short term could produce further downside.</p>
      <p>“Overall trend is down… Volume is still bearish. It’s certainly a look to hedge short play for me going into the close,” regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> told subscribers of his Telegram trading channel on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>Fellow contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a> had previously added that BTC/USD <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-ranging-continues-as-trader-says-8-400-could-be-next">could dip to $8,400</a> if bullish signals remained evasive. As noted, that figure would be just $100 off the average price for Bitcoin this year, as predicted by the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rallies-hardest-in-november-so-why-are-the-charts-bearish">Stock-to-Flow model</a>.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, traders could feel the fatigue on Wednesday, with the weekly performance showing a 6% loss, despite remaining 5% up overall versus the same time last month. </p>
      <p>Van de Poppe had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-ranging-under-93k-is-extremely-fine-says-analyst">argued</a> that such “ranging” price behavior in itself did not constitute a bearish sign.</p>
      <h3>Neo leads continued altcoin renaissance</h3>
      <p>On <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">altcoin</a> markets, meanwhile, some assets broke out of their sideways pattern to deliver noticeable moves.</p>
      <p>Out of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, Neo (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/neo">NEO</a>) and Binance Coin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/binance-coin">BNB</a>) were the clear winners on the day, achieving gains of 13.1% and 6.55% respectively. </p>
      <p>NEO was building on the upward momentum which had characterized the token in recent days. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, increased by just over 1% to $187.70.</p>

      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap stood at $241.3 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share at 65.9%.</p>
