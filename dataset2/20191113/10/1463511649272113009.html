      <h1>Four days to governorship poll, Senate approves N10b promissory note for Kogi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:55:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Emmanuel Leke</a></address>
      <p>Four days to the governorship election in Kogi State on Saturday, the Senate has approved N10.069 billion settlement of promissory note to the Kogi State Government.</p>
      <p>Kogi State had tendered the request along with other States in the Eight Senate, but it was rejected.</p>
      <p>Approval of the promissory note came following the consideration of the report of Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debt.</p>
      <p>The Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, made attempt to delay the approval of the loan, arguing that with the election on Saturday, it will be appropriate for the approval to be delayed till next week.</p>
      <p>But the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan, justified the approval, saying it was just a coincidence.</p>
      <p>Lawan said Kogi State had requested for the money in the last Senate, but it was not granted by the lawmakers.</p>
