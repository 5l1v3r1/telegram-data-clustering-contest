      <p>But Richard Guiney from the business group says its not something new.</p>
      <p>"The businesses on Grafton Street have been referring to the area as the Grafton Quarter for the refurbishment of the street that's been going on over the last number of years," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think there's a move towards that as a district brand."</p>
