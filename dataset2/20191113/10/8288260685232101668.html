      <p>McDonald’s is launching a Snickerdoodle McFlurry for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The fast food giant operates more restaurants in Birmingham than any other UK city outside of London.</p>
      <p>And the Snickerdoodle McFlurry, a festive twist on the popular dessert menu item, is the newest product being sold at McDonald's eateries.</p>
      <p>Customers who love the Golden Arches can acquire the Snickerdoodle McFlurry exclusively via McDelivery.</p>
      <p>McDonald's customers can find the products on UberEats from November 11 to 17.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The dessert is a mix of creamy vanilla soft serve, cinnamon cookie crumbles, white chocolate pieces, and a snickerdoodle topping.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s is bringing back the mint Matchmaker McFlurry this month too - after fans clamoured for its return.</p>
      <p>The popular flavour hasn't been seen in restaurants since 2013.</p>
