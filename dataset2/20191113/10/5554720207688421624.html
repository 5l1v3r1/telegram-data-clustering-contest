One fan wrote, “Powerful people comes from powerful places.” This was in reference to Deepak’s IPL team Chennai Super Kings.</p>
      <p>Days after finishing with a spell of 6-7 in four overs including a hat-trick, Deepak had claimed another hat-trick against Vidarbha while playing for Rajasthan in the ongoing Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy competition.</p>
      <p>Deepak dismissed Vidarbha’s Darshan Nalkande, Shrikant Wagh and Akshay Wadkar with his menacing bowling as he claimed his second hat-trick in three days. He ended his spell of four overs with 4/18 with his performance immensely helping his Rajasthan team</p>
