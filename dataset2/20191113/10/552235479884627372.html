      <h1>Craig Mulholland promises Rangers fans a youth revolution is coming as he praises Steven Gerrard's key role</h1>
      <h2>The youth chief has urged the club's rising stars to take advantage of loan opportunities if they present themselves elsewhere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:24:41+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Craig Mulholland is certain <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> supporters will see a wave of homegrown talent establishing themselves as first team regulars in the coming years.</p>
      <p>The academy chief has been lauded for his work with the stars of tomorrow and he has urged the current crop of talented teens to take advantage of loan opportunities if they present themselves elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Mulholland has also praised the role manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> has played in helping encourage the academy side. The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend has welcomed the likes of Lewis Mayo, Dapo Mebude and Josh McPake to take part in training sessions alongside the senior side.</p>
      <p>Rangers youth teams have enjoyed real success with the U17s winning the Al Kass Cup earlier this year. The implementation of the games programme has also allowed Scottish players to mix it with the best in Europe.</p>

      <p>And the Ibrox youth supremo reckons every player waiting for their chance should follow in the footsteps of £7million summer signing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-kent">Ryan Kent</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: "When we started this project, three or four years ago we had 14 internationals from U16s to 21s. Now we have 42.</p>
      <p>"You see how they're performing at the Youth Champions League and Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>"The average age of a player making his debut in the English Premier League, which is maybe more relevant to Rangers and Celtic than many of the other clubs in Scotland, is 23.</p>
      <p>"Ryan Kent's a good example. He's had five, six, seven loans before establishing himself in a first team.</p>
      <p>"If they are not going to play in the first team at 16 or 17 as they might do at other clubs, how do we individualise pathways? We need to get them exposure to men's football early enough, which is why the Challenge Cup run has been great.</p>

      <p>"With loan deals, but we didn't send Stephen Kelly on loan last year because we felt we needed to build his body before making that step. That's what I mean by individualising pathways.</p>
      <p>"The manager has been brilliant. Michael Beale has been through Chelsea's Academy, Liverpool's Academy. They've got a real understanding of how you get from an academy to the first team.</p>
      <p>"We expect and hope that over the next 12 months, a number of these academy lads will start finding their way to the first team."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And he is also certain Rangers have got it right with the appointment of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-wilson">Ross Wilson</a> as the club's sporting director.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old will work closely alongside Gerrard ahead of the January transfer window as the pair look to wrestle the title away from rivals Celtic.</p>
      <p>Mulholland believes the former Southampton chief's non-stop work ethic is already having an impact throughout the whole club.</p>

      <p>He added: “Ross is relentless at what he does. He has real experience and every club he has left they have been in a good position.</p>
      <p>"They promote young players and he understands the model here.</p>
      <p>"I believe Ross will take us to another level. He wants us to see every day as been better than yesterday. We will push until we make this one of the best academies in Europe that is producing players on a regular basis.He has some really ambitious ideas.</p>
      <p>"What is refreshing is the fact we have people like Ross and the gaffer, who have this energy and they know what the standards are at a big club. That pushes the club on.</p>
      <p>"You look at his record, he puts a lot of the building blocks in place.</p>
      <p>"He helped get Watford and Huddersfield to the Premier League due to that process. He managed a football programme at one of the best academies in Europe at Southampton and now we have him here.</p>
      <p>"There is loads we can learn from him. In his first week or so he has met every coach from the Under-9s to the reserves as well as every player. He has watched most of the teams and met the parents.</p>
      <p>"He is having an impact already and not just on the first team, but every level.”</p>
