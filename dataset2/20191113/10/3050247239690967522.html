      <h1>Lightning Network Will Drive Bitcoin to $250,000 by 2023 — Tim Draper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:05:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) could be worth millions of dollars after 2022 as payment processors allow easier transactions, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tim-draper">Tim Draper</a> has forecast. </p>
      <p>Speaking during a Q&amp;A session at the <a href="https://twitter.com/tippin_me/status/1194354834813706240">Malta AI &amp; Blockchain Summit</a> last week, the pro-cryptocurrency venture capitalist said innovations such as the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> would be key in propelling the Bitcoin price higher. </p>
      <h3>Draper: 4 years until $250,000 BTC</h3>
      <p>Doubling down on previous claims, Draper added he still believed BTC/USD would hit $250,000 by 2022 or 2023. </p>
      <p>“I think Bitcoin payment processors are really going to open the floodgates,” he summarized. </p>
      <p>On the topic of why Bitcoin would reach new records within just the next three to four years, Draper continued:</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s because of Lightning Network and OpenNode and maybe others that are allowing us to spend Bitcoin very freely and quickly, so that it’s not just a store of value but it can be used for micropayments; it can be used for retail, it can be used all over.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Bitcoin price bullish sentiment mounts</h3>
      <p>While not a payment processor in a strict sense, Lightning <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/lightning-network-101/what-is-lightning-network-and-how-it-works">facilitates</a> near-instant BTC transactions between nodes via channels that cost almost nothing to use. The fees for Lightning transactions can, therefore, be much cheaper than transacting on-chain — just a single satoshi (approximately $0.00008788).</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-will-hit-250k-by-q1-2023-despite-consolidation-says-tim-draper">reported</a>, Draper has long been one of Bitcoin’s biggest bulls, joining the likes of John McAfee in delivering sky-high price predictions. </p>
      <p>In September, he even went as far as to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/250k-bitcoin-price-prediction-is-now-conservative-says-tim-draper">call</a> the $250,000 figure “conservative,” while subsequently arguing Bitcoin would cause considerable <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-will-end-the-reign-of-dictators-and-toll-trolls-says-tim-draper">geopolitical upheaval</a>. </p>
      <p>Other voices have since joined him in his price belief, with BTCC exchange co-founder Bobby Lee last week claiming BTC/USD would be worth <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bobby-lee-500k-bitcoin-price-flippening-of-gold-will-come-by-2028">around $500,000</a> by 2028.</p>
