      <h2>She said she and Giovanni "have the most fun and laughs together"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:21:26+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>Michelle Visage has hit back at reports she's clashed with her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> partner Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the American TV star, 51, was "deeply unhappy" after a series of backstage rows with professional dancer Giovanni.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10333426/strictly-michelle-visage-clash-giovanni/">The Sun</a>, a source claimed RuPaul's Drag Race star Michelle and Giovanni had been "locking horns" since <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictlys-mike-bushell-relieved-to-be-eliminated-as-fans-call-fix-over-michelle-visage/">being in the bottom two last weekend.</a></p>

      <p>A source told the publication: "Michelle has become quite unhappy at times. She has a fiery relationship with Giovanni. They have been locking horns since the start.</p>
      <p>"Both are very strong characters and they’ve both had a lot to say. He’s probably not used to a partner being quite so in control and calling the shots."</p>
      <p>However, Michelle slammed the reports on social media.</p>
      <p>In a statement, she wrote: "The articles about my partner and I have been upsetting. If anyone knows us, you would know how close Giovanni and I are.</p>
      <p>"Gio is my best friend in this competition, he is my rock and I trust him with everything. We have the most fun and laughs together and to suggest otherwise is just sad.</p>

      <p>"At this very moment, we are focusing on Blackpool and we are SO excited to share our magical dance with all of you! Thanks for the love and support!"</p>
      <p>Giovanni replied: "Darling.. you have been quite popular this week in the papers.. they don’t know what to say anymore. Just keep focusing on what we are doing!</p>
      <p>"Our friendship is strong, We are strong and we know it! Blackpool here we come!"</p>
      <aside>We have the most fun and laughs together and to suggest otherwise is just sad.</aside>
      <p>Michelle recently revealed the pair can be "at each other's throats" during rehearsals.</p>
      <p>She explained to The Sun: "We’re both Italian. We’re both intense. We’re both Virgos. So there’s a perfectionist level that’s really ridiculous between us.</p>
      <p>"So Mondays and Tuesdays is a lot of us at each other’s throats. By the end of the week, we’re totally in love with each other again and it’s fine. Our relationship is very fiery. It is weird, but it’s perfect."</p>

      <p>Michelle and Giovanni found themselves in the bottom two last weekend against <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/bbc-breakfast/">BBC Breakfast</a> presenter Mike Bushell and Katya Jones.</p>
      <p>Mike and Katya were sent home and Michelle expressed her gratitude on Twitter after being saved.</p>
      <p>She wrote on Instagram: "Annnnnnnd we made it to BLACKPOOL! Thank you SO VERY MUCH to the judges @shirleyballas @motsimabuse @brunotonioliofficial #craigrevelhorwood for putting us through in the dance-off.</p>
