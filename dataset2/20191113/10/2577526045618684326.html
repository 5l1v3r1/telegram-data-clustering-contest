      <h1>Stardew Valley's Massive Endgame Update is Nearly Here</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:33:31+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p><i>Stardew Valley</i>’s long-awaited 1.4 update arrives later this month. In a <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/1-4-pc-release-date-more/">blog post</a> published last night, developer Eric Barone confirmed the update’s release date and showed off some of the new features on their way to the game.</p>
      <p>Barone says that he’s achieved his goals when it comes to polish and bug-squashing, but more importantly, “content-wise, nearly every aspect of the game has been expanded or improved upon in some way.”</p>
      <p>Some of those changes are pretty small, like a tweak to fishing that will let you catch two fish at once if you’re using a specific bait, but some - like new 14-heart events for your in-game spouse - are much bigger. Barone says he doesn’t want to spoil the changes, but that “there is more end-game stuff like that to keep things going a little further after you've completed everything.” On PC, there’ll also be a new screenshot button that lets you take a picture of your entire farm at once.</p>
      <p>The new update has been in the works for a while, but Barone confirms it’s now in its final stages, and that it will arrive on PC on November 26. Console and mobile players will have to wait a little longer, but the aim is for all other versions of the update to release “simultaneously a few weeks after PC.”</p>
