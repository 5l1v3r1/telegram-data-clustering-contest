      <p>The chocolate bars, which will be available to purchase from next week, come in three varieties: caramelised hazelnut, smooth orange and caramel and sea salt.</p>
      <p>Galaxy states it is the first major milk chocolate brand to offer a vegan alternative to its standard range.</p>
      <p>The chocolate bars come in a widely-recyclable sleeve made of card and clear, compostable film.</p>
      <p>Kerry Cavanaugh, marketing director at Galaxy manufacturer Mars Wrigley UK, said the company is “so excited” to introduce the Galaxy vegan range using a recipe that “doesn’t compromise on the brand’s signature smooth and creamy characteristics”.</p>
