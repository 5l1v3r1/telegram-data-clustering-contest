      <h3>THREE suspected ‘high-value’ targets in Central Visayas were arrested by agents of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency in separate buy-bust operations in Cebu City which led in the confiscation of some P11 million worth of shabu last Tuesday, PDEA chair, Director General Aaron N. Aquino said.</h3>
      <p>The official identified two of the arrested suspects as Merekris Zamur alias ‘Maricor Pocong/Bacol,’ 34, and Wynners Sayago alias ‘Giner,’ 40. The name of the 3rd suspect was withheld since he is only 17-years old.</p>
      <p>According to Aquino, members of the PDEA Regional Office 7 arrested the teenager in Lower Kawayan, Barangay Sambag 2 after he sold 50 grams of shabu worth P340,000 to an undercover officer 7:30  a.m. Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The young suspect also yielded a mobile phone he used in making the drug transaction, P1,280 in cash and the marked money paid to him by the poseur.</p>
      <p>Another operation in Pelaez Street in Bgy. Punta Princesa led in the arrest of Zamura who was found in possession of some 1.5 kilos of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ worth P10.2 million, several drug paraphernalia and the marked money he received from the agent.</p>
      <p>A follow-up operation in the same barangay resulted in the arrest of Sayago during an entrapment operation which yielded 50 grams of shabu worth P340,000, P706 in different denominations, a mobile phone and the buy-bust money.</p>
      <p>Aquino said that all three suspects are now facing non-bailable charges for sale and possession of dangerous drugs under Republic Act 9165, or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.</p>
