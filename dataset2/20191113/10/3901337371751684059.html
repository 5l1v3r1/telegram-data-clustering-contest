      <p>"After 19 years as a professional, I have decided to retire from playing football at the end of this season," Villa tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all the teams, coaches and teammates that have allowed me to enjoy this dreamed career. Thank you to my family, that has always been there to support me.</p>
      <p>"It is my objective to put the cherry on top by winning the Emperor's Cup with Vissel Kobe on 1 January."</p>
