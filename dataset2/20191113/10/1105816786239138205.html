      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said that world institutions including the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have endorsed that Pakistan is heading in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“World Bank has improved our ease of doing business ranking by 28 points,” he said while addressing a tripartite signing ceremony between MSD Tire and Rubber Company, Doublestar China and Dawood Pakistan Express Bus Service in Islamabad. The premier welcomed Chinese investment in various sectors of Pakistan adding that they will be provided with an enabling environment.</p>

      <p>“The current account deficit has been curtailed and the rupee has also stabilised,” said Imran adding that he was confident Pakistan will achieve higher growth rate than projected for the current fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The premier vowed to economically uplift the country by bolstering exports and attracting foreign investment.</p>
      <p>“This will not only help us reduce the import bill but the export of tires will build up our foreign exchange reserves,” said PM Imran. “Several agreements have already been signed with China and the CPEC provides a platform to further bolster the economic partnership between the two countries.”</p>
      <p>He also said that the next challenge of the government is to provide job opportunities to the youth of the country.</p>
