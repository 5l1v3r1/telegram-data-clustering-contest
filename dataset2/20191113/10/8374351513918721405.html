      <h1>Musk announces new Tesla factory will be in Germany</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:03:14+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse</a></address>
      <p>A new Tesla auto factory for the European market will be based in Germany, chief executive Elon Musk said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Musk said during a ceremony at Germany’s Golden Steering Wheel awards that the new “Gigafactory” would be “in the Berlin area.”</p>
      <p>He said the company planned the facility “near the new airport” in Berlin and that Tesla would also set up a design center in the area.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that’s part of the reason we are locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany,” he said on-stage.</p>
      <p>“We are also going to create an engineering and design center in Berlin because I think Berlin has some of the best art in the world.”</p>
      <p>The news highlights a further global expansion for the electric automaker, which last month said its factory in China had started production.</p>
      <p>Musk offered few details, but reports have said the company hopes to begin European production by 2021.</p>
      <p>Tesla is estimated to have some 30 percent of the European market for battery-powered cars.</p>
