      <h1>Jakarta gov’t warns public against using electric scooters on pedestrian bridge after photos of damages go viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:15:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Since its launch <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/grab-launches-indonesias-first-e-scooter-sharing-service-grabwheels-available-in-bsd-city/">earlier this year,</a> GrabWheels — an e-scooter rental service by Singapore-based app Grab — has somewhat become a trend among youngsters in Jakarta and Tangerang. As there have been no regulations on e-scooters, the users are still oblivious on whether they should or shouldn’t ride them in certain locations, including pedestrian bridges.</p>
      <p>Jakarta Bina Marga Agency posted a series of screenshots from CCTV recording showing people using e-scooters on the newly revitalized pedestrian bridges on Jakarta’s main thoroughfare of Sudirman. The bridge’s wooden floor appears to be damaged as the result of the e-scooter wheels.</p>

      <p>“Hello Jakartans, users of skateboard and e-scooter (GrabWheels) are not allowed to ride on Sudirman pedestrian bridges (Senayan roundabout, Gelora Bung Karno stadium, and Jakarta Metro Police). Other than disturbing other bridge users, [the equipment] can also damage the bridge. Let’s be wise in using public facilities, we use and take care of them together,” the agency wrote in the caption.</p>
      <p>The Jakarta Transport Agency (Dishub DKI) Chief Syafrin Liputo said his team has met Grab officials and they promised to tackle the matter from their end. </p>
      <p>“We have discussed the matter with Grab, and they will install a device on pedestrian bridges that functions to turn off the e-scooter,” Syafrin <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4781903/jpo-sudirman-rusak-gegara-dilintasi-skuter-listrik-pemprov-dki-beri-warning">told </a><i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4781903/jpo-sudirman-rusak-gegara-dilintasi-skuter-listrik-pemprov-dki-beri-warning">Detik</a> </i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4781903/jpo-sudirman-rusak-gegara-dilintasi-skuter-listrik-pemprov-dki-beri-warning">today</a>. </p>
      <p>Syafrin said the agency is currently drafting a new regulation regarding e-scooters. At the moment, they have issued <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4782475/dilarang-di-trotoar-jpo-skuter-listrik-boleh-pakai-jalur-sepeda?single=1">a ban of e-scooters on public facilities</a> such as pedestrian bridges, sidewalks, as well as car-free day on Sudirman-Thamrin every Sunday – but users are allowed to ride in the <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/dont-cross-the-line-drivers-entering-jakartas-dedicated-bike-lanes-may-be-fined-idr500k/">bicycle lanes</a>. </p>
