      <p>Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez spoke to El Larguero on Tuesday night. During the interview, he spoke about many things, including Real Madrid's Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>"Bale and I have met once when we went to see our agents," Saul said. "I was really surprised, [he was] a super nice guy, we were speaking for a little bit... in Spanish!"</p>
      <p>The Wales forward has often been criticised for not dominating the language but Saul revealed that he does speak Spanish better than we have been led to believe.</p>
      <p>Saul also spoke about Luis Enrique leaving his role as Spain boss. "It was terrible news for us," he said, but he approves of his replacement. "Robert Moreno was a good appointment."</p>
