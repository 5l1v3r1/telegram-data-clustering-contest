      <h1>Kilmarnock pool forced to close after 'diarrhoea incident' during swimming lessons</h1>
      <h2>The Galleon Centre's pool closed last night after the incident.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:39:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Dunn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>The mystery closure of a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> pool was due to a 'diarrhoea incident'.</p>
      <p>A boss at the Galleon Centre confirmed that the outbreak took place yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>Since the incident a super deep clean of the pool has been underway and the pool has remained closed since.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But bosses are now hopeful of reopening the pool this afternoon.</p>
      <p>David Hasson, Galleon acting general manager, said: "Unfortunately we had to close the pool around 5.30pm yesterday as one of our bathers had diarrhoea during swimming lessons.</p>
      <p>"Diarrhoea is likely to contain bacteria and viruses and may also contain cryptosporidium.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Under health and safety guidelines we have strict procedures to follow to ensure the safety of all swimmers.</p>
      <p>"This means closing the pool for a period of time to allow us to go through the process of chlorination and backwashing.</p>
      <p>"We hope to be open this afternoon but we will keep everyone up to date on our Facebook page."</p>
      <p>A statement on the Galleon's Facebook page read: "Unfortunately we had to close our pool yesterday evening due to an incident of diarrhoea.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Our standard operating procedure is to close the pool immediately for super-chlorination and carry out a deep clean of the pool, surround, showers and changing facilities, in accordance with PWTAG guidelines.</p>
      <p>"This procedure can take up to 15 hours before we lower chlorine levels back down to operational levels.</p>
      <p>"We are in the process of bringing levels down and will post an update on likely opening times by 12pm today."</p>
