      <p>Encounters between Bafana Bafana and Ghana have often been on the edge, though the Black Stars have seemingly had the upper hand in official matches like the Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers.</p>

      <p>The two sides face off again tomorrow night in Cape Coast for the opener of the 2021 Afcon qualifier in Group C, and the Siya crew looks at FIVE of Ghana’s key men going into this titanic battle that will set the tone for the rest of the qualification phase. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Richard Ofori (Maritzburg United)</b>
      </p>
      <p>He knows the core of the Bafana team well given that he is a goalkeeper in the PSL and the majority of coach Molefi Ntseki’s squad is made up of locally based players. Ofori has singlehandedly won matches for both club and country in the past.  </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Mubarak Wakaso (Deportivo Alaves, Spain)</b>
      </p>
      <p>With over 50 caps for Ghana, he is among the most experienced in the side. A key player for several years now and will be looking to help the Black Stars get off to a good start in this Afcon campaign after the disappointment of the one in Egypt in July. A midfielder with a serious goal threat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thomas Partey (Atletico Madrid, Spain)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Expect a midfield battle between Partey and Dean Furman, with the Ghanaian also known for his good distribution and being involved in build-up play. Has come in for some praise in Spain since joining Madrid four years ago.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jordan Ayew (Crystal Palace, England)</b>
      </p>
      <p>He’s managed to start all but one of his club’s Premier League matches and contributed with four goals so far this season. Jordan appears to be the main man for Roy Hodgson upfront and is expected to carry that confidence to this crucial fixture.</p>
      <p>
        <b>André Ayew (Swansea City, England)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Much like his brother, Andre has been in good form for his club. He is also the leader of the Black Stars and shows that with his goal and assists contribution.</p>
      <p>If there is any player Bafana captain Thulani Hlatshwayo and his defenders need to pay special attention to – it’s André Ayew.  </p>
