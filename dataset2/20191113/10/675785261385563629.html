      <p>Live television can throw up all kinds of danger - even before you add us normal people looking to bag our five seconds of fame.</p>
      <p>From school students opening their results and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/watch-exactly-sky-sports-banned-5052846">finding out their dreams have been crushed</a> in front of the entire nation to Sky Sports being forced to take its transfer deadline day coverage behind closed doors <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/watch-exactly-sky-sports-banned-5052846">after it descended into chaos</a> , it doesn't always go to plan.</p>
      <p>Fox Sports took to the airwaves yesterday to report on Carolina Hurricanes' 8-2 win over the Ottawa Senators in the ice hockey.</p>
      <p>It all seemed to go swimmingly as the reporter delivered his piece to camera without a hitch while fans young and old waved frantically in the background.</p>

      <p>But many viewers missed an incredible moment in the background of the report - which has since been labelled 'the greatest theft captured on film'.</p>
      <p>As a man becomes distracted looking at his friend's phone, a fellow Hurricanes fan gently lifts the ice cream he is holding out of its paper sleeve and takes an extremely generous bite.</p>
      <p>The light-fingered thief, now identified as Weston Davis, attempts to return dessert but as its owner becomes aware of the daring raid and looks around to identify his mugger, Weston ducks into the crowd to escape with the loot.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The clip has since been viewed millions of times online after being shared by outlets including ESPN and the official Hurricanes account, where people were left stunned by the 'smooth move'.</p>
      <p>After plenty of others branded the stunt 'fake' and 'staged', Weston came forward to reveal that although his victim was long-term friend Joe Campen, the heist wasn't a set-up.</p>
      <p>Joe, who has known Weston since high school and attended the game with him, told <a href="https://theathletic.com/1371279/2019/11/12/seriously-the-oral-history-of-the-stolen-ice-cream-cone-at-the-hurricanes-game/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> he felt someone messing with the cone but ignored it as he never thought someone would be so brazen to pinch it.</p>
      <p>Insisting the prank wasn't fake, Weston said: "Joe and I are good friend.</p>
      <p>"He was standing there behind the camera and I just thought I’d mess with him hoping maybe the camera would get a shot of it."</p>
