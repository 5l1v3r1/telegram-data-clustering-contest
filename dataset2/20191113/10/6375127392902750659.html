      <p>AGENTS of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency shortly after noon yesterday arrested a 23-year-old woman who sold 500 grams of shabu worth P3.4 million to an undercover officer in Novaliches, Quezon City, PDEA chair, Director General Aaron N. Aquino said.</p>
      <p>Suspect Roselle Bolivar, a jobless resident of Pangarap Village, Caloocan City yielded five knot-tied transparent plastic packets each containing 100 grams of the so-called ‘poor man’s cocaine’ during the buy-bust operation at the parking lot of a shopping mall in Barangay Pasong Putik in Novaliches at 12:45 p.m. yesterday, the official said.</p>
      <p>Aquino said that undercover officers of the PDEA National Capital Region under Director Joel Plaza and the PDEA Regional Special Enforcement Team conducted the sting following weeks of surveillance and eventual drug negotiation.</p>
      <p>The suspect will be facing non-bailable charges for violation of Section 5 (Sale of Dangerous Drugs) of Article II of the Republic Act 9165 otherwise known as “The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.”</p>
      <p>Aquino said that the suspect is now being held at the PDEA lock-up facility in Q.C.</p>
