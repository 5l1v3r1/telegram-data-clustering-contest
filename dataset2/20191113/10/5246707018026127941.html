      <p>The revised design of Sonic the Hedgehog in Paramount's upcoming movie <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/video_oh_boy_sonics_movie_redesign_is_revealed_in_brand_new_trailer">has been revealed</a>, and it's been widely praised as a huge, massive, <i>incalculable</i> improvement on the character seen in <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/sonic_the_hedgehog_movie_gets_its_first_official_trailer_and_its_definitely_something">the original trailer</a>. Following the debacle surrounding the initial reveal (<i>Sonicgate? Hedgehogate?</i> It's always a <i>-gate</i>), it was rumoured that Tyson Hesse, Sonic-fan extraordinaire and animator of the excellent <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania"><b>Sonic Mania</b></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA9zwpMj_8A">intro movie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDYbwdEn7rs">accompanying shorts</a>, was involved in the emergency redesign of the fastest thing alive.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/fowltown/status/1131937685700980736?s=20">original tweet</a> revealing the revised Valentine's Day 2020 release date featured an image <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/the_director_of_sonic_mania_adventures_might_be_working_on_the_blue_blurs_movie_redesign">which eagle-eyed fans deduced might be the handiwork of the talented animator</a>. Hesse fanned the flames by posting <a href="https://twitter.com/tyson_hesse/status/1132095399462727680?s=20">an image of Tony Stark</a> from the original <b>Iron Man</b> film moments before (SPOILERS!) he reveals himself to be the titular hero at the end of the movie.</p>
      <p>Well, Hesse has once again taken to Twitter to confirm that, yes, t'was he that took the helm and turned this ship around:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Obviously, he didn't do this job alone and the many VFX artists and animators responsible for implementing his redesign deserve plaudits for the hard work they've put in here. Opinions will always differ, but you'll have a hard time finding someone on the internet that'll argue the original was better.</p>
