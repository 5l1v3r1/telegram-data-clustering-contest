      <h1>Pollard signs for Brumbies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T10:26:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/brumbies">Brumbies</a> have confirmed that highly-rated Australian U18 hooker Billy Pollard has committed to Rugby <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> and the Brumbies under a four-year contract with the club.</p>
      <p>Pollard will join the Brumbies Academy Development Programme for 2020, including pre-season training time with the Plus500 Brumbies, alongside other Brumbies development players.</p>
      <p>Pollard, who had attracted the attention of several high-profile NRL clubs throughout his formative career, has chosen rugby union after a series of strong performances, culminating in a standout display for the young Wallabies in their win over New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Playing in the front row, Pollard showed great speed and determination to go the length of the field in the U18 Test match, hauled down just short of the line, a snapshot of the pace, skill and potential that he possesses.</p>

      <p>“We are extremely happy to have signed Billy, who we believe is a player with enormous potential,” Plus500 Brumbies Head Coach Dan McKellar commented.</p>
      <p>“Like any 18-year-old hooker, Billy is just getting started, but he has the necessary attributes to succeed at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> level and is very much in the mould of the modern-day hooker.</p>
      <p>“In attack he is dynamic, wants the ball in his hands and has tremendous speed and acceleration for a front rower. Defensively he is abrasive and aggressive, loves to compete and enjoys the physical side of the game. These are great natural traits that Billy has.</p>

      <p>“We are excited to work closely with Billy over the next few years to ensure he reaches his full potential and goes on to have a long career with our club.”</p>
      <p>Pollard had a choice of a number of clubs, across both codes, but ultimately picked the Brumbies due to their proven track-record of improving young players and giving them a chance to express their talent.</p>
      <p>“I am very excited to be able to sign for the Brumbies,” Pollard said of his deal. “The club is well-known for giving young players an opportunity and helping them to develop in their career.</p>
      <p>“I am looking forward to working with Dan and Laurie [Fisher] and learning off some of the best front row forwards in the country. The Brumbies set-piece is one of the best around and I can’t wait to get started.”</p>
