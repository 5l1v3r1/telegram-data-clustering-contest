      <h1>Steve Sidwell recalls headbutting team-mate Nicky Shorey amid Sterling vs Gomez fallout</h1>
      <h2>Former Chelsea and Reading midfielder says England training bust-up is 'the kind of thing that happens regularly' from youth level upwards</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:36:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Steve Sidwell said the bust-up between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez is 'the kind of thing that happens once a week' - as he recalled the time he headbutted team-mate Nicky Shorey.</p>
      <p>Sterling has been axed by England boss Gareth Southgate for Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro over his part in a spat with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-gomez">Gomez</a> which spilled over from Sunday's game between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>The controversy has marred a magnificent few months for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Sterling</a> , who has been lauded over his excellent form for club and country and his role in campaigning against racism in football.</p>
      <p>But former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and Reading midfielder Sidwell said such rows are a regular occurrence in football squads, saying: "It's the things that happen probably once a week, once a month."</p>
      <p>And he recalled the time he was hauled into the manager's office after headbutting Nicky Shorey after feeling he had been on the end of a bad tackle from his Reading team-mate.</p>

      <p>"I've got up and pushed him, he's pushed me back and I've just thrown a head on his nose," said Sidwell on The Debate on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"His nose is splattered, he's swung for me, he's caught me, and Steve Coppell's come over.</p>
      <p>"Before you know it training's stopped, we're in the manager's office, and he was like 'What's going on?'.</p>
      <p>"We said 'I don't know', we shook hands - but the mad thing about it was we were car-sharing at the time. We were neighbours.</p>

      <p>"We drove home, went for a pint, and nothing ever happened.</p>
      <p>"Football's a unique environment, and this happens from youth teams upwards."</p>
      <p>Sterling apologised to Gomez and the rest of the England players following their bust-up on Monday, then released a statement via <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> in which he said the two had "moved on" from the incident.</p>
      <p>He and Gomez were then pictured joking together in training on Tuesday.</p>
