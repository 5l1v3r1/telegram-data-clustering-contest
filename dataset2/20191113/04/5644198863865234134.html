      <p>Tesla has an engineering firm in Pruem, Germany, that specializes in automated manufacturing systems for battery-making plants.</p>
      <p>In October, Reuters reported that the automaker is aiming to start production for its factory in China amid uncertainties around orders, labor and suppliers.</p>
      <p>The automaker reported a profit in its third quarter in late October, surprising investors who doubted about Tesla's profitability and its ability to compete with larger global rivals.</p>
