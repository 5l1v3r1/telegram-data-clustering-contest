      <h1>Scottish Government accused of 'complacency' over dishing out anti-overdose kits amid drugs crisis</h1>
      <h2>Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick has admitted he has no idea how many people are trained to administer naloxone, the anti-overdose medication.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McGivern, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcgivern/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-government">Scottish Government</a> has been accused of complacency over provision of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drugs-1">anti-overdose kits</a>, amid a drug death epidemic. </p>
      <p>Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick has admitted he has no idea how many people are trained to administer naloxone, which reverses the effects of opiate overdose, in Scotland.</p>
      <p>The man spearheading the nation’s response to a world’s worst drug death rate has also admitted the Government does not hold data on how much cash has been devoted to naloxone since 2016, a period in which the death rate has shot up from 706 to 1187.</p>

      <p>Scottish Labour’s shadow health minister Monica Lennon was furious when she gave written questions to FitzPatrick, only to be fobbed off weeks later.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “The Scottish Government can’t even answer basic questions about the action being taken to tackle Scotland’s drug deaths crisis. I asked about Naloxone training weeks ago and it’s embarrassing the Minister hasn’t bothered to get this information.</p>
      <p>“Where is the emergency response to the drugs crisis? It’s right that SNP Ministers made money available for the National Naloxone Programme but it beggars belief that they don’t know how many emergency responders, like police officers, or pharmacists are equipped to use it.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to see where progress is being made and it’s unacceptable for the Public Health Minister to send MSPs away to dig out the information he should already have.”</p>
      <p>To Lennon’s query on how many responders in each emergency service are trained on how to administer naloxone, FitzPatrick said: “The Scottish Government does not hold this information centrally. Any requests for this information should be directed to the respective emergency services.”</p>
      <p>The question on how much funding has been provided to the national naloxone programme was answered with a table covering from 2011 to 2016, which saw funding go from £147,000 to £249,000, peaking at £390,000 in 2015.</p>
      <p>FitzPatrick adds: “As the programme concluded in 2016, the responsibility transferred to organisations who offer drug addiction services and Health Boards to fund the supply of naloxone locally.</p>
      <p>“Additionally, the Drug Death Taskforce is committed to widen the provision of naloxone to those who are most vulnerable.”</p>
      <p>Joe FitzPatrick announced the formation of the Scottish Drug Deaths Taskforce as a direct result of the Daily Record's campaign to turn things around.</p>

      <p>The Scottish Government refused our demand for a public inquiry at the time - stressing that Scotland needs immediate, rolling responses.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “Effectively, the minister is telling me to go out and dig around for the information myself because he can’t be bothered. If I have to wait weeks or months putting in Freedom of Information requests that is a complete waste of time.</p>
      <p>“I would like to see clear evidence of this crisis being given the urgency it clearly requires.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesperson defended the naloxone response, saying: “Scotland was the first country in the world to announce a national take home naloxone programme in November 2010, which was coordinated and funded by the Scottish Government. The programme played an important role in empowering individuals, families, friends and communities to reverse an opiate overdose.</p>
      <p>“Between 2010 and 2016, over £1 million Scottish Government funding was made available for the national naloxone programme, supporting Alcohol and Drug Partnerships and Health Boards to develop local programmes.</p>
      <p>“Although the national programme has now ended, we have supported the embedding of naloxone provision in local NHS Health Board areas and are working closely with local partners to ensure naloxone remains a priority and is accessible for those who most need it.  </p>
      <p>“The Drug Death Taskforce is working with the Scottish Ambulance Service and other emergency responders to further extend take home naloxone provision.”</p>

      <p>The Record's call to decriminalise the use of drugs, while hitting dealers hard, has been supported by the the SNP, which has adopted the position as official party policy.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Affairs Committee at Westminster has also stressed the need for such a radical approach.</p>
