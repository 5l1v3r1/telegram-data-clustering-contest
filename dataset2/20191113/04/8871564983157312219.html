      <p>An Irish alt-rock act will return to the Thai kingdom early next year as one of the main acts at a two-day music festival in Pattaya. </p>
      <p>Maya Music Festival <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mayamusicfest/photos/a.1533536673581711/2495928867342482/?type=3&amp;permPage=1">announced</a> yesterday that it will have Irish rockers Kodaline live on stage for its fifth year. The quartet — Steve Garrigan, Mark Prendergast, Vincent May and Jason Boland — are known for their debut single <i>All I Want</i>, <i>High Hopes</i> and <i>The One</i>.</p>
      <p>The outdoor music event will celebrate its fifth birthday in late January by going “mega scale” on a 300-rai (48-hectare) field with four stages for different musical genres. It will also feature an outdoor flea market and RV camping. </p>
      <p>Founded in Dublin in 2006, Kodaline performed in Thailand for the first time earlier this year at <a href="https://directory.coconuts.co/events/bangkok/nightlife/mangosteen-music-festival-detour/">Mangosteen Music Festival</a>.
