      <p>MEDAN, Indonesia: A suspected suicide bombing outside a police station in Indonesia has left at least one attacker dead, authorities said Wednesday.<br/><br/>The explosion happened around 8:45 a.m. local time (0145 GMT) at a police compound in Medan on Sumatra island.<br/><br/>“We suspect this is a suicide bombing with one attacker killed,” national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.<br/><br/>An AFP reporter at the scene saw a body lying on the ground outside the station.<br/><br/>A police source who did not want to be named told AFP that the attack was perpetrated by at least two suicide bombers, but that was not officially confirmed.<br/><br/>Unconfirmed local media reports said at least one police officer had been rushed to hospital after the bombing but that their condition was not immediately known.<br/><br/>Police stations have been frequent targets for radicals in the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation, which has long struggled with Islamist militancy.<br/><br/>In August, Indonesian authorities shot and arrested a suspected militant who attacked police officers at a station in the country’s second-biggest city Surabaya.</p>
