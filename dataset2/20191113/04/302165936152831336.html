      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — Two days after controversial Singaporean actor Aliff Aziz and singer was arrested for an alleged drunken brawl in Singapore, he took to social media to thank his fans.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on his mother’s Facebook page, Siti Hafizah Sheikh Mohamad, the 28-year-old thanked fans for their support and admitted that 2019 has been a difficult year for him, having faced many tests.</p>

      <p>“Thank you to all the good-hearted people who messaged me personally.</p>
      <p>“It has been a tough year for me spiritually and mentally but may Allah help me to become a stronger person,” he added.</p>
      <p>The scandal-ridden actor, who has continuously been making headlines for all the wrong reasons, was recently detained by several police officers near Orchard Towers, along Orchard Road in Singapore. </p>
      <p>A minute-long video of the incident that was circulating on social media showed the singer being taken down by police officers on patrol, while he was shouting into his mobile phone.</p>

      <p>In the clip, he was also heard yelling, “You talk to my father” repeatedly as two police officers tried to handcuff him on the ground.</p>
      <p>Responding to the negative comments online regarding his actions, especially the phone call he made during the arrest, Aliff said it is normal for a son to ask for his father’s help in such situations.</p>
      <p>He also admitted that he can’t recall much from the incident, but has read many versions of stories (news reports) about him being drunk.</p>
      <p>“As long as I’m still alive, I’ll try to fix it.</p>
      <p>“I hope there is a reward for me in the afterlife, not because of the good I’ve done, but because there are many people who like to talk bad behind me,” he added.</p>
