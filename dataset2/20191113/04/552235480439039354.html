      <h2>Barrhead Travel founder Bill Munro was also accused of taking Travel Leaders group “for a ride” in a series of blistering emails</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Stewart, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Scottish tycoon</a> was slated in a foul-mouthed email from the US firm that bought his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/holidays">£36million travel empire</a>, an employment tribunal heard yesterday.</p>
      <p>Barrhead Travel’s founder Bill Munro was also accused of taking Travel Leaders Group “for a ride” in a series of blistering emails.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Knapp, a senior vice-president with Travel Leaders, made Munro redundant months after buying the firm last year, the tribunal in Glasgow heard.</p>
      <p>During the deal, Knapp sent an email saying: “F*** him! I’m happy to acquiesce but my recommendation is to serve him notice day one after completion.”</p>

      <p>In another email to Munro’s solicitors, Knapp said the Scot “either is really dense or he is trying to take us for a ride”.</p>
      <p>Munro, 75, launched legal action claiming unfair dismissal and is trying to be ­reinstated at the company.</p>
      <p>At first, he stayed on as chairman after the buyout but claims his dismissal was a “sham”.</p>
      <p>Munro started Barrhead Travel in 1975. It grew to more than 70 stores, employing 1000 workers.</p>
      <p>Bill and his daughter Sharon sold ­Barrhead Travel to Travel Leaders in February last year.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the tribunal heard that Munro was offered a new position with Travel Leaders UK but refused because it removed his 42 years of continuous service with the firm.</p>
      <p>When this was put to Knapp, he said this was a “silly” issue to be concerned about.</p>
      <p>Under UK law, workers have little protection of employment if they have less than two years’ service.</p>
      <p>The tribunal continues.</p>
