      <p>Surveillance video shows Justin Thorne inside a hotel in Cobb County, Georgia, where police said he robbed two guests at gunpoint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-county/former-officer-held-up-motel-guests-at-gunpoint-while-in-uniform-police-say/1007925356?ry9efh">WSB-TV</a> said several sources within the Atlanta Police Department tipped them off to the story, calling Thorne an embarrassment to the entire police force.</p>
      <p>The robbery happened Oct. 17 inside the Comfort Inn and Suites off Windy Hill Road in Cobb County during the late morning hours.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows Thorne dressed in his police gear that included a bulletproof vest, hat, full uniform, a gun and even a police badge.</p>
      <p>But what the hotel staff didn't know at the time was that this 22-year-old, who is now under arrest and charged with multiple felonies, wasn't there to conduct an investigation.</p>
      <p>Instead, Cobb County police say, he was there to commit an armed robbery.</p>
      <p>The holdup happened inside a hotel room where two guests were forced to hand over $800 in cash and an iPhone valued at $700.</p>
      <p>Cobb police worked the case for days and through the help of APD, they identified Thorne as their suspect.</p>
      <p>Cobb police will only say this is an ongoing investigation</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/cobb-county/former-officer-held-up-motel-guests-at-gunpoint-while-in-uniform-police-say/1007925356?ry9efh">WSB-TV</a> looked into Thorne's record and learned he joined APD in 2017, working as a patrol officer on the city's southeast side until earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In a statement, an APD spokesman said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"APD's Office of Professional Standards was investigating then-Officer Justin Thorne after receiving an allegation in late September that Thorne had offered to take payment from a suspect with an outstanding warrant in exchange for making the warrant go away. When Thorne was asked by OPS to make a statement about the allegation, he chose to abruptly resign on October 1."</i>
