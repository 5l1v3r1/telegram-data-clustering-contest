      <p>Facebook's latest transparency report is out. The social media giant said the number of government demands for user data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/facebook-says-government-demands-for-user-data-are-at-a-record-high/">increased by 16% to 128,617 demands during the first-half of this year</a> compared to the second-half of last year. From a report:<i> That's the highest number of government demands its received in any reporting period since it published its first transparency report in 2013. The U.S. government led the way with the most number of requests -- 50,741 demands for user data resulting in some account or user data given to authorities in 88% of cases. Facebook said two-thirds of all of the U.S. government's requests came with a gag order, preventing the company from telling the user about the request for their data. But Facebook said it was able to release details of 11 so-called national security letters (NSLs) for the first time after their gag provisions were lifted during the period. National security letters can compel companies to turn over non-content data at the request of the FBI. These letters are not approved by a judge, and often come with a gag order preventing their disclosure. But since the Freedom Act passed in 2015, companies have been allowed to request the lifting of those gag orders.</i></p>
