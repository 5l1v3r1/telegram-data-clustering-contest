      <p>Children in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-services">care</a> are still being failed five years after landmark legislation was passed in Scotland.</p>
      <p>A report on youth homelessness said improvements in 2014 vary across council areas and leave some vulnerable people “poorly supported”.</p>
      <p>Young people who grew up in care and who found themselves homeless said there have been major improvements since the Children and Young People Act of 2014 was passed at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-parliament">Holyrood</a>.</p>
      <p>But a report on their experiences added: “They often continue to find themselves moving on from care at too early an age, before they are ready, often poorly prepared or poorly supported and with limited or no choice.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The findings were led by a coalition called A Way Home Scotland, chaired by former children’s commissioner Tam Baillie and unveiled by Scottish Government housing minister Kevin Stewart.</p>
      <p>Megan Sutherland, who grew up in care and was at yesterday’s report launch, said: “The 2014 Act was a huge improvement but too much responsibility still rests with children, not their corporate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parents</a>.”</p>
      <p>Megan left care in Inverness aged 17 and spent time “sofa surfing” before getting a place at university in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a>. She said: “There has been a huge improvement since 2014 but too much responsibility is left with children.”</p>
      <p>Stewart said: “Young people leaving care are some of the most vulnerable people in our society and we should take all actions possible to prevent them from ever becoming homeless.”</p>
