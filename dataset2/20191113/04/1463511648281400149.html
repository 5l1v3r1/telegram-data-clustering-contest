      <h1>I gave Obasanjo $140,000 on behalf of Atiku’s son-in-law — Witness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T04:44:11+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 04:44</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>A Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday heard that Abdullahi Babalele, a son-in-law of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, allegedly gave former President Olusegun Obasanjo the naira equivalent of $140,000.</p>
      <p>An Economic and Financial Crimes Commission witness, Bashir Mohammed, told Justice C.J. Aneke that he delivered the cash to Obasanjo on behalf of his “close friend” Babalele.</p>
      <p>Babalele is on trial for allegedly laundering $140,000 in the build-up to the 2019 general elections.</p>
      <p>The EFCC arraigned him on two counts of money laundering in August.</p>
      <p>Babalele was accused of procuring Mohammed “to make cash payment of $140,000 without going through any financial institution.”</p>
      <p>The EFCC prosecutor, Rotimi Oyedepo, said the money exceeded the threshold stipulated by the money laundering Act.</p>
      <p>The alleged February 20, 2019 transaction contravened Sections 18 (c) and (2)(b)of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, Oyedepo said.</p>
      <p>Babalele pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the EFCC opened its case against Babalele by calling Mohammed as its first witness.</p>
      <p>Mohammed, who was led in evidence by Oyedepo, narrated how he allegedly delivered the sum to the former president in his Abeokuta, Ogun State home before the election.</p>
      <p>Obasanjo endorsed Abubakar, who was the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, for the election.</p>
      <p>Abubakar lost the election to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said he got a phone call from Babalele sometime in February, requesting him to deliver a message to “an elder statesman”.</p>
      <p>He said on Babalele’s request he supplied two bank accounts, which were credited.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the witness took the money to Obasanjo’s residence in Abeokuta, Ogun State.</p>
      <p>Mohammed said: “When I got to the gate, somebody came and took me inside where I met former President Olusegun Obasanjo and delivered the message.</p>
      <p>“I called the defendant in the presence of former President Obasanjo and informed him that I had delivered the message.</p>
      <p>“He said that was good and thanked me.”</p>
      <p>Under cross-examination by the defence counsel, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), Mohammed affirmed that he wrote a statement at the EFCC office during investigation.</p>
      <p>Ozekhome’s bid to tender the statement as an exhibit was, however, opposed by the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>Justice Aneke adjourned till Wednesday (today) to rule on the admissibility of the statement.</p>
