      <p>MEDAN, Nov 13 — A suspected suicide bombing outside a police station in Indonesia has left at least one attacker dead, authorities said today.</p>
      <p>The explosion happened around 8.45am local time (9.45am Malaysian Time) at a police compound in Medan on Sumatra island.</p>
      <p>“We suspect this is a suicide bombing with one attacker killed,” national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>An AFP reporter at the scene saw a body lying on the ground outside the station.</p>
      <p>A police source who did not want to be named told AFP that the attack was perpetrated by at least two suicide bombers, but that was not officially confirmed.</p>
      <p>Unconfirmed local media reports said at least one police officer had been rushed to hospital after the bombing but that their condition was not immediately known.</p>
      <p>Police stations have been frequent targets for radicals in the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation, which has long struggled with Islamist militancy.</p>
      <p>In August, Indonesian authorities shot and arrested a suspected militant who attacked police officers at a station in the country’s second-biggest city Surabaya.  — AFP</p>
