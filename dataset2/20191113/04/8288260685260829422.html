      <h3>Happy days</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City great Geoff Horsfield has described how disparaging comments from Aston Villa’s Olof Mellberg inspired Blues to a legendary derby victory over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>In a superb interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/UndrTheCosh">Undr The Cosh</a> podcast the ex-Blues and West Brom striker discusses his relationship with Trevor Francis, the celebrations after winning promotion at the Millennium Stadium - and the first Second City clash in 16 years.</p>
      <p>Horsfield, who scored in two games against Villa, was part of the team which won 3-0 at St Andrew’s in September 2002 and he has recalled how then boss Steve Bruce motivated his men following an interview given by the Villa defender.</p>

      <p>“Mellberg put in the paper on the Thursday ‘I have never even heard of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> and I have never heard of their players - that was it,” Horsfield told Undr The Cosh.</p>
      <p>“We tore them to bits in the tunnel, and I mean frightened them to death.”</p>

      <h3>Sky Blue thinking</h3>
      <p>Coventry City will have to move their second round FA Cup tie because of a fixture clash with hosts Birmingham City.</p>
      <p>The Sky Blues have been drawn at ‘home’ for the the next round which clashes with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> ’ scheduled Championship match with Millwall at St Andrew’s.</p>
      <p>Mark Robins’s men have been drawn against fellow League One outfits in the form of either Ipswich Town or Lincoln City.</p>
      <p>Lincoln and Ipswich drew 1-1 in their tie at the weekend, with a replay scheduled for next week to decide who will face the Sky Blues at the end of the month.</p>

      <p>Ties will be played between Friday, November 29th and Monday, December 2nd, with the reward for a victory being a spot in the third round draw alongside clubs from the Championship and Premier League.</p>
      <p>That once again raises the intriguing prospect of Blues potentially being drawn away from home - and still playing at St Andrew’s.</p>
      <p>First the Sky Blues must find a way past either of their League One rivals and whoever they face, the tie is likely to be played on Sunday, December 1, 24 hours after Blues welcome Gary Rowett back to St Andrew’s.</p>
      <h3>How we signed him</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City were signing more than a mere winger when they brought Jeremie Bela to St Andrew’s.</p>
      <p>That’s the opinion of Pep Clotet who having effectively given up hope of capturing the 26-year-old in the summer, now sees a wealth of tactical options opening up with the Frenchman’s arrival.</p>
      <p>Blues’ caretaker head coach gave Bela his debut on Saturday against Fulham, just a few days after the attacker arrived at the club.</p>
      <p>Bela started on the left wing before moving when Jefferson Montero was introduced.</p>
      <p>However, Clotet claims his new recruit doesn’t simply give Blues another option in a 4-4-2, it opens the horizons, potentially a 4-3-3.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“We wanted to get him in the summer, the player was sorting his situation with the other club, a few things that were not football related that I didn’t get involved with,” Clotet said.</p>
      <p>“I thought ‘Well, we just need to forget and do something else’, I was very pleased when we were able to invite him to train with us, to assess him and have a good look at his fitness levels, which were very good.</p>
      <p>“That makes me happy because I think he is a player who can help us, he adds options to us, the fact we are using two forwards to attack and we can turn that into three forwards to attack.</p>
      <p>“That’s a massive thing tactically for us, it opens a massive range of tactical opportunities that I really like."</p>

      <h3>Welcome back</h3>
      <p>Jefferson Montero reminded Birmingham City fans what they had been missing with a thrilling cameo at the end of Saturday’s loss to Fulham.</p>
      <p>The on-loan winger ended a spell of more than two months on the sidelines to make just his third appearance since his summer move from Swansea.</p>
      <p>For the second time this season he came on in the closing stages and terrorised the visitors’ defence, setting up a chance for Lukas Jutkiewicz and sending over a series of crosses from the bye-line that suggested a way back for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> .</p>
      <p>The equaliser didn’t come but Montero was still pleased to be back in contention having been carried off with a thigh injury at the end of August.</p>
      <p>On his official Twitter account he posted a 40-second video of him pulling at the Fulham defence with the message ‘Glad to come back’.</p>
      <p>The supporters who reacted shared that sentiment.</p>
      <h3>Cheikh out</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City rejected two approaches for midfield misfit Cheikh Ndoye, according to reports in France.</p>
      <p>Ndoye spent the tumultuous 2017/2018 campaign at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> , one of 13 new faces brought to the club during Harry Redknapp’s short tenure.</p>
      <p>However, despite arriving with a good goalscoring record as captain of Angers the Senegal international didn’t adapt to English football, in a season in which Blues were managed by Redknapp, Steve Cotterill and Garry Monk.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That much was obvious fairly quickly yet in an interview with <a href="https://rmcsport.bfmtv.com/football/le-vestiaire/">Le Vestiaire on RMC Sport</a> , translated by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/midfielder-recalls-time-birmingham-city-move-st-andrews-originally-wasnt-choice/">Sport Witness</a> , it is claimed that in December 2017 Blues knocked back attempts to sign him by both his former club and Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>He also revealed he was dropped by Cotterill because of his poor English.</p>
      <p>Ndoye is quoted as saying: “I stayed one season in the Championship, but even in December, Angers wanted to bring me back. The problem is, in England, when it goes bad, things go quickly. Redknapp made me come, and after seven games he was gone."</p>

      <h3>Ratings so far</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City’s season is already a third over, sixteen games have gone, 30 remain and the team sits mid-table in the Championship.</p>
      <p>With virtually as many victories, seven, as losses - eight, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet</a>’s adventurous team seems to be both living and dying by the sword of their footballing ambition.</p>
      <p>The caretaker head coach is building a team that doesn’t deal in draws, it’s all out for the three points.</p>
      <p>Some of his players have thrived in that environment, others have found it harder, but with the international break upon us Blues writer Brian Dick rates them for their bodies of work so far.</p>
      <p>We’ve focused on the players who have appeared in at least half the games.</p>

      <h4>Lee Camp 5.5</h4>
      <p>The season is three months old, so it’s important not to merely reflect recent slips.</p>
      <p>Without being spectacular Camp was solid enough throughout the first half of the campaign, with particularly important saves against Bristol City and Charlton.</p>
      <p>However, errors against Derby, Wigan and most recently Fulham are set against good stops in the wins over Blackburn and Luton and reignited the debate about <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> ’ best goalkeeper.</p>
