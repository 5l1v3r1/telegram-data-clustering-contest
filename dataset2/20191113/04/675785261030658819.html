      <p>A mum has shared the devastating moment she found her daughter dying hours after she went to bed complaining of a headache.</p>
      <p>Tributes have been paid to Jessica Cain, from Gateshead, after her tragic death from meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia last month.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old's mum Shelia Rowell has told how her daughter complained of feeling groggy and took two paracetamol before going to sleep.</p>
      <p>However, the 49-year-old told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/a-true-angel-north-moving-17236089">Chronicle Live</a> when she went to speak to her the following morning she found her unresponsive.</p>

      <p>She added: "She said she had a bit of a headache and felt a bit groggy. She took a couple of paracetamol and water and went to bed.</p>
      <p>"The next morning, I went to speak to her but I couldn't wake her up."</p>
      <p>She phoned for an ambulance and attempted CPR as she received instructions over the phone. Paramedics then arrived, however they could not revive Jessica.</p>
      <p>"Everyone is still in shock," said Sheila. "It hit everybody hard. It happened so quickly and was so sudden."</p>
      <p>Jessica, who was born and brought up in Gateshead, was aiming to pursue a career in art therapy and began studying at the University of Derby.</p>

      <p>She spent her last week travelling to Manchester, Derby, Birmingham and Sheffield with her friends before returning to the North East.</p>
      <p>Her mum said: "She was stunning and was always happy and smiley. She is smiling in every picture I have of her."</p>
      <p>Other touching tributes said the 21-year-old lit up the room with her smile and was adored by her family and friends.</p>
      <p>She was also described as "a gorgeous girl both inside and out" and a "true Angel of the North".</p>
      <p>Sheila now wants to raise awareness of potentially fatal illnesses, such as meningococcal <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/meningitis-symptoms-signs-menb-vaccine-7394355">meningitis</a> and septicaemia, and is urging people to get help as early as possible if they spot any signs of them.</p>
      <p>According to the charity Meningitis Now, early symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia can include fever, headache, vomiting, muscle pain and fever with cold hands and feet.</p>
      <p>Patients can get a lot worse very quickly and people are urged to "trust your instincts" and get medical help immediately.</p>
