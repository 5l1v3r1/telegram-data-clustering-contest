      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Alfredo Morelos has been heavily linked with the Villa Park side as the claret and blue return to Premier League action in a fortnight's time</h2>

      <h4>Chelsea star makes Wesley admission</h4>
      <p>Chelsea star Willian has revealed he has been following Wesley's early Premier League performances ahead of his maiden Brazil call up.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> striker was a surprise name in Brazil's latest squad for the friendly fixtures against Argentina and North Korea.</p>
      <p>Since arriving on B6 for a club-record £22m fee, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wesley-moraes">Wesley</a> has netted four times in 12 top flight performances, but still has his fair share of claret and blue doubters.</p>
      <p>A number of fans continue to call for Dean Smith to look at other options to lead the line, including splashing the cash in the January window.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Newcastle handed major boost for Villa clash</h4>
      <p>Whilst Villa are in the midst of a major injury crisis, their next opponents Newcastle United may be about to receive a huge fitness boost.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> ’s side have a number of doubts for the visit of the Magpies after a series of injuries derailed their latest Premier League game.</p>
      <p>Villa were without three key men for their journey to Wolverhampton Wanderers, with Tom Heaton (calf) , Jack Grealish (calf) and Bjorn Engels (hip) all ruled out before kick off.</p>
      <p>Those issues were compounded in the first 45 minutes of action at Molineux, when Jed Steer was stretchered off and Matt Targett hobbled off.</p>

      <h4>Villa target speaks out amid rumours</h4>
      <p>Villa transfer target Alfredo Morelos says he is eyeing a regular place in Colombia's first-team setup.</p>
      <p>The Rangers hot-shot has been heavily linked with Smith's side, who could be in the market for a striker in January to help out struggling Wesley.</p>
      <p>Morelos <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/i-told-him-rangers-striker-17234360">hasn't been shy about expressing his desire for a move away from the Ibrox side</a> , for whom he netted his 22nd goal of the season at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Colombian international scored his ninth Scottish Premiership goal in 12 games in Sunday's 2-0 win at Livingston - he also has 11 goals in the Europa League for Steven Gerrard's side.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>Villa flop's message to Newcastle fans</h4>
      <p>"Ease off Steve Bruce."</p>
      <p>That's the message to Newcastle fans from former Villa defender <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/micah-richards">Micah Richards</a> .</p>
      <p>Bruce makes his first return to B6 since his sacking in 2018, when the two teams meet at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>It will be Bruce's first appearance back at Villa Park, since the infamous 'cabbage-gate' that marred his final game in the claret and blue dugout.</p>
