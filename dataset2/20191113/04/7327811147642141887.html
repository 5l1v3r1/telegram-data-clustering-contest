      <p>FLATBUSH, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police are trying to track down two men who beat and robbed a food delivery man in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The NYPD released video of the incident Nov. 5 on Dorchester Road in Flatbush.</p>
      <p>Two men approached the 60-year-old victim as he delivered food at the location.</p>

      <p>The delivery man, who has two children, works for Double Dragon Chinese restaurant just a few blocks away.</p>
      <p>He suffered bruising and lacerations to his face, and remains hospitalized.</p>
      <p>The NYPD issued the following descriptions of the suspects:</p>
      <p>The first individual is a male, black; last seen wearing a black hooded sweater with the word "puma" on the front, black sweatpants, and white sneakers.<br/>The second individual is a male, black; last seeing wearing a blue hooded sweater, gray sweatpants, and blue sneakers.</p>
