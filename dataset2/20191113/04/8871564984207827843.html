      <p><b>Date: </b>Nov. 14, Thursday – Dec. 5, Thursday<br/><b>Venue: </b>Archivo 1984, La Fuerza Compound, Chino Roces Ave., Makati City</p>
      <p>“Ang Baliw na Baliw na Daigdig ni Danny Zialcita” (“The Really Crazy World of Danny Zialcita”) opens this Thursday at Makati City’s Archivo 1984 Gallery. The exhibition will feature rare photographs, posters, and an unveiling of the late director’s previously lost film <i>Incognito.</i></p>
      <p>Zialcita dominated Philippine cinemas in the late ’70s and ’80s with dramatic films focusing on relationships. The late director is behind the crazy domestic drama <i>Bakit Manipis Ang Ulap?</i> (“Why Are Clouds Thin?”), the sexual comedy <i>Mga Daga sa Labas ng Lungga</i> (“Mice Outside the Mice Hole”), and the TV drama “Gaano Kadalas Ang Minsan?” (“How Frequent is Sometimes?”).</p>
      <p>Zialcita was also an art collector, which is why the exhibit will also show some of his paintings, as well as rare movie posters, plus a sound installation piece by contemporary visual artist Ian Jaucian.</p>
      <p>The exhibit will run for three weeks, and admission is free. For details visit Archivo 1984’s Facebook<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ARCHIVO1984/"> page</a>.</p>

The second Saturday’s program will focus on the actual script writing and fleshing out stories, as well as applying genre templates. The third and final Saturday will focus on revising stories, using dialogue, editing, and finishing the script.</p>
      <p>The fee is PHP1,000 (US$20), which can be paid at the Ticket2ME <a href="https://ticket2me.net/e/4074/Screenwriting?fbclid=IwAR34ZmKexLmTRHBEWl2XOIIyDJbC279hF05Cs_4a3F22uRELUtq6T2Qw-_o">website.</a> Visit the UP Film Institute <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UPFIOfficialPage/photos/a.1880237475340197/2858378860859382/?type=3&amp;theater">page</a> for more details.</p>

      <p><b>Date: </b>Nov. 16, Saturday to Nov. 30, Saturday<br/><b>Venue: </b>Black Box Theater, FA Annex, Ateneo de Manila University, Katipunan Ave., Quezon City</p>
      <p><i>Antigone vs. the People of the Philippines</i> is theater group Tanghalang Ateneo’s take on the Greek playwright Sophocle’s famous tragedy <i>Antigone,</i> whose titular female lead buries her brother alive when he becomes an enemy of the state. This new adaptation attempts to get to know Antigone further by transposing the tragedy to the modern-day Philippines, where the nation’s traitors <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/no-rest-no-peace-street-protests-wake-marcos-burial-libingan-ng-mga-bayani/">are given honorable burials</a>, the innocent murdered, and <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/former-marcos-defense-minister-says-ph-peaceful-filipinos-free-martial-law/">history is revised.</a></p>
      <p>The work poses questions like, “Where will one woman place herself amidst discussions of justice and human rights?”, and “What can you give up in order to fight for justice, humanity, and the greater good?” Directed by Tara Jamora Oppen and adapted to the stage by Sabrina Basilio, the show will run for two weeks in Quezon City’s Ateneo de Manila University.</p>
      <p>Tickets are PHP350 (US$7) for Ateneo students, and PHP400 (US$8) for the general public. For tickets, visit Tanghalang Ateneo’s Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tanghalangateneo/photos/a.356557647782598/2449544271817248/?type=3&amp;eid=ARCsedYi8hBCg5rFxKThx4S2pyOorfAqZ9kmIM2Vk0O1jZSxz-yNn3_08m4qwrwcwVGhv-swe3Tucv3Y&amp;__tn__=EEHH-R">page.</a></p>
