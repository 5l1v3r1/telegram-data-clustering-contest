      <p>University students could be among scorers for open-ended questions in tests to be conducted under a new unified university entrance examination system starting in fiscal 2020, the private contractor tasked with the scoring work has said.</p>
      <p>The Center for Research on Learning and Educational Assessments also said Tuesday that at least three scorers will be assigned for each open-ended question, to be introduced for the subjects of Japanese and mathematics.</p>
      <p>Applicants for the scoring job “must have received a degree from or be enrolled in undergraduate or graduate programs” at universities, said the unit of major Japanese educational service firm Benesse Holdings Inc.</p>
      <p>The Benesse unit disclosed the details of its scoring system as part of its efforts to assuage concerns among potential test-takers as to whether quality and fairness in scoring will be secured, especially because part-timers are expected to be included in the some 10,000 scorers.</p>
      <p>Those who pass academic and aptitude tests, as well as interviews, will be registered as scorers and undergo multiple training sessions. On every day of the test-scoring period, they will take an additional test, and only those who pass the daily tests will be allowed to give scores on each day.</p>
      <p>At least three people will be tasked to score responses to each question on the examination test. If the first two people give the same points to a response, a third person will check the appropriateness of the score. If the first two give different scores, a scorer of a higher rank will score the response.</p>
      <p>The scoring work will be conducted at a special venue, and scorers will be required to leave their mobile phones and other items in a locker during work.</p>
      <p>Under the unified university entrance examination system, responses from some 500,000 test-takers must be scored within 20 days.</p>
      <p>“In the annual open-ended-question-style academic test for high school students conducted by the Benesse group, we return some 4.57 million sheets of test responses from some 1.3 million test-takers in around 20 days after scoring the responses,” the company said, highlighting its sufficient track record in scoring work.</p>
