      <p>Jonah Hauer-King has reportedly been cast as Prince Eric in the upcoming live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.</p>
      <p>He is set to star opposite US singer Halle Bailey – who will play Ariel – in Disney’s latest reimagining of one of its classic films.</p>
      <p>Harry Styles had been among the high-profile names linked with the highly coveted role of Eric, but it appears to be the largely unknown Hauer-King who has got the part.</p>

      <p>Here’s what you need to know about the 24-year-old:</p>
      <p>
        <b>He has dual nationality</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hauer-King’s mother is an American theatre producer while his father is a British restaurateur.</p>
      <p>It appears the actor is proud of his heritage as his Instagram bio consists of a US flag and the national flag of the UK.</p>

      <p>An early career role for Hauer-King was the lead part in psychological drama play Equus, while he was studying at Cambridge University.</p>
      <p>He played Alan Strang, a boy accused of blinding six horses. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe portrayed the character in a 2007 revival of the play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>He was named a rising star in 2016</b>
      </p>
      <p>The London Evening Standard named Hauer-King among London’s most influential young people in 2016, alongside ballet dancer Francesca Hayward, who will soon star in Cats.</p>
      <p>The newspaper listed Hauer-King as being educated at Eton and “born and bred” in London.</p>
      <p>
        <b>He has starred in Little Women</b>

      <p>Hauer-King played the character of Theodore “Laurie” Laurence in the BBC’s critically acclaimed 2017 adaption of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel.</p>
      <p>The three-part series also starred Emily Watson and Maya Hawke. The latest Hollywood adaption of Little Women features Timothee Chalamet as Laurie.</p>
      <p>Hauer-King’s other TV roles include World War Two drama World On Fire and a minor part in an adaption of Howards End.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Little Mermaid is not his first foray into film</b>
      </p>
      <p>While he was largely unknown before being linked to the role of Prince Eric, Hauer-King already has several films under his belt.</p>
      <p>They include family adventure film A Dog’s Way Home, which was released earlier this year and also featured A-listers Bryce Dallas Howard and Ashley Judd.</p>
