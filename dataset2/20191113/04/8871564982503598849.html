      <p>A suspected suicide bombing outside a police station in Indonesia has left at least one attacker dead, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The explosion happened around 8:45 am local time (01:45 GMT) at a police compound in Medan on Sumatra island.</p>
      <p>“We suspect this is a suicide bombing with one attacker killed,” national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>An <i>AFP</i> reporter at the scene saw a body lying on the ground outside the station.</p>
      <p>A police source who did not want to be named told <i>AFP</i> that the attack was perpetrated by at least two suicide bombers, but that was not officially confirmed.</p>
      <p>Unconfirmed local media reports said at least one police officer had been rushed to hospital after the bombing but that their condition was not immediately known.</p>
      <p>Police stations have been frequent targets for radicals in the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation, which has long struggled with Islamist militancy.</p>
