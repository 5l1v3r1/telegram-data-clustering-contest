      <p>A memo about the workout went out to all 32 teams <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/sports/colin-kaepernick-to-hold-private-workout-at-falcons-facility/1007888054">Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, who guided the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season, has not played in the NFL since opting out of his contract March 3, 2017.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick started a leaguewide movement to kneel during  the playing of the national anthem to protest social and racial injustices and police brutality.   </p>
      <p>All 32 teams have been invited to the private workout, which will include an interview, measurements and quarterback drills. The workout will be <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/sports/colin-kaepernick-to-hold-private-workout-at-falcons-facility/1007888054">recorded</a> and provided to all league teams.</p>
      <p>It's not known how many teams will attend the workout, which will be closed to the public and the media.</p>
      <p>The Falcons, who play in North Carolina on Sunday, did not immediately respond for comment on the workout. </p>
      <p>Kaepernick filed a grievance through the NFL Players Association against the NFL on Oct. 16, 2017.</p>
      <p>The grievance filed by Kaepernick and Panthers' safety Eric Reid against the NFL was <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/sports/colin-kaepernick-to-hold-private-workout-at-falcons-facility/1007888054">settled</a> in February. Terms of the settlement were not released.</p>
