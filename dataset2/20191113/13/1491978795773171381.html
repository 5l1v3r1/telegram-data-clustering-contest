      <h1>HSBC to let customers block spending on gambling websites</h1>

        <i>Bank says 24-hour cooling-off period will give problem gamblers time to reconsider</i>
      </p>
      <p>HSBC will allow customers to prevent themselves from spending money with bookmakers and online casinos, as it becomes the latest bank to introduce measures intended to help <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/gambling">problem gamblers</a>.</p>
      <p>Europe’s largest bank will offer its 14.5 million UK customers the option to self-exclude from all gambling transactions, a restriction that can only be reversed after a 24-hour cooling-off period.</p>
      <p>It said the scheme, designed in partnership with the GamCare and GambleAware charities, would create “positive friction” by giving customers time to consider their urge to gamble.</p>
      <p>The bank said the move was a response to concerns expressed by its customers about the impact that betting is having on their finances.</p>
      <p>More than half a million of its customers placed bets every month in 2018, spending an average of £52.50, while it receives more than 12,000 calls from customers about gambling per year.</p>
      <p>It has trained staff to respond to these calls with the help of GamCare and will also analyse data on card spending to see who might benefit from advice.</p>
      <p>HSBC’s move to help people who are trying to rein in their gambling is part of a growing trend in the financial sector to arm customers with technological tools to do so.</p>
      <p>Dr Heather Wardle, an assistant professor and gambling behaviour researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: “The financial sector is a key enabler of the gambling industry – without them online gambling couldn’t exist.</p>
      <p>“So it’s right that banks and other financial institutions take the protection of people from gambling harms seriously.”</p>
      <p>High-street lender NatWest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/30/natwest-to-offer-help-to-gambling-addicts-in-high-street-branches">said last month</a> that it would offer counselling sessions for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/11/people-dying-campaign-gambling-public-health-concern">gambling addicts</a> inside branches as part of a groundbreaking pilot scheme that could be rolled out across the country.</p>
      <p>Lenders such as Monzo, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/11/barclays-mobile-banking-gambling-drinking-app">Barclays</a> and Starling also allow customers to block gambling transactions on their bank accounts or credit cards, but HSBC is the largest bank to introduce such measures.</p>
      <p>“We are committed to helping customers manage their finances and that includes introducing new tools that can help control spending,” said Maxine Pritchard, HSBC’s head of financial inclusion and vulnerability.</p>
      <p>“With the bank receiving 12,000 calls a year relating to gambling, it’s clear we should do more to support these customers.</p>
      <p>An influential cross-party group of MPs recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/03/call-for-radical-overhaul-of-online-casinos-after-far-reaching-inquiry">called for much stricter regulation</a> of online gambling, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/ban-credit-cards-for-online-gambling-says-government-review">ban on betting with credit cards</a>.</p>
      <p>Online payments firm <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/paypal">PayPal</a> promised to tighten up its controls earlier this year after the Guardian revealed that it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/17/paypal-problem-gamblers-misuse-avoid-bank-limits">letting problem gamblers spend up to £150,000</a> a day on credit.</p>
