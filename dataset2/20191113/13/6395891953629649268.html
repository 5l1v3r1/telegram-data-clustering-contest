      <p><b>ANKARA, TurkeyÂ (AP)</b> - Turkey's state-run news agency says the body of a former British officer who helped found the White Helmets volunteer group in Syria, has been transferred to Istanbul's main airport to be flown to London, following an autopsy.</p>
      <p>Anadolu Agency said James Le Mesurier's body would be flown aboard a Turkish Airlines flight later on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Le Mesurier was found dead outside his home in Istanbul on Nov. 11. Police believe he fell to his death and are investigating the circumstances.</p>
      <p>Turkey's Forensic Medicine Institute said toxicology and other examinations were continuing, adding that a report into his death would be sent to prosecutors "as soon as possible."</p>
      <p>Last week a top Russian official had alleged Le Mesurier was a spy - a claim Britain strongly denies.</p>
