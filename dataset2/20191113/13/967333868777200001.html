      <p>​The singer has told the magazine he was thrilled to receive such a title.</p>
      <blockquote>"I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it’s a lot of pressure', he told <i>People magazine</i>. "Everyone’s going to be picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title. I’m [also] following Idris Elba, which is not fair and is not nice to me!" </blockquote>
