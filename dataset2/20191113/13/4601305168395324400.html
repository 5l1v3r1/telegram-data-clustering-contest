      <p>As much as some of us fear the loss of our jobs to robots, there's one job we're pretty sure they are welcome to: vacuuming. There's nothing quite like kicking back and watching a robot vacuum do one of the most time-consuming tasks on the household chore list.</p>
      <p>And there are few 'bots that do it quite like the <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/roborock-s6-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-adaptive-routing-black?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=roborock-s6-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-adaptive-routing-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-346634&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrk1&amp;scsonar=1">Roborock S6 Robot Vacuum &amp; Mop</a>.</p>
      <p>The power on this thing is a big highlight, combining 1500 rpm of suction with soft bristles that spin at 1350 rpm. It's a combo that makes short work of nearly any mess, and there's even a mopping function that gives hardwood floors an extra shine.</p>
      <p>With a 32-bit quad processor, the Roborock S6 has brains as well as brawn. Its 14-sensor array helps it build a complete 360-degree view of your room, then plan the quickest route to get every inch. Want it to avoid the dog dish? It's a simple matter to draw virtual barriers in the accompanying app - no magnetic strips required.</p>
