      <p>Wendy Williams had a few things to say about <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/539873/john-legend-is-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-for-2019/">John Legend nabbing <i>People</i>‘s “Sexiest Man Alive” honour</a> during her show Wednesday.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://toofab.com/2019/11/13/wendy-williams-jason-momoa-sexiest-man-alive-john-legend/">toofab</a></i>, Williams insisted she liked Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen as a couple but not separately.</p>
      <p>She told viewers, “Like, they’re short and they’re thin. I love them together, but not apart.”</p>
      <p>Williams added, “You know who I like and he’s not even the ‘Sexiest Man Alive’. I normally don’t like facial hair, but in new life, I’m meeting a lot of new men. If I could think of one person it would be Jason Momoa. Anyway, but congratulations, John.”</p>

      <p>But that wasn’t all she had to say about Legend nabbing the title.</p>
      <p>“When I think about a sexy man, I’m not thinking John Legend. The first thing I think of is that I weigh so much more than him. If we were walking down the street and somebody wanted to spray me with a water gun, I need a man that’s going to punch someone in the face. You know what I mean?</p>
      <p>“If I’m not quite feeling right after leaving the club, I need a man to throw me over his shoulder and say, ‘Come on girl.’ John is not that guy. But congratulations, Jonathan.”</p>
