      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Danny_Rose">Danny Rose</a> has vowed to walk away from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> for nothing rather than leave in January.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was made available for sale this summer and was left out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia with suggestions of offers from a number of Premier League clubs.</p>
      <p>The England international has since forced his way back into Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans this season but speculation over his future continues.</p>
      <p>Rose insists he has a good relationship with his manager and fully intends to see out the remaining 18 months of his contract.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty obvious what happened [in the summer]. People upstairs at Tottenham were trying to do what they were trying to do. I've said [to them] I've got 18 months left on my contract and I'm not going anywhere until my contract has ­finished," he told the <i><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/danny-rose-tottenham-want-me-gone-but-i-will-leave-contract-expires-2021-a4285931.html">Evening Standard.</a></i></p>
      <p>"In January, you're probably going to hear something [about my future]. I'm telling you right now that I'm not going anywhere until my contract is finished.</p>
      <p>"[Tottenham chairman] Daniel Levy told me in the summer there was no new contract for me at Tottenham, which is fine. I respect that. We move on.</p>
      <p>"My contract is up in 18 months' time and I'll leave the football club then. People [in the media] can save their time ­trying to get stuff ready for January about me being sold.</p>
      <p>"Because I can tell you now: it ain't happening. I know what people were trying to do in the summer... There were no bids — that was rubbish."</p>
