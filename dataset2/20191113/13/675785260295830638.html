      <h2>Raheem Sterling trained on Wednesday despite being punished as a disciplinary measure following an altercation with teammate Joe Gomez - who was also present</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:31:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Fresh pictures from England's training session on Wednesday have shown the full extent of Joe Gomez's facial injury following his high-profile bust-up with teammate Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Having clashed towards the end of Liverpool's 3-1 win against fellow Premier League title challengers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday, a still simmering Sterling was involved in a fracas with Gomez at St George's Park the following day.</p>
      <p>The incident took onlookers aback and the 24-year-old Sterling admitted "emotions got the better of me" in a late night social media post that followed the Football Association confirming the forward would sit out the Montenegro qualifier.</p>
      <p>Sterling stayed with the group and apologised to team-mates at a meeting on Monday night, then trained as usual the following morning. Gomez sported a cut close to his right eye in the session.</p>

      <p>And on Wednesday, the pair took to the training field again where they were seen in high spirits alongside each other.</p>
      <p>Gomez's facial injury was once again evident, while he also appears to have suffered a cut on his neck too.</p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate would not divulge any details during his press conference on Tuesday, but it appears the scratch was caused by jewellery Sterling was wearing, according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10333935/england-sterling-gomez-what-happened-fight/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573598141">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>The two players reportedly had to be pulled apart by team-mates, sending food flying from tables.</p>

      <p>Southgate has defended his decision to sideline Sterling against Montenegro after likening the England forward's high-profile bust-up with Gomez to a family row.</p>
      <p>"Raheem in his post last night explained for a very brief moment his emotions ran over," he said. "It would be correct to say that's not the same for Joe.</p>
      <p>"We are dealing with a very young squad in a sport where emotions often run high. These things happen in football. My priority is always the care and wellbeing of all my players. All my players.</p>
      <p>"Then you have a decision to make as to whether there needs to be something further, which is my reasoning for not selecting Raheem for the game on Thursday."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Southgate said the whole squad is now interacting as normal and the punishment would be the "end of the matter"', while the England boss took a conciliatory tone when asked if he was disappointed in the forward's conduct.</p>
      <p>"I love all of my players," he said. "We are like a family and all family have disagreements.</p>
      <p>"Most important for any family is to come through those disagreements and work through them. I don't expect as a manager to never have to deal with things that are unexpected or difficult.</p>

      <p>"It's part and parcel of the job and part and parcel of working with elite players. Our focus now is to move forward.</p>
      <p>"The reality is I'm not prepared to go into details. There is enough conjecture and opinion and talk out there and we don't need to add to it.</p>
      <p>"As a group we've decided the best way forward and we're in agreement on that. We move on from there."</p>
