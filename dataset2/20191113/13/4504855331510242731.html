      <p>The first floor has a traditional bar that serves classic espresso beverages like cappuccinos, lattes and cortados.</p>
      <p>Over on the third floor, things start getting more complex.</p>
      <p>The Experiential Coffee Bar gives customers an immersive dive into the “art, science and theatre” of coffee.</p>
      <p>The fourth floor has the Barrel-Aged Coffee Bar.</p>
      <p>It serves coffee beverages whose beans have been aged in barrels.</p>
      <p>This is where customers get try out cocktail-inspired coffees.</p>
      <p>There’s also sweet treats at the massive store.</p>
      <p>The first on-demand liquid nitrogen gelato at a Starbucks location in the US will also be served.</p>
      <p>Merchandise and artwork from local artists are going to be scattered throughout the building.</p>
      <p>“The design of the Chicago Roastery was inspired by the iconic Chicago landmark, and the city itself,” said Jill Enomoto, vice president of Roastery Design &amp; Concept at Starbucks.</p>
      <p>Although it’s the biggest in the world, this isn’t the chain’s first Roastery.</p>
      <p>Other locations are in Seattle, Shanghai, Mila, New York and Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The Chicago location employs almost 200 people, including roasters, baristas, commessas, bakers and mixologists, the company said.</p>
