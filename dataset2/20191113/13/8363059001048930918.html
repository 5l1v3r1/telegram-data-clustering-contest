      <h1>Smyths Toys Has Kicked Off its Black Friday Deals Already</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:20:23+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Black Friday is the 29th of November, but as is increasingly becoming the case there's no logical reason for retailers to save all their deals for that day (or the days running up to it). The common theme we've already started to see this year is "why wait", and it's a philosophy being adopted by the people at Smyth's Toys as well. The toy retailer's Black Friday deals <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/special-offers/c/SM060110?q=%3AukBestsellerRating">have already arrived.</a> There aren't all that many, but there are enough to be browsing through.</p>
      <p>Being a toy shop means all the deals are either on toys,baby stuff, or other things that are exclusively designed for children. In other words, like Argos's 'Crazy Code' deals, these are mostly designed to get your Christmas shopping in now instead of waiting for Black Friday to roll around. Or, to get you to spend now, and then spend even more when he hit Black Friday proper.</p>
      <p>So what's on offer? Four Lego deals are available, because that's the first thing we checked, including  <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/lego-and-bricks/lego-city/lego-60198-city-cargo-train-rc-and-tracks-building-set/p/166898">the RC Cargo Train for £115.49</a> (down from £180), <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/lego-and-bricks/lego-city/lego-60228-city-deep-space-rocket-and-launch-control-set/p/175257">the Rocket and Launch Control for £60</a> (down from £90), and<a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/lego-exclusives-and-hard-to-find/lego-10220-creator-expert-volkswagen-t1-camper-van-construction-toy/p/166501"> the Creator VW van for £68</a> (down from £85). There's also <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/lego-and-bricks/lego-classic/lego-10698-classic-large-creative-brick-box-toy/p/141295">a big box of bricks</a>, which is £10 off the usual price.</p>
      <p>Other brands only seem to have one or two deals a piece, which suggests there are bound to be a lot more to come over the next few weeks. <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/special-offers/c/SM060110?q=%3AukBestsellerRating">The usual suspects are there </a>too, including NERF, Barbie, Hot Wheels, various Disney toys, and even Peppa Pig.</p>
      <p>Since these are Black Friday deals they'll probably be sticking around for a while, though they will be dependant on the discounted toys remaining in stock. It's usually the case that once they're gone they're gone. But the good news is that it's all available in-store or online, depending on how you prefer to shop.</p>
