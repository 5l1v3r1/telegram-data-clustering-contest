      <p>Apple shared the official word in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-introduces-16-inch-macbook-pro-the-worlds-best-pro-notebook/">Newsroom post today</a> for the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>.
