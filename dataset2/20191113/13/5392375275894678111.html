      <p>Samsung is working on a new entry-level smartphone with model number SM-A105F whose name, according to rumors, should be the Galaxy A01.</p>
      <p>To provide us with the first information in this regard is the FCC, the US institution has published the relevant certification anticipating the presence of a 3,000 mAh battery and a rear photographic compartment that includes two cameras and an LED flash.
