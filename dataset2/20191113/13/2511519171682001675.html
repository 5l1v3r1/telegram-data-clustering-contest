      <p>If you thought <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/avengers?CMP=ILC-refresh"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> was emotional enough, you clearly haven’t seen the deleted scene that was left on the cutting room floor.</p>
      <p>As part of new streaming service Disney+, Marvel fans are being treated to the  previously unseen clip, which was been stitched into the digital version of the film. It depicts Tony Stark (<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/robert-downey-jr">Robert Downey Jr</a>) – who is about to die in the final battle – in a version of the afterlife, speaking with his grown up daughter (<i>13 Reasons Why</i> star Katherine Langford).</p>
      <p>The scene is called “Tony at the Way Station” – but why was it cut? Directors Anthony and Joe Russo explain in the commentary they were concerned such an emotional moment would “ground the movie to a halt”.</p>
      <p>The Russos added: ”He does something similar in the next sequence when he gives his own eulogy. The hope was not to ‘dilute the value’ of any powerful moment."</p>
      <p>In the scene, Tony admits to his daughter that putting on the Infinity Gauntlet ”might have” been “a bad decision”, saying: ”I’m scared I made a mistake."</p>
      <p>His daughter responds: ”I know. And I know it’s going to be tough for you to let go, but if someone had to do that so the rest of us could [live]... I’m proud of you... I love you 3,000.”</p>
      <p><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/avengers-endgame-avatar-box-office-record-marvel-mcu-russo-brothers-comic-con-a9014191.html">highest-grossing film of all time</a>. A new theory doing the rounds suggests that the future TV show based on Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston, will <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/marvel-mcu-theory-loki-tv-show-disney-plus-kevin-feige-kang-fantastic-four-a9200901.html">affect Phase Four of the MCU</a> in a pretty huge way.</p>
