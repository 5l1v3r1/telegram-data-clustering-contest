      <p>Nike is ending a sales partnership with Amazon less than a month after the athletic gear company named an e-commerce veteran as its new chief executive.</p>
      <p>The company says it wants to create a more direct customer experience, but the announcement Wednesday is a setback for Amazon.</p>
      <p>Amazon is under pressure from big-name brands to cut back on fake goods from third-party sellers. Nike announced the pilot program with Amazon in 2017, hoping that it would have more control over the brand if it were more closely involved.</p>
      <p>Industry analysts who have monitored the partnership say it appears that those problems have continued.</p>
      <p>Amazon has acknowledged problematic sales of counterfeit goods on the site this year introduced new tools stop them.</p>
      <p>Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
