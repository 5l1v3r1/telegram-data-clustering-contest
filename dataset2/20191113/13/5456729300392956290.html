      <h1>Bayelsa Governorship Poll: APC heads to Appeal Court over disqualified deputy governorship candidate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:33:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/south-south-regional/362693-bayelsa-governorship-poll-apc-heads-to-appeal-court-over-disqualified-deputy-governorship-candidate.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) says it is heading to the Appeal Court to challenge the disqualification of its deputy governorship candidate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, from Saturday’s Bayelsa governorship poll.</p>
      <p>The Abuja Division of the Federal High Court, on Tuesday, disqualified Mr Degi-Eremienyo, for submitting false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
      <p>But Amos Jothan, the state APC Chairman, in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Wednesday in Yenagoa, described the court ruling as a miscarriage of justice.</p>
      <p>“We are totally surprised that the court could in spite of objections by our lawyers, go ahead to determine a weighty criminal allegation of falsification and fraud solely on the basis of affidavit evidence, contrary to well-established judicial precedents that such must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by calling oral evidence.</p>
      <p>“We strongly believe that the judgment cannot withstand superior judicial scrutiny.<br/>“Therefore, our lawyers have filed a notice of appeal and other court processes to arrest the execution of the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>
      <p>“We call on all our members and supporters not to be distracted but continue to peacefully mobilise for the November 16, election,” he said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had on September 18 approached the court seeking disqualification of the candidate over alleged falsification of information. (NAN)</p>
