      <p>Strictly Come Dancing star Alex Scott has said she feared Neil Jones would not like her after it was claimed she wanted to swap him for Kevin Clifton.</p>
      <p>Professional dancer Jones, 37, reunited with the former England football star, 35, after he missed two weeks of live shows because of an injury.</p>
      <p>During that time Clifton, who lifted the Glitterball Trophy with Stacey Dooley last year, stood in for Jones.</p>

      <p>Scott later denied reports she was “fuming” after finding out she would be back with Jones at the last minute.</p>
      <p>Scott and Jones, who are dancing to Beyonce’s Run The World (Girls) at Blackpool’s Tower Ballroom this weekend, appeared on This Morning with co-hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Schofield asked: “Were you disappointed? Was there any truth in that at all?”</p>
      <p>Scott said: “No and I think that’s why I woke up on Sunday morning actually a little bit gutted because I think, how you said Holly, I had started blossoming when we were together doing the Charleston.</p>
      <p>“So it wasn’t just Kev – I have found this confidence. And for me, we had done the amazing jive, which was so much fun, on Saturday night, and you wake up to those headlines.</p>

      <p>“My first reaction was, ‘Oh no, my partner is going to think I don’t even like him any more’.</p>
      <p>“We started this journey together. So then, straight away, that’s where social media can come in and play a positive part because I just put out a tweet saying it’s absolutely not true.</p>
      <p>“Because what everyone sees on TV is me having the time of my life. It’s not an act. I love dancing with Neil.”</p>

      <p>The pair performed a jive on Saturday night’s show, with Jones telling the judges: “It’s good to be back.”</p>
      <p>He said he and Clifton had agreed Scott’s new-found confidence had come from her alone.</p>
      <p>Jones said: “I know Alex so well and I know we get on well and I have known Kevin for over 25 years. We are really good friends.</p>
      <p>“And actually, between me and Kevin, we were joking because we said that her highest score is not me or Kevin, it is from her on her own.</p>
      <p>“That’s on her, not on us.”</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing continues on BBC One on Saturday.</p>
