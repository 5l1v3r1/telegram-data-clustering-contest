      <p><b>American Special Vehicles (ASV)</b> has issued a recall for <b>1197 units</b> across the <b>2015-18 model-year Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup truck lines</b>, over concerns the drag link could separate from the adjuster sleeve.</p>
      <p>The conversion specialist reports: "The drag link jam nut may loosen and may result in the drag link separating from the adjuster sleeve".</p>
      <p>"If the drag link separates from the adjuster sleeve, the steering may become difficult to operate or potentially fail, increasing the risk of an accident or injury to vehicle occupants and other road users."</p>
      <p>As reported above, there are <b>1197 trucks</b> affected by this recall, available for sale between <b>1 January 2015 and 31 December 2018</b> â€“ the VIN list is available <a href="https://www.productsafety.gov.au/system/files/VIN%20list_9.xls">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Owners of the recalled vehicles will be contacted via mail, and advised to arrange an appointment with their preferred Ram dealer to arrange the inspection and repair of their vehicle, free of charge.</p>
