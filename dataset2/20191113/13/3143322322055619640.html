      <p>The World Cup- winning Springbok team will be visiting Mpumalanga next year. This was confirmed by Andy Colquhoun, general manager: communications of SA Rugby, on Monday.</p>
      <p>During the past week the SA rugby players embarked on a tour around the country to show off the Webb Ellis Cup, visiting major cities around the country.</p>
      <p>Smaller provinces were excluded, which caused an outcry, especially in Mpumalanga which has produced five Boks in the squad, Duane Vermeulen and Faf de Klerk from Mbombela, S’busiso Nkosi from Barberton, Trevor Nyakane from Bushbuckridge and Kwagga Smith from Lydenburg.</p>

      <p>Provincial culture, sport and recreation MEC, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali noted with disappointment that Mpumalanga has been omitted from the Springbok Trophy Tour.</p>
      <p>“It is disappointing that thousands of rugby fans in the province have not been afforded a chance to celebrate with their local players,” she said in a statement issued over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“I have taken up the issue with the South African Rugby Union, the minister of sport and recreation, Nathi Mthethwa and President Cyril Ramaphosa during his visit to Mpumalanga on Friday to ensure that locals have a chance to rub shoulders with the Webb Ellis Cup and the players.”</p>

      <p>Colquhoun, however, could not confirm exactly when the team would visit, nor which players would accompany the trophy.</p>
      <p>“We cannot confirm when exactly next year the players will be going on the tour. We are still looking at their schedules,” he explained. Meanwhile the Springboks concluded their official tour in Cape Town yesterday.</p>
