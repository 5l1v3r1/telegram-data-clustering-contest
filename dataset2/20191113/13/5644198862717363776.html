      <p>England women's coach Phil Neville was pleased the side returned to winning ways with a 3-2 friendly victory over the Czech Republic on Tuesday but said the scoreline should have been far more comfortable.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: England women's coach Phil Neville was pleased the side returned to winning ways with a 3-2 friendly victory over the Czech Republic on Tuesday but said the scoreline should have been far more comfortable.</p>
      <p>Leah Williamson's deflected 86th-minute strike beat Barbora Votikova in the Czech goal to give England their second win since finishing fourth at the World Cup in July.</p>

      <p>Neville made five changes to the side that lost 2-1 to Germany at Wembley last weekend but lapses of concentration at the back showed they need to improve significantly in 2020.</p>
      <p>"We got the win I think that was what I demanded for the team," he told BBC.</p>
      <p>"We should be beating Czech Republic by more than 3-2. We dominated the second half but we were careless in possession and with the final ball or cross."</p>
