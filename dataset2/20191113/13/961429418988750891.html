      <p>Jon Rouse became the first chief officer of Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership in 2016. It was a <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/revealed-details-of-6bn-manchester-health-devolution-plan/5082727.article">unique post and arrangement, with national government then hailing it as a major plank of policy, and securing a deal for extra NHS transformation funding.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Rouse, previously a council chief executive and director general of social care at the Department of Health, will leave early in the new year to take up <a href="https://www.stoke.gov.uk/news/article/517/jon_rouse_announced_as_preferred_candidate_for_city_director">a new role as city director and head of paid service at Stoke-on-Trent City Council</a>, a role similar to chief executive.</p>
      <p>It comes as Greater Manchester seeks to negotiate for a new round of additional NHS transformation funding, and there are signs it is having difficulty securing this. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, changes in government and policy mean Greater Manchester is increasingly treated under NHS rules as only one of more than a dozen “integrated care systems”, rather than a unique project, although there are important differences in its governance to other ICS.</p>
      <p>There has also been reorganisation in the NHS, which means that, since April, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/north-west/watered-down-devo-manc-gets-regional-line-manager/7024901.article">Mr Rouse has been reporting to the NHS England and Improvement regional director for the north west</a>, rather than to the NHSE national chief finance officer, as was previously the case.</p>
      <p>The GM project has blazed a trail on health and social care integration, and has claimed a number of improvements in health related outcomes and services. But it has <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/north-west/aande-gets-worse-for-devo-manc/7025587.article">struggled to deal with</a> poor performance on the accident and emergency four-hour target.</p>
      <p>Greater Manchester partnership chair Lord Peter Smith said: “Jon… has worked tirelessly to help Greater Manchester deliver its shared health and social care vision.</p>
      <p>“Our collective achievements for our population over the last three years have been significant, from real gains in health — with the lowest ever rate of smoking and highest ever level of physical activity — to improvements in early cancer diagnosis and survival rates, school readiness, maternal safety, social care quality, primary care access and mental health services, among many others.”</p>
      <p>Mr Rouse said: “It has been a privilege to spend the last few years helping build our unique devolved model for improving population health. I am very proud of the progress made, the results achieved, and the strength of partnership established.</p>
      <p>“I have every confidence that the Partnership will go from strength to strength and will take much learning into my new role.”</p>
      <p>Mr Rouse <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/hsj100/hsj100-full-list-stevens-tops-table-for-fifth-year/7023990.article">was placed at number 28 in the 2018 <i>HSJ </i>100 list</a>.</p>
      <p>His Stoke appointment is subject to approval by a council meeting tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Steve Wilson, the GM partnership finance director, is leaving next month.</p>
