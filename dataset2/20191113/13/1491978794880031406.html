      <p>Spanish striker David Villa is to retire from football in January. The 37-year-old will finish his career at Vissel Kobe in Japan. The forward scored 59 goals in 98 appearances for Spain, five of them coming at the 2010 World Cup, where Spain were crowned champions for the first time. Villa made a name for himself at Valencia before moving to Barcelona and Atlético Madrid. His time at Barcelona saw him become a Champions League winner, under the leadership of Pep Guardiola, scoring the opening goal in a 3-1 victory over Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. After a season in Madrid, Villa headed to MLS,  scoring 80 in 124 appearances. After that he headed to Japan to pair up with former teammate Andrés Iniesta</p>
