      <p>Bordeaux - French cyclist <b>Raymond Poulidor</b>, who gained huge affection as an eternal runner-up in the Tour de France, has died at the age of 83, his wife told AFP on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Poulidor had been hospitalised since early October and "he left us this morning," his wife Gisele told AFP from their home in western France.</p>
      <p>His astonishing career spanned 25 years but he will always be remembered for the races he failed to win.</p>
      <p>From 1964 to 1976 Poulidor finished second in the Tour de France on three occasions and was third five times in an era dominated by Eddy Merckx.</p>
      <p>So famous was his repeated failure to clinch the Tour that the phrase "to do a Poulidor" passed into the French language, synonymous with coming an unlucky second.</p>
      <p>Despite his Tour de France disappointments, Poulidor is forever ranked among France's cycling greats and at the same time is seen as a humble hard worker loved by the people who earned every one of his many triumphs.</p>
      <p>His long-time rival Merckx told AFP "a great friend has left us".</p>
      <p>"I am very sad. During my career we were rivals but afterwards we often spent time together. We holidayed together. It's a big loss."</p>
      <p>Among current riders, Romain Bardet, second in the Tour de France in 2016 and third the following year, said: "He was an emblematic character, adored by the public."</p>
      <p>"He was the link between cycling and its origins among the people. I remember seeing him on the Tour de France but also at the local village races with the organisers. He represented the real face of cycling, a popular and accessible sport."</p>
      <p>Born on April 15, 1936 in a small village in western France, just a few miles from where he died, Poulidor clinched 189 wins during his career from 1960-1977. High points included wins in the Tour of Spain, the Dauphine Libere twice, and the Paris-Nice twice.</p>
      <p>For the remaining four decades of his life he retained his links with cycling through public relations and as a consultant.</p>
      <p>He remained an avid fan and in subsequent years he was frequently seen surrounded by admirers and signing autographs at the start of every Tour de France stage.</p>
      <p>Doing promotional work at the 2019 Tour took a lot out of him, according to wife Gisele.</p>
      <p>"He was very tired after the last Tour de France," she told AFP.</p>
