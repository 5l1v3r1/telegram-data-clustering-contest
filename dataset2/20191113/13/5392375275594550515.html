      <p>The Realme 5s that<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/12/realme-5s-appears-on-flipkart-launch-is-imminent/"> featured alongside the Realme X2 Pro on a Flipkart landing page is officially confirmed</a>. Indian etailer Flipkart now has a dedicated landing page for the device, and we can now confirm it will launch alongside the Realme X2 Pro on November 20th.</p>
      <p>The page has a render of the Realme 5s that seemingly confirms it shares the same design with the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/20/realme-kernel-sources-for-realme-5-5-pro-and-xt/">Realme 5</a> unveiled back in August. It has a rear fingerprint scanner, and a Quad camera setup, but with different camera specs. The teaser page says it will be dropping the 12MP main camera on the standard Realme 5 for an upgraded 48MP sensor.</p>
      <p>Other specs are currently still under the wrap, at least officially. However, a new <a href="https://www.bgr.in/news/realme-5s-full-specifications-leaked-ahead-of-india-launch-48mp-quad-camera-price-features-858543/">leak from India</a> suggests other camera details remain unchanged. And that means we would be seeing a Realme 5s with an 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensor modules.</p>

      <p>Up front, the Realme 5s will come fitted with a 13mp selfie camera seated within a water-drop notch. And speaking of the display, the leak has it that the device will come fitted with a 6.5-inch HD+ display with Gorilla Glass 3+ protective layer.  Other rumored specs include a <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/tag/snapdragon-665">Snapdragon 665, with a base model of 4</a>GB of RAM and 64 GB of native storage. It could also come with a 5,000mAh battery, with Android 9 Pie based on ColourOS 6.</p>
      <p>More official details about the device are likely to surface until it goes official next.</p>
