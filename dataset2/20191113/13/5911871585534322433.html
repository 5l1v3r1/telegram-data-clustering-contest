      <p>Kacey Musgraves also picked up an early CMA Award for her “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2031584/kacey-musgraves-rainbow-video/video/">Rainbow</a>” music video; <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1988591/album-of-the-week-kacey-musgraves-golden-hour/franchises/album-of-the-week/"><i>Golden Hour</i></a> was the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/featured/the-best-albums-of-2018/">deserving</a> recipient of the Country Music Association’s Album Of The Year award in 2018.

      <p>Nine Inch Nails was also recently <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063227/trent-reznor-on-the-rock-roll-hall-of-fame-ive-changed-my-opinion/news/">nominated</a> for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the third time.
