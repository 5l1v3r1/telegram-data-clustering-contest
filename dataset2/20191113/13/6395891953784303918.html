      <p><b>SEOUL, South KoreaÂ (AP)</b> - North Korea's supreme decision-making body lashed out Wednesday at planned U.S.-South Korean military drills and warned that the United States will face a "bigger threat and harsh suffering" if it ignores North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's end-of-year deadline to salvage nuclear talks.</p>
      <p>The North's State Affairs Commission said the drills would violate agreements between Kim and President Donald Trump on improving bilateral relations and compel North Korea to raise its war readiness.</p>
      <p>Kim is chairman of the commission, which he established in 2016 following years of efforts to consolidate his power and centralize governance.</p>
      <p>The statement is North Korea's latest expression of displeasure over the military drills and slow pace of nuclear negotiations with Washington. The talks have stalled over disagreements on disarmament steps and sanctions relief.</p>
