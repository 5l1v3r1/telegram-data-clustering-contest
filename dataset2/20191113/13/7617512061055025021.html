      <p>Two men were stabbed in Campbell River only four hours apart, RCMP said.</p>
      <p>About 6 p.m. Tuesday, a man in his 30s was stabbed twice near the Radiant Life Community Church soup kitchen. He was taken to Campbell River Hospital and is expected to survive.</p>
      <p>Police arrested a suspect, who is in custody awaiting charges.</p>
      <p>“We believe the people were acquainted with each other,” said RCMP Const. Maury Tyre.</p>
      <p>Then, shortly after 10 p.m., a man in his 20s was sitting behind the Campbell River Community Centre when he was stabbed several times. The victim was taken to Campbell River Hospital to be treated for his injuries and has been released.</p>
      <p>“The details of the second stabbing are far more sparse,” said Tyre. “We’re collecting video from the downtown core and we’re asking anyone who has video of that area to contact us, just to let us know, and we’ll come pick it up.”</p>
      <p>Police do not believe the attack was random and are trying to identify a suspect, he said.</p>
      <p>The suspect is described as a man who is 5-foot-7-inches tall with shoulder-length grey hair, wearing a grey jacket and jeans.</p>
      <p>Detectives and forensic officers want to talk to witnesses.</p>
      <p>“There are almost always witnesses. It’s just a matter of whether they are willing to come forward and talk, especially in the marginalized community,” Tyre said.</p>
      <p>“These stabbings are very serious incidents. Removing individuals from the street who would do harm to others in this community is a top priority and any assistance the public can provide in these matters is greatly appreciated.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call the Campbell River RCMP at 250-286-6221.</p>
