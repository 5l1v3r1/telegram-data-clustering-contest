      <h1>Leganes coach Aguirre fears Messi free-kicks ahead of Barça meeting</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona travel to Leganes after the international break in La Liga</h2>

      <p>Javier Aguirre replaced Mauricio Pellegrino as Leganes coach at the start of the month and kicked off with a decent 1-1 draw against high-flying Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>Things don't get much easier for Aguirre after the international break, with Leganes welcoming league leaders Barcelona -- and Lionel Messi -- to Butarque.</p>
      <p>Leganes are bottom of the table but Aguirre told Onda Cero he doesn't think they are "dead" and that they still have time to save themselves.</p>
      <p>He also spoke about the visit of Messi, who has already scored four free-kicks this season, including two in his last match against Celta Vigo.</p>
      <p>"For Messi, a free-kick is a penalty, it's incredible what he does," he said. Asked if he'd considered defending his set plays without a wall, he added: "One of my coaching staff suggested it. I said if I leave Messi outside the area against (goalkeeper) Pichu Cuellar and give him 10 balls, he'd score 11 goals."</p>
      <p>Aguirre also spoke about who he considers the best player in history. He said that "I played against Maradona," but he added that "the best to me was always Johan Cruyff, he did everything on the pitch."</p>
