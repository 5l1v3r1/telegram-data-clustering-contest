      <h1>Apple’s Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR are still launching in Canada in December</h1>
      <h2>It remains unclear how much the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR will cost in Canada</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:30:13+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>Apple’s high-end <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/04/mac-pro-apples-pro-display-xdr-monitor-first-look/">Mac Pro desktop and Pro Display XDR</a> are still launching in December.</p>
      <p>However, Canadian pricing for both devices has not been revealed, though we can confirm that the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR will be available to purchase on Apple.ca.</p>
      <p>The new Mac Pro features a look that ditches the ‘trash can’ design of the previous Mac Pro in favour of the cheese grater-like aesthetic. The desktop was also built with modularity in mind, allowing users to expand the computer to their specific needs.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Mac Pro features a new Intel Xeon processor with up to 28 cores. A PCI expansion has returned, with eight internal PCI slots in total. It’s also possible to configure the computer with up to 1.5TB of RAM.</p>
      <p>Apple’s ‘Pro Display XDR’ monitor is set to still launch in December as well. The display measures in at 32-inches and includes 6K resolution and HDR support.</p>
      <p>For more on the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, check out my first look at the high-end from <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/04/mac-pro-apples-pro-display-xdr-monitor-first-look/">their reveal back in June. </a></p>
      <p>In the U.S., the Mac Pro starts at $5,999 USD (about $8,060 CAD). The Pro Display XDR starts at $4,999 USD (roughly $6,716 CAD). Canadian pricing for the Pro Display XDR has not been confirmed by Apple yet.</p>
