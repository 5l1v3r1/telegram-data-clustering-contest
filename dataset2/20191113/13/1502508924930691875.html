      <p>State-run defence major <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hindustan-aeronautics-ltd">Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd </a>(HAL) on Wednesday reported Rs 621-crore net profit for the second quarter (Q2) of fiscal 2019-20, registering a 116 per cent annual growth from Rs 287 crore in the same period a year ago.</p>
      <p>Sequentially, net profit, however, rose 10 per cent to Rs 621 crore from Rs 564 crore a quarter ago.</p>
      <p>The city-based aerospace firm said in a statement that revenue from sales grew 32 per cent annually to Rs 3,451 crore from Rs 2,610 crore in the like period a year ago.</p>
      <p>"Our performance is a result of streamlining the production to even out seasonality of business leading to bunching of revenue during the third and fourth quarters of a fiscal," said the statement.</p>
      <p>Sequentially, revenue rose 5 per cent to Rs 3,451 crore from Rs 3,291 crore a quarter ago.</p>
      <p>Though the company filed the quarterly results on the BSE on November 11, it shared the details with the media belatedly on Wednesday.</p>
