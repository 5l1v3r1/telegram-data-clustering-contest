      <h1>‘Off-putting’: Victims’ advocates slam George Pell High Court ruling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:19:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/christianebarro/" target="_blank">Christiane Barro</a></address>
      <p>The High Court’s decision to hear disgraced cardinal George Pell’s appeal arguments will serve only to further discourage child sexual abuse survivors from coming forward, leading anti-abuse campaigner Chrissie Foster says.</p>
      <p>Describing Wednesday’s ruling as “off-putting” to other victims who are tossing up whether to report abuse, Ms Foster – whose two young daughters were sexually abused by a Catholic priest at their primary school in the 1980s –  said the justice process seemed never-ending.</p>
      <p>“Where does it end? With him walking away? Is that when the barrage stops, when George Pell gets off?” she told <i>The New Daily</i>.</p>
      <p>Pell, 78, was found guilty by a jury earlier in 2019 of the rape of a 13-year-old choirboy and sexual assault of another at St Patrick’s Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996. He has always denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>In August, the Victorian Court of Appeal upheld the jury’s verdict, in a 2-1 ruling.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, Justices James Edelman and Michelle Gordon announced they <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/11/13/george-pell-decision/">agreed Pell’s disputed convictions should be referred to a full court of the High Court</a> “for argument as on an appeal”.</p>
      <p>The High Court did not formally grant or refuse Pell’s application for special leave to appeal, instead referring the matter to the full court.</p>
      <p>After the hearing, the court could refuse the application for special leave, or approve it and either allow or dismiss the appeal.</p>
      <p>The referral was basically the same as a grant of leave, the University of Melbourne’s Jeremy Gans said.</p>
      <p>“A majority of the justices will decide which side wins,” Professor Gans tweeted.</p>

      <p>The High Court matter is not expected to be heard until 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/138161/courtin-paper.pdf">According to lawyer Dr Judy Courtin</a>, for every 1000 child sexual assault victims, 100 will report abuse to the police – and just six convictions will result from these reports.</p>
      <p>Then, about 55 per cent of these convictions are appealed. Of those, more than half are successful, Dr Courtin told a 2013 conference by the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law.</p>
      <p>“This is a crime that you may as well do because you’re not going to get locked up. It’s just dreadful,” Ms Foster said.</p>
      <p>Child sexual abuse survivor Phil Nagle said Wednesday’s ruling showed just how gruelling the court process was.</p>
      <p>“I just see it as like the process never ends and it seems to be very, very difficult to uphold a conviction,” he told <i>TND</i>.</p>

      <p>However, a “very pleased” former Catholic priest, Eugene Ahern, described the High Court decision as “entirely reasonable”.</p>
      <p>“We should all accept that the umpire has the right to make a decision,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The grounds that were put by Cardinal Pell’s lawyers deserve to be examined at the highest legal level in our country.”</p>
      <p>Dr Viv Waller, a Melbourne lawyer who represented one of the affected choirboy’s at Pell’s trial, said she and her client were “very respectful” of the High Court’s decision.</p>
      <p>“The appeals process is a very important part of the justice system and it’s important that the criminal justice system has checks and balances in it,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We will be waiting for the outcome of the appeal.”</p>
      <p>While being a witness in a sexual assault case was “always a difficult process”, Dr Waller encouraged survivors to report such matters to police – if they’re able and it won’t adversely affect their wellbeing.</p>
      <p>“It would be a very undesirable consequence if this made people reluctant to report these very serious matters to the police,” she said.</p>
      <p>The father of the second Pell victim, who died aged 31 from a drug overdose, is devastated, his lawyer Lisa Flynn said.</p>
      <p>“He was really hopeful that this would be over for him today because as the process goes on, and has gone on for some time, it is extremely re-traumatising for him,” she said in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>“Every appeal that is announced by Pell is a downturn. It brings up the raw emotions.”</p>
      <p>It is understood Pell’s lawyers told the former Vatican treasurer about the High Court decision in person on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Pell is serving a six-year jail term and is ineligible for parole until he has served three years and eight months of his sentence.</p>
