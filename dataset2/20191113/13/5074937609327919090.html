      <h1>Qualification will be difficult - Oti Akenteng</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:07:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Asare, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA - Francis Oti Akenteng, Technical Director of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), has said that, qualification to the semi-finals of the ongoing U-23 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) will be a stern task for the Black Meteors.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors had their chances of qualifying to the semis dented when they suffered a 3-2 defeat against their Egyptian counterparts in the second group game having secured a point in their opener against Cameroon.</p>
      <p>According to the celebrated technical brain, the Black Meteors must win their final group game against Mali and hope things would go in their favour in order to qualify to the next round and subsequently book a spot in next year’s Olympics.</p>
      <p>“Even if we can’t qualify for the last match we need to win against Mali who have dominated us over the past years. There would be a need to beat Mali no matter what, so let us motivate them and discard whatever happened in the two matches and who knows we might just be lucky,'' he told GNA Sports.</p>
      <p>He added, “We have every right to criticize the coach but let’s wait for his technical report after the tournament, then we can pinpoint what actually went wrong and prepare better for future tournaments”.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors who are third on the table with a point face off against Mali on Thursday while Egypt (Who have six points) and Cameroon (Who have four points) lock horns in the other group match.</p>
