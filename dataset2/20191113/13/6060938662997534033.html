      <p>MUMBAI: Defending Champions <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/2018-ipl-auction-complete-ipl-squad-of-mumbai-indians/articleshow/62683658.cms">Mumbai Indians</a> on Wednesday announced that they have roped in New Zealand pace spearhead <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/trent-boult">Trent Boult</a> for the upcoming season of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipl">Indian Premier League</a>.</p>
      <p>Bolt's inclusion is expected to bolster the already robust bowling setup for the four-time <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> champions.</p>
      <p>With the Wankhede Stadium pitch having a tendency to assist seam bowlers in the evening matches, the seamers are expected to add to the home advantage.</p>
      <p>Akash Ambani, owner, Mumbai Indians while welcoming Trent Bolt to the club said, "Mumbai Indians has always taken pride in having good pace attack. Year-on-year our bowlers have won us many games, a classic example being last year's final.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to have Trent Boult as part of the MI family and are looking forward to the upcoming season. I am sure his experience across formats, especially in the limited overs, will add value to our campaign."</p>
      <p>The seasoned New Zealand bowler made his IPL debut in 2014 and played for DC in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. He has 38 IPL wickets from 33 games.</p>
      <p>Mumbai Indians had earlier roped in West Indian batsman Sherfane Rutherford for off leg-spinner Mayank Markande.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, fast bowler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ankit-Rajpoot">Ankit Rajpoot</a> will represent <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-2018-complete-ipl-squad-of-rajasthan-royals/articleshow/62685110.cms">Rajasthan Royals</a> in the 2020 edition of the IPL after a successful trade by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-2018-kings-xi-punjab-complete-squad/articleshow/62685044.cms">Kings XI Punjab</a>.</p>
      <p>The right-arm fast bowler who joined KXIP in 2018 has played 23 IPL matches and has 22 wickets.</p>
      <p>Rajpoot put in one of the most memorable bowling performances ever when he claimed 5/14 in a league game in the 2018 season against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-2018-complete-squad-of-sunrisers-hyderabad/articleshow/62684939.cms">Sunrisers Hyderabad</a>. Rajpoot is the only uncapped player to have a five-wicket haul in the IPL.</p>
