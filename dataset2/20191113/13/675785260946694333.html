      <h1>Jurgen Klopp wary of injury crisis ahead of crucial Premier League title run-in</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool hold a commanding eight-point lead in their quest to win their first title since 1990, but Klopp knows injuries to any of his stars could eat away their advantage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:54:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp is praying none of his Liverpool stars suffer injuries on international duty to threaten their title bid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> hold a commanding eight-point lead in their quest to win their first title since 1990, but Klopp knows injuries to any of his stars could eat away their advantage.</p>
      <p>Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah have withdrawn from international duty with ankle problems and the Reds boss does not want to lose anyone else.</p>
      <p>Liverpool return to action at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday week and Klopp wants all his big names available for the next hectic couple of months, which will see them compete in five competitions on two continents.</p>

      <p>“If you had told me that you can have 34 points, wow!” said Klopp in response to Liverpool’s flying start. “It’s pretty much impossible, but we did it.</p>
      <p>“But now the boys go for the last international break of the year. They have to come back healthy.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully they all come back healthy and then we go to Crystal Palace. I think the last games are somewhere on the planet on Tuesday in the week that we play on Saturday against Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>“So they will fly back on the Wednesday, Thursday have a recovery session and Friday, Saturday ‘hello, Crystal Palace!’. That’s the situation so nothing happens so far, but it’s still the best situation we could have asked for so let’s hope we can carry on.”</p>

      <p>Salah has returned to Melwood for treatment on his left ankle after being ruled out of Egypt’s AFCON qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros.</p>
      <p>The striker was pictured wearing a protective boot and Liverpool hope he will recover in time to face Palace.</p>
      <p>Robertson is also a concern after pulling out of Scotland’s squad for their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan and revealing he has not been training properly because of his niggling ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The left-back has been resting between games in a bid to be available and aggravated the problem when he took a kick from Rodri in Sunday’s win over title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>

      <p>Robertson, 25, said: “It’s a big disappointment for me. But I don’t want to pick up more injuries and ruin my season because of it.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had to listen to the people around me when previously I would have told them to beat it. The fact my ankle has swollen up again has made it easier to miss these games.</p>
      <p>“For the last two-and-a-half weeks I’ve not trained at all for Liverpool. I’ve trained the day before a game, missed a Champions League game other than the last 15 minutes against Genk and missed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the League Cup.”</p>
