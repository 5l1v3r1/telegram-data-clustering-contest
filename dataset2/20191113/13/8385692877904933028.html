      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/android-10-coming-to-the-oneplus-7-pro-5g-in-q1-2020.html">confirmed</a> recently that the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G won't get Android 10 until Q1 2020. That managed to upset quite a few people who purchased the device, and the company's CEO offered an <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/a-letter-to-oneplus-7-pro-5g-users-in-europe.1138168/">explanation</a>.</p>
      <p>Pete Lau decided to explain what's going on, and tried to calm people down in the process. He shared "A letter to OnePlus 7 Pro 5G users in Europe" via the company's official Forums.</p>
      <p>Before we get down to it, do note that the regular OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/09/android-10-based-oxygenos-10-now-rolling-out-to-the-oneplus-7-series.html">started receiving</a> Android 10 back in September. That is why the 7 Pro 5G users are so upset, as they're months behind in the pecking order.</p>

      <p>Do note that OnePlus had to stop the Android 10 rollout to the OnePlus 7 series due to bugs, and <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/10/oneplus-7-series-android-10-rollout-continues-with-oxygenos-10-1.html">continued</a> it after a short while, in October.</p>
      <h3>Android 10 is late for the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G because brand new tech is in play</h3>
      <p>In its letter, Pete Lau acknowledges that people are upset, and says he's been occupied with the matter as well. He said that OnePlus started researching 5G back in 2016, and that the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G is the company's first 5G phone.</p>
      <p>That being said, he thanked everyone who purchased the device, and supported the company that way. He does note that 5G is brand new technology, and that it is not as simple to update, not even close.</p>

      <p>Mr. Lau says that 5G uses a different communications module to establish a faster connection as opposed to 4G. It thus requires a deeper level of understanding, and more rigorous tests, debugging, and optimizations. That actually goes for both hardware and software.</p>
      <p>He says that the company had to make system optimizations from the fundamental system architecture. This is a really arduous and time-consuming process, admits Mr. Lau.</p>
      <h3>Pete Lau promised that Android 10 is coming as soon as possible</h3>
      <p>He did promise that the company will overcome such obstacles, and deliver Android 10 to the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G as soon as possible. Pete Lau once again reiterated that the company is aiming to release this update in Q1 2020.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>He said that the company's mission didn't change, and that it will keep supporting the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G. He also said that it plans to increase the speed of the process. Considering that this is a 5G smartphone, things are moving slower at the moment.</p>
      <p>OnePlus users are quite used to fast updates. The company has a rather demanding userbase at the moment, so it's not surprising that such concerns were voiced by people who purchased the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, their concern is understandable, as they feel they'd be better off getting the regular version. Well, considering that 5G is not nearly where it should be, that may have been a better option. In any case, Android 10 is coming to the OnePlus 7 Pro 5G, you'll just have to wait a bit longer.</p>
