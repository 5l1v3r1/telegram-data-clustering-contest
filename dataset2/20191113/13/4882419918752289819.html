      <p>Former Barcelona player Ronald Koeman, who is currently in charge of the Dutch national team, once again has had to respond to questions about his future.</p>
      <p>It's been revealed recently that there's a clause in his deal which would allow him to leave his current job if Barcelona come in for him after next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p>This time, he was much more discrete than in previous questions, as if he's grown fed up of being asked about the same thing.</p>
      <p>He has always been linked with Barcelona since he hung up his boots and he said that "moving there is a possibility but I will not think about it until after Euro 2020."</p>
