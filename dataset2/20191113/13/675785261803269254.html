      <h1>Secret of living beyond 100 uncovered - and it could lead to 'fountain of youth' pill</h1>
      <h2>Scientists from the Riken Centre for Integrative Medical Science have revealed why 'super-centenarians' live much longer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:53:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, Mark Waghorn, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>The secret of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/life-expectancy">living beyond 100</a> has been discovered by scientists.</p>
      <p>Super-centenarians have abnormally large amounts of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/immune-system">immune cells</a> that fuel their longevity, according to new research.</p>
      <p>The breakthrough could lead to therapies that increase the number of people who get that landmark telegram from The Queen.</p>
      <p>Study lead author Dr Kosuke Hashimoto said: "If we can find the link between the immune system and aging and longevity, we may be able to contribute to prolonging healthy life expectancies."</p>
      <p>As we age the risk of developing cancer and other life-threatening illnesses increases through a reduction in the immune system's T-cells.</p>
      <p>These special cells kill bugs and foreign bodies - and are found in abundance in super-centenarians who have reached 110.</p>
      <p>In the first study of its kind, Dr Hashimoto and colleagues sequenced thousands of immune cells in blood taken from seven of these rare individuals.</p>

      <p>They compared these with samples taken from five randomly selected people aged in their 50s to 80s.</p>
      <p>Dr Hashimoto said: "The findings suggest how the immune system of super-centenarians might protect against viral infections and tumour development to confer exceptional longevity."</p>
      <p>It sheds light on why super-centenarians generally tend to spend most of their lives in good health.</p>
      <p>Many live without assistance - even after they turn 100. They have been described as the "elite of health and longevity."</p>
      <p>The study found one particular type of T-cell, called CD4+, was four or five times as abundant in the super-centenarians as their younger counterparts.</p>
      <p>It's not known why - or how it might extend lives. Getting to the bottom of it could lead to a 'fountain of youth' pill.</p>

      <p>Dr Hashimoto, of the Riken Centre for Integrative Medical Science in Yokohama, Japan, said: "The composition of T cells changes as people age."</p>
      <p>"People who have reached 110 years of age, known as supercentenarians, generally tend to spend most of their lives in good health, suggesting their immune system retains the ability to fight infection and cancer.</p>
      <p>"However, immune cells in supercentenarians have not been well characterised."</p>
      <p>Scientists have claimed there is no limit to how long people will live in the future thanks to new technology.</p>
      <p>The Canadian team said super-centenarians will become more common as average life expectancy rises.</p>
      <p>By analysing the lifespan of the longest-living individuals from the USA, the UK, France and Japan for each year since 1968, they found no evidence for a limit, and if such a maximum exists, it has yet to be reached or identified.</p>
      <p>Other scientists argue that technology, medical interventions and improvements in living conditions could all push back the upper limit.</p>
      <p>Dr Hashimoto said: "Supercentenarians are rare individuals who reach 110 years of age.</p>
      <p>"They are endowed with high resistance to lethal diseases such as cancer, stroke, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>"Exceptionally long-lived people such as super-centenarians tend to spend their entire lives in good health, implying that their immune system remains active to protect against infections and tumours.</p>
      <p>"However, their immunological condition has been largely unexplored. We profiled thousands of circulating immune cells from super-centenarians.</p>
      <p>"They are a great model of healthy ageing. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional.</p>
      <p>"Our study reveals super-centenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating immune cells, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases"</p>
      <p>In September it was revealed there were 820 people in the UK aged 105 and over - compared to 320 in 2002. There were 13,170 centenarians - with five times more women than men.</p>
