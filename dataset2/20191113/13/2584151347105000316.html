      <h1>Trump lashes out online ahead of impeachment hearings</h1>
      <h2>“Millions of Americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is,” Trump tweeted, paraphrasing remarks of conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh.</h2>

      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday railed against House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry, tweeting out lines of attack from his favorite morning cable news show hours before the probe’s first public hearings were set to commence.</p>
      <p>In his first post on a morning critical to the fate of his presidency, Trump paraphrased remarks that conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh made Tuesday and that were rebroadcast during a segment on “Fox &amp; Friends” early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“‘Millions of Americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing is.’ Rush Limbaugh @foxandfriends,” Trump wrote online.</p>
      <p>“Also, why is corrupt politician Schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer. Did that lawyer ever work for me, which would be a conflict?” he added.</p>
      <p>The second line of Trump’s tweet, which invoked House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), appeared to refer to the congressman’s plans to yield significant questioning time during Wednesday’s impeachment testimony to his panel’s majority counsel.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear whether two of the more well-known lawyers for the Intelligence Committee’s Democratic lawmakers, Daniel Goldman and Daniel Noble, ever took on Trump as a client in his capacity as a private businessman — though such a possibility seems unlikely.</p>
      <p>Goldman, the Intelligence Committee’s director of investigations, served 10 years as a federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. Noble, a senior counsel for the committee, also worked in the Southern District, specializing in cybercrime and organized crime prosecutions.</p>
      <p>Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), the top GOP member of the Intelligence Committee, is also expected to turn over much of his time with the witnesses on Wednesday to the minority counsel.</p>
      <p>“The Democrats have stacked the deck against President Trump and the Republicans. They have leaked out everything,” the president complained in another morning missive, mentioning the Twitter handles for “Fox &amp; Friends” and one of the program’s co-hosts, Steve Doocy.</p>
      <p>Beginning at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, lawmakers will hear testimony from George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary at the State Department whose portfolio includes Ukraine, and William Taylor, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Both administration officials were previously deposed before members of three congressional committees last month, and the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were released to the public last week.</p>
