      <p>This Wednesday, AMC and Sundance will jointly air <i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/in-resisting-the-allure-of-a-killers-good-looks-preppy-murder-series-restores-some-dignity-to-his-victim/2019/11/11/41687f3a-ff48-11e9-8501-2a7123a38c58_story.html">The Preppy Murder: Death in Central Park</a></i>, a five-part series about the killing of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin by 19-year-old Robert Chambers, who landed on the cover of <i><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48262/index.html">New York </a></i><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48262/index.html">mag</a> in the lead up to the trial due to his reported good looks. When it happened, the so-called "Preppy Murder" was the court case of the decade, attracting wall-to-wall news coverage and spawning a glut of true-crime inspired pop culture: a TV movie starring Lara Flynn Boyle (<i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098119/">The Preppie Murder</a></i>), a<i> Law &amp; Order </i>episode (“<a href="https://lawandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Kiss_the_Girls_and_Make_Them_Die">Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die</a>”), and even a song by The Killers (“<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/9429ddce-ac14-4c20-9d0e-d063f7b42593">Jenny Was a Friend of Min</a>e”).</p>
      <p>Then, the case was largely forgotten; the Preppy Murder's star prosecutor <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/arts/television/linda-fairstein-when-they-see-us.html">Linda Fairstein</a> was recast as a villain in the case of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/arts/linda-fairstein-when-they-see-us.html">Central Park 5</a>. Meanwhile, Chambers served just 15 years for Levin’s murder — despite being in jail now on unrelated charges.</p>
      <p>First, the facts: Robert Chambers killed Levin early in the morning on August 26, 1986, less than two hours after the pair left Dorrian’s — an Upper East Side bar with a reputation for serving underage patrons — at 4:30 AM. The teenagers knew each other. Levin had told her friends she liked him, and <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/crime/48262/index.html#content">they'd had "flings" in the past</a>. Before sunrise, she'd be strangled in the middle of Manhattan's famed Central Park.</p>

      <p>The crime was a tabloid sensation, crossing the rigid geographic boundaries co-director Ricki Stern says defined Manhattan at the time. Chambers was the East side prep school athlete and former altar boy; Levin was Jewish and a downtown girl. By the time he faced trial in 1988 on charges of second-degree murder, it seemed that Chambers was already winning in the court of public opinion. Former <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1987/10/23/A-prosecutor-claimed-Friday-that-Roman-Catholic-Church-members/5672561960000/">Cardinal Theodore Bishop</a>, decades before he’d become the most senior Catholic official <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/world/europe/cardinal-theodore-mccarrick-resigns.html">defrocked in the church’s sexual abuse scandal</a>, wrote a letter to the court on Chambers’s behalf.</p>
      <p>Initially, Chambers denied any involvement in Levin’s killing, but by the time of the trial, his attorneys had come up with the novel “<a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6628&amp;context=jclc">rough sex defense</a>,” insisting her death was a mishap during consensual sex. In other words, victim blaming. It worked. After nine days of jury deadlock, Chambers' team had the leverage they needed to force a plea deal for manslaughter with it's comparatively meager sentence of five to fifteen years.</p>

      <p>In the end, Chambers served every last day of that sentence. After assaulting a correctional officer, her was moved to Clinton Correctional Facility — a prison along the Canadian border that’s earned the nickname “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/08/us/new-york-clinton-correctional-facility/index.html">Little Siberia</a>” for housing some of New York’s most violent offenders (it's also the subject of last year's <i><a href="https://www.romper.com/p/how-true-to-the-real-story-is-escape-at-dannemora-the-showtime-miniseries-is-based-on-unbelievable-events-13246893">Escape at Dannemora</a></i>). Nearly 5 years of his prison term were served in <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2004/nov/25/preppie-killer-faces-drug-charge/">solitary confinement</a>. When he was released in 2003, Chambers was greeted with more media attention, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/robert-chambers-jennifer-levin-murder-the-preppy-killer/">including a <i>48 Hours </i>interview</a>. That was then.</p>
      <p>As for where Robert Chambers is now, the answer is <a href="http://nysdoccslookup.doccs.ny.gov/GCA00P00/WIQ3/WINQ130">Sullivan Correctional Facility</a>, after having plead guilty to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-chambers/nys-preppy-killer-gets-19-years-for-drug-charges-idUSN1138147220080811">selling a controlled substance and assaulting</a> a police officer in 2008. This time through the justice system, though, the Preppy Killer wasn't a handsome teen with powerful clergy on his side and a tabloid-ready defense. He was a 41-year-old <a href="https://nypost.com/2008/03/12/a-dirty-dozen-druggie/">drug addict</a> with a long rap sheet for drugs, burglary, assault and manslaughter. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison.</p>
