      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Surging gasoline prices caused U.S. consumer prices to rise last month at the fastest pace since March.</p>
      <p>The Labor Department said Wednesday that its consumer price index rose 0.4% in October after a flat reading in September. Gasoline prices, after drops in August and September, jumped 3.7% last month. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, so-called core consumer inflation rose just 0.2% in October.</p>
      <p>Overall consumer prices rose 1.8% over the past year, just below the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Core prices increased 2.3%.</p>
      <p>Relatively tame inflation has allowed the Fed to cut short-term U.S. interest rates three times this year to support an American economy slowed by trade disputes with China and other U.S. trading partners.</p>
