      <h1>Anna Soubry given award for leaving Conservatives and standing up to abuse</h1>
      <h2>She has been subjected to threats because of her anti-Brexit stance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:59:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Bunn</a></address>
      <p>Change UK leader and parliamentary candidate for Broxtowe Anna Soubry has won an award for "political courage".</p>
      <p>The former Conservative MP, who had an 863-vote majority at the 2017 election, has actively campaigned for a 'People's Vote' on the Brexit referendum and was subjected to threats because of her stance.</p>
      <p>Last month she warned "good people" would not want to stand at the 2019 election <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/mp-anna-soubry-issues-election-3489745">because of fear of similar attacks</a> .</p>
      <p>She was presented with the award by the Political Studies Association for leaving her party - in February - to uphold her values and for standing up to abuse and threats. She was presented with the award alongside Luciana Berger, who has suffered anti-semitic abuse during her career.</p>
      <p>Ms Berger is now a member of the Liberal Democrats after leaving the Labour Party and Change UK this year.</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry said: "I am hugely grateful, but it says a lot about the state of British political life at the moment that standing up to racist anti-semitism, as Luciana has done, and my refusing to give in to threats and abuse, merits a special award".</p>
      <p>Ms Soubry is standing at the election in Broxtowe. You can view the list of prospective candidates so far <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/general-election-2019-candidate-list-3515103">here</a> .</p>
