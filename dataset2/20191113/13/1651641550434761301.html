      <p>The jam tomorrow of Apple devices — <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-might-launch-the-16-inch-macbook-with-a-new-keyboard-layout-tomorrow/">the MacBook Pro 16-inch</a> — is now official.</p>
      <p>The device ships with a (you guessed it) 16inch True Tone equipped Retina HD display. It has slim bezels, which means you’ll get a device in the same body size as that of the smaller screened 15-inch MacBook Pro. There’s a 6-speaker stereo system with Dolby Atmos, and Apple’s Touch Bar makes a return on the keyboard — albeit with a physical escape key.</p>
      <p>Aside from the screen size, the biggest improvement in the new MacBook Pro is the keyboard. Apple had previously equipped its devices with the older butterfly-style keyboard. Said keyboard eventually proved to be problematic, leading to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-apologizes-to-users-facing-issues-with-macbook-keyboard/">Apple launching several repair programs</a> that generated a lot of lost revenue in terms of bad PR and repair costs. The firm has now switched to a new scissor style. I’ll let those who’ve gone hands-on with it discuss it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962380/apples-16-inch-macbook-pro-keyboard-screen-speakers-processor">Dieter from the Verge</a> gives a thumbs up to the new keyboard, “Reader: it is good.” The hands-on then goes on to note that. “The whole thing is blissfully quiet (though it’s not as silent as the keys on a Pixelbook Go). It has a more muted thumpy sound and feel compared to the 2015 MacBook Pro with the older style keyboard — which now feels overly springy to me. I prefer this keyboard. It may have a little less travel than those 2015 models but the backlight doesn’t bleed out the sides of the keys.” iMore’s <a href="https://www.imore.com/16-inch-macbook-pro-review">headline is a bit more punchy</a>, “Clickity-clack, the good keyboard is back!”</p>
      <p>You get the gist. At first glance, this keyboard seems to the antidote to all of Apple’s butterfly woes. Hopefully, MacBook users won’t find themselves defeated by dust and lint again anytime soon.</p>
      <p>As far as the other key specs go, the MacBook Pro goes up to 64GB of RAM, with up to 8TBof storage and an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory. The device starts at $2,399 and is available for pre-order online from today.</p>
