      <p>As cloud computing continues to eat up traditional tech spending, businesses are beginning to change where they spend their money.<br/><br/>The worldwide public cloud services market is forecast to grow 17% in 2020 to a total of $266.4 billion, up from $227.8 billion in 2019, according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-11-13-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-public-cloud-revenue-to-grow-17-percent-in-2020">tech analyst Gartner.</a><br/><br/><b>MUST READ:  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-cloud-computing-everything-you-need-to-know-from-public-and-private-cloud-to-software-as-a/">What is cloud computing? Everything you need to know about the cloud, explained</a></b><br/><br/>Cloud computing adoption has now become mainstream, said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53485/Sid-Nag">Sid Nag</a>, research vice president at Gartner. That means higher spending on cloud, but also higher expectations from cloud buyers as to what they will get for their money.<br/><br/>According to Gartner, software-as-a-service (SaaS) will remain the largest market segment: SaaS is forecast to grow to $116 billion next year, up from $99.5 billion in 2019.</p>

      <p>The second-largest sector is cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), which will reach $50 billion in 2020. IaaS is forecast to grow 24% year over year, the highest growth rate across all market segments, which Garter said was the result of data centre consolidation. That's because modern applications and workloads -- many of which are cloud applications themselves -- now require infrastructure at a scale that traditional data centres cannot meet. <br/><br/>Cloud computing was listed among the top three areas where most global CIOs will increase their investment next year, Gartner said: "As organisations increase their reliance on cloud technologies, IT teams are rushing to embrace cloud-built applications and relocate existing digital assets."</p>
      <p>However, as the use of cloud computing goes mainstream, the landscape will become increasingly sophisticated and competitive -- so much so that customers will need help with managing multiple cloud suppliers and applications.<br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/topic/the-cloud-v-data-center-decision/"><b>Cloud v. data center decision</b></a><b> (ZDNet special report) | </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/the-cloud-v-data-center-decision-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Download the report as a PDF</b></a><b> (TechRepublic)</b><br/><br/>By 2022, Gartner said, up to 60% of organisations will use an external service provider's <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-aws-be-caught-heres-how-its-cloud-computing-rivals-can-improve-their-chances/">cloud-managed service offering</a> -- twice the number in 2018. <br/><br/>"Cloud-native capabilities, application services, multicloud and hybrid cloud comprise a diverse cloud ecosystem that will be important differentiators for technology product managers. Demand for strategic cloud service outcomes signals an organisational shift toward digital business outcomes," Nag said.</p>
