      </p>
      <p>The Spanish giants had previously unveiled their home, away and third strips for the 2019/20 campaign, but have now added a fourth kit featuring diagonal red stripes over a yellow background.</p>
      <p>"With the tagline '<i>Ho portem dins'</i> ('It’s deep within us'), FC Barcelona is presenting a new kit for this season that features the Catalan flag, the <i>senyera</i>, in honour of the club's roots and history: over 120 years the club has grown as an entity that is open to the world, and which views sport as a phenomenon that can build bridges between people. However, this has not meant losing its sense of Catalan identity, culture and values," a statement on the club's website read.</p>
      <p>Sergi Roberto, one of the club's four captains added: "It is an honour to wear the flag, the four stripes, on the shirt."</p>
