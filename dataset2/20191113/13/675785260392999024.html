      <h2>Tahith Chong has reportedly stalled on signing a new contract at Manchester United and Juventus are ready to snap him up when his current deal expires</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:07:41+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:07</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Tahith Chong has refused to confirm he will sign a new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> contract, but insists his only focus is the Red Devils this season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old winger is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the campaign, and reports emerged last week that he is stalling on penning a new deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are keen on landing the talented youngster and are prepared to offer him a bumper deal - in the same way they did with Paul Pogba - to snap him up on a free.</p>
      <p>And Chong has given United no assurances he will extend his stay at the club, saying his only focus right now is representing the Red Devils.</p>

      <p>"It's early right now," Chong told FOX Sports. "I'm still a player of Manchester United and the season is in full swing. My focus is on that.</p>
      <p>"The contract will come naturally. I am now focusing on this season."</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was impressed by Chong during Manchester United's pre-season tour and opted against sending the youngster out on loan.</p>
      <p>"To be honest, I can see them staying here and making a proper impact," explained the Red Devils boss.</p>
      <p>"They have already, on pre-season, and they did so in February, March and April.</p>

      <p>"They did well in training but we never gave them enough game time.</p>
      <p>"Pre-season has shown they have grown over the last six months and they are getting used to men's football. They will get opportunities."</p>
