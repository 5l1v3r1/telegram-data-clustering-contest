      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:09:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Asare, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA – StarTimes, Africa’s leading pay-TV service operator in collaboration with the German Bundesliga, have rolled out a project targeted at developing young football talents and coaches in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The project dubbed Bundesliga Football School (BLFS), slated for December 14–18, 2019, is targeted at developing and promoting young talents and also allows local fans to experience a physical connection to Germany's top tier league through a number of fun and inclusive activities.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the press launch held at Tang Palace Hotel in Accra on Tuesday, Head of Mrs. Akofa Bamfo, Head of Marketing at StarTimes Ghana, revealed the need to invest in the development of Ghana football.</p>
      <p>“StarTimes, the brand that introduced affordable pay-tv to Ghanaians threeyears ago is seeking to give back to Ghanaians with this Football school project through our partnership with Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>“We would continue to improve our brand, offer more value to our customers and contribute our quota to the growth of Ghana Football,” She said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Francis Oti Akenteng, Technical Director of the Ghana Football Association in his address on behalf of the President of GFA, Mr. Kurt E.S. Okraku, said that, the association fully supports the initiative especially at a time where his administration has prioritized youth development.</p>
      <p>“We can’t deny the fact that Ghana football over the past years has been dependent on colts and academy players. So for the BLFS to target the young ones, I believe would see more glory days under.</p>
      <p>“It is indeed a good initiative that will help the GFA especially with our local coaches get to work hand in hand with some experienced Bundesliga coaches as they help develop the younger ones,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>The BLFS sessions would be ran by experts and licensed coaches from the youth training centres of Bundesliga clubs with assistance from selected Ghanaian coaches.</p>
      <p>Former German international Renate Lingor, two time World Cup winner, two time European Champion and three time Bronze Medal Olympic Games winner together with other UEFA license A coaches such as Tobias Süveges of SV Werder Bremen, Arne Stratmann of TSG 1899 Hoffenheim, Bjoern Nass of Bayer 04 Leverkusen and head coach of the Bundesliga Football school, Birger J. Nass will lead the course.</p>
      <p>The one-week course would see football  players (Boys and Girls) between the ages of 13 and 17 receive targeted assistance in a series of compact training sessions and workshops, enabling them to showcase their talent.</p>
