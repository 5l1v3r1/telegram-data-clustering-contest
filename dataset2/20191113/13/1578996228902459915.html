      <h1>Selena Gomez Debuts the Meaningful Matching Tattoo She Got With Julia Michaels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T13:34:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 13:34</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Footage <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29774504/selena-gomez-dog-winnie-puma-fashion-campaign/">came out</a> of Selena Gomez and Julia Michaels getting matching tattoos Monday night after Gomez made a guest appearance at Michaels' concert. It wasn't clear then what the friends and collaborators got. (Michaels is a singer and songwriter; she co-wrote Gomez's <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29687645/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-hot-100-reaction/">first #1</a> song <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29553902/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/">"Lose You to Love Me"</a> among other tracks.) But Gomez unveiled the first photos of the actual little tattoos the girls got on their hands last night. They're arrows and deeply meaningful.</p>
      <p>"It's tatted," Gomez wrote on her first shot, tagging Michaels. "My arrow points to you forever."</p>

      <p>Gomez went to Michaels' '90s prom-themed birthday party over the weekend. She shared shots of herself with Michaels at the party, writing an adoring caption to her longtime friend. "My love, my heart and my soul @juliamichaels 🖤," Gomez wrote on her Instagram.</p>
      <p>Michaels commented back, "😭😭😭😭🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 the amount I love you is unreal."</p>

      <p>Gomez collaborated with Michaels on <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a26015177/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-anxiety-lyrics-meaning/">her song "Anxiety."</a> When the single came out this January, Gomez wrote an intimate tribute to Michaels on her Instagram where she touched on how impactful their friendship was to her.</p>
      <p>"My sweet soul sister. Julia you have been a huge part of my life," she wrote. "You have taught me how to have courage when I have self doubt. This song is extremely close to my heart as I’ve experienced anxiety and know a lot of my friends do too. You’re never alone if you feel this way. The message is much needed, and I really hope you guys like it!"</p>
