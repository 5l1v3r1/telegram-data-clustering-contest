      <p>Southeast Asia is a major contributor to land-based plastic waste leaking into the world’s oceans, with more than half of it coming from four nations - Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand - along with China, the top single polluter.</p>
      <p>Many countries in the region struggle with poor waste sorting and disposal systems, and their growth in population and explosive demand for consumer products mean more single-use plastic ends up in landfill or leaks into the environment.</p>
      <p>To battle the growing crisis, Southeast Asia, home to 641 million people across 10 countries, needs to introduce region-wide policies to regulate plastic packaging, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said in an 89-page report.</p>
      <p>“Southeast Asia is a primary source and victim of plastic, where it is choking seas and threatening ecosystems and livelihoods,” said Kakuko Nagatani-Yoshida, UNEP’s Regional Coordinator for Chemicals and Waste.</p>
      <p>“If we want to solve the marine litter problem globally, we have to solve it in this region.”</p>
      <p>Worldwide, around eight million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, according to previously published UNEP data.</p>
      <p>Whales and sea turtles have been found dead in the region in recent years with large amounts of plastic rubbish in their stomachs.</p>
      <p>In June, leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) adopted a declaration to combat marine debris, a move commended by environmentalists as a good first step.</p>
      <p>But whether the declaration will be implemented is questionable given that ASEAN has a code of non-interference in member states that would leave necessary policy-making in the hands of individual countries.</p>
      <p>Some governments in Southeast Asia have already introduced broad plans and timelines to reduce their plastic addiction.</p>
      <p>Between now and 2025, Thailand plans to ban seven types of plastics most commonly found in the ocean such as bottle cap seals, disposable bags, cups and straws.</p>
      <p>This week, the Thai cabinet approved a ban on plastic bags at supermarkets and department stores belonging to 43 companies, starting on Jan. 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>The government said the policy was expected to save 45 billion single-use plastic bags per year, or 225,000 tonnes, from incineration or landfill.</p>
