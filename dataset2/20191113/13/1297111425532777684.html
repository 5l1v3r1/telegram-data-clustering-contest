      <h2>CFL teams will deal with a range of emotions following Sunday's division finals in Regina and Hamilton.</h2>

      <p>The road to the final four in the CFL has included some long and winding roads, but the division finalists have now been determined.</p>
      <p>Each club has a unique story that is quite fascinating.</p>
      <p>The Edmonton Eskimos lead the league in doubters, many of whom presume that head coach Jason Maas won’t return for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p>Eskimos quarterback Trevor Harris was razor-sharp, leading his team to <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/montreal-alouettes/als-defence-comes-up-short-in-semifinal-playoff-loss-to-eskimos/wcm/ab87f1a3-da9f-4200-a67a-b0ff7ca65149">a 37-29 victory over the host Montreal Alouettes in Sunday’s East Division semi-final.</a></p>
      <p>Maas had rested Harris the previous week, when <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-clinch-first-place-in-cfl-west-division">the Eskimos played the host Saskatchewan Roughriders in a game that was meaningless for the visiting team</a>, and Sunday’s result proves that the Eskimos’ head coach made the right call.</p>
      <p>Harris’ 92-per-cent completion rate says it all. The CFL’s load-management example definitely paid off for the Eskimos.</p>
      <p>Edmonton, a cross-over team after finishing fourth in the West, will now meet the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in the East Division final.</p>
      <p>The Tiger-Cats have been the quietest 15-3 team in the league in a long time. A very impressive record was attained even though starting quarterback Jeremiah Masoli was lost to injury early in the season.</p>
      <p>Dane Evans, who was next in line behind centre, and his Tiger-Cats teammates deserve full marks for an impressive regular season.</p>
      <p>One doesn’t have to analyze <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-quarterback-carousel-turned-out-swell-for-saskatchewan-roughriders-and-winnipeg-blue-bombers">the West Division final, between the Roughriders and the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a>, for very long before focusing on the starting quarterbacks.</p>
      <p>The remarkable stories of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-being-cautious-with-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Saskatchewan’s Cody Fajardo</a> and <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-quarterback-carousel-turned-out-swell-for-saskatchewan-roughriders-and-winnipeg-blue-bombers">Winnipeg’s Zach Collaros</a> will be well-covered this week by everyone in the media.</p>
      <p>The two teams will crank up the rivalry to another level on Sunday at Mosaic Stadium, with a spot in the Grey Cup on the line.</p>
      <p>The Blue Bombers come into the game riding <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/calgary-stampeders/calgary-stampeders-fail-to-execute-as-winnipeg-blue-bombers-end-their-season/wcm/403e6aba-efa2-45ea-b5f0-689e1c6c5a6d">a 35-14 road win over the Calgary Stampeders.</a></p>
      <p>Saskatchewan received a first-round bye after winning the West’s regular-season title for the first time in 10 years, and only the second time in a span of 43 seasons.</p>
      <p>The fan base of the losing team on Sunday is in for a very long off-season, knowing that a loss to a traditional rival ended the season.</p>
      <p>This is a high-stakes game for bragging rights on the Prairies.</p>
      <p>The game being played in Regina should give the Roughriders an edge, but playoff football in the CFL can generate unpredictable results.</p>
      <p>Just follow Rob Vanstone’s predictions to discover who will come out on top. Take the opposite of what he predicts and you’ll have a good idea on the winner before the game is played.</p>
      <p>As a former GM, when our club was involved in a division final, you knew you were going to experience the ultimate range of emotions by Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>A win will produce a dizzying moment of brief happiness and celebration — a prelude to a pre-Grey Cup planning meeting with your staff.</p>
      <p>In the event of a loss, the only thing you needed to nail down was what time the gloomy year-end meetings were to occur on Monday.</p>
      <p>Either way, the long and winding road ends for two teams on Sunday.</p>

      <p>The usual predictions …</p>
      <p>
        <b>EAST DIVISION FINAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Edmonton at Hamilton (Sunday, noon)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Taman: </b>One half of the Battle of Alberta is in place. Eskimos by eight.</p>
      <p><b>Vanstone:</b> Hamilton will show why it won 15 regular-season games. Tiger-Cats by 11.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WEST DIVISION FINAL</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Winnipeg at Saskatchewan (Sunday, 3:30 p.m.)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Taman: </b>Beating Calgary was the key for Winnipeg. Blue Bombers by nine.</p>
      <p><b>Vanstone:</b> Avoiding Calgary was the key for Saskatchewan. Roughriders by four.</p>
      <p><b>Season records:</b> Taman 55-28 (1-1 last week); Vanstone 54-29 (0-2).</p>
      <p>• • •</p>
      <p><b>Hero:</b><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/winnipeg-bluebombers/friesen-streveler-slingshots-bombers-past-cfls-goliath/wcm/e972270c-1424-4835-967e-5b6b2b642d49">Winnipeg quarterback Chris Streveler.</a> Playing with a plethora of injuries, after reports that he might not even play, he showed up in the second half versus Calgary and assisted in a dominant win. Streveler rushed 13 times for a game-high 82 yards, including a touchdown, while being used as a complement to Collaros.</p>
      <p><b>Zero:</b> Calgary Stampeders. Not even reaching the West final has to be a major disappointment, considering that the Grey Cup game is being played in Calgary. Seeing Winnipeg or Saskatchewan take over their locker room will make for some long faces for the Stampeders.</p>
