      <h1>Microsoft measurably improves Surface Pro X by releasing ARM64 Chromium-based Edge browser</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apps-that-will-not-work-on-microsoft-surface-pro-x/">Surface Pro X and other Windows 10 on ARM laptops have a significant app gap</a>, due to x64 apps not working on the platform.   These days however we do much of our computing in the browser, and many have complained that Microsoft has not released a native ARM64 Edge browser for Windows 10 on ARM, and instead left users with the slow emulated 32bit Chrome and Chromium-based Edge browser.</p>
      <p>What has been particularly galling is that the ARM64 version of the modern Chromium-powered Edge browser did exist, but was not being publicly released.</p>
      <p>It appears Microsoft has been listening to the protests, and today made the Canary version of the new ARM64 browser available.</p>
