      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A 19-year-old Madison woman was arrested at East High School on Tuesday afternoon after having a weapon on school grounds and spitting on a resource officer, police said.  </p>
      <p>Madison police said Juanecia Thompson, who is not an East student, refused to exit the school around 12:45 p.m. following a disturbance with a student. </p>
      <p>According to an incident report, the school resource officer requested Thompson leave, but Thompson continued yelling, swearing and told the officer that "no one could make her leave the building." </p>
      <p>The report said Thompson spit on the officer's neck and was taken to Dane County Jail after a backup officer arrived. </p>
      <p>Police said Thompson had a stun gun and pepper spray in her pockets. </p>
      <p>She was tentatively charged on suspicion of possession of weapons on school grounds, discharge of bodily fluids at a public safety worker, disorderly conduct, resisting and felony bail jumping. </p>
