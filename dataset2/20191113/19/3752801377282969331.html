      <p>Bolivia's exiled ex-president Evo Morales said on Wednesday he was ready to return to "pacify" his country amid weeks of unrest that led to his resignation.</p>
      <p>"If the people ask me, we are ready to return to pacify" the country, the leftist leader said in a news conference in Mexico City, where he arrived on Tuesday after receiving political asylum.</p>
      <p>He called for a "national dialogue" to resolve the crisis in Bolivia and rejected the legitimacy of interim president Jeanine Anez, who has stepped in to try to fill a power vacuum left by Morales's resignation.</p>
