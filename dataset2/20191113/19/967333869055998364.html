        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) - The US Department of Defence (DOD) is facing challenges in sustaining the F-35 fighter jet fleet due to a shortage of parts and the poor performance of the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) system, the Government Accountability Office said in a report.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We testified that DOD faces challenges keeping the growing [F-35] fleet ready to perform its mission, largely due to insufficient planning", the report said. "Challenges include spare parts shortages: F-35s were unable to fly about 30 percent of the time due to a lack of spare parts from May-November 2018, poor performance of the information technology system used to sustain the aircraft: It requires manual workarounds and has data inaccuracies".</blockquote>
      <p>The report comes amid the US and Turkey dialogue about Turkey's purchases of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911131077298272-trump-offered-erdogan-100-bln-deal-in-exchange-for-s-400-resolution-to-us-satisfaction---report/">Russian S-400 air defence systems</a> and American F-35 fifth-generation fighters.</p>
      <p>In July, the United States announced its decision to suspend Turkey's participation in the US-sponsored F-35 fifth-generation fighter programme over Ankara's S-400 deal, adding that the country would be completely removed from the project by late March 2020. The US has repeatedly objected to its NATO ally purchasing the S-400, claiming that the system is incompatible with the alliance's security standards and might compromise the operation of F-35 jets.</p>

It is considered the most expensive weapons program in history, with a projected life cycle cost of between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion, according to published reports.</p>
