      <p>AA Roadwatch have warned that the weather is affecting roads in Carlow, Laois and Offally, in particular on the N80 between Portlaoise and Tullamore.</p>

      <p>Roads are slippy around Kildare and west Wicklow following earlier snowfall, while there is flooding on the N4 Westbound off-ramp at J16 Mullingar centre in Westmeath.</p>
      <p>AA Roadwatch are urging motorists to "remember it takes longer to stop a vehicle on wet or icy roads, so slow down and give extra space to other road users. Only drive through standing water if you know itâ€™s not too deep for your car."</p>
