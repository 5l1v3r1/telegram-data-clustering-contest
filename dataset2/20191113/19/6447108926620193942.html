      <h1>New Stardew Valley update will add end-game content, quality of life improvements</h1>

      <p>Stardew Valley is one of those very rare indie gems that continues to surprise us, even years after its original launch. Having recently announced that he will be self-publishing the game on nearly all available platforms, developer Eric Barone (better known to the world as “ConcernedApe”) has outlined his plans for Stardew Valley’s upcoming 1.4 update.</p>

      <p>This newest update will be available to PC players on November 26th before making its way to the mobile and console versions of the game. Barone didn’t give too much away though says that 1.4 will deliver new end-game content for fans with a variety of new things to do. Not only that, it has allowed him to go back and tidy up certain parts of Stardew Valley which have continued to irk him, stating:</p>
      <blockquote>One of my main goals with 1.4 was to finally “polish” the game to the degree that I’ve always wanted. What I mean by that is that I wanted to fix all the bugs that have been lingering in the game, to fix a lot of weird or annoying things about the controls &amp; feel of the game, and add in a lot of “quality of life” features that will make the game more seamless to play. I feel pretty confident that this goal has been met!</blockquote>
      <p>Those who have been tending to their farms on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One may feel slightly out of the loop. These two versions have only just been patched to version 1.3 which Barone apologises for, pointing out how quicker and more convenient it is to roll out PC updates. He promises that, in future, there won’t be as much of a delay though Stardew Valley die hards wanting to get their grubby hands on new content as it goes live are better off on PC.</p>
      <p>This much loved farming sim doesn’t seem to be losing steam and hopefully 1.4 will have plenty of surprises in store for us later this month.</p>
