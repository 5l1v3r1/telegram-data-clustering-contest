      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/china.html">China</a>'s largest carmaker, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd, wants to triple its overseas auto sales to one million units by 2025, a senior company official said on Wednesday, as more Chinese auto manufacturers seek sales growth globally.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai-based company, which sold around seven million vehicles last year with its brands and through joint ventures with Volkswagen and General Motors, makes up just under a quarter of China's auto market, the world's largest.</p>
