      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> Santa Cruz compact pickup was confirmed for production today, perhaps in an effort to get ahead of next week's <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/la-auto-show/">L.A. Auto Show</a> news wave. Hyundai also announced its first truck for the North American market will be built, starting in 2021, in its assembly plant in Montgomery, Ala. Doing so will require a $410 million expansion of the facility, which currently builds the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/sonata/">Sonata</a> and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/hyundai/elantra/">Elantra</a>. In the present political climate, Hyundai was keen to note that the project "will add 1,200 new direct and indirect jobs." </p>
      <p>Like the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/ridgeline/">Honda Ridgeline</a>, Hyundai confirmed that the Santa Cruz will be a unibody pickup, going so far as even dubbing it a "<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/crossover/">crossover</a>." In the words of the press release, "Santa Cruz is for those who want all the traditional attributes of a compact utility vehicle, but need the day-to-day versatility of an open bed. It's the crossover that creates a whole new segment that successfully combines capability and utility to meet the unspoken needs of a new generation of buyers, especially Millennials." </p>
      <p>Digging through that, the "whole new segment" and "compact" bits would imply that the Santa Cruz will be smaller than the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/ridgeline/">Ridgeline</a>, and possibly the rest of the Colorado/<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/toyota/tacoma/">Tacoma</a>/<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/ford/ranger/">Ranger</a> segment that is now typically considered midsize.</p>
      <p>The Hyundai Santa Cruz concept truck, pictured above, was first shown at the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/detroit+2015/">2015 Detroit Auto Show</a>. As production is set to begin in 2021, it seems likely that it'll be a 2022 model and that we should see the production version some time next year. </p>
