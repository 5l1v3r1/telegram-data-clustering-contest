      <p>An appeals court has found former Premier League player Dickson Etuhu guilty of attempting to fix a match in Sweden's top division, overturning the verdict of a lower court.</p>
      <p>STOCKHOLM: An appeals court has found former Premier League player Dickson Etuhu guilty of attempting to fix a match in Sweden's top division, overturning the verdict of a lower court.</p>
      <p>The case centred on allegations that the 37-year-old Etuhu, who has played for Manchester City, Norwich, Sunderland, Fulham and Blackburn as well as Swedish club AIK, conspired together with another man to offer former team-mate Kyriakos "Kenny" Stamatopoulos money to fix a game between AIK and IFK Gothenburg in spring 2017.</p>

      <p>"What preceded the meeting and what was said at the meeting must be seen in a context. In the opinion of the court, Kenny Stam has clearly been offered an improper benefit," the Court Of Appeal in Stockholm said in its judgment published on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It fined Etuhu and ordered him to serve a period of probation.</p>
      <p>The Stockholm District court originally found Etuhu, a former Nigeria international, not guilty, deciding that there was not enough evidence of a concrete monetary offer being made to Stamatopoulos, AIK's reserve goalkeeper at the time.</p>
