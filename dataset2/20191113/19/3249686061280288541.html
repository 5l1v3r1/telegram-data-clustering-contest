      <p><b>Big Bang's "Fantastic Baby" </b>has been plagiarized by an Indian Telugu movie titled '<b>Mr. Pellikoduku</b>' and it was uploaded on YouTube back on September 30, 2013.</p>

      <p>This is completely wrong. They used the whole chorus and didn't even bother to remove<b> G-Dragon</b>'s voice in the intro. As a VIP I am completely annoyed and angry. It's one thing to be inspired by others, but it's a completely different matter when you choose to simply steal someone's else work. This is just downright wrong.</p>
