      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:03:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Debbie Hall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/debbie-hall/</a></address>
      <p>A 76-year-old charity champion pulled out the stops to raise over £4000.</p>
      <p>John Thompson from Livingston has picked a charity every year for the past 46 years and each time throws himself into fundraising through activities like walking and swimming.</p>
      <p>Over the years he has raised tens of thousands for organisations including the British Legion, Poppy Scotland and Help for Heroes.</p>
      <p>For the last eight years John has been helping West Lothian’s schools for children with additional needs as well as centres for adults with special needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>He has also raised money for six day care centres for elderly and dementia patients and most recently abseiled from the Forth Road Bridge for Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland.</p>
      <p>This year John decided to help prostate cancer charities and organised a 10-mile sponsored walk and other activities that saw him hand over £848 to the West Lothian Prostate Cancer Support Group and £3445 to Prostate Cancer UK Scotland.</p>
      <p>Charlie Hogg, leader of the local support group, said: “During his year of fundraising, John received donation support from some West Lothian councillors and great support from his links with the military charities and the British Legion from his days in the army.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>“The funds for Prostate UK will be used in Scotland to continue to support prostate cancer research projects at Heriot Watt University and at the Beatson Research Unit in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“The West Lothian Prostate Cancer Support Group will use their funds to continue to publicise the work they do to offer help to those men newly diagnosed to fully understand all about various treatments they may be offered and about the various side effects.</p>
      <p>“The group has also recently started to publicise their new ladies group as partners can be left out from the cancer discussions as men do not explain what is happening and this group helps them to understand what is going on so they can fully support their partner.”</p>
      <p>John, who lives at Craigengar Park, Livingston, said: “I have been collecting funds for charities for the last 46 years.</p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>“Last year I had a medical problem and went to the doctors as I thought it  was prostate cancer but the doctor  gave me the all-clear and that was  when I decided I would do a 10-mile walk for prostate cancer charities.</p>
      <p>“My brother Pat was with me on the walk to keep me company and it was hard and painful but we made it to the end.”</p>
