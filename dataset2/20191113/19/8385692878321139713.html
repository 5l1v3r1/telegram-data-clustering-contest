      <p>This is going to be the perfect gift for any little girl on your holiday shopping list.</p>
      <p>Walmart is offering up a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">bundle</a> of the Google Home Mini and the Frozen II book for just $25. Now the Home Mini would typically cost you $50 by itself, so this is a pretty good deal.</p>
      <p>These two are being bundled together because Google can read along with you on a number of books and this is one of those books. So you can read along with the Google Assistant, or your child can as well. And this is going to help teach them how to read. That's always a really cool thing, when you can actually get something that's educational and still fun.</p>

      <p>This feature does work on a number of other Little Golden Books.</p>
      <p>With the Google Home Mini, not only can you read along with the Google Assistant, but you can also ask it questions. Like how's the weather today, who's the president of the United States, or asking about today's news headlines. You can also control your smart home products with the Google Home Mini. So if you have a Nest Hello or some smart light bulbs, you can control all of that with the Google Assistant, which is a really cool feature.</p>
      <p>So this is a gift that isn't just great for your kids, but it's also great for you as the parent. And with the holidays right around the corner, it's never too early to start shopping for holiday presents. You don't want to wait til the last minute to get something for your kids either.</p>
