      <h1>Jessica Helgerson uses "moody, green, lush" palette for Portland home renovation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:00:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/bridget-cogley/" target="_blank">Bridget Cogley</a></address>
      <p>Interior designer Jessica Helgerson has overhauled a home in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/portland/">Portland</a>, Oregon to include decorative ceilings, floral wallpaper and shades of green and grey that evoke its rainy, cool climate.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.jhinteriordesign.com/">Helgerson</a> designed the transformation to retain the architectural charm and enliven rooms of NW Johnson Street, a two-storey home that was built in the Pacific Northwest city in 1907.</p>

      <p>The property had previously been subdivided into apartments, and then returned back to a single home, which left a number of issues with the layout.</p>
      <p>"Although the house had been restored to a single-family dwelling by the time our clients purchased it, there were still clear signs of its former incarnation â€“ namely an awkwardly placed backstair that made for unnecessary circulation and an odd phone booth space just off of the main stair landing," Helgerson said.</p>

      <p>The designer removed the staircase and replaced it with a new one in the centre. She also opened up the kitchen to a dining room, and added a master bath in replace of a former balcony on the first level.</p>
      <p>Four bedrooms, bathrooms and a study are now located on the first floor, while the ground level accommodates a family room at one end and a living room anchored by a pink sofa on the other.</p>

      <p>The kitchen and dining room are set in the centre of the home. It inlcudes a built-in cabinet with glass doors that acts as a divide between two rooms. Nearby is a pantry, powder room, bar nook and the house's entrance.</p>
      <p>Helgerson added a number of custom elements throughout NW Johnson Street to bring back the character of the property.</p>

      <p>"We layered on architectural elements like coffered ceilings, columns and ceiling rosettes to dress up a house that lacked a lot of the charm and character that we typically associate with older homes," she said.</p>

      <p>This is complemented by a grey-green colour palette and different floral wallpapers that characterise the interiors. "Our aesthetic direction for the house was to create 'an ode to the Pacific Northwest'," Helgerson added.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"The palette is moody, green, lush, mossy and heavy on the western walnut, while the decorative lighting and furnishings are markedly modern and playful, which suits the youthful, forward-thinking character of our clients and their kids," she added.</p>

      <p>Green hues are used heavily throughout, from a shade of paint on the oven, the colour of the dining stools and a built-in daybed, to teal cabinets and armchairs in a dark sage.</p>
      <p>Dark wood is intended to provide a link to the outdoors, while also warming the cool tones of the house. It is seen on kitchen counters, the floors, a bathroom vanity, bed frames and dining room furniture.</p>

      <p>In the kitchen, pale greyish-blue cabinets are complemented by tiled walls with a leafy print of sword ferns, painted by Helgerson's colleague and senior project designer Mira Eng-Goetz.</p>
      <p>"The mural is a way to create a garden view in a room with windows that look out onto the facade of a neighbouring apartment building," said Helgerson.</p>
      <p>"The tiles even continue over the built-in fridge to achieve a seamless fern-scape throughout the room."</p>

      <p>Additional rooms in the house have cream walls, window trim and moulding that soften the otherwise grey aesthetic, while accent pieces are in soft pink, golden and rust tones.</p>
