      <h1>A Match Ban And Kshs 6.5 Million Fine For Man City’s Bernardo Silva Over ‘Racist’ Tweet</h1>

      <p>Manchester City forward Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first-team match and fined Kshs 6.5million for his tweet relating to team-mate Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>Silva compared Mendy to the character on a packet of Conguitos — a sweet brand available in Spain and Portugal.</p>
      <p>The Portugal player, 25, must also complete a face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3.</p>
      <p>Silva deleted the post 46 minutes after he published it before tweeting: “Can’t even joke with a friend these days.”</p>
      <p>There was no hearing after Silva admitted the charge, and acknowledged some people may be offended by the “historical connotations of the Conguitos character”.</p>

      <p>The report from the FA commission said: “The player did not himself intend the post to be insulting or in any way racist.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that the tweet was intended to be no more than a joke between close friends.</p>
      <p>“However, this was not a private jocular communication between two friends.</p>
      <p>“The post was on a social media platform exposed to the 600,000 followers of a high-profile and well-respected professional footballer.”</p>
      <p>Silva will be ineligible for City’s Premier League home match against Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
