      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Attorneys for porn star Stormy Daniels are challenging a request by President Donald Trump's lawyers to stake claim to a settlement between Daniels and Ohio's capital city.</p>
      <p>A federal judge last year said Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, must pay Trump nearly $293,000 for his attorneys' fees and another $1,000 in sanctions after her defamation suit against him was dismissed.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the city of Columbus reached a $450,000 settlement with Daniels over the porn actress' arrest at a strip club in 2018. Trump's lawyers noted in filing to the court involved in the Columbus judgment last week that Clifford owes him $293,052.</p>
      <p>Daniels' attorneys said in a Wednesday filing that Clifford has an active appeal in her defamation suit and Trump's request should be deemed "null and void."</p>
