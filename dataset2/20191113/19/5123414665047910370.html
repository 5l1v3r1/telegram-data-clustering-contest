      <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/blumeysc">Blumey</a> comes correct on his forthcoming EP via the label <a href="https://soundcloud.com/natural_selektion">Natural Selection</a>, roping in both Noble and King Monday to remix one of the track's "Whale Talk." A young producer that makes various sounds across the 140 spectrum, Blumey focuses on the more darker elements of dubstep &amp; 140 music. We were given the chance to premiere the original track "Whale Talk," which you can listen too below.</p>

      <p>You need the slowest of skank's for this one. It's a production that evolves really well and if you know me, you know thats the kind of criteria I look for within music. Blumey starts the track with an eerie intro. The drop is industrial, almost robotic and a low-end sub surrounds it. Throughout the production a piercing snare can be heard cutting through the sub. On the second drop, the switch up is minimal yet weighty. The industrial textures die away and it turns into more of a militant dubstep track. Fully rate this from Blumey. The entire EP will be available towards the end of November.  </p>
