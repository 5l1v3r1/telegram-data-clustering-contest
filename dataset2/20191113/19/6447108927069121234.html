      <h1>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds 5.2 update improves Vikendi, adds spike traps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:53:59+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Aran Suddi</a></address>
      <p>PUBG Corp has confirmed what players can expect to see in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds update 5.2. It’s quite a large update added the new spike trap item which can puncture the tyres of any vehicle, though it is a one time use only item. A new system called PUBG Labs is being added and here players can give feedback on new features the developers are working on including new modes, rule sets, and locations.</p>
      <p>The Vikendi map has been updated as well with new roads so it is easier to travel around, and the river has also frozen to also allow for easier movement. The mountain has been shrunk and some buildings have been removed or replaced so there’s a better gameplay experience. When it comes to bug fixes the safe zone will appear in different locations, and the spectator view should no longer be forced to look downwards in certain situations.</p>
      <p>The update list is massive so prepare for a bit of a read.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>PUBG Update 5.2</summary>
        <p> </p>
        <p>
          <b>New Item: Spike Trap</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Spike Traps puncture the tires of any vehicle that runs over the strip of spikes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A Spike Trap can only damage one vehicle before it disappears.</li>
              <li>Spike Traps puncture the tires of vehicles, but do not damage overall vehicle health.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Spike Traps are spawned at rates consistent with other throwables across all maps.</li>
          <li>You can lay a Spike Trap by selecting it and pressing LMB. Once you’ve laid a Spike Trap, you cannot pick it back up.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>New System: PUBG Labs</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>PUBG Labs is a space where we introduce to you experimental in-game features and collect your feedback to perfect them as permanent game additions.</li>
          <li>You can find PUBG Labs in the menu under the Play button.</li>
          <li>PUBG Labs will continue to be updated with new content. Play modes, new rule sets and maybe even some new vistas to take in down the road.</li>
          <li>The most important for PUBG Labs is your valuable opinions! Please feel free to let our Community Managers know about what you think from your experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>The upcoming experimental content of PUBG Labs</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Skill Based Rating (PC – Live server: Nov 26 – Jan 1 KST / Console – Live server:  Nov 26 – Jan 6 KST)</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Skill Based Rating is an experimental feature being tested through PUBG Labs, tracking your skill and assigning you a rating based on your match performances.</li>
              <li>This Skill Based Rating is separate from the current Survival Title System.</li>
              <li>
                <p>Ratings will be applied for each mode based on players’ skill level. To see your rating, you must first play 5 matches.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>After you finish 5 rating-evaluation matches, your rating going forward will be adjusted based on factors such as kills and overall placement in matches.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You can leave feedback about the changes to your rating after the end of each match, so we can gauge how the system feels.</li>
              <li>
                <p>For one week after the Skill Based Rating test ends, all players who participated can share their feedback via an in-game survey.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Feedback period</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>PC: 1/2 – 1/9 KST<br/>Console: 1/7 – 1/14 KST</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Improved terrain</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>New roads have been added to reduce the difficulty of moving through certain snow-covered areas of Vikendi.</li>
          <li>Along with the roads added, the amount of vehicles across the map have increased and locations adjusted.</li>
          <li>A cold front has moved in and the river around Castle has frozen over to allow you to navigate that area more easily.</li>
          <li>Located at the center of Vikendi, Mount Kreznic consists of various terrain types which are difficult to navigate, due to how steep the mountain is. To improve this, the overall height of the mountain has been lowered. <i>Yes, we shrunk the mountain, but just a bit.</i></li>
          <li>Vikendi terrain in many areas is very flat, making it difficult for players to hide or take cover when encountering enemies. To improve this, we’ve added more variance to terrain height  in areas across the map.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Improved towns in Vikendi</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A few of Vikendi’s towns were seldom visited due to complex structures or not enough loot. We’ve made some adjustments to the following areas:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Volnova has been reshaped in general. Major buildings and driving routes have been modified.</li>
              <li>Item spawn counts in Peshkova have increased.</li>
              <li>Garages where vehicles are spawned in Trevno have been relocated to allow easier escape after looting. <i>So get to stepping. </i></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Some buildings have been removed or replaced with different buildings to improve gameplay. The field of vision gained from high buildings has been adjusted, through structural changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Improved gameplay balance</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Blue Zone balance on Vikendi has been adjusted so that players can set up strategies using more varied routes.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>The size of early safe zones has increased.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Speed of early Blue Zones has increased.</li>
                  <li>The size and speed of mid and late-game Blue Zones remain similar to previous updates.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The randomness of Blue Zone locations throughout the match has slightly increased.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>To reflect player feedback on insufficient vehicle spawns on Vikendi, we’ve signifcantly increased the overall number of  vehicle spawns.</li>
          <li>The location of vehicle spawns has been modified in accordance to the new Blue Zone balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Gameplay</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Way Point feature has been added to allow you to make strategic plans for the routes you take.</li>
          <li>You can use the feature only when the map is open (M key).</li>
          <li>Press ALT+RMB to place the first point and while ALT is held, you may click other locations to add more points. You may release ALT to remove the starting point.</li>
          <li>You can place up to 4 points per group of Way Points.</li>
          <li>Press ALT+Del to remove placed Way Points. When you place a new starting point somewhere else, the existing Way Points will all disappear.</li>
          <li>In Duo/Squad Mode, when a teammate places Way Points, they will appear on the map with a Radio Message. You can change the settings to not display the Way Point of certain teammates from the in-game Team Management menu.</li>
