      <p>This is the epic rematch 'Jeopardy!' fans have been waiting for!<br/><br/><a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/jeopardy-james-holzhauers-run-ends-shy-of-record/5327974/">Recording-breaking contestant James Holzhauer</a> and the <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/entertainment/university-of-chicago-librarian-emma-boettcher-wins-another-round-of-jeopardy/5679572/">Chicago librarian</a> who took him down will once again go head to head for the $250,000 grand prize <a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/jeopardy-james-holzhauers-run-ends-shy-of-record/5327974/">in the final round of "Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions"</a> this Thursday and Friday.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/jeopardy-host-alex-trebek-gets-emotional-over-contestants-answer/5691054/">RELATED: 'Jeopardy!' host Alex Trebek gets emotional over contestant's answer</a></b><br/><br/>In June, Holzhauer, known to fans as "Jeopardy James," scored the highest single-game total 16 times and was inching toward overtaking Ken Jennings' regular-season winnings record.<br/><br/>Yet the seemingly unstoppable Las Vegas professional sports gambler ended his 32-day winning streak just shy of the record thanks to Emma Boettcher, a librarian at the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>Leading into the show, Holzhauer had $2,382,583 in the bank, putting him at a close second behind Jennings' $2,520,700 in regular-season winnings. That means he would have needed to continue winning long enough to earn at least $138,117 to pull into first place.<br/><br/>For those who claimed Boettcher's June win was a fluke, Holzhauer posted on Twitter that "subsequent games won by 'giant killers' who beat a 10+ time #Jeopardy champ: Emma: 4 and counting, 8 others (combined): 0."</p>
