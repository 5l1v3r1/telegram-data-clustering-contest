      <h1>After Salman Khan, now Bigg Boss faces serious allegations of biases as angry fans take to Twitter to vent out frustration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:54:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>Angry fans have taken to social media to slam the makers of Colors TV’s popular reality show, <i>Bigg Boss, </i>of biases in favour of Siddharth Shukla and housemates close to him.  Meanwhile, <i>Bigg Boss </i>took a decisive turn on Wednesday with two known friends in the reality show, Siddharth Shukla and Asim Riaz, reaching a point of no return in their friendship. Their friendship received a further jolt after Asim failed to successfully complete the ‘tunnel’ task.</p>

      <p>Also compounding their friendship were Arhaan Khan, Rashami Desai and Devoleena Bhattacharjee. Arhaan, in particular, was seen provoking Asim against Siddharth. Asim too felt that Siddharth and Aarti were largely responsible for his failure to win the task successfully.</p>
      <p>Later, Arhaan was seen confiding with Rashami that he was confident of removing Asim from Siddharth’s team. This, according to him, will be a game-changer since this had the potential to significantly weaken the rival team.</p>
      <p>Housemates chosen to be the contenders for the next captain’s role were Paras Chhabra, Mahira Sharma, Devoleena and Vishal Aditya Singh. However, what has irked a large number of <i>Bigg Boss </i>fans on social media was the promo broadcast by Colors TV showing the contenders for the captain’s role break a rule.</p>
      <p>According to the promo, the four contestants will face punishment by <i>Bigg Boss. </i>They could possibly face disqualification thereby losing the opportunity to run for the captaincy’s role. As expected, angry fans took to Twitter to allege biases against <i>Bigg Boss.</i></p>

      <p>Earlier, the show’s host Salman Khan had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/huge-row-on-bigg-boss-show-after-salman-fans-trend-besthostsalmankhan-to-counter-allegations-of-biases/272065/">faced allegations</a> of biases in favour of Siddharth Shukla.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rashami too was seen wooing Asim Riaz saying that even she felt that the latter was right on many occasions but she could not express her mind since the two did not talk that frequently.</p>
      <p>Rashami also expressed her displeasure on being linked with Arhaan saying that she planned to get married next year and didn’t want any rumours to spoil her marriage prospects.</p>
