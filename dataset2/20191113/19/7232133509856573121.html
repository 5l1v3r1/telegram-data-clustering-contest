      <h1>Bitcoin Mining Now Consumes A Quarter Percent Of Global Electricity</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin-mining">Bitcoin mining</a> consumes a large amount of energy, and in return for the upfront electricity costs, miners are rewarded with a set amount of BTC for validating each block added to Bitcoin’s blockchain.</p>
      <p>As the crypto asset’s network grows in size and scale, the more electricity required to power the operation. Bitcoin as a network has grown to be so large, it now consumes a quarter percent of the global electricity supply.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Mining Requires Up to 0.25% of the World’s Electrical Supply</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin mining is a complex mathematic process called “proof-of-work.” To ensure legitimacy, each block added to the blockchain must be first validated by this process. As time goes by, the difficulty of mining grows, and it has resulted in the technology required to mine Bitcoin becoming more expensive and powerful.</p>

      <p>In the early days of Bitcoin, mining was as simple as using any normal computer’s CPU. Later on, miners turned to GPUs, and eventually, mining difficulty grew so much that specialty computers designed specifically for mining were created.</p>
      <p>But as the technology required becomes more powerful, the more electricity is required to power the equipment. And as Bitcoin scales, so does the requirement for more and more energy supply.</p>
      <p>It’s now reached the point where <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is consuming as much as 0.25% of the entire world’s supply of electricity – more than many nations.</p>

      <p>This important milestone was shared by Columbia University alum and Managing Partner at Blocktown Capital, James Todaro. The public figure points out the fact that such an achievement solidifies Bitcoin as an important asset and technology that is here to stay, shedding the negative comparisons to things like beanie babies, tulips, or even <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2018/05/06/no-bitcoin-didnt-drop-warren-buffett-compared-rat-poison/">rat poison</a>.</p>
      <p>The usage proves the technology has merit, and in time could grow to be a mainstay among other everyday technologies like computers, refrigerators, and televisions. Televisions, for example, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/improving-tv-efficiency-reduce-world-electricity-use/">utilize as much as 5% to 8% of the global residential electricity supply</a>, and there’s often more than one per household.</p>
      <p>In terms of global adoption, it would <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/09/24/50-of-population-to-use-bitcoin-by-2043-if-crypto-follows-internet-adoption/">take Bitcoin until 2043</a> to be used by as much as 50% of the global population, a feat that the internet is only now achieving, despite widespread use among the mainstream public</p>

      <p>Bitcoin still has a long way to go to ever reach a status like the TV, or the internet, but having grown to consume even a quarter percent of the global electrical supply shows the world that Bitcoin is here to stay, and could someday become an everyday technology just like TVs, the internet, computers, and more.</p>
