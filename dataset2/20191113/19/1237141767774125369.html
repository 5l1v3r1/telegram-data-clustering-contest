      <h1>How This Runner’s World+ Member Inspired Hundreds More to Join Her Favorite Running Group</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:12:25+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author">Gabrielle Hondorp</a></address>
      <p>Jennie Coughlin was always a runner, but it wasn’t until she joined the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/223573647748267/">Sub-30 Club</a> that she truly felt like one.</p>
      <p>Growing up, Coughlin ran high school cross country and track, but quit because of incessant injuries and being the slowest girl on the team. For years she tried to be a consistent runner but remained plagued by injury. “It’s really hard to keep training when you keep getting injured and you don’t have anyone to run with,” Coughlin said. “I tried to restart 12-15 times, but it wasn’t consistent. It was really discouraging.”</p>
      <p>While Coughlin never lost her love of running, she needed something to stoke the fire. She found her inspiration in the Sub-30 club. The group was started by Runner's World contributor <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/author/1113/ted-spiker/">Ted Spiker</a>, who wanted to train with people to break 30 minutes in the 5K. It has since expanded to become a thriving online running community.</p>
      <p>“I had just finished the Wineglass 5K in 2015 and heard about the club so I checked it out. Once I joined, I was immediately blown away by how encouraging they were,” Coughlin said. “The group is so supportive it makes you not be able to leave.”</p>
      <p>Coughlin has since run countless races and continues to advocate for the group. Recently, her <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a29727779/runners-world-member-jennie-coughlin/">Runner’s World+ member profile</a> was shared on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/runnersworldmag/?hl=en"><i>Runner’s World</i> Instagram page</a>, drawing 175 new members to the Sub-30 club since it was posted.</p>

      <p>“I am so excited to grow this group,” Coughlin said. “A misconception is that it is only for people training for a sub-30-minute 5K, and while it started as that, it has become so much more. If you run, you are a runner, and if you are a runner, you are welcome.”</p>
