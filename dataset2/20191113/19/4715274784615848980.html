      <p>This year’s Grand Wine Experience, the biggest wines and spirits event in Southeast Asia, will highlight the story of wine as one legacy. </p>
      <p>Happening on Nov. 15 at the Grand Ballroom of the Marriott Hotel, the 19th GWE, dubbed “Generations,” aims to surpass all previous editions by serving over 700 varieties of wines, spirits, sakes, and beers, alongside a gloriously decadent buffet of unparalleled proportions. </p>

      <p>The event is organized by the Philippine Wine Merchants and Ralph’s Wines and Spirits.</p>
      <p>According to the organizers, “The event will emphasize that winemaking is not just an art, but a tradition passed down from one custodian of the land to another, from one family to the next. Families preserve the reputation and protect the brand and estate. They cultivate and refine the methods and practices handed down to them by their forbears, and bequeath them to their most immediate, most trusted, and most loved.”</p>

      <p>In attendance were Philippine Wine Merchants director Ronald Lim Joseph, Ryan Joseph, Robi Joseph, Marriott Manila F&amp;B director Mo Ali, Resorts World Manila corporate communications director Joee Guilas, and Philippine Wine Merchants director Raymond Lim Joseph. </p>

      <p>For appetizer, we were served Crab and Apple Salad (cherry tomato glaze, pine nut gremolata, avocado mousseline, crème fraiche) which was paired with Freixenet Elyssia Pinot Noir Brut Rosé (a sparkling wine from Spain with nice and fresh aromas of raspberry and strawberry with a hint of mint).  </p>
      <p>It was followed by Smoked Egg Yolk Ravioli Soup (lobster consommé, stuffed morels) paired with a 2016 Haart to Heart, a rich, delicious and elegant, easy to sip Mosel Riesling with plenty of fruit (peaches, blackcurrant, and pineapples).  </p>
