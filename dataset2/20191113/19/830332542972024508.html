      <p>DARLINGTON, Wis. - A county board in southern Wisconsin has backed away from a plan to prosecute journalists over their reporting on a water quality study and discipline elected officials for how they handle information about the research.</p>
      <p>The Lafayette County Board on Tuesday night put off a decision on how to release information about private wells contaminated with fecal matter.</p>
      <p>The board shelved a resolution that said journalists would be prosecuted if they didn't quote a county news release verbatim when reporting on water quality. It also had threatened to punish officials who talked publicly without getting government permission.</p>
      <p>The proposals drew criticism for violating First Amendment protections for freedom of speech.</p>
      <p>The Journal Sentinel says county board Chairman Jack Sauer threatened to throw out critical members of the public at the meeting and accused attendees of being Democrats.</p>
