      <h1>Matildas captain Sam Kerr joins Chelsea in England’s Women’s Super League</h1>

      <p>Sam Kerr says a desire to play in the world’s best women’s soccer league led to her signing a lucrative deal with English heavyweights Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The Matildas captain ended weeks of speculation about her club future, announcing on Wednesday she’s joining Chelsea for the next two-and-a-half years.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old striker is taking a three-week holiday before linking with Chelsea for the second half of the English Women’s Super League (WSL) season.</p>
      <p>‘The WSL is the best league in Europe,” Kerr said in a statement.</p>

      <p>“I want team success and I don’t want it to come easy.</p>
      <p>“I feel Chelsea have been building something special over the years and I want to be a part of that. I want to lift some trophies.”</p>
      <p>Kerr has become the face of Australian women’s soccer since debuting with the Matildas at the age of 15.</p>
      <p>The dynamo played a key role in Australia’s sweep of the just-completed two-game friendly series against Chile – she scored a double in a 2-1 win in game one in Sydney last Saturday, and set up the match winner in a 1-0 triumph in Adelaide on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Kerr had been weighing up her club future since opting against returning to Australia’s domestic W-League and Perth Glory.</p>
      <p>She had been splitting her time each year between Glory from October to April, then Chicago Red Stars in the United States’ National Women’s Soccer League from April to September.</p>
      <p>After Tuesday night’s victory in Adelaide, Kerr conceded the gruelling schedule had led to near-exhaustion.</p>
      <p>She outlined her plans for a three-week holiday, initially in Perth to visit family and then to Bali.</p>
      <p>“I’m really looking forward to a break,” she said post-game.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first time ever I have had scheduled time off where I can go on a holiday and take care of myself.</p>
      <p>“It’s my body – obviously I have been going back and forth (between Australia and the US) – but also my mind. I have been going non-stop.</p>
      <p>“And the Matildas have gained a whole lot of exposure in the last few years so our lives have changed dramatically.</p>
      <p>“It will just be nice to turn off from football and enjoy myself.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s manager Emma Hayes hailed the signing of Kerr for her club.</p>
      <p>“She’s a player that can make things happen but she’s also a fantastic team player,” Hayes said in a statement.</p>
      <p>‘The fact she chose Chelsea when she could have gone to any club in the world is a testament to the players and the staff here, because she saw this is the best place for her to grow and take the next step in her career.”</p>
