      <p>Harry Styles is set to pull <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-harry-styles-to-host-november.html">double duty on <i>Saturday Night Live</i></a><i> </i>this weekend. He’ll be hosting for the first time <i>and </i>musical-guesting for <i>not </i>the first time, having performed on the show as recently as <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/saturday-night-live-recap-jimmy-fallon-harry-styles.html">Jimmy Fallon’s episode in 2017</a> (where he also <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/853457640097185792">showed up in a sketch as Mick Jagger</a>). The show released the first promo for the episode today, where Styles is joined by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/ron-funches-kenan-thompson-snl-underrated-interview.html">cast member Kenan Thompson</a> in a truly beautiful celebration of fall. It’s just Harry, Kenan, a gorgeous tree and pile of autumn leaves, the anticipation of the wonderful and very American holiday of Thanksgiving, and a warm and inviting sense of togetherness — until, of course, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/snl-season-45-writers.html">writer Dan Licata</a> crashes the party in his breakout role as Leaf Blower Guy. “You guys need to leave,” he tells them. “Yeah, leaves!” Styles replies. “We <i>love</i> leaves!”</p>
