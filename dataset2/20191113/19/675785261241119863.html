      <h1>Lionel Messi names the only player he has ever asked to swap shirts</h1>
      <h2>Usually it is his opponents who are desperate to trade jerseys with the Argentinean legend but on one occasion Messi couldn't resist getting one players shirt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:41:55+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Lionel Messi has revealed that he once asked current Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane for his shirt early on in his career at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d'Or winner and Barca captain is regularly asked by his opponents to swap shirts at the end of games but does not make a habit of doing so himself.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old admitted in an interview with <a href="https://www.tycsports.com/">TyC Sports</a> , however, that during one early El Clasico in his career when he came up against Zidane he couldn't resist the opportunity to get the jersey of the 1998 World Cup winner.</p>
      <p>"I don't ask for shirts, I usually swap them, but I asked Zidane once," Messi said.</p>

      <p>"If there is an Argentine I swap it with him, but, unless someone asks me, I'm not asking anyone."</p>
      <p>Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu recently insisted the talismanic <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lionel-messi-promise-made-barcelona-20860072">Messi would remain at the Catalan club for at least the next five years</a> after it emerged there is a clause in his current deal that would allow him to leave at the end of the season, prompting rumours he could be set for a Nou Camp exit.</p>
      <p>Bartomeu said: “Ultimately it is he who must decide. He has earned the right to decide when he will stop playing football. But like he said a few weeks ago, he wants to finish his playing career at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>“Over the next two or three seasons our leader will continue to be Leo Messi. There’s no doubt that he is still young, still strong. He is still ambitious.</p>

      <p>“So Leo Messi will still play with us for the next two, three, four or five years. I have no doubts about that.”</p>
      <p>Barcelona currently top La Liga on goal difference, tied on 25 points with their bitter rivals Madrid, and Messi has scored eight goals in seven matches so far in the division.</p>
