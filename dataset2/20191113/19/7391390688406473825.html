      <p>Festive attire, swoon-worthy romances, epiphanies about the true meaning of Christmas — it must be a holiday movie. The <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/13/romany-malco-trailer-netflix-holiday-rush/">trailer for Netflix's new Christmas movie <i>Holiday Rush</i></a> checks all the boxes of the genre, and packs an extra punch of the feels courtesy of two TV stars fans are bound to recognize. <i>Holiday Rush</i> brings together stars from <i>A Million Little Things</i> and <i>Walking Dead</i>, creating a crossover you never knew you needed.</p>
      <p>In the trailer, Romany Malco, best known for playing Rome Howard on <i>A Million Little Things</i>, takes on the role of popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=118&amp;v=c2U6diYTnxA&amp;feature=emb_logo">New York radio DJ Rush Williams</a>, who has been doing everything he can to spoil his four kids in the wake of their mother's death. However, life throws his family a curveball when he loses his job right before Christmas, forcing them to say goodbye to their "boujie" lifestyle and downsize to a simpler way of life. Add in a budding romance with producer Roxy Richardson, played by <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Sonequa Martin-Green, and you've got an epic holiday romance.</p>
      <p>Obviously, <i>Holiday Rush</i> is a far cry from zombie attacks and outer space adventures, but it should pack the type of emotional punch that <i>A Million Little Things</i> fans should love. Like any good Christmas movie, the story is bound to hit your right in the feels, so make sure to have a few tissues on hand just in case.</p>

      <p>Of course, <i>Holiday Rush</i>, which is slated to hit the streaming service on Nov. 28, is just the latest in a long line of current and upcoming <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/netflixs-holiday-movies-tv-show-lineup-includes-a-christmas-prince-3-19215791">holiday-related movies to hit Netflix</a> this year. Other titles include <i>Holiday in the Wild</i>, <i>Let It Snow</i>, <i>The Knight Before Christmas</i>, <i>A Christmas Prince: The Royal Baby</i>, and <i>Klaus</i>, just to name a few. If that isn't a reason to stay curled up on the couch all winter long, then what is?</p>
