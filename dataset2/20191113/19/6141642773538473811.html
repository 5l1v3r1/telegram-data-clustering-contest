      <p>Stella Creasy has hit back at an anti-abortion party who are focusing their general election campaign on unseating her.</p>
      <p>The Labour candidate for Walthamstow, a vocal campaigner for abortion rights, called the Christian Peoples Alliance a party which “promotes hatred in many forms”, after it emerged they were campaigning for the sitting MP’s seat.</p>
      <p>CPA leader Sidney Cordle told the PA news agency that although the party was “concentrating” on the seat in north-east London, they are expected to stand about 30 candidates.</p>
      <p>He added: “This time the majority are in and around London, we’ve got one person standing in Birmingham.”</p>
      <p>It comes after Ms Creasy, who is heavily pregnant, supported efforts to bring about a change in the law to see abortion decriminalised in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>She was targeted by a group calling itself the Centre For Bioethical Reform UK and a billboard poster was put up in her constituency by the group, with an image of a foetus and a link to a website called Stop Stella.</p>
      <p>Mr Cordle said the party was working with CBR UK on the election campaign, as well as other Christian organisations who he declined to name.</p>
      <p>He said CBR UK was “very keen” to have a candidate in the upcoming general election and had asked CPA to stand in Walthamstow, adding: “They said they would help us with the campaign.”</p>
      <p>Deborah Longe, a 19-year-old law student, is the candidate CPA are standing in Walthamsthow.</p>
      <p>“We have an excellent candidate who, if she’s elected, will be the youngest member of Parliament because she’s only 19,” Mr Cordle told PA.</p>
      <p>“She’s the Greta Thunberg of abortion, she’s a young lady with passion and enthusiasm for what she believes in, and that’s why we’re putting her up.”</p>
      <p>Referring to the CBR via an article on Twitter reported by HuffPost, Ms Creasy wrote: “This party promotes hatred in many forms-whether women’s human rights, LGBTQ rights, of Islam or the EU. They also can’t even spell Walthamstow.</p>
      <p>“If have to crawl out hospital bed with a newborn in tow, nothing will stop me fighting their divisive politics coming to our hometown!”</p>
