      <p>For the last two Orlando Pirates matches, Abel Mabaso has been used in what is becoming Orlando Pirates’ problem position at right back. Will he solve their woes on that side or will Mthokozisi Dube return to the XI against Polokwane City? </p>

      <p>Since the beginning of the 2018-19 season, Orlando Pirates have struggled to settle on a first choice right back, trying a plethora of different options in that role. This is in stark contrast to the left side where Innocent Maela has been a model of consistency, with Paseka Mako impressing of late when called upon.</p>
      <p>Last season, Milutin Sredojevic used five different players in that position during the league campaign, such was Pirates’ issue in the right back area. In the transfer window before this season began, three of those fullbacks were offloaded by the club. Thabo Matlaba was released and joined Black Leopards, Abbubaker Mobara was let go and joined Cape Town City, and Diamond Thopola was sent to Chippa United on loan. </p>

      </p>
      <p>This season, the club entered the campaign with Mthokozisi Dube, Asavela Mbekile and exciting teenager, Thabiso Monyane – converted from a forward into a right back – as their main options for that position. However, Dube has missed most of the season with a shoulder problem, Mbekile has not done enough to impress, and Monyane has been inconsistent, as youngsters often are.</p>
      <p>That has seen Pirates try Siphesihle Ndlovu in that role on three occasions whilst Abel Mabaso has played each of the last two games whilst Dube has been suspended. Now that the latter’s ban is over, Rulani Mokwena will have a big call to make. </p>

        <b>Why did Pirates Sign Mabaso?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Early in his career, Mabaso was a very exciting and attacking right back at Mamelodi Sundowns, Mpumalanga Black Aces and Maritzburg United. He was always considered a player who was comfortable in midfield too, and when he joined Chippa United, he had the best season of his career as a central midfielder.</p>
      <p>That season, he made 32 appearances and scored four goals and did not play at right back even once. It was that form that prompted Pirates to sign him. However, he struggled to get much game time in midfield and could now be considered a possible solution to Pirates’ troubles on the right side of the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stats</b>
      </p>
      <p>Against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday, Mabaso made a game-high three tackles in a solid performance. Against Maritzburg United, both of his crosses reached a teammate and he attempted 87 passes, the most in Bucs’ team. </p>
