      <h1>Jennifer Nettles’ Calls Out Country Radio At Female-Focused CMA Awards: ‘Play Our F*@#!n Records’</h1>

      <p>Jennifer Nettles sure knows how to make a fashion statement — or, rather, how to make a statement with fashion.</p>
      <p>The Sugarland singer hit the red carpet of Wednesday’s CMA Awards making a bold fashion move to push for female equality in country music. Nettles chose a white Christian Siriano pantsuit featuring the words “Equal Play.” She accessorized with a hot-pink train displaying a female Venus symbol and “Play Our F*@#iN Records Please &amp; Thank You” written across it.</p>

      <p>That’s a significant statement to make at this particular edition of the CMAs, which is focusing specifically on female artists while bringing together three of them — Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Reba McEntire — together to host. The awards show is making history with it being the first time women are nominated in every single category, with one exception – Male Vocalist of the Year.</p>
      <p>Miranda Lambert has been among the female country artists to call attention to country radio’s disparity between the frequency that male artists are played in comparison to females.</p>

      <p>“It’s B.S., straight up! Carrie Underwood still struggles, and that just blows my mind because she’s got a million hits and she’s Carrie Freakin’ Underwood,” Lambert told <i><a href="https://www.redbookmag.com/life/interviews/a52629/miranda-lambert-friendship-rules/">Redbook</a></i>. “I tell them at the radio stations, ‘Just play one of us; it doesn’t have to be me. Then we all win.’ I’ll fight for it until I can’t no more.”</p>
      <p>The 53rd annual <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/540493/livestream-watch-the-53rd-annual-cma-awards-red-carpet/">CMA Awards</a> take place on Wednesday, Nov. 13.</p>
