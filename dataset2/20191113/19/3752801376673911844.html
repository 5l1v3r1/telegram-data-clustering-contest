      <p>Military police surrounded Venezuela's embassy in Brazil on Wednesday as rival supporters of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and President Nicolas Maduro faced off inside in a struggle for control of the diplomatic compound.</p>
      <p>Embassy officials opened the doors to Guaido's appointed ambassador Teresa Belandria after recognizing the opposition leader as president, the envoy said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear which side was in control of the embassy.</p>
      <p>The last Maduro-appointed ambassador to Brazil was withdrawn in 2016.</p>
      <p>Belandria said officials inside the embassy delivered "voluntarily the diplomatic headquarters to the legitimately accredited representation in Brazil" early on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Upon entering the headquarters, we could verify that a group of officials was living in the official residence," Belandria said.</p>
      <p>"We request all accredited officials at the embassy and in the 7 Venezuelan consulates, adopt this same decision."</p>
      <p>Freddy Mergote, a senior embassy official loyal to Maduro, said "strangers to our facilities are entering and are violating the Venezuelan territory," according to a voice recording sent to Brazil's left-wing Workers Party (PT) and shared with AFP.</p>
      <p>"We need help, we need the immediate activation of all social movements and political parties," Mergote said.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the Venezuelan president yelled "Viva Maduro."</p>
      <p>Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza condemned what he described as an invasion of the embassy.</p>
      <p>"We hold the Government of Brazil responsible for the safety of our staff and facilities," Arreaza tweeted.</p>
      <p>"It is a delicate situation," said Paulo Pimenta, a member of PT, in a voice recording sent to AFP via WhatsApp. Pimenta said he was among 10 Brazilians to enter the embassy in the morning.</p>
      <p>The stand-off could not come at a worse time for Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who is hosting the BRICS summit a short distance from the Venezuelan embassy.</p>
      <p>Brazil is among dozens of countries to recognize Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader, but BRICS titans China and Russia back Maduro.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro is due to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping at the foreign ministry Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro - an ardent admirer of US President Donald Trump with whom he shares a contempt for multilateralism and left-wing ideology - is under pressure from Brazil's powerful beef, farming and mining sectors to stay on good terms with China, the Latin American country's biggest trade partner.</p>
      <p>The BRICS summit will be the first time Bolsonaro, notoriously awkward at public events, has hosted a major international gathering since he took office in January.</p>
