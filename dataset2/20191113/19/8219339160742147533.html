      <h1>Phil Schiller says SD card slot and other ports ‘probably not’ ever returning to MacBook Pro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:37:05+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Along with the debut of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple SVP Phil Schiller shared more about <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard/">designing the scissor switch Magic Keyboard</a> for the notebook, how pros’ top request was to have a physical escape key, and more in an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/16-inch-macbook-pro-magic-keyboard/">interview with <i>CNET</i></a>. YouTuber Jonathan Morrison was also able to sit down with Schiller and dive into some questions including the new thermal system, six-speaker setup, and even whether Apple will ever bring back the SD card reader to the MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=KjfxcL1S8Dc&amp;feature=emb_logo">Jonathan covered</a> a range of topics with Phil Schiller but one of the more interesting moments was when he asked, “Do you think there’s ever a chance that the SD card slot makes a comeback?”</p>
      <p>Schiller replied:</p>
      <blockquote>“Probably not, again nothing about the future is in stone, and things can always change. But, as we’ve been spending a lot of time with MacBook Pro surveying what our customers use, what I/O they need, where their needs are growing and how they are changing, and did a lot of soul searching on it and asking ourselves about a lot of connectors about USB-A about SD card readers, about HDMI and requestioning everything. And really what we came down to is more and more customers are taking advantage of USB-C and Thunderbolt, love the incredible headroom in performance there is there, the higher power there is, the charging ability there is, and so we think having on the highest-end notebook four USB-C/Thunderbolt ports gives the most headroom for the things you will be doing in the years ahead. And the trade-off is for a few traditional media types like SD card readers means using an adapter but there are USB-C adapters, I carry one for that. And ultimately, that gives you the highest performance and most flexibility with this arrangement. So after a lot of soul searching, we think we’ve done the best thing for customers with the I/O we have, meaning we don’t have every port type in the world on it.”</blockquote>
      <p>When asked about the new six-speaker system that works with Dolby Atmos, Schiller said:</p>
      <blockquote>“And you just can’t believe the speakers in a notebook are producing that sound. And it’s very related to your position of where you are in front of it.”</blockquote>
      <p>Another interesting aspect of this interview, the entire thing was recorded with the new mics on the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>Jonathan also asked about Apple coming in with a starting price point around $600 lower than expectations.</p>
      <blockquote>“Our intention all along was to replace the 15 with the 16 and try to deliver a lot more at the same price point. And it wasn’t always clear that we could but it’s always been the goal to do that.”</blockquote>
      <p>To end the interview, Schiller spoke about Apple’s commitment not only to pros around Macs but also to Macs overall.</p>
