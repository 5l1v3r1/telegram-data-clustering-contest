      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/supreme-court/?tps=1">Supreme Court</a> <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg/?tps=1">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> was absent during oral arguments before the high court bench on Wednesday due to illness, Chief Justice <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Roberts/?tps=1">John Roberts</a> said.</p>
      <p>From the bench, Roberts <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/470241-ginsburg-misses-supreme-court-arguments-due-to-illness">said Ginsburg was</a> "indisposed due to illness," but offered no details. He added that she would rely on written briefs and audio recordings to keep up with the cases. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-illness-supreme-court/index.html">court spokeswoman</a> later said Ginsburg was at home with a stomach bug.</p>
      <p>The court was scheduled to hear oral arguments on two cases Wednesday, including a $20 billion racial discrimination case, <i>Comcast Corporation v. National Association of African American-Owned Media</i>.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg, 86, attended every court session in her 25-year tenure until she missed a session in January following surgery to remove cancerous nodules from her lung. In August, the court said she was undergoing treatment for a "tumor on her pancreas." She previously was treated for colon and pancreatic cancer.</p>
      <p>Ginsburg is regarded as the leader of the court's liberal wing.</p>
      <p>The Wednesday session was the court's last this month. Justices will hold a private meeting on Friday, and meet again on Monday, but no arguments are scheduled. Case arguments will resume on Dec. 2.</p>
