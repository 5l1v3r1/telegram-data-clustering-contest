      <h1>Fido sending out bonus 5GB to some subscribers for free</h1>
      <h2>It's hard to imagine why a carrier would be giving out free data</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T19:04:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>A user posted on the <a href="https://forums.redflagdeals.com/fido-targeted-fido-5-extra-gb-free-2-years-2328473/">Red Flag Deals forums</a> and mentioned that Fido offered them 5GB of extra data for free for two years.</p>
      <p>The user states that they’re on a 10GB for $65 bring your own device plan. The plan was originally a 10GB for $60 holiday promotion from two years ago.</p>
      <p>The text from the carrier says, “Hi, it’s Fido: Great news! We added a 5GB monthly data bonus to your current plan for the next two years. This is an exclusive offer just for you to thank you for being a Fido customer. You don’t have to do anything — the extra data is already on your account. Questions? Visit <a href="http://www.fido.ca/contactus">www.fido.ca/contactus</a> for a list of ways you can reach us.”</p>
      <p>So far, no one else has commented on the thread, so it’s hard to gauge how widespread this offer is. Although, this is very similar to a deal that Rogers offered some of its<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/07/rogers-offering-5gb-monthly-data-free/"> subscribers on November 7th.</a></p>
      <p>It’s likely that this is a preemptive move on Fido’s part given this holiday/Black Friday season carriers are likely going to be offering deals on their plans that hover around the $65 mark.</p>
      <p><i>MobileSyrup </i>has reached out to Rogers for more information regarding this offer.</p>
