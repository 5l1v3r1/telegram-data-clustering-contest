      <h1>PETA releasing 'Wool Hurts' Christmas sweater with 3D 'bruised and bloodied' plush sheep</h1>

      <p>PETA isn’t sheepish about its hatred of wool — at least not judging by its newest apparel offering, which features a "bloodied" plush sheep hanging from it.</p>

      <p>The limited-edition <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle">item</a>, which was designed around the popular <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty">ugly Christmas sweater trend</a>, comes in seasonally-appropriate green with red and white designs adorning torso and sleeves. However, in a decidedly unfestive design, the words “Wool Hurts” are emblazoned on the front and a large “bruised and bloodied plush” sheep protrudes from the front and back.</p>

      <p>The controversial animal rights organization calls the look “a show-stopping, conversation-starting” feature that goes “where no sweater has gone before” and promises to give the sweater's wearers “a chance to join in on the holiday fun while making a statement for animals at the same time.”</p>
      <p>The alleged fun-time-having sweater is made of 100-percent acrylic yarn and produced in Germany. According to the PETA website, the holiday item will be shipping the week of Nov. 25 — possibly just in time for Thanksgiving.</p>
