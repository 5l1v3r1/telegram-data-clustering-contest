      <p>Between 1.1 million and 1.9 million children and teens have a concussion every year. It's an all too common injury that needs to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>For years, there have been strict rules about what kids can and cannot do after a concussion, but now that's changing.<br/><br/>Now, new guidelines, the first update in eight years, are relaxing the rules a bit. Doctors say it will make things a little easier for kids to recover both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>Angelo Neumann had four concussions by the time he was 9.<br/><br/>"At home, we just have to be extra cautious that he doesn't hit his head," said Mark Neumann, Angelo's dad.<br/><br/>Hali Jester, who is a softball standout, had a concussion too. She didn't sit out to recover, then unfortunately suffered another bad hit.<br/><br/>Jester said, "I don't like to sit out. I don't like to miss anything, and I didn't take care of myself. I didn't realize how serious this could be."<br/><br/>Dr. Mark Halstead is a pediatric sports medicine specialist with Washington University, St. Louis. He and other pediatricians say it's crucial to take concussions seriously.<br/><br/>"When athletes continue to play after their concussion and they don't come out immediately, those kids have much worse symptoms and it actually oftentimes doubles their recovery time," he said.<br/><br/>Previous guidelines advised complete rest for the brain after a concussion.<br/><br/>"We had some people who said, 'that doesn't sound exactly right' because we've tried that with things in medicine before that doesn't usually get people better," Dr. Halstead said.<br/><br/>New guidelines have switched up that old thinking.<br/><br/>Experts say, while kids don't go back to normal activity right away, light exercise like a 20-minute brisk walk as early as a day after an injury can be beneficial.<br/><br/>Dr. Halstead explained, "The research out there shows that when we start doing some light physical activity earlier on in the process, people recover quicker."<br/><br/>Previous guidelines also suggested limiting electronics. But cutting off a teen's social network can lead to isolation, anxiety and depression. The new rules suggest that some use of devices is okay.<br/><br/>"We don't want someone to be, you know, on restricted use of them, but also that there's no harm necessarily in using them," Dr. Halstead said.<br/><br/>Another change: kids shouldn't be kept out of school for a prolonged time, but limiting academic workload may be necessary.<br/><br/>It's all about moderation, as too much physical or mental exertion before the brain has fully recovered can both prolong recovery and worsen outcome of a concussion.<br/><br/>The most important thing - getting a child evaluated and treated right away.<br/><br/>According to a report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, concussions ranked highest in boys' tackle football followed by lacrosse, ice hockey and wrestling.<br/><br/>And in girls' sports, soccer reported the most incidents followed by lacrosse, field hockey and basketball.</p>
