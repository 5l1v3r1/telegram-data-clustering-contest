      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — The ringgit opened weaker against the US dollar today after yesterday’s released of a disappointing economic data, casting doubt on the country’s economic growth momentum, dealers said.</p>
      <p>At 9.15am, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1500/1530 versus the US dollar against 4.1410/1440 yesterday.</p>
      <p>A dealer said the Producer Price Index (PPI) delivered a disappointing performance amid a widening contraction in September vis-à-vis August, dashing hopes that the PPI could be on track for a sustained recovery.</p>
      <p>“Deeper contraction in mining, down 14.4 per cent year-on-year and the lowest for the year, is worrying as this may take a toll on exports and growth momentum given that mining represents about seven per cent of the economy,” he said.</p>
      <p>September PPI for local production fell 2.4 per cent from the same month last year and down 1.9 per cent from August.</p>
      <p>The local note was also traded lower against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit decreased against the Singapore dollar to 3.0461/0501 from Tuesday’s close of 3.0415/0448 and depreciated against the yen to 3.8098/8132 from 3.7932/7966.</p>
      <p>It eased against the British pound to 5.3352/3399 from 5.3158/3213 and declined versus the euro to 4.5700/5737 from 4.5679/5729. — Bernama</p>
