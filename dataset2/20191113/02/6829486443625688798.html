      <h1>As Australia Burns, People Are Begging For Scott Morrison To Listen To Them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:54:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Conaghan</a></address>
      <p>There are fears that Australia’s bushfires may be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/12/australia-fires-rage-out-of-control-catastrophic-day">out of control for months</a> yet, but Scott Morrison is still having trouble acknowledging the big, fat, flaming elephant in the room.</p>
      <p>While bushfires are nothing new to Australia, the fact that they’ve arrived so early in the season, and with such ferocity, have sparked a debate on the impact climate change is having. A debate in which the Prime Minister has tried his best to not engage with.</p>
      <p>Scott Morrison and his conservative colleagues have <a href="https://junkee.com/q-a-scott-morrison-teenager/229018">faced criticism</a> for refusing to answer questions on this.</p>

      <p>As Australia burns, people have taken to twitter using #attnscottmorrison to draw attention to all the ways the government has failed in the fight against climate change.</p>
      <p>At least 300 properties have been destroyed and three lives have been lost in the bushfires, which are spread from Cobraball in central Queensland to Sydney.</p>
      <p>More than 80 fires are still burning in New South Wales and more than 60 are blazing in Queensland, with the extreme drought creating a tinderbox across most of the east coast.</p>

      <p>With the government’s continued support of coal mining, resistance to emission reduction policies and their crackdown on climate protestors, people are rightfully pissed.</p>

      <p>Greg is one of 23 former fire chiefs who have been attempting to meet with the prime minister since April to talk about the impact of climate change on bushfires.</p>
      <p>“Nationwide, people’s feelings of fear and anxiety about the future of our country are reaching boiling point,” the petition reads.</p>
      <p>“It’s time to get PM Scott Morrison’s attention.”</p>
