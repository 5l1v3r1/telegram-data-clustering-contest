      <h2>Officials have blamed the flooding in Venice, Italy, on climate change. They claim it will be eye-wateringly expensive to repair the historic city, which is believed to have suffered severe damage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:29:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:29</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Riccardo Bastianello, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Venice has been hit by the second worst floods on record, leaving an 'indelible wound' on the historic Italian city.</p>
      <p>Water flooded the city's historic basilica and left many of its squares and alleyways deep underwater yesterday.</p>
      <p>Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said he would declare a state of disaster and warned of severe damage.</p>
      <p>City officials said the tide peaked at 187 cm (6.14 ft) at 10.50 p.m. (2150 GMT), just short of the record 194 cm set in 1966.</p>
      <p>"The situation is dramatic," Brugnaro said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>"We ask the government to help us. The cost will be high. This is the result of climate change."</p>

      <p>Saint Mark's Square was submerged by more than one metre (3.3 ft) of water, while the adjacent Saint Mark's Basilica was flooded for the sixth time in 1,200 years.</p>
      <p>Four of those inundations have now come in the last 20 years, most recently in October 2018.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate word on any damage inside the church.</p>

      <p>In 2018, the administrator said the basilica had aged 20 years in a single day.</p>
      <p>Video on social media showed deep waters flowing like a river along one of Venice's main thoroughfares, while another showed large waves hammering boats moored alongside the Doge's Palace and surging over the stone sidewalks.</p>
      <p>"A high tide of 187 cm is going to leave an indelible wound," Brugnaro said.</p>

      <p>Much of Italy has been pummelled by torrential rains in recent days, with wide spreading flooding, especially in the southern heel and toe of the country.</p>
      <p>In Matera, this year's European Capital of Culture, rain water cascaded through the streets and inundated the city's famous cave-dwelling district.</p>
      <p>Further bad <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> is forecast for the coming days.</p>
