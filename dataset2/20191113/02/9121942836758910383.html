      <p>BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s Cabinet has approved legislation that will criminalize “upskirting” photos and taking unauthorized pictures of people killed in accidents.</p>
      <p>The bill introduced Wednesday, which requires parliamentary approval, will make it a criminal rather than civil offense to take and distribute such pictures.</p>
      <p>The German move follows the approval this year of legislation making it illegal in England and Wales to take “upskirting” photos.</p>
      <p>It also will ban the taking or distribution of unauthorized pictures “that display a dead person in a grossly offensive way,” punishing them with up to two years in prison.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht says that “we must spare relatives the additional suffering of pictures of their deceased parents or children being spread around.”</p>
