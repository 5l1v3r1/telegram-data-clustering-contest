      <p>BEIRUT: A man was shot dead south of Beirut after the army opened fire to disperse protesters blocking roads, Lebanese state media said Wednesday, nearly a month into an unprecedented anti-graft street movement.<br/>The victim “succumbed to his injuries” in hospital, the National News Agency said, the second death during the nationwide protests that have paralyzed the country.<br/>The army said in a statement that it had arrested a soldier after he opened fire in the coastal town of Khalde, just below the capital, to clear protesters “injuring one person.”<br/>Protesters have been demanding the ouster of a generation of politicians seen by demonstrators as inefficient and corrupt, in a movement that has been largely peaceful.<br/>On Tuesday night, street protests erupted after President Michel Aoun defended the role of his allies, the Shiite movement Hezbollah, in Lebanon’s government.<br/>Protesters responded by cutting off several major roads in and around Beirut, the northern city of Tripoli and the eastern region of Bekaa.<br/>The Progressive Socialist Party, led by influential Druze politician Walid Jumblatt, said in a statement that the man shot dead was one its members.<br/>A long-time opponent of President Michel Aoun, Jumblatt appealed to his supporters to stay calm.<br/>“In spite of what happened, we have no other refuge than the state. If we lose hope in the state, we enter chaos,” he said.<br/>The government stepped down on October 29 but stayed on in a caretaker capacity and no overt efforts have so far been made to form a new one, as an economic crisis brings the country to the brink of default.<br/>On Tuesday morning, dozens of protesters had gathered near the law courts in central Beirut and tried to stop judges and lawyers from going to work, demanding an independent judiciary.<br/>Employees at the two main mobile operators, Alfa and Touch, started a nationwide strike.<br/>Many schools and universities were closed, as were banks after their employees called for a general strike over alleged mistreatment by customers last week.</p>

      <p>The UN’s special coordinator for the country, Jan Kubis, urged Lebanon to accelerate the formation of a new government that would be able “to appeal for support from Lebanon’s international partners.”<br/>“The financial and economic situation is critical, and the government and other authorities cannot wait any longer to start addressing it,” he said.<br/>The leaderless protest movement first erupted after a proposed tax on calls via free phone apps, but it has since morphed into an unprecedented cross-sectarian outcry against everything from perceived state corruption to rampant electricity cuts.<br/>Demonstrators say they are fed up with the same families dominating government institutions since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war.<br/>In his televised address on Tuesday, Aoun proposed a government that includes both technocrats and politicians.<br/>“A technocratic government can’t set the policies of the country” and would not “represent the people,” he said in the interview on Lebanese television.<br/>Asked if he was facing pressure from outside Lebanon not to include the Iran-backed Hezbollah in a new government, he did not deny it.<br/>But, he said, “they can’t force me to get rid of a party that represents at least a third of Lebanese,” referring to the weight of the Shiite community.<br/>The latest crisis in Lebanon comes at a time of high tensions between Iran and the United States, which has sanctioned Hezbollah members in Lebanon.<br/>Forming a government typically takes months in Lebanon, with protracted debate on how best to maintain a fragile balance between religious communities.<br/>The World Bank says around a third of Lebanese live in poverty and has warned the country’s struggling economy could further deteriorate if a new cabinet is not formed rapidly.</p>
