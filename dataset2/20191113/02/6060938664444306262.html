      <p>INDORE: September 12, 2019. When the squad for Freedom Series was announced, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a>'s name figured in Board President's XI instead of the national side.</p>
      <p>In his nine-year international career, Yadav has seen many ups and downs but this was certainly a body blow. After all, the Vidarbha pacer hadn't done much wrong.</p>
      <p>In the last home Test that India had played before the South Africa series, Yadav had taken a 10-wicket haul. Yadav was only the third Indian pacer after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kapil-Dev">Kapil Dev</a>, who did it twice, and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Javagal-Srinath">Javagal Srinath</a>, to bag 10 wickets in a home Test.</p>
      <p>No wonder, Yadav, who turned 32 last month, was dejected. Some doubts also crept up in his mind. However, it was only for a brief period. His better half Tanya said Yadav got on with his regular routine as it was the only way to bounce back. "He was bit upset initially but gathered himself very quickly. Umesh is aware that he is part of a world class unit and has to do well whenever the opportunity comes," Tanya told TOI.</p>

      <p>India's star pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jasprit-bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a> then got injured and Yadav was called up as a replacement. After warming the benches during the series against Australia and West Indies, Yadav was eager to make a meaningful contribution.</p>
      <p>The smile was back with the wickets of Adrian Markam and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dean-Elgar">Dean Elgar</a> in the Pune Test. The pacer played a crucial role in India's clean sweep against South Africa where wickets didn't have much on offer for the quicks. Yadav picked up 11 wickets in two Tests at an impressive average of 12.18. His strike rate of 21.2 was the best among all the bowlers.</p>
      <p>Even the opposition were in awe of Yadav's performance. Skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Faf-du-Plessis">Faf du Plessis</a> praised Yadav after the series. South Africa's assistant coach, performance, Prasanna Agoram, who has seen Yadav since he took a five-wicket haul against a star-studded South Zone side in 2009, feels Yadav now means business.</p>
      <p>"It's a huge difference between Umesh of 2009 and 2019. I like his attitude. He is a calm and quiet guy who listens to advice from everyone but has his own mind. This Umesh Yadav means business. He is more mature. He has got great skills and a sensible head on his shoulders," Agoram told TOI.</p>

      <p>Agoram had armed the South African players with detailed analysis about Yadav. "When he played in a warm-up game against us, he got Dean Elgar in the second over. The South Africans hold him in high regard. Whenever the captain demanded a wicket, he provided a breakthrough" he said.</p>
      <p>After a stop-start career laced with injuries and inconsistent performances, Yadav has been a regular in the Indian side. He was India's leading pacer during the home Test series against New Zealand, England and Australia in 2016-17.</p>
      <p>Bumrah's emergence meant somebody needed to make way. Unfortunately, Yadav was that guy each time.</p>
      <p>It must have been disappointing but Umesh looked at positive side of coin. "Umesh is very calm and secure. He knows there's competition for places. He has immense self-belief about what he can bring to the table. He has that positive mindset and always works very hard to overcome his shortcomings. Umesh knew he will get his chances and when he gets them, he will have to be ready," Tanya said.</p>
      <p>An average IPL prompted him to take a small break and that rejuvenated him. "After the break, he was back to his routine. He would discuss and work on his bowling with Subroto (Bannerjee) sir," she added.</p>
      <p>That work seems to be paying off.</p>
