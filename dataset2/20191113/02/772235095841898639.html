      <p><b>Holden</b> has become the <b>first car company</b> in Australia to<b> rent vehicles directly</b> to the general public – giving them the option to switch between a hatchback, an SUV or a ute at a short notice, as their needs change throughout the year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/">Holden’s</a> rental car service called <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/maven/">Maven</a> has been around since 2017, but until now has only made cars available to drivers in the <b>“gig” economy</b>, such as <b>food delivery drivers</b> or <b>Uber ride-share drivers</b>.</p>
      <p>Over the past two years the Maven service has built up more than <b>6000 members</b> who have used more than <b>2300 Holden cars</b> to complete more than <b>9 million</b> ride-sharing or food delivery journeys – in the process clocking up more than <b>200 million kilometres</b> combined.</p>
      <p>Holden has expanded the Maven fleet to 2500 in anticipation of growing demand from retail customers. By comparison, car-share market leader <b>GoGet</b> has about 3000 vehicles that can be rented hourly or daily, from $74 to $93 per day, depending on which plan subscribers are on.</p>

      <p>There is no membership fee to join <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/">Holden’s</a> <a href="https://www.maven.com/au/en/monthly-rentals.html">Maven service</a>, but the cars available for weekly rental start with the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/trax/">Holden Trax</a> city SUV ($225 per week), and then go up in price to include the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/commodore/">Holden Calais</a> sedan ($265), the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/equinox/">Holden Equinox</a> medium SUV ($250) and the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/acadia/">Holden Acadia</a> seven-seat SUV ($330). The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/trailblazer/">Holden Trailblazer</a>, or a <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/colorado/">Holden Colorado LTZ</a> ute with a tow bar is $300 per week.</p>
      <p>The prices are dearer than taking out a long-term loan but the fees include <b>insurance</b>, <b>scheduled</b> <b>servicing</b>, <b>unlimited kilometres</b>, and <b>24/7</b> roadside assistance. Plus, customers have the choice of <b>extended periods without a car </b>to avoid weekly fees. Insurance claim excess is $1000 for drivers over 25 and $1500 for drivers under 25.</p>
      <p>Customers who sign up must first take the vehicle for a minimum <b>28 days</b> before switching to week-by-week rental periods. You can also go without a car for most of the year, but the minimum rental periods are <b>seven-day blocks</b>.</p>
      <p>Maven only needs seven days’ notice to switch vehicle types. For example, you could rent a hatchback for most of the year but switch to an SUV or ute during the holidays.</p>

      <p>“The offer is designed to feel like vehicle ownership but without the hassles,” says a media statement from Holden.</p>
      <p>“With only seven days’ notice required, members can take a break, change their model or when their needs change (such as) heading overseas, members can drop their vehicle off and pick up another when they get back.”</p>
      <p>For now the Maven service is only available at selected Holden dealers in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast and Perth.</p>
      <p>The service is not currently offered in Canberra, Tasmania, or the Northern Territory but the vehicles can be driven there, though not swapped there.</p>
      <p>Holden says the next generation of car buyers and drivers – millennials – are becoming increasingly accustomed to not owning expensive items outright, whether it be renting a home or rolling over new mobile phones on a plan.</p>
      <p>In fact, Holden says nearly four out of every five Maven customers so far is a millennial who “values experiences over possessions (and) spend money on a desirable experiences instead of buying goods”.</p>

      <p>The company says Maven can also be used by small businesses to “reduce their capital outlays or … reward employees with an upgraded work vehicle without committing to a long-term lease”.</p>
      <p>In March this year, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a> launched its <b>Kinto car-share service in Tokyo</b> “as society shifts from conventional car ownership to car usage that can be enjoyed wherever and as much as users would like”.</p>
      <p>The Japanese company said at the time it will “continue to watch the market and listen to customer feedback to determine … when a Toyota subscription service is right for Australia”.</p>
      <p>Luxury brands are also eyeing off the car-share segment locally following successful trials overseas.</p>
      <p>“The subscription model is an important direction for us for the future,” <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volvo/">Volvo Australia</a> boss Nick Connor told <i>CarAdvice</i> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think younger people value ownership any more,” Mr Connor said at the time, because they like the idea of “using something and then giving it back”.</p>
      <p>"The subscription model has a lot of legs, and it can be premium priced – frankly it needs to be premium priced to make us any money,” he said.</p>
      <p>Not every car-sharing experiment has been successful, however. In the US, General Motors “temporarily paused” its 'Book By Cadillac' luxury-car sharing service at the end of 2018 after just two years of operation. It had allowed customers access to a range of prestige vehicles for $US1800 a month.</p>
