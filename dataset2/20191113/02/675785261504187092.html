      <p>Speaking ahead of his bug-infested trip to the jungle, Roman revealed that the creepy-crawlies are not something to be feared but if he was to be wrapped in cotton wool, then you would see him freaking out.</p>
      <p>Roman said: "Someone did a trial with ostriches once.Them and frogs would be my fears along with Cotton wool. Snakes and spiders I don’t mind."</p>
      <p>The radio personality has said that his famous parents were unlikely to come out to Australia.</p>
      <p>He is the son of former EastEnders and Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp and Wham! backing singer Shirlie.</p>
      <p>He also insisted he has not read which other celebs were going on the show as he wanted it to be a surprise.</p>

      <p>As a big Arsenal fan he is likely to be excited to chat with former striker Ian Wright who is also in the line up.</p>
      <p>The prospective campmate has said that he would be willing to delete his social media completely, after controversy surrounded historic tweets that bad-mouthed K-pop sensations, BTS.</p>
      <p>To avoid any hassles for the I'm A Celebrity bosses, Roman indicated that he was willing to make this sacrifice if it meant that he had a clean run on the show.</p>

      <p>Roman said: "I love this programme so much. I love it when it kicks off with the first show and you see Ant and Dec arrive.</p>
      <p>“I will be happy to get rid of social media but the thing I will miss most is speaking to my parents and my girlfriend.”</p>
