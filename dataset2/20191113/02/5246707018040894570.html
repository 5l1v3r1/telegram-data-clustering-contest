      <p>Last weekend, three listings on Nintendo of America's website confirmed <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_nights_at_freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_nights_at_freddys_2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_nights_at_freddys_3">Five Nights at Freddy's 3</a></b> would be <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/prepare_for_scares_when_the_five_nights_at_freddys_trilogy_creeps_onto_the_eshop_later_this_month">released</a> on the Switch eShop on 29th November for $7.99 each.</p>
      <p>It left many fans wondering if the last chapter – <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_nights_at_freddys_4">Five Nights at Freddy's 4</a></b> – would be making the switch.</p>
      <p>Well, the good news is, a listing has now appeared on the Switch eShops in Europe and Australia, confirming the fourth game in Scott Cawthon's jump scare horror series will be released on the same day as the original three.</p>
      <p>Here's a description, courtesy of Steam, along with some screenshots:</p>
      <blockquote>In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.</blockquote>
