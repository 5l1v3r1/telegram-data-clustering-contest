      <p>President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/donald-trump">Donald Trump </a>said the U.S. will increase tariffs on China in case the first step of a broader agreement isn’t reached.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t make a deal, we’re going to substantially raise those tariffs,” he said Tuesday in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. “They’re going to be raised very substantially. And that’s going to be true for other countries that mistreat us too.”</p>
      <p>China is “dying” to make a trade deal with the U.S., Trump said, adding that he’d only sign it if it’s good for American companies and workers. Still, “we’re close -- a significant phase one deal could happen, could happen soon.”</p>
      <p>Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping had planned to sign “phase one” of the deal at an <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">international </a>conference this month in Chile that was canceled because of social unrest in that country.</p>
      <p>Shanghai stocks opened lower and the yuan was weaker against the dollar on Wednesday. Other Asian markets also declined. Hong Kong’s benchmark declined 2 per cent as the city faced heightened tensions.</p>
      <p>A new site for the signing hasn’t been announced. U.S. locations for the meeting that had been proposed by the White House have been ruled out, according to a person familiar with the matter. Locations in Asia and Europe are now being considered instead, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions aren’t public.</p>

      <p>Trump reiterated complaints about China’s ascendance in the global economy. “Nobody’s cheated better than China,” he said. “The theft of American jobs and American wealth is over.”</p>
      <p>U.S. stocks have rallied to records in recent days partly on optimism that tensions are cooling in an 18-month dispute involving tariffs on some $500 billion in trade between the world’s two largest economies. The S&amp;P 500 Index was up about 0.3 per cent as Trump delivered his remarks.</p>
      <p>The economic stakes of a prolonged trade war are rising for both countries.</p>
      <p>China’s exports and imports continued to contract in October, though slightly less than forecast by economists. The nation’s trade surplus with the U.S. widened in the month to $26.4 billion -- heading in the opposite direction from the narrowing that Trump has called for to balance the countries’ trading relationship.</p>
