      <p>One person died and 21 were injured after their jeepney slammed into a truck last night in the town of Rodriguez in Rizal province.</p>
      <p>Authorities said that the driver of the jeepney lost control of his vehicle as he was <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/13/19/higit-10-pasahero-sugatan-sa-pagtagilid-ng-jeep-sa-rizal">driving down a slope</a> in the village of San Jose, <i>ABS-CBN News </i>reports.  The jeepney, which <a href="http://www.dwiz882am.com/index.php/1-patay-matapos-sumalpok-ang-jeep-sa-isang-truck-sa-rodriguez-rizal/">came from Quezon City</a>, slammed into an Isuzu Elf cargo truck, which tried to avoid the oncoming vehicle but failed.</p>
      <p>One of the jeepney’s passengers, 62-year-old Estelita Sumulat, <a href="https://radyo.inquirer.net/215889/1-patay-higit-10-sugatan-sa-aksidente-sa-rodriguez-rizal">died after sustaining serious injuries</a> in the accident, according to <i>Radyo Inquirer</i>. The other injured passengers <a href="https://radyo.inquirer.net/215889/1-patay-higit-10-sugatan-sa-aksidente-sa-rodriguez-rizal">were brought</a> to the Ynares Medical Center for treatment.</p>
      <p>Despite the death of one passenger, another passenger said the truck actually saved their lives.</p>
      <p>“We were lucky there was a truck,” Leigh Ann Angeles said. “If not, we would have fallen off a cliff.”</p>
      <p>The owner of the jeepney promised that he would pay for the victims’ hospital bills. Meanwhile, his driver might be charged with reckless imprudence resulting in homicide and injuries.</p>
