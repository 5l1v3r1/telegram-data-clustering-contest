      <p>Seahawks backup quarterback Geno Smith was front and center amid a controversy stemming from the coin flip during overtime of Monday’s game against the 49ers.</p>
      <p>It was a bit ridiculous, however, especially when one sits down and thinks about it.</p>
      <p>The conspiracy theorists focused on how Smith appeared to call tails, but the officials said he said heads. It was, indeed, heads, and the Seahawks started with the football.</p>

      <p>Smith decided to join the conversation on social media Tuesday, given that the coin-flip controversy dominated sports talk. He did so with this funny tweet.</p>
