      <p>The daughter of Dean Martin, the entertainer who popularized the classic Christmas tune "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dennis-quaid-weighs-in-on-baby-its-cold-outside-controversey">Baby, It's Cold Outside</a>," reacted to a #MeToo-inspired version, calling it "insane."</p>
      <p>"I love John Legend and Kelly [Clarkson]. You know, they're fabulous entertainers. But, what on earth are they thinking?" Deana Martin said Tuesday on "The Story with Martha MacCallum."</p>
      <p>Martin added, "To me, it's always been a sweet, classy, flirtatious song there's nothing wrong with."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/kelly-clarkson">Clarkson</a>, 37, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-legend-abortion-law-boycotts-money-talks">Legend</a>, 40, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-john-legend-baby-its-cold-outside">recorded a version of the 1944 classic</a>, written by Frank Loesser, after it sparked debate over lyrics some say have grown problematic over the years over the notion of consent.</p>

      <p>In the tune, which has been covered by many artists since its debut, a female sings: "I really can’t stay,” to which a man responds: "But baby, it’s cold outside.” In another part of a song, a woman is heard singing lines like "Say what's in this drink?", "The answer is no" and "I've gotta get home."</p>
      <p>For his version, Legend updated the lyrics with Nathasha Rothwell, who writes and stars in HBO's "Insecure."</p>
      <p>“What will my friends think ...” Clarkson sings in the updated version.</p>
      <p>“I think they should rejoice,” Legend says.</p>
      <p>“... if I have one more drink?”</p>
      <p>“It’s your body and your choice.”</p>
      <p>Martin argued that the new iteration is actually "more sexual."</p>
      <p>"Have we lost our ability to just say something is cute and flirty at this point?" MacCallum asked.</p>

      <p>"It's gone a little crazy. I think that John Legend and Kelly, their version is, has brought it, made it more sexual," Martin argued, before giving her father's likely reaction. "And I think he would be kind of laughing right now that this was, you know, being changed."</p>
      <p>Martin who praised Legend and Clarkson as "fabulous entertainers" advised Legend to "write a new song," saying "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</p>
