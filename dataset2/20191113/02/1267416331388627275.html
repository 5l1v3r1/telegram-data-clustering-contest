      <h1>Apple patent describes TrueTone-like system for indoor smart lights</h1>
      <h2>This could also apply to self-driving vehicle interiors</h2>

      <p>An <a href="https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=10477659&amp;IDKey=DFBD69321C98&amp;HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D10477659.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F10477659%2526RS%3DPN%2F10477659">Apple patent</a> has been disclosed that hints at some form of auto-adjusting light system for the inside of buildings and maybe even vehicles.</p>
      <p>The patent details a form of keeping a room’s ambient light the same even as the sun moves behind clouds or begins to set.</p>
      <p>For example, your baseline is a lamp on a table with a smart light set to 50 percent brightness and sunlight shining through a window. It appears that from this patent, at some point when the sun moves behind a dark cloud making the room darker, a sensor should be able to detect this and raise the lamp’s brightness to counteract the less light that would have come from the sun.</p>
      <p>Apple’s patent also talks about a device that can sense the changes in light. It’s unclear if this is a standalone device or not. Still, I think it would be very interesting if this light-sensing technology was built into Apple’s hardware, especially the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/06/18/homepod-review/">HomePod</a>.</p>
      <p>This feature could even be applied to self-driving cars– because users don’t need to concentrate on the road they can have interior lights on all the time.</p>
      <p>Apple also mentions that it could create some form of lighting to go around the edge of a window to help counteract the changing brightness from the sun.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure I like this idea since the changing conditions of natural light are what make it feel unique and, well, natural. However, having a system brightening my internal lights as the sun goes down would be handy.</p>
