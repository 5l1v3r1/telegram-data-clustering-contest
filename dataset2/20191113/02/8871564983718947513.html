      <h1>Mentally ill man allegedly stabs mother, pushes body down street in wheelchair before being restrained</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T02:47:02+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 02:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>A 38-year-old suffering from mental illness was apprehended by members of the public in Taman Kampung Padang, <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/man-stopped-in-sarawak-carrying-over-rm500000-of-drugs-in-sling-bag/">Sarawak</a>, after he allegedly stabbed his mother in the neck.</p>
      <p>Sefiah Hamid, 62, is suspected to have been <a href="https://www.hmetro.com.my/utama/2019/11/516461/update-aku-dah-bunuh-mak-aku?fbclid=IwAR3ZlTLuQyewXyWmhAq2jFA0XFiD2bUyXpUBQM6or0ATOu7GnujqHpAHT-w">killed in her home with a kitchen knife between 8:30am and 10:30am Tuesday morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Police believe that after the unnamed suspect killed his mother, he then took her body, which was in a wheelchair, for a short walk in town. While doing so, he encountered his younger sister and her boyfriend, both of whom he also allegedly stabbed, albeit without causing serious injury.</p>
      <p>At that point, bystanders the realized that not all was well, and managed to subdue the man, tying his arms and legs.</p>
      <p>The suspect is believed to have acted alone. His mother was described as having been wheelchair-bound after suffering a broken back. Officers say the suspect had a record of psychiatric problems, and is unemployed.</p>
      <p>Investigators have asked the public to cease sharing videos and photos of the incident, as several clips and images of the grisly scene had <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Taman%20Kampung%20Padang&amp;epa=SEARCH_BOX">already made their way onto social media</a> shortly after the man was restrained.</p>
