      <h1>Apple’s new 16-inch MacBook Pro still uses a 720p webcam and lacks Wi-Fi 6 — unlike iPhone 11</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:40:10+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Apple’s new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> offers a range of great improvements headlined by a more reliable scissor switch Magic Keyboard. However, there are a couple of notable components that didn’t see an upgrade.</p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro features a return to the scissor switch keyboard, can be configured with up to 64Gb of RAM, has a new six-speaker system, improvement thermal system, and much more.</p>
      <p>However, it unfortunately still uses an <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/specs/">802.11ac Wi-Fi chip</a>. The lack of Wi-Fi 6 is disappointing considering Apple debuted it in the <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">iPhone 11 lineup</a> this year.</p>
      <p>Another holdover from old MacBooks is the 16-inch MacBook Pro still uses a 720p FaceTime Camera. The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro front-facing camera can shoot 4K.</p>
      <p>What do you think about the new MacBook pro lacking Wi-Fi 6 and a better FaceTime camera? Share your thoughts in the comments below!</p>
