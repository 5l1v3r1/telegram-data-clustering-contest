      <p>A Cadbury Christmas-themed chocolate product has been pulled from shelves because of a possible health risk for anyone with a nut allergy.</p>
      <p>The chocolate giant is urgently recalling its Dairy Milk Little Robins over incorrect packaging.</p>
      <p>Mondelez UK, which owns Cadbury, says the Christmas treats could contain undeclared almonds that are not mentioned on the label.</p>
      <p>The product has been incorrectly packed with Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins Daim Chocolate.</p>
      <p>No other Mondelez UK products are known to be affected.</p>
      <h3>The product</h3>
      <p>Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins</p>
      <p>Pack size: 93g</p>
      <p>Batch code: CIS3092812 &amp; CIS3092822</p>
      <p>Best before: 31 March 2020</p>

      <p>Mondelez UK has contacted the relevant allergy support organisations and has issued a point-of-sale notice to customers.</p>
      <p>The notice says: "This error may not be immediately obvious as the individual chocolate pieces within the bag are wrapped in a similar foil."</p>
      <p>Affected products can be returned to the store from which they were purchased for a full refund.</p>
