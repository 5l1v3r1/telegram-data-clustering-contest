      <p>The cruise deals website currently has an eight-night Jewel of the Emirates holiday package, which includes a seven-night cruise on board Jewel of the Seas, an overnight stay in Dubai and your return flights.</p>
      <p>The seven-night Jewel of the Seas cruise has some very glamorous ports of call on its itinerary; we're talking the likes of Dubai Doha, Bahrain, Sir Bani Yas Island and Abu Dhabi, as well as a day at sea.</p>
      <p>The holiday usually costs £1,099pp but you can currently bag it from <a href="https://mirror.cruisenation.com/special-offers/jewels-of-the-emirates">£699pp with Mirror Cruise</a> . (It's worth noting that the cheapest prices are subject to availability).</p>

      <p>The price is based on two people sharing a cabin, so that makes for a saving of £800 per couple!</p>
      <p>Jewel of the Seas alone makes for quite a glamorous getaway.</p>
      <p>The cruise ship underwent a £20million renovation in 2016 complete with new staterooms, three new restaurants and wine bars, a poolside movie screen and a rock-climbing wall.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Other highlights on board the ship also includes Broadway-style shows, an adults-only solarium, movies under the stars, sushi-making classes and even mini golf.</p>
      <p>Then of course there'll be ample opportunity to explore the cities whether you're taking in Dubai's incredible skyline, home to the world's tallest building the Burj Khalifa, or exploring the picturesque beaches in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>The deal is valid for the itinerary departing on the 2nd February 2020 - perfect if you're after winter sun - but don't be disheartened if you can't quite make the offer work for you on that date.</p>
      <p>There are heaps more itineraries with similar itineraries from January to March 2020, with prices starting from £729pp.</p>
      <p>You can check out the discounted packages on the <a href="https://mirror.cruisenation.com/special-offers/jewels-of-the-emirates">Mirror Cruise website</a> , including more <a href="https://mirror.cruisenation.com/destinations/dubai-emirates-cruises">Dubai &amp; Emirates cruises</a> if you're looking for different travel dates. </p>
