      <h1>55 tertiary students at Old Tafo benefit from Scholarship Scheme</h1>

      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 13, GNA - Fifty-five (55) tertiary students at the Old Tafo Municipality in the Ashanti Region, have been awarded scholarship under the government’s ‘Scholarship Award Scheme’ for their educational development.</p>
      <p>Mr Fred Obeng Owusu, the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), said the beneficiaries were made up of 28 males and 27 females.</p>
      <p>A total amount of GHȼ87,031.00, he noted, had been released to that effect by the Municipal Assembly.</p>
      <p>Mr Obeng Owusu, who was addressing the Assembly’s turn of ‘Meet-the-Press’ at Old Tafo, stressed that government would not compromise on its educational responsibilities since the accelerated development of any society was dependent on a literate citizenry.</p>
      <p>He hinted that the authorities had supplied 600 dual desks to basic schools in the Municipality since its creation about two years ago.</p>
      <p>One solar-powered mechanized borehole each for the Osei Kyeretwie, Uthmania and Alzaria Senior High Schools (SHSs) had also been constructed to enhance the free-flow of water in these institutions.</p>
      <p>On-going projects being executed by the Assembly under the Ghana Education Trust (GET) Fund include two boys’ dormitories, which were 90 per cent complete, and a library at the Osei Kyeretwie SHS.</p>
      <p>The rest are six-unit classroom block each for the Old Tafo Methodist Basic School, Pankrono R/C Basic School and Tafo-Pankrono M/A Basic School.</p>
      <p>Mr Obeng Owusu lauded the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo-led Administration for introducing the ‘Free SHS’ policy, saying this had led to increased enrolment in schools in the Municipality.</p>
