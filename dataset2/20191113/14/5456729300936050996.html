      <p>A Grade 1 Area Court in Karu, FCT on Wednesday, ordered a 27-year-old woman, Joy Alake, to sweep the court premises for two weeks for stealing nine pieces of wrappers and four skirts worth N68,000.</p>
      <p>The convict, who resides at Karu Village, Abuja, pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal trespass and theft and pleaded for leniency.</p>
      <p>The judge, Sani Mohammed, who did not give the convict an option to pay any fine, warned her to desist from committing crimes.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed also ordered the police to release the recovered wrappers to the complainant.</p>
