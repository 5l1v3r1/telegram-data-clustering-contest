      <h1>Deontay Wilder explains difference between himself and Anthony Joshua</h1>
      <h2>Joshua lost his three heavyweight world titles to Andy Ruiz Jr in June - but rival Wilder remains champion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:03:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder has claimed Anthony Joshua's mindset cost him his heavyweight world titles.</p>
      <p>The Brit lost his three belts to Andy Ruiz Jr in one of the sport's biggest upsets in New York in June.</p>
      <p>Wilder, meanwhile, retained his by knocking out Dominic Breazeale inside a round and returns to action on Saturday week in his rematch with Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>And he explained why he believes he still reigns while Joshua must win back his crown.</p>
      <p>"Me and Joshua have a different mindset. Mine is strong, way stronger than his," <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11860301/wilder-vs-ortiz-2-deontay-wilder-claims-his-mindset-is-way-stronger-than-anthony-joshuas">Wilder told Sky Sports</a> .</p>
      <p>"Joshua knew he would lose one day," Wilder said. "When it was time he handed his belts over to Ruiz Jr - he literally transferred the belts to this man.</p>

      <p>"For me? My mindset is different. I'm a totally different king, a totally different beast.</p>
      <p>"I am the best in the world and I prove it each time I go in the ring.</p>
      <p>"I'm not worried about making mistakes and, if I do, rest assured I will correct it as the fight goes on.</p>
      <p>"I'm fighting for one champion, one face, one name - the [undisputed] champion. Nobody will get in my way, nobody."</p>
      <p>Wilder has fought 42 times as a professional - but plans to fight on for six years.</p>
      <p>“Six years is my max that I’m planning to finish my career,” he said.</p>

      <p>“In the beginning of my career, we had a plan of things to move forward with.</p>
      <p>"I can’t say things went exactly as planned. In life, things don’t go as planned. It’s a great to be with a group of guys that have my best interest at heart.</p>
      <p>"The people who were planning the beginning of my career are planning the ending as well. I think the ending is going to be a little bit sweeter than the beginning.</p>
      <p>"In the beginning you have a long task ahead of you and you don’t know where the roads will lead. I did the best I can in the heavyweight division. I brought a lot of excitement. I bring a lot of drama."</p>
