      <h1>Bernardo Silva banned for 'racist' tweet comparing Benjamin Mendy to cartoon character</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City star Silva will serve a one-match suspension, has been hit with a £50,000 fine and ordered to attend face-to-face education</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:06:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Bernardo Silva has been banned for one game and fined £50,000 for a controversial tweet sent to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> team-mate Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>Silva must also complete a face-to-face education programme following the FA's publication of their decision into the player's misconduct charge.</p>
      <p>City have yet to say whether they intend to appeal the decision, with Bernardo set to miss their Premier League home game against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> on November 24.</p>
      <p>Silva sent Mendy a tweet, comparing his colleague to the character on packets of Conguitos chocolates, in the wake of City's 8-0 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> on September 21.</p>

      <p>The FA Charged Silva after claiming the post constituted an “aggravated breach” of its rules on social media behaviour because it appeared to reference Mendy's race.</p>
      <p>Today the FA released a statement which read: "Bernardo Silva has been suspended for one first team competitive fixture, fined £50,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a breach of FA Rule E3.</p>
      <p>"The Manchester City midfielder’s social media activity on 22 September 2019 breached FA Rule E3(1), as it was insulting and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute, and constituted an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it included reference, whether expressed or implied, to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin."</p>
