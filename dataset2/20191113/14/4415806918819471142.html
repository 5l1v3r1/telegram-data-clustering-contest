      <h1>Body of ex-Army officer to be flown from Turkey to UK</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:15:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>The body of a former British army officer who helped found the White Helmets volunteer group in Syria is to be flown to London following a post-mortem, Turkey’s state-run news agency said</p>
      <p>The Anadolu Agency said James Le Mesurier’s body would be flown aboard a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul airport later on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Le Mesurier was found dead outside his home in Istanbul on November 11. Police believe he fell to his death and are investigating the circumstances.</p>
      <p>Turkey’s Forensic Medicine Institute said toxicology and other examinations were continuing, adding that a report into his death would be sent to prosecutors “as soon as possible”.</p>

      <p>Last week, a top Russian official alleged Mr Le Mesurier was a spy — a claim Britain strongly denies.</p>
      <p>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused him of being a former British agent working in the Balkans and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>She claimed he had “been spotted all around the world, including in the Balkans and the Middle East”.</p>
      <p>“Given the role of the West in undermining stability in these regions, it is not difficult to assume what the British intelligence officer did there,” she said.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International said on Tuesday that there was a possibility of foul play and called for an investigation.</p>

      <p>Mr Le Mesurier’s body was found near his home in the Beyoglu district by worshippers on their way to a mosque, according to reports by Anadolu.</p>
      <p>Anadolu also said Mr Le Mesurier’s wife told police that her husband had been taking medicine to treat “intense stress”.</p>
      <p>Mr Le Mesurier was the founder and chief executive of May Day Rescue, which founded and trained the White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defence.</p>
      <p>The group, which has had more than 3,000 volunteers in opposition-held areas, says it has saved thousands of lives since 2013 and documented Syrian government attacks on civilians and other infrastructure.</p>
