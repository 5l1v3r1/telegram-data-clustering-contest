      <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/check-flood-risk">The Environment Agency</a> has issued warnings and alerts for a number of locations along the River Trent, which is at risk of breaching its banks as a result of heavy rainfall this week.</p>
      <p>A serious warning has been issued for the River Trent at Carlton-on-Trent, including Beck Cottage.</p>
      <p>This reads: "River levels are rising at the Torksey river gauge as a result of high tides coinciding with high river levels.</p>
