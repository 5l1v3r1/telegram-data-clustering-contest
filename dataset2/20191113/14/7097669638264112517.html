          <b><a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/fiat">Fiat</a> announced that it will sell a 2020 <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/fiat/500x">500X</a> Sport model in the U.S., despite pulling the regular <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a28902093/fiat-500-dead-north-america/">500 minicar</a> out of the U.S. market several weeks ago.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Like the 500X, the Sport will be powered by a <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a25300703/2019-fiat-500x-photos-info/">new 177-hp turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder</a>.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The 500X Sport will start at $28,390, a $2305 premium over the standard 500X, and it will be on sale starting in early 2020.</b>

      <p>The Fiat 500X, the roomier, all-weather-capable sibling to the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/fiat/500">500</a>, is Fiat’s closest thing to an SUV, which helps explain why Fiat is still selling the 500X here even though it has killed the regular 500 for the U.S. market. The Sport version has only been available to customers overseas, though. However, now the sportier 500X will make its way to U.S. customers for the 2020 model year, Fiat announced today.</p>

      <p>The Fiat 500X Sport is basically an appearance package, set apart from the standard 500X by a new front fascia with LED headlamps and a sport badge, body-color painted side moldings, and an updated rear fascia with dual chrome exhaust. A set of 18-inch wheels comes standard, although 19-inch premium aluminum wheels wrapped with Michelin CrossClimate all-season tires are available to upgrade the 500X Sport’s capabilities.</p>
      <p>Like the 500x, the Sport version will be powered by the same newly downsized turbocharged 1.3-liter four-cylinder, which makes 177 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. A nine-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive system with an automatic disconnecting rear axle come standard.</p>

      <p>The cabin features Alcantara inserts on the steering wheel, and the roof of the gauge cluster, which has new graphics, is adorned with Alcantara as well. A new techno-leather steering wheel features red stitching and paddle shifters, and the headliner, pillars, and door and console finishes are darker compared to the standard 500X. Other standard features include aluminum pedal covers and Sport-branded floor mats.</p>
      <p>A 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability is found in all 500X trim levels, so naturally it's also standard on the Sport. Additionally, like the 500X, the Sport model is available with an array of driver-assistance features such as adaptive cruise control and front park assist.</p>
      <p>The 500X Sport starts at $28,390, and it will be available to U.S. buyers in early 2020. That's a $2305 premium over the standard 500X, which starts at $26,085 and is available in Pop, Trekking, and Trekking Plus trims.</p>
