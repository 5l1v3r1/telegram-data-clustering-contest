      <p>Elon Musk has fueled hopes that he would bring a Tesla R&amp;D base, if not a factory, to the UK for years now, but it would seem that he has had a change of heart – and that Brexit had something to do with the u-turn.</p>
      <p>As he collected an award for the Tesla Model 3 this week, the company's CEO announced that Tesla's new European Gigafactory, as well as an R&amp;D base, will be built on the outskirts of Berlin in Germany. <br/><br/>It was then reported that the Musk said that the UK wasn't considered for the new site because of Brexit: "<a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/108395/tesla-gigafactory-europe-to-be-built-in-germany-not-uk-as-elon-musk-blames-brexit">Brexit made it too risky to put a Gigafactory in the UK," he said</a>.<br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/topic/digital-transformation-a-cxos-guide/"><b>Digital transformation: A CXO's guide</b></a><b> (ZDNet special report) | </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/digital-transformation-a-cxo-s-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Download the report as a PDF</b></a><b> (TechRepublic)</b><br/><br/>In typical Musk style, he confirmed the decision by <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1194364798407852032">Tweeting "Giga Berlin"</a>, and he added that the new factory will build batteries, powertrains and vehicles, starting with the production of the Tesla Model Y.</p>
      <p>"Some of the best cars in the world are made in Germany, everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding," said Musk. "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/tesla-cites-brexit-as-germany-chosen-over-uk-for-european-plant-elon-musk">That's part of the reason why we're locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany</a>."<br/><br/>The European plant will be Tesla's fourth battery plant. The first one, in Nevada, was launched in 2014; the second one is due in Buffalo, New York; and the third one, a $2 billion factory in Shanghai, is nearing commercial production. </p>
      <p>Currently, all of the company's vehicles are built at its factory in California, using batteries produced in Nevada. <br/><br/>Tesla has a final assembly factory in Europe, in Tilburg, Netherlands, which produces Model S and Model X; but having a local production site on the continent is likely to further boost its European sales. Musk previously said that <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/08/22/tesla-gigafactory-europe-lower-saxony-local-govt/">he would like the European facility to be operational by 2021.</a><br/><br/>Bringing a Tesla plant to Europe has been on Musk's mind for a few years now; until now, it seemed that the UK had been one of the CEO's locations of choice.<br/><br/>In 2014, speaking at the handover of the first right-hand drive Model S cars to British owners, <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/model-s/87332/tesla-plans-uk-rd-base-charging-network-and-25k-3-series-rival">Musk said that the UK would be the base for a new R&amp;D center, and potentially a factory.</a><br/><br/>He said: "It makes sense to have (a factory) in the UK once we're producing more than 500,000 units… I'd say Model S is more European than American in design and handling. Most of the set-up work was done by British guys."<br/><br/>After the Brexit referendum in 2016, the company's CEO didn't backtrack. Speaking to <i>The Telegraph</i>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/11/08/electric-car-maker-tesla-comes-to-europe-as-it-snaps-up-german-f/">he said that he did not see Brexit being likely to have a "significant impact" on Tesla's long-term objectives</a>. <br/><br/>He added that he was still considering building a Tesla engineering group in Britain at some point, and praised British automotive engineering talent, and especially Formula 1.<br/><br/>David Bailey, who has researched the impact of Brexit on UK automotive at Birmingham Business School, told ZDNet that Musk's hints had fuelled hopes for some sort of R&amp;D center or assembly point in the UK "if and when" Tesla chose to invest in Europe.<br/><br/>"Such hopes have been dashed with the decision by Tesla to invest big time in Germany," he said. "But in reality it comes as little surprise."<br/><br/>Like Musk, Bailey points the finger at "Brexit uncertainty", both short-term – "simply not knowing what will happen" – and long-term, as the UK could face tariff barriers and customs delays that would make the country a much less attractive place to make cars.<br/><br/>Brexit has stymied investment in the auto industry, Bailey argued, which is down by over 80% in the last three years. <br/><br/>In addition to Brexit, Bailey highlighted that another factor could have influenced Musk's decision. "The UK is lagging behind other European countries in EV take up," he said.<br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tesla-power-storage-balkan-battery-project-is-largest-running-in-europe/"><b>Tesla power storage: Balkan battery project is 'largest running in Europe'</b></a><br/><br/>Recent research showed that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48340202">only one in four people in the UK would consider buying an electric car in the next five years</a>, partly because the government recently cut subsidies for buying greener cars and reduced discounts on all-electric cars from £4,500 to £3,500.<br/><br/>"In contrast the German government is committing big support for EV in the coming years," said Bailey.<br/><br/>"Musk looked at where the big action and investment is taking place and concluded that it isn't in the UK, sadly," he continued.<br/><br/>The timing is unfortunate for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in a twist of fate chose an electric car factory in the West Midlands for his first major speech of the election campaign today. </p>
