      <p>Blackpink have become the first K-pop group to have a video earn more than a billion views on YouTube.</p>

      <p>In reaching the major YouTube milestone they join Psy as one of the only two K-pop acts to score over a billion views on a single video.</p>
      <p>Psy’s 2012 viral hit Gangnam Style has nearly 3.5 billion views on the video platform.</p>
      <p>Blackpink are at the forefront of the South Korean genre of pop music’s increasing global success, alongside acts like BTS and NCT.</p>
      <p>The genre is defined by its combination of pop and rap music, and high-production music videos.</p>

      <p>They were also the big winners at the People’s Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday night, taking home three awards, for group, music video and concert tour.</p>
