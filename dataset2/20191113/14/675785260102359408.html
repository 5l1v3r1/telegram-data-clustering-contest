      <h1>Katie Price splurges on shopping trip with Kris Boyson ahead of bankruptcy hearing</h1>
      <h2>The former glamour model and her boyfriend were weighed down by shopping bags after snapping up plenty of designer goodies ahead of her hearing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:02:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> seemingly won't let her upcoming bankruptcy hearing stop her from splashing the cash on a shopping spree.</p>
      <p>The former glamour model was pictured last night, seemingly loading boyfriend Kris Boyson up like a packmule.</p>
      <p>Kris was weighed down by multiple bags, using both hands to carry all the designer goodies they'd been buying from Prada and Gucci.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-five, 41, is said to have spent six hours shopping with her 30-year-old beau at a retail outlet.</p>
      <p>The shopping trip comes ahead of Katie's court appearance later this month, where she's facing a fresh bankruptcy claim.</p>
      <p>The upcoming appearance and the possibility of being declared bankrupt didn't seem to put Katie off, and she happily splashed the cash with Kris.</p>

      <p>She is being pursued by creditors and entered into a Individual Voluntary Agreement over her estimated Â£250,000 debts to the High Court.</p>
      <p>Katie was dressed for her shopping trip in a camouflage jumper and matching jogging pants.</p>
      <p>She wrapped up warm in a puffy coat with a fur-trimmed hood.</p>
      <p>A designer Gucci handbag hung around her neck and she clung to her shopping bags.</p>

      <p>Personal trainer Kris was also in his designer clobber, wearing jeans and a Kenzo jumper.</p>
      <p>He was well prepared for downpour too, carrying a large umbrella that he slung over his shoulder when he wasn't using it.</p>
      <p>One snap sees Kris carrying at least seven shopping bags, potentially stuffed with Christmas presents for his and Katie's loved ones.</p>
      <p>The couple recently got back together for the second time and they've had a rollercoaster of a relationship.</p>
      <p>Not long after they got together, she dumped him for younger man Alex Addison, with Kris talking to the Sunday Mirror about his devastation that the romance was over.</p>

      <p>They got back together around the time of his 30th birthday and she announced her engagement to him on Loose Women, showing off her new diamond ring.</p>
      <p>They split again when Katie hooked up with builder Charles Drury, who she met when he was working on her house.</p>
      <p>And while she and Kris are back together once more, it doesn't appear that the engagement is back on just yet.</p>
      <p>Kris recently dropped hints that he's ready to have a baby with Katie, and she's suggested it could happen in the next year.</p>
