      <p>Apple’s Mac Pro, announced earlier this year, will be made available for buyers next month.</p>
      <p>The Mac Pro will be sold alongside a new Apple Pro Display XDR, a reference Display that’s impressively specced. It’s a 32 inch 6K retina display which goes up to 1,600 nits of brightness at its peak. It’s also very expensive. How expensive? Well, if you have to ask…</p>
      <p>“We designed Mac Pro for users who require a modular system with extreme performance, expansion and configurability. With its powerful Xeon processors, massive memory capacity, groundbreaking GPU architecture, PCIe expansion, Afterburner accelerator card and jaw-dropping design, the new Mac Pro is a monster that will enable pros to do their life’s best work,” <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/">said Phil Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing all the way back in June.</a> “Pro Display XDR is the world’s best pro display and the perfect companion to the all-new Mac Pro. With Retina 6K resolution, gorgeous colour, extreme brightness and contrast ratio, and a highly functional design, Pro Display XDR delivers the most comprehensive set of features ever offered on any display at this price point.”</p>
      <p>Apple’s new Mac Pro will start from $5,99 while the display sells from $4,999.</p>
