        <b>Fijian lock Leone Nakarawa has been provisionally suspended by Racing 92 after failing to return from the Rugby World Cup in the agreed time, the club has confirmed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 31-year-old returned two weeks later than scheduled having played in all four of the Pacific Islanders’ pool matches in Japan before being knocked out. Nakarawa was expected back in Paris on Monday, October 28, but did not return until Monday, November 11.</p>
      <p>In the meantime reports circulated that the French giants were considering sacking the Fijian legend while the Pacific Rugby Welfare claimed that Nakarawa was finishing building a house and that he had been granted permission by the Parisian club to do so.</p>

      <p>A statement released by Racing a day after Nakarawa’s eventual return confirmed that the player would be suspended until a disciplinary meeting to decide upon his full punishment.</p>

      <p>According to local reports, the meeting between Nakarawa and Racing 92 is due to take place on the eve of their Champions Cup clash with Munster on Saturday, November 23rd.</p>
      <p>The 61-capped international and 2016 Olympic gold medalist has not trained with the French club this week and is expected to be absent for their Champions Cup opener with champions Saracens on Sunday.</p>
