      <h1>Alexandria man Reuben flown back to Scotland after Bali horror crash</h1>
      <h2>The Vale born IT worker has been supported by people from throughout the area, and his work colleagues.</h2>

      <p>An Alexandria man left fighting for his life after a horror motorbike crash in Bali was due to return to Scotland on Monday.</p>
      <p>Reuben Armstrong boarded a flight on Sunday, headed for Glasgow, where he will continue treatment following the incident on the holiday island he calls his second home.</p>
      <p>The Lennox Herald reported how the Vale-born IT worker had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a severe head injury.</p>
      <p>But he is now back on home soil with mum Diane, from Tullichewan.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His best friend Lincoln Savage, who set up a Justgiving page to help pay for treatment in Bali and his repatriation, shared the good news with us and said: “It just makes you realise how lucky we are in this country to have the healthcare we do.</p>
      <p>“At this point in the UK, we would just be trying to give him our support.</p>
      <p>“The added stress of having to raise extra funds has been really difficult.</p>
      <p>“We have had to raise a lot of funds to get him back by a repatriation specialist which is a ridiculous amount of money.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Lincoln, who has known Reuben for the last decade, paid tribute to the company the pair work for, Equals, who have contributed to the funds.</p>
      <p>He said: “We both work in London and the company we’ve worked for has never seen anything like it.</p>
      <p>“On the day, they saved his life. If we didn’t get that money from our CEO, we don’t know what would have happened.</p>
      <p>“Since then they have been helping me with the loan to pay the medical bills while raising money in the background.</p>
      <p>“The whole company also donated a day’s wages which was about £13,000. They cancelled the Christmas party and all sorts.</p>
      <p>“It’s a testament to who he is. He’s really well liked and everyone at work has been saying he’s such a lovely guy. He’s always chatting to people.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was out with his friend on his motorbike when he crashed, hitting his head on a wall.</p>
      <p>He suffered frontal lobe damage in the smash and was initially in a coma before undergoing brain surgery.</p>
      <p>Because of the effect of the trauma on Reuben’s brain, he has become very agitated and is expected to resume treatment at Gartnavel Hospital following the 7500-mile flight.</p>
      <p>Lincoln, 29, said: “Surprisingly, he’s doing well.</p>
      <p>“Physically he’s in good condition but he’s still struggling to come to terms with what’s happened.</p>
      <p>“The shock for him of waking up in the hospital in Bali, with his mum and gran has been really confusing.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Reuben, who attended Levenvale Primary moved to Grimsby before setting up home in London 10 years ago. He split his time between there and Bali where he had just put a deposit down on a flat before the crash.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t wearing a helmet, which is fairly standard in Bali, when he came off his motorbike.</p>
      <p>His insurance company refused to pay out as a result and so family and friends had to launch a mass fundraising campaign to pay medical bills there and to get him home.</p>
      <p>This included a fundraiser earlier this month in Grimsby and various events at his workplace.</p>
      <p>A Justgiving page set up by Lincoln has also managed to raise over £38,000.</p>
