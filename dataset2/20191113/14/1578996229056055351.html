      <h1>We're Getting Another Friends Reunion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:32:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Kosin</a></address>
      <p>It's all happening. Sources tell <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-works-at-hbo-max-1254331?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_2019-11-12%2015:45:00_lgoldberg&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> that a <i>Friends </i>reunion special with all six members of the original cast is in the works at HBO Max.</p>
      <p>There's no deal in place just yet, but if it goes through, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer will appear alongside show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman for an unscripted special.</p>
      <p>HBO Max recently won the rights to <i>Friends</i> in a bidding war with Netflix, and will premiere the show on its platform when it launches in 2020. <i>Friends</i> <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28339156/friends-leaving-netflix-2020/">will leave Netflix</a> at the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>This will be the first time all six original cast members reunite for a public event since the show aired its last episode in 2004. In 2016, Aniston, Cox, Kudrow, LeBlanc and Schwimmer appeared together for an interview to celebrate the work of director James Burrows. Perry was appearing in a play in London and couldn't attend, but filmed a short video tribute that aired during the event.</p>
      <p>It's been an buzzy year in the <i>Friends</i> universe. September marked the 25th anniversary of the show, and <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28543121/friends-apartment-pop-up-exhibit-25th-anniversary/">a month-long pop-up in New York</a> featured photo ops with recreations of the show's most iconic moments. Aniston even marked the occasion by joining Instagram with a candid photo of all six cast members hanging out together. The photo <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/16/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-broke-instagram-trnd/index.html">hilariously broke Instagram</a> for a short period of time.</p>

      <p>Despite news of the reunion, there's still no plan for a reboot of the show. Aniston <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jennifer-aniston-reveals-why-she-finally-joined-instagram-1250338">told Ellen Degeneres</a> "no" when she asked about the possibility, but also dropped the first hint of the reunion special. "We would love for there to be something, but we don't know what that something is," she said. "So we're just trying. We're working on something."</p>
