        <i>Good morning.</i>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court finally heard arguments over the future of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program that has kept roughly 700,000 young, unauthorized immigrants in limbo for years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s what you need to know:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Need a refresher on DACA and Dreamers?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2012, President Barack Obama introduced the program, which shields people who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. It was intended as a stopgap measure, and didn’t provide a pathway to citizenship.</p>
      <p>But it did allow participants, known as Dreamers, to get work permits, and in some states, <a href="https://edsource.org/2017/understanding-daca-and-education-in-california-a-quick-guide/586829">including California</a>, to access in-state tuition and legally drive. Dreamers can renew their status in two-year intervals.</p>
      <p>Recipients who aren’t veterans have to be enrolled in high school or have a diploma or G.E.D. and cannot — contrary to what <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194219655717642240?s=20">President Trump has said</a> — have a serious criminal history.</p>
      <p>In 2017, President Trump moved to end the program after nine conservative state attorneys general threatened to sue over it. They said it was an overreach of presidential power. President Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/supreme-court-dreamers-case.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">has been conflicted</a> about the program, and his public statements have reflected that.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What happened this week?</b>
      </p>
      <p>After years of failed negotiations and fights in lower courts, the case headed to the Supreme Court, setting up one of the most important showdowns of the court’s term.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/supreme-court-dreamers.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">my colleagues reported</a>, the conservative majority of justices seemed prepared to let the Trump administration end the program, although the more liberal justices expressed skepticism about the administration’s rationale for ending DACA.</p>
      <p>Now, we wait for a decision, which is expected by June.</p>
      <p>

        </a>
        <i> in the case.]</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How is California involved?</b>
      </p>
      <p>California’s connections to the fight are multifaceted and deep.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Janet Napolitano, who is set to step down as president of the <a href="https://edsource.org/2019/uc-president-janet-napolitano-stepping-down/617643">University of California next year</a>, sued to protect the program she helped create as secretary of homeland security. That made U.C. the first university to do so.</p>
      <p>“America is a beacon of justice and opportunity and today we stood up for the young immigrants who seek both,” Ms. Napolitano said on Tuesday in Washington, where she was joined by undocumented students from the university, as well as professors.</p>
      <p>

        </a>
        <i>.]</i>
      </p>
      <p>And most of those young immigrants live in California — Los Angeles, in particular, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/05/us/politics/who-are-the-dreamers.html?module=inline">a demographic analysis</a> of Dreamers. More than a quarter of initial program acceptances — 222,795 — were for Californians. The median age of entry into the U.S. was 6 years old.</p>
      <p>Finally, a couple of the lawyers arguing before the court on Tuesday hailed from California. Most notably, there was <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/theodore-olson">Theodore Olson</a>, the conservative legal giant who argued for the winning side in Bush v. Gore, which handed the presidency to George W. Bush. He later disappointed some allies when he challenged California’s ban on same-sex marriage.</p>
      <p>In the DACA case, he has served as an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/theodore-olson-dreamers-supreme-court.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article">unlikely ally to Dreamers.</a></p>

      <p>In Pomona, a girl celebrated her Afro-Latina heritage with what she called a “quincenegra.” In Bakersfield, a girl honored her Muslim faith and made her entrance on a horse; she’s part of a riding club.</p>
      <p>Others are breaking from traditional gender roles. Or having “double” quinces when they’re 30 and feel as if they’re firmly enough into womanhood to properly recognize it.</p>
