      <h1>Bittersweet day for Aleksandar Mitrovic, high-flying Bees and Leyton Orient's early FA Cup exit</h1>
      <h2>The EFL talking points from another busy weekend in the Championship and the FA Cup</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:56:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Sanders</a></address>
      <p>It was another action-packed weekend in the Football League, with the London derby between Millwall and Charlton one of the big games in the Championship.</p>
      <p>A late goal from Matt Smith earned Millwall the bragging rights as the Lions won 2-1 at the Den, with Gary Rowett enjoying another home win, after a victory against his old side Stoke City in his first game in charge.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, there were wins for Fulham and Brentford, while Queens Park Rangers drew 2-2 with Middlesbrough at Loftus Road.</p>
      <p>Below, we take a look at the talking points from the weekend action.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Millwall remain Championship kings of south east London</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 91st minute winner from Matt Smith might have come as a surprise - especially considering the striker hasn't found the net since the end of September - but Millwall beating Charlton will be seen as anything but.</p>
      <p>The Addicks were hot on the heels of the top-two earlier in the season and were seven points clear of their south London rivals less than two months ago, but after leaving The Den with that familiar losing feeling, Charlton have seen that gap closed to just a single point after Smith's last-gasp header, with the Addicks continuing to miss Lyle Taylor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bittersweet afternoon for Mitrovic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Only in one of Fulham's seven Championship victories this season has Aleksandar Mitrovic not been on the scoresheet, so it was no surprise the Serbian striker came up trumps when the Whites needed him most against Birmingham City on Saturday.</p>

      <p>After five points from a possible 15 available, Scott Parker's job looked in doubt, but Mitrovic's second-half winner at St Andrew's could prove to be a turning point - a result that saw Fulham temporarily climb back into the top-six before Bristol City won at Cardiff a day later.</p>
      <p>However it wasn't all rosy for the league's top goalscorer, who earlier received his fifth card of the campaign and will miss next Friday's west London derby against QPR after the international break through suspension.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bees flying high</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brentford proved that their shock home defeat by Huddersfield Town last weekend was a minor blip as they blew Wigan away and became the first visiting side to score three goals at the DW Stadium since Sheffield United did on New Year's Day.</p>

      <p>The only surprise was that Ollie Watkins didn't add to his impressive league tally, but the Bees are closing in on the play-off places after remarkably finding themselves on the cusp of the relegation zone only a matter of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leyton Orient suffer humiliation</b>
      </p>
      <p>If October was a month to remember, November has most certainly been a month to forget for Leyton Orient.</p>
      <p>The O's began Carl Fletcher's reign with an impressive victory at Grimsby Town, which was their third league win in succession, but three games without a win has seen Orient slide towards the wrong end of the table.</p>
      <p>However, a kind FA Cup draw against a team more than 70 places below them in the football pyramid looked to be the ideal distraction on their return to the first round. But it turned out to be a disastrous afternoon for Fletcher's men, who were beaten 2-1 by Essex-based Maldon &amp; Tiptree in front of a shell-shocked Brisbane Road crowd - a result that came just eight days after the O's lost to Morecambe, who sit bottom of the Football League.</p>
