      <p>OTTAWA – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting with Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet on Parliament Hill, as he continues his week of meetings with the opposition leaders in advance of Parliament resuming on Dec. 5.</p>
      <p>During a pre-meeting photo opportunity, Trudeau said he was looking forward to discussing their “shared priorities,” listing fighting climate change, affordability, gun control and protecting supply management as examples.</p>
      <p>“We also have conversations in which we disagree but it’ll be done in respect because I think Canadians expect different parties in Parliament to work together constructively and that’s exactly what I intend to do,” Trudeau said.</p>
      <p>Blanchet said he is also looking for collaboration on some issues that arose on the campaign trail, citing climate change and health care as examples, in French.</p>
      <p>The Bloc Quebecois leader said he hopes that this Parliament will work “politely, peacefully, with the only consideration of getting some progress on the issues which have been made important by the people during the last election.”</p>
      <p>He is scheduled to hold a post-meeting media availability later this morning.</p>
      <p>Blanchet, who is entering the House of Commons for the first time as an elected official, is then meeting with his caucus for their first post-election gathering in Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Like Blanchet, the majority of the party’s 32 MPs are parliamentary rookies who were elected on Oct. 21 as part of a resurgence of the party in Quebec.</p>
      <p>The party now holds third-party status in the House of Commons, and potentially the balance of power on certain issues, given the Liberals are 13 votes short of the majority they need to pass their initiatives</p>
      <p>Trudeau began his series of short sit-down interviews with Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer on Tuesday<b>.</b></p>
