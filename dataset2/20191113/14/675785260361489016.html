      <p>Piers Morgan has hit out at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry following reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-prince-harry-spend-20862479">couple will not be spending Christmas Day with the Royal Family</a> .</p>
      <p>During an interview with the Mirror's Kevin Maguire, the controversial host accused the Sussexes of 'snubbing' the Queen with their festive plans.</p>
      <p>It is understood that Meghan and Harry will travel to California to spend time with her mum Doria Ragland, taking little Archie with them.</p>
      <p>It will be part of a six-week break from their royal duties when they will spend some “much-needed” family time together.</p>
      <p>It is believed that Remembrance Sunday was their last joint public engagement ahead of their trip.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, Piers said: "It is a clear snub to the Queen."</p>

      <p>The Mail's Andrew Pierce said: "How many more Christmasses is she going to have? Not many.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s clear that Harry has fallen out with his brother and there is tension with Meghan and Kate.</p>
      <p>"People were so glad when Harry married that woman and now you never see him looking happy anymore."</p>
      <p>Speaking out the fallout between Harry and William, Kevin adds: "There is a very personal dispute there and it’s clearly wounded them."</p>
      <p>Piers then continues to rant about the couple, referring to their South Africa documentary in which they both discussed struggling with life in the royal spotlight.</p>

      <p>Meghan admitted she wasn't okay while Harry confirmed struggles in his relationship with his brother.</p>
      <p>Piers said: "Imagine going to make a documentary in South Africa and then turning the documentary into a “woe is me” about your terrible life and making all the headlines about you.</p>
      <p>"You have a palace full of servants, she is playing the media game."</p>
      <p>When Susanna Reid tried to have her say on the issue, he adds: "Why are you sticking up the royals?</p>
      <p>"She’s an actress Susanna and she realised she was getting all this negative press and has turned on the waterworks to make us feel sorry for her."</p>

      <p>Even though Meghan and Harry are expected to skip Sandringham, the rest of the family and believed to be attending as normal.</p>
      <p>They had been expected to return to the UK after their trip to the States to spend the remainder of the holiday season with the Queen at Sandringham in Norfolk.</p>
      <p>However, a senior palace source had told how the couple haven’t yet decided when they will come back and may yet stay and spend the Christmas holidays in the States.</p>
      <p>The source said: “It’s too early to tell exactly what they will end up doing, they haven’t decided.”</p>
      <p>This will be their first Christmas as a family-of-three following the birth of Archie in May.</p>
