      <p>In an exclusive chat with Filmfare, producer Juno Chopra revealed, “The idea to remake the film was suggested by Akshay Kumar. He had come home to meet us one day. That’s when he asked us why we were not remaking Pati Patni Aur Woh, which was made under our own banner.” When we asked him that was Akshay his first choice for the film? Juno replied, “No, we never thought of him casting in the film. Kartik was our first choice always.”</p>
      <p>Directed by Mudassar Aziz, Pati Patni Aur Woh is scheduled to release on December 6.</p>
