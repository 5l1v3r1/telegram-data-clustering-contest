      <p>Fire chiefs and police have now completed their probe into the Cameron House blaze – almost two years since the tragedy.</p>
      <p>The Crown Office, which is investigating the deaths of two guests at the Loch Lomond hotel, confirmed it has now received a report from Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And police investigating the fire told the Lennox they have also handed a report on the fire to the Crown Office.</p>
      <p>The tragic blaze on December 18, 2017 claimed the lives of Simon Midgley, 38, and Richard Dyson, 32 with the cause of the fire still to be revealed.</p>
      <p>Local politicians have been calling for answers for the past 23 months but last week it was revealed that answers may be in sight.</p>

      <p>In a letter to Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie a couple of weeks ago, Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC said the final SFRS report was due.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Officer Ross Haggart, SFRS’ director of prevention and protection, said: “The SFRS investigations into the circumstances surrounding the incident at Cameron House on December 18, 2017 have been extremely complex.</p>
      <p>“We have now finalised and submitted our reports on the incident to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service’s Health and Safety Investigation Unit for their further consideration.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police Scotland are still to hand in their final report to prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The Crown Office will decide whether any legal proceedings will be held once all the reports are in.</p>
      <p>The development comes as hotel owners revealed the cost of repairs to fix the luxury building is expected to reach £23million.</p>
      <p>New accounts were submitted to Companies House by Cameron House Resort (Loch Lomond Ltd) last month.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, owners said the bill for the fire should be £18.5m but this has now risen to £23m, which should be met by their insurance firm.</p>
      <p>The report also states that the hotel had laid off 300 staff following the incident.</p>
      <p>It reads: “Assessments of total reinstatement costs and related insurance proceeds are ongoing and at this time the estimated costs of reinstatement including contents total approximately £23m, the majority of which is expected to be reimbursed through insurance proceeds.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It goes on to state that they hope to be reopen in October next year.</p>
      <p>Reconstruction of the hotel is now well under way after owners received approval from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority to retain the B-listed facade and rebuild the entire internal frame, which is too badly damaged to be restored.</p>
      <p>They are also adding a 70-bedroom extension, which they say was planned before the fire.</p>
      <p>Parts of the hotel, including two restaurants, its lodges and the spa, have continued to operate.</p>
      <p>Jackie Baillie says she hope that the completion of the fire report means answers will be drawn soon.</p>
      <p>She said: “The completion of the SFRS report is very welcome indeed and I hope that the Senior Advocate Depute can start to draw conclusions from the evidence provided in the findings from a number of different agencies, including the police.”</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokesman said: “The Crown is committed to ensuring that the facts are thoroughly investigated by the relevant agencies, fully considered by the COPFS and, in due course, aired in an appropriate legal forum.”</p>
      <p>Police Scotland said: “A police report has been submitted to the Crown.”</p>
