      <p>RIVERDALE, Bronx (WABC) -- Police are searching for a group of masked burglars who broke into a Bronx mansion and got away with more than $100,000 worth of valuables.</p>
      <p>The home belongs to Don Ghermezian, the CEO of the American Dream Mall and Mall of America.</p>
      <p>Reportedly no one was home when it happened at 5 p.m. Sunday, raising the question how the burglars knew they wouldn't encounter anyone inside.</p>
      <p>The NYPD has released video showing the men leaving the mansion after they climbed to a second floor balcony in the rear of the home on Grosvenor Street.</p>
      <p>They were able to get their hands on $140,000 worth of handbags and jewelry before taking off.</p>
      <p>Police also released an image one of the suspects on the balcony. They are hoping someone might recognize the backpack in the picture.</p>
      <p>The mansion belongs to Don Ghermezian, CEO of the Triple five Group, which purchased the partially open American Dream Mall in the Meadowlands.</p>
      <p>The group also owns Mall of America and the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada.</p>
      <p>Reports are that Ghermezian learned about the break in when his security system notified him.</p>
