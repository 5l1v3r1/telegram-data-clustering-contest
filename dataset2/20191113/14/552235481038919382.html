      <p>Police in Ayrshire have renewed an appeal for witnesses after an 83-year-old woman was robbed in Ardrossan. <br/>  <br/>The woman was approached by an unidentified man and robbed while she was walking on the town's Winton Street around 2.55pm on Sunday, November 10. <br/>  <br/>She was uninjured but badly shaken as a result of the robbery. Her purse was stolen during the incident. <br/>  <br/>Detective Sergeant Stephen McCulloch said: “Our inquiries into this robbery are ongoing and we are continuing to appeal for help from the public to identify the man responsible.</p>
      <p>"We have established that a man was seen loitering in the doorway of VG Stores on Glasgow Street for some time before the robbery.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"A number of people passed him and we would urge anyone who may have been in the area to come forward.</p>
      <p>"He is described as being white, in his 30s, around 5ft 10 in in height with black curly hair.  He was wearing black clothing with distinctive white flashes on his trousers and a black hat.</p>
      <p>"We would urge anyone who may have been in the area to come forward. You may not have thought anything of what you saw at the time but it could be of use to our inquiry."</p>
