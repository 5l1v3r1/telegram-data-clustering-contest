      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. -- Deputies have charged a Lehigh Acres man with drug trafficking and smuggling after they say he received a shipped package of Fentanyl.</p>
      <p>According to a Lee County Sheriff's Office report, a supervisor at a shipping facility became suspicious of a package sent from Puerto Rico and contacted authorities to investigate it.</p>
      <p>A K-9 unit detected the presence of narcotics in the package.</p>
      <p>Investigators later observed 30-year-old Stephan Carrion Velazquez arrive at the post office and pick it up on November 8th. Investigators obtained a search warrant for his vehicle and found a package inside the box containing 1196.6 grams (42 ounces) of Fentanyl.</p>
      <p>Velazquez was placed under arrest for Trafficking in Fentanyl, 4 grams or more; and Synthetic Narcotic- Smuggle Schedule I II into State.</p>
