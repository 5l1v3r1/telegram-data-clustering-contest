      <h1>Why Notts County boss Neal Ardley mentioned Man City and Liverpool to Notts County squad after Ebbsfleet win</h1>
      <h2>Magpies are flying high after losing just three of their last 19 games</h2>

      <p>Neal Ardley believes Notts County are showing an incredible will to win this season as he hailed their "brilliant spirit".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> secured a thrilling 3-2 win at Ebbsfleet in the FA Cup on Saturday thanks to Ben Turner’s injury-time header which came moments after they had conceded a penalty.</p>
      <p>It followed on from an excellent fight back against Hartlepool where Notts came from two goals down to salvage a 2-2 draw at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>Magpies boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> has been particularly pleased with the way his players have taken to the video analysis when it comes to their education, but says the spirit on the pitch is there for all to see.</p>
      <p>“The whole point of doing video analysis is not to single people out,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s to show that if this happens again, then let’s learn from it.</p>

      <p>“The most pleasing thing is that I feel I have a group of boys who really take it on board.</p>
      <p>“They have a brilliant spirit. They have a will to win.</p>
      <p>“I said to them after the game on Saturday that with Man City and Liverpool, is that they are not only the best teams in the country, but their will to win is great.</p>
      <p>“If they keep that, keep fit, we can achieve something.”</p>
