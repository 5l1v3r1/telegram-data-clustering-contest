      <p>AUBURN, Ala. -- A Texas-based non-profit that works to find missing people across the country has called off its search for UFC heavyweight Walt Harris' missing stepdaughter.</p>
      <p>Destinie Duvall of Texas EquuSearch tells WRBL-TV the horse-mounted search group is heading home after using "every resource available" to search for 19-year-old Aniah Blanchard in Auburn, Alabama.</p>
      <p>Blanchard was last seen on Oct. 23 at an Auburn gas station. Her damaged car was later found abandoned.</p>
      <p>Twenty-nine-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed has been arrested and charged with first-degree kidnapping. Surveillance video puts him at the gas station at the same time as Blanchard. He was free on bond in an earlier kidnapping case at the time.</p>
      <p>The search and rescue group looked in areas along Interstate 85, the Tuskegee National Forest and area waterways, The Opelika-Auburn News reported.</p>
      <p>"We've used every resource available to use over the last nine days to locate Aniah," Duvall said. "It's always hard to leave folks without the answer we came here to find."</p>
      <p>Texas EquuSearch is hopeful investigators will be able to provide new leads and they could then rejoin the search effort.</p>
      <p>"We have faith in the Auburn Police Division, the public and other agencies involved in finding us a new lead," Duvall said. "We're prepared to come back immediately when the call comes."</p>
