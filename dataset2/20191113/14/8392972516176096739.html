      <p>Fresh from her trip to Dubai, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/gemma-collins/">Gemma Collins</a> rocked a new hairstyle on the red carpet of ITV's Palooza.</p>
      <p>Wearing a floor-length green sequinned dress from her own collection, Gemma showed off her curves – and her new bangs – at London's Royal Festival Hall.</p>
      <p>Arriving at the party, the style chameleon appeared to have had a fringe cut in as she posed up a storm on the red carpet.</p>

      <p>"Your hair looks amazing. I have the same shaped face but haven’t had the guts to get a fringe cut. Seeing this has given me a bit more confidence," said another.</p>

      <p>Inside, as she shared videos of Olly Murs performing with Sir Tom Jones, Gemma clearly decided that enough was enough and the fringe had to go.</p>

      <p>She could be seen on her Instagram Stories fringe-less, leading some to speculate that she must've worn a clip-on fringe for her arrival.</p>
      <p>As she left the glitzy party, Gemma's fringe was nowhere to be seen.</p>
