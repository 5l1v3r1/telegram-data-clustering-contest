      <h1>Man jailed over sexual abuse of a girl after NSPCC spoke at victim's school</h1>
      <h2>Clive Oliver, 71, of Woodside Road in Sandiacre, was jailed for three years</h2>

      <p>A pensioner was told he may have caused a lifetime of damage as he was jailed for the sexual abuse of a girl.</p>
      <p>Clive Oliver, 71, who suffers from an aggressive form of prostate cancer, was told by Judge Stuart Rafferty QC that "children under the age of 13 are sacrosanct" as he was sentenced at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">Nottingham Crown Court</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a 32-month sentence was handed to Oliver of Woodside Road, Sandiacre. He was freed halfway through the term.</p>
      <p>Later the second offence came to light when the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nspcc">NSPCC</a> went to the victim's school and spoke of child abuse. Oliver pleaded guilty to sexual assault.</p>
      <p>The judge told him: "You may die in prison. That, I am afraid, is a risk people who commit offences of this kind take.</p>
      <p>"It gives me no satisfaction at all. That is not my business. My business is passing the appropriate sentence for what happened.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult to contemplate the end of a life facing certain death with a weight of guilt on your shoulders. I hope you find some sort of resolution before it is too late."</p>
      <p>He said that Oliver had delayed the investigation by suggesting ways in which the abuse was accidental.</p>
      <p>The judge said the girl needlessly felt guilty and had been badly affected by the abuse.</p>
      <p>"The damage is something none of us can calibrate. It may be a lifetime, I hope not," the judge added.</p>
      <p>Jon Fountain, prosecuting, said the second offence came to light as the result of the NSPCC campaign "Speak Up, Stay Safe."</p>
      <p>Officials visited schools to give children "the courage to speak out."</p>
      <p>Mr Fountain added: "It did give her courage."</p>
      <p>Mark Watson, mitigating, told the court: "He has prostate cancer which appears to be aggressive.</p>
      <p>"He has been given various timelines but it is terminal. Eighteen months ago, he was told that he had four years.</p>
      <p>"A new doctor is trying a different regime and it is unknown.</p>
      <p>"These are factors which mean either he will be released for a short period of time before the cancer takes its final grip or he will not get that far."</p>
      <p>He said that grey haired Oliver, who used a walking stick, had shown remorse. He is due to be freed after 18 months to be monitored by probation officers.</p>
