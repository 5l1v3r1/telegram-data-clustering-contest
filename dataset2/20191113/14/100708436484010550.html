      <p>Last fall, Shonda Rhimes received an unexpected phone call, with a top-secret invitation. She was given the chance to read an advanced copy of the book; fly to Washington, D.C.; and share her thoughts with the author at a private gathering weeks before the chart-buster would hit bookstores.</p>
      <p>The superstar producer and writer behind <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> and <i>Scandal</i> told no one. The manuscript was “like a live baby I was afraid to leave home alone,” as Rhimes <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/by-shonda/a25030014/shonda-rhimes-review-michelle-obama-memoir-becoming/">described</a> it. Every free moment she had, she read.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to be prepared,” Rhimes <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/by-shonda/a25030014/shonda-rhimes-review-michelle-obama-memoir-becoming/">remembered</a>. “Because this was not any book club. This was <i>the</i> book club.”</p>
      <p>Eleven other black women writers and confidantes received a similar invitation. They included the National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson; the legendary radio journalist and first black woman NPR host, Michele Norris; the renowned poet Elizabeth Alexander, who had just been named president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation; the towering Johns Hopkins University historian Martha Jones, who had just published <i><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781316604724">Birthright Citizens</a></i>, which would win two book awards; another towering historian, Rutgers University’s Erica Armstrong Dunbar, whose latest book, <i><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501126413">Never Caught</a></i>, was a National Book Award finalist; one of America’s most influential literary scholars, Columbia University’s Farah Jasmine Griffin; the novelist Tayari Jones, whose <i><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781616201340">An American Marriage</a></i> was a <i>New York Times</i> best seller; the Pulitzer Prize–winning, two-time U.S. poet laureate Natasha Tretheway; the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill; and the author’s special assistant, Chynna Clayton, and her old friend from Harvard Law School Verna Williams, whose <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2018/11/16/her-secret-white-house-visits-seeded-michelle-obama-memoir/2013723002/">recorded conversations</a> with the author were crucial in the book’s development.</p>
      <p>The book appeared on bookshelves on this day last year and <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/03/26/michelle-obama-becoming-best-selling-memoir/">sold</a> 725,000 copies on its first day in stores. It sold <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/media/michelle-obama-book-sales/index.html">more than</a> 1.4 million copies in its first week on sale. Within two weeks, the book had sold 2 million copies in North America, becoming the <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/11/30/michelle-obama-becoming-sales/">best-selling book</a> of 2018.</p>
      <p>By March, with 10 million copies sold, publishing executives were already saying that this memoir of an African American woman <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/03/26/michelle-obama-becoming-best-selling-memoir/">was on track to become</a> one of the most successful memoirs in history. The canons of American literature and black women’s literature converged, as they rarely had before, in the form of <i>Becoming</i>, by Michelle Obama.</p>
      <p>Weeks before the former first lady of the United States started packing basketball arenas with thousands of excited readers, she packed a small conference table with about a dozen serious readers. She wasn’t after platitudes or cheerleaders. She wanted some of the best black women writers around to tell her “what we all really and truly think,” Rhimes <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/by-shonda/a25030014/shonda-rhimes-review-michelle-obama-memoir-becoming/">recounted</a>. And they did. And “all of the women at the roundtable felt a deep connection to this memoir,” Dunbar <a href="https://www.essence.com/culture/michelle-obamas-becoming-is-black-womens-history/">later wrote</a>. It was a connection so deep, they were all “caught up in Michelle’s embrace,” <a href="https://www.publicbooks.org/michelle-obamas-embrace/">Jones added</a>.</p>
      <p>They discussed <i>Becoming</i>. And much more.</p>
      <p>The end of the day neared. Obama sat back <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/by-shonda/a25030014/shonda-rhimes-review-michelle-obama-memoir-becoming/">and said</a>, “The other thing that several people mentioned is: When does a black woman from my background get to tell her own story in a way that will be read by millions of people? … We don’t have enough stories out there … We are blinded by our ignorance of what it means to be an American.”</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>I, for one, am striving to overcome my ignorance about what it means to be an American by reading the stories of black women, by black women, who have developed an inimitable viewpoint of America as they overcome the confines of their gender, race, and often class. We still don’t have enough stories out there. But the stories are coming, especially from black women. And we should all be reading them to better compose our stories in our minds, on our pages. When I say <i>we</i> and <i>our</i>, I’m especially talking to us nonblack women.</p>
      <p>On this, the one-year anniversary of the release of <i>Becoming</i>, I have compiled a list of 21 new releases from August to the year’s end—books of all kinds on my reading list—that showcase what black women’s literature this year is becoming, and what it has always been: essential to fully understanding the American story, the human story, and to what we are all becoming.</p>

      <p>It is a spectacular novel that only this legend can pull off, one that wrenches us to confront the life-altering and life-pulling and life-subsuming facts of history, of love, of expectations, of status, of parenthood, as only a teenage pregnancy can.</p>

      <p>Loosely based on her own teenage life, Parker’s debut young-adult novel is a beautiful salute to the black teenaged girl who struggled to tune out the haters and the dictators, who overcame and found the strength to live in herself voraciously, on her own terms.</p>

      <p>As this incredibly instructive memoir asks us, if Vernon can find her way to live unapologetically as a big-bodied black Muslim woman, if she can own the rebellion that is her body and hold her hijab-covered head high as people look down on her, then why can’t anyone living in an othered body—then why can’t we?</p>

      <p>Longlisted for the National Book Award, <i>Race for Profit </i>masterfully dissects how exploitative and racist real-estate practices continued well after housing discrimination was banned in 1968, with policies ostensibly encouraging low-income black homeownership that ended up opening the doors to new methods of exploiting black homeowners.</p>
