      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> have been left annoyed as they have accused Mick and Linda Carter of treating Ollie's autism like a terminal illness.</p>
      <p>For months, the couple have been worried that their son has Autism.</p>
      <p>In this week's episodes they took him</p>
      <p>for some assessments.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In last night's episode (November 12 2019), before going in for the assessments, Linda spoke to a woman in the waiting room who told her she was there with her son, and her daughter had been assessed last year.</p>
      <aside>When will Mick and Linda realise that autism isn't a terminal illness?</aside>
      <p>The woman told her autism is common in siblings and Linda responded by saying: "Well he's got two brothers and a sister and there's nothing wrong with them," but she quickly apologised for her choice of words.</p>
      <p>After Ollie had his assessment, Dr Fremantle told the Carters that Ollie demonstrated good attention to detail and carried out most of the tasks the practitioner set him with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However she also said taking into account the outcome of the assessment, the information Mick and Linda had given, and the findings from the school's observations, they had concluded Ollie has Autism Spectrum Disorder but is at the milder end.</p>
      <p>After confirming everything would be explained in a full report, Mick said: "So he's autistic then? And the report, it's definite, yeah?"</p>
      <p>However viewers weren't impressed with Mick and Linda's reaction and felt they were acting as if Ollie had a terminal illness.</p>
