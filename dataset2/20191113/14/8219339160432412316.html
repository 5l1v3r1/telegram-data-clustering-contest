      <p>Alongside the launch of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, Apple has officially discontinued the 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro has been hotly anticipated, and as expected, it delivers a return to the scissor switch keyboard. It also features up to 64GB of RAM, new six-speaker system, and more alongside the larger display.</p>
      <p>With all the improvements to its largest Pro notebook, Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/">discontinued</a> the <a href="https://amzn.to/2KxHUnl">15-inch MacBook Pro</a>.</p>
      <p>But while the 15-inch MacBook Pro isn’t available anymore in new condition from the company, it’s still available as <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/15-inch-macbook-pro">certified refurbished</a> from Apple. Meanwhile, if for whatever reason you’re not wanting to pick up the 16-inch MacBook Pro, we’re likely to see <a href="https://amzn.to/2KxHUnl">great discounts from retailers</a> with the remaining stock of the 15-inch models from <a href="https://amzn.to/2KxHUnl">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://bit.ly/2NIDprI">Best Buy</a>, and more.</p>
