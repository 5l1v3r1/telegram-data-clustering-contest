      <p>Sometimes, nature can be really cruel â€“ especially, when animals live with the reality of "eat or be eaten". After a seemingly successful hunt, this big lizard is either trying to get every last bit of turtle or simply got its head stuck inside its dinner's shell, if that is the case, it would appear that the defeated turtle still got the "last laugh".</p>
