      <p>In a new interview, Osbourne teased Cowell for the size of his teeth and eyes while praising the judge for his weight loss.</p>
      <p>“I think he looks great. I think he looks absolutely great. The teeth are a bit big and one eye's kinda droopy but I think he looks great,” Osbourne said on “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mickey-rourke-good-morning-britain-cowboy">Good Morning Britain</a>.”</p>

      <p>Osbourne, 67, also noted that she hasn’t spoken to her former “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sharon-osbourne-claims-simon-cowell-axed-her-from-x-factor-due-to-her-age">X Factor</a>” co-worker in more than a year.</p>
      <p>“'I haven't spoken to him in so long, last May was the last time. Not this year but the year before. So it's been a while.”</p>

      <p>Cowell, 60, made the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/simon-cowell-weight-loss">decision to lose weight</a> following a fall that led to his hospitalization in 2017.</p>
      <p>Cowell eventually shed 20 pounds after making several lifestyle changes — including eliminating alcohol and meat from his diet.</p>

      <p>“I am [scared], sure, because you could wake up and look like cyclops. I had this thing where they lifted up my mouth and then for the first week I couldn’t feel my mouth. I can hardly feel my mouth now, to be honest with you. I couldn’t find my mouth,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“But it was numb,” she continued. “It was up on one side and I looked like Elvis. All the kids and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ozzy-osbourne-health-issues-fall">Ozzy [Osbourne]</a> were like, ‘Why are you snarling at me?’ I’m like, ‘I’m not snarling, I’m not doing anything!’”</p>
