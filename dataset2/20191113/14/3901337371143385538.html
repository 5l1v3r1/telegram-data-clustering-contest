      <p>Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo is seemingly an unhappy camper at Juventus after being substituted in two consecutive games, which prompted angry responses from the five-time Ballon d'Or winner. Manager Maurizio Sarri has alluded to a fitness issue, but there appears to be a new development.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was taken off in the 82nd minute of a UEFA Champions League tie against Lokomotiv Moscow last week, a decision he did not seem happy with.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo seemed to have a few words with Sarri as he was replaced by Paulo Dybala, but <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-unhappy-with-substitution-maurizio-sarri-explains-his-reaction/666939">the former Chelsea manager played the incident down</a>, claiming his superstar forward was struggling with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>This substitution was repeated by the Italian tactician when Juve hosted AC Milan this past Sunday, again swapping the former Real Madrid man with Dybala, this time in the 55th minute. Â </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/frustrated-cristiano-ronaldo-storms-off-pitch-leaves-stadium-maurizio-sarri-responds/667218">Ronaldo caused even more of a stir when he came off against Milan,</a> though, as he decided to head straight for the tunnel instead of the bench, with reports suggesting he also left the stadium early.</p>
      <p>Sarri once again looked to throw water over the fire, claiming his star man was still struggling with fitness issues, despite Ronaldo's angry response seemingly suggesting otherwise.</p>

      </p>
      <p>What is perhaps more telling is the ex-Los Blancos man has still joined up with the Portugal national team ahead of their 2020 European Championship qualifiers later this week, and has reportedly trained without any limitations.</p>
      <p><i>The Portugal News</i> claimed Ronaldo has not shown "any physical problems" on the training ground with his international colleagues, further suggesting that Sarri may have simply been taking him off due to his performances not being up to standard.</p>

      <p>Portugal require one win in their next two matches, against Lithuania and Luxembourg, to qualify for the tournament that will be hosted across several European countries as they look to defend their title.</p>
