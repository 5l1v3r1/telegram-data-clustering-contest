      <p>WAKISO<b>-The family of 41-year-old Robert Kituuka, of Namulanda along Entebbe Road, were left puzzled after the latter was returned home in a coffin, just a month after his imprisonment in Kigo prison.</b></p>
      <p>According to Olive Nakate a widow to the deceased, Kituuka was detained on October 16, over land-related matters. "Court had ordered him to refund sh8.8m or be imprisoned for three years," said  Nakate.</p>
      <p>"I had finished all the paperwork to secure a loan for his release when I got contacted on Monday by prison warders who said my husband had died of a heart attack and told me to pick the body from Mulago Hospital," added Nakate.</p>

      <p>Gabriel Musqua a friend to the deceased, intimated that he last visited Kituuka weeks ago, but the latter never complained of any illness while in prison. "It then beats my understanding to be told that, he died of heart complications,” said Musqua.</p>
      <p>Kituuka had seven children; he was buried on Tuesday at Gerenge village in Katabi town council, Wakiso district. When contacted about the matter, Frank Baine the public relations officer for prison services excused himself to first contact the in-charge Kigo prison for a detailed report. He had not replied by press time.</p>
