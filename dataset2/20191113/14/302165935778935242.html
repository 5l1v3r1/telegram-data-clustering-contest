      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — A mobile application has been developed to help plan travelling using KL Rapid Bus on the actual time of arrival of the public transport at a certain location.</p>
      <p>The Transport Ministry in a written reply displayed on Parliament website said the usage of technology will enable commuters know the arrival and departure of buses to facilitate them plan their journeys.</p>
      <p>“Prasarana (Prasarana Malaysia Berhad) will also ensure the recruitment of drivers is conducted more frequently to overcome the shortage of drivers which affected the bus operation,” the ministry said.</p>
      <p>The ministry was replying to a question by P. Prabakaran (PH-Batu) who asked the Transport Minister to explain how the ministry intends to ensure public buses such as KL Rapid Bus provide their service according to schedule.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the ministry also stated that the perception of bus service monopoly in the Klang Valley was inaccurate as there are other bus companies apart from those under Prasarana.</p>
      <p>“The government will study and implement the bus contracting model which is more efficient and encourages competition in future,” said the ministry.</p>
      <p>This was in reply to a question by Prabakaran who wanted an clarification from the ministry on whether there is a monopoly system by the bus company in Kuala Lumpur. — Bernama</p>
