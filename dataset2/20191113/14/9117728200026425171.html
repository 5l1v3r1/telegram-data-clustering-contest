        <b>According to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> deputy team principal Claire Williams, the spare parts shortage, responsible for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a>'s retirement at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, is down to a "huge run of bad luck".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The British team are once again rock-bottom of the constructors' standings after another dismal season, scoring just one point through Kubica, and their financial issues have been apparent all season long.</p>
      <p>Kubica was called into the pits just after <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> crashed out of the race with a wheel problem. Williams revealed how challenging this period has been for the team.</p>

      <p><i>"We've had a huge run of bad luck, which considering the year that we have had this year, is probably not wholly surprising," </i>the deputy team principal said to <i>RaceFans.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"A lot of the race attrition that we had with the front wing damage in particular has been predominantly out of our control. We've had racing incidents with other drivers coming into the car and causing those issues. But it has put an enormous pressure on the team, clearly, particularly in operations and manufacturing."</i>
      </p>
      <p>However, Williams did praise her team for the work they've done considering the circumstances: <i>"I have to say, the job that has been done at the factory in order to make sure that we are back at a level we need to be, they've done an amazing job."</i></p>
