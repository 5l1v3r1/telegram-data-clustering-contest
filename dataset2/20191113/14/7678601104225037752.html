      <h1>'How dare you': Offices hang photos of Greta Thunberg near single-use plastics</h1>

      <p>A new trend is taking hold in Israel, and this time, it involves the famous Greta Thunberg, or at least, her picture. </p>
      <p>Offices in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem have recently begun hanging up photos of Thunberg to remind employees not to use single-use plastics, reported the <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/greta-thunberg-plastic-single-use-office-workers-shame-climate-change-a9196871.html">Independent</a></i>. The photos, taken by journalist Allison K. Sommer, show Thunberg’s “judgmental” expression alongside quotes such as "How dare you" and "Are you sure?", and are placed in cafeterias, near plastic utensils and single-use coffee cups. </p>

      <p>Thunberg is a 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist known for her work with the United Nations. </p>
      <p>“People are suffering. People are dying. And all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you,” the activist said during one of her climate protest speeches. <br/>Israel is currently the world’s second largest per capita consumer of single-use plastics, according to the Times of Israel. The trend, dubbed "Greta-shaming", began after Ikea Israel announced it would cease to provide single-use plastics by 2020.  </p>
      <p>The use of Thunberg’s photos to shame single-use plastic users has been met with both amusement and support around the world.</p>
      <p>“I think this is great! Israel has a conscience and a sense of humor,” one person tweeted. </p>
      <p>"I'll have to try that at work.... for a good laugh," said another. (vel/kes)</p>
