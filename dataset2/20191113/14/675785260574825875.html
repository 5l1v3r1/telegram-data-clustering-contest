      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:09:05+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> has officially begun at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/currys-group-plc">Curry's PC World,</a> and this year they're taking things further than ever before, handing out free <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> Nest Minis to customers that pick up a Fitbit.</p>
      <p>Previously £113, the Fitbit HR will now set you back <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Ffitness-trackers%2Ffitbit-inspire-hr-fitness-white-nest-mini-chalk-bundle-10201456-pdt.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcurrys-selling-cheapest-fitbit-even-20874039">£74.99 at Curry's,</a> which the electrical retailer classes as its "lowest price ever". And even better, everyone that decides to purchase it will also get a completely free Google Nest Mini, worth £49.</p>
      <p>Bearing in mind that Amazon are still selling the exact same Fitbit HR <a href="https://amzn.to/2qSKyN6">for £82.98</a> - that doesn't come with any additional freebie - it's a considerable saving.</p>

      <p>The bargain offer is all thanks to Curry's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> deals, which launched earlier today - a whopping two weeks early. Although they don't call it Black Friday, they call it Black Tag.</p>
      <p>If you're scared of picking up a deal too early and prices getting cheaper on actual Black Friday, fear not, as Curry's has also announced a special Black Friday guarantee, which means that should prices go down on the big day, Currys PC World will refund you the difference.</p>
      <p>The lowest price we've ever seen the Fitbit HR is £69.99, although you can no longer get it for that price right now, with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-tech%2Fsmart-watches-and-fitness%2Ffitness-trackers%2Ffitbit-inspire-hr-fitness-white-nest-mini-chalk-bundle-10201456-pdt.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcurrys-selling-cheapest-fitbit-even-20874039">Curry's £74.99</a> being the cheapest price from a big brand retailer.</p>

      <p>So even if you don't want the Google Nest mini, if you're in the market for a Fitbit, this is probably one of your best options. Then you can just sell the Google Nest <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcurrys-selling-cheapest-fitbit-even-20874039">on eBay,</a> or gift it to someone for Christmas...</p>
      <p>As for the Google Nest mini, it's basically the same as the Google Home mini, apart from the fact that its fabric covering is made from 100 per cent recycled bottles, that it also has a new wall mounting hole, and improved audio quality. So essentially just the newer and slightly improved version of the usual Google Mini.</p>
