      <h1>Queen's corgis each had a special menu with royal chefs preparing lavish meals</h1>
      <h2>The Queen owned generations of corgis for almost 80 years - and they enjoyed a very special diet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:32:08+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Living in palaces and having acres of space to roam free in, the Queen's corgis were some of the most pampered pooches in Britain.</p>
      <p>Her Majesty had her beloved breed at her side for the best part of eight decade.</p>
      <p>Tragically, her final Corgi, Willow, had to be put to sleep last year - a death that is said to have hit the Queen "extremely hard".</p>
      <p>The dogs have been a constant in the monarch's life since she was given Susan as a present on her 18th birthday.</p>
      <p>So it will come as no surprise that the adorable dogs also had only the very best when it came to their meal times.</p>

      <p>As well as meticulously checking what the royal household will be eating each week, the Queen also insisted her beloved corgis had their own menus.</p>
      <p>Not only that, what they ate was pretty special too.</p>
      <p>Former chef Darren McCrady said: "They corgis have their own menu.</p>
      <p>"One day they'll have lamb, one day beef and then another, chicken."</p>
      <p>And how their doggy dinners are prepared is also very particular.</p>

      <p>Darren said: "We had to make sure that all the meat was cut very finely and diced so there were no bones because we couldn't have them choking."</p>
      <p>And Her Majesty was even happy for her dogs to share the limelight with her.</p>
      <p>On her 90th birthday, as well as being surrounded by her grandchildren, the official photo of the Queen also featured the corgis on the steps of Wndsor Castle.</p>
      <p>The Queen first fell in love with the breed when she was a child and fell in love with her father's corgi, Dookie.</p>
      <p>During her reign she has owned more tha 30 of the dogs and many of them, including Willow, were descendants of the first she owned, Susan.</p>
      <p>Susan even travelled with the Queen and Prince Philip on their honeymoon.</p>
      <p>The Queen made the difficult decision to stop breeding the Pembroke Welsh corgis four years ago amid fears she could trip over one and injure herself.</p>
      <p>It has also been claimed she also didn't want to leave any of her beloved pets behind when she dies.</p>
      <p>However, four years ago, Her Majesty, couldn't resist adopting a corgi, Whisper, when it's owner, Sandringham gamekeeper Bill Fenwick, died aged 93.</p>
      <p>The Queen is said to have given Bill and his wife Whisper as a present.</p>
      <p>Whisper passed away aged 12.</p>
