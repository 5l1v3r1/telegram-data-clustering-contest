      <p>The government has widen the scope of antidumping duty imposed on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jute">jute </a>yarn and sacking bags by including more companies of Bangladesh to protect domestic players from cheap inbound shipments.</p>
      <p>In a notification, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has said it has amended a notification dated January 1, 2017 to include more companies under the ambit of antidumping duties.</p>
      <p>The duties are in the range of $97.19 per tonne and $125.21 per tonne.</p>
      <p>It was in 2017, when it was first imposed on imports of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jute">jute </a>yarn and sacking bags coming from Bangladesh to guard domestic players from cheap imports.</p>
      <p>The anti-dumping duty is imposed on specific companies of a country.</p>
      <p>Based on complaint of local players, the Directorate General of Trade Remedies, (erstwhile DGAD) had initiated a probe into imports of the products in 2015.</p>
      <p>West Bengal is the major player in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jute">jute </a>industry, with 3.5-4 lakh people being employed in the sector.</p>
      <p>Countries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports.</p>
      <p>As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of the World Trade Organization.</p>
      <p>The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trade practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters.</p>
