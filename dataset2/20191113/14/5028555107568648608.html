      <p>Finally: a true <i>Pokémon</i> game on a flagship Nintendo console.</p>
      <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/how-i-neatly-fit-pokemon-lets-go-into-my-grown-up-gaming-life/">Last year’s <i>Pokémon Let’s Go</i> games</a> were technically the Switch’s first Pokémon RPGs, but those remakes of the original <i>Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> were greatly simplified and softened up to cater to newer and younger players who got their start with <i>Pokémon Go</i>. <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, on the other hand,<i> </i>are "real" mainline <i>Pokémon</i> games, serving as direct sequels to 2016’s <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> and continuing the franchise that began with <i>Red</i> and <i>Blue</i> in 1998 (1996 for Japanese players).</p>
      <p>That means<i> Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> feature the same basic skeleton that has grown into a <i>Pokémon</i> tradition over the past 20+ years. You pick a starter Pokémon and then travel around the region, catching more monsters and earning eight badges so you can earn the right to challenge the region’s Champion and become the very best, like no one ever was. Along the way, you encounter and vanquish a team of bumbling low-level criminals, repeatedly battle with a rival who helps you hone your skills, and solve a regional mystery that ends with you capturing one or more ancient legendary creatures.</p>
      <h3>Game Details</h3>
      <p><b>Developer:</b> Game Freak<br/><b>Publisher</b>: The Pokémon Company/Nintendo<br/><b>Platform</b>: Nintendo Switch<br/><b>Release Date:</b> November 15. 2019<br/><b>Price</b>: $60<br/><b>ESRB Rating</b>: E for Everyone<br/><b>Links:</b> <a href="https://amzn.to/33W39Xe">Amazon US</a> | <a href="https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/">Official website</a></p>
      <p>Because <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> throw you into the deep end pretty quickly, they’re not great introductions for newbies; try the <i>Let’s Go</i> games for that, or even <i>Pokémon Go</i>. But for series fans, these are the sequels you've been waiting for... with one substantial caveat.</p>
      <h3>Pokémon without all the Pokémon</h3>
      <p>Any discussion of what <i>has</i> changed in <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> needs to start with the games’ most controversial subtraction: for the first time in the series’ history, a mainline <i>Pokémon</i> game won’t actually include all the Pokémon.</p>
      <p>Every <i>Pokémon </i>game has a “regional” Pokédex that blends the region’s new creatures with a cross-section of monsters from older games. But after you beat the main quest, previous titles opened up a “national” Pokédex, letting you collect all of the Pokémon from every title and (eventually) letting you import Pokémon from previous generations. In <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, a mix of 400-odd monsters, old and new, are the only ones available for the entire game—meaning hundreds more are not available at all. Mega Evolutions are gone, as are most of the regional Pokémon forms from <i>Sun </i>and <i>Moon</i>. The <i>Pokémon Home</i> app will still recognize all existing Pokémon when it comes out next year, but you can’t pull them into <i>Sword </i>or <i>Shield</i>, and Game Freak <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/right-as-pokemon-sword-shield-are-about-to-arrive-game-freak-re-iterates-that-there-are-no-plans-to-add-a-full-pokedex-572064.phtml">isn’t planning to add them in later</a>.</p>
      <p>The bottleneck is, supposedly, a lack of development time and resources. And before you casually dismiss that rationale, the monsters that <i>are</i> in <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield </i>are clearly more than just refurbished versions of the models used in the 3DS games. Every Pokémon that makes the jump to the Switch needed to be retextured and tweaked and made usable in the mega-sized Dynamax mode (more on that in a moment). It’s clearly a non-trivial amount of work, especially when multiplied across a sprawling history of 800-plus monsters.</p>
      <p>When you’re playing the single-player campaign, the amount and variety of Pokémon available actually feels pretty good. For longtime players and monster collectors, though, it’s hard not to feel a bit resentful. Suddenly, a series that has focused on catching ‘em all for more than two decades has decided that hundreds of Pokémon are not actually essential to the <i>Pokémon</i> experience after all. I've been importing certain individual Pokémon from game to game since 2003, and I always appreciated that Game Freak encouraged this kind of sentimental attachment. Not anymore.</p>
      <p>With half of all existing Pokémon gone, the “long tail” of <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>—the stuff that players have always done after the main single-player story has been cleared—has been dramatically reduced in size and scope relative to previous games. The reduced Pokédex also seriously limits the variety of possible monster teams and strategies that make the competitive circuit interesting.</p>
      <p>Maybe <i>Pokémon Home</i> will include a battling component, or maybe a re-release of <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield </i>a couple of years from now will fill in the rest of the monster roster. But despite <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>'s many improvements, I'd imagine many competitive players will continue to use <i>Sun </i>and <i>Moon</i> just for the larger roster.</p>
      <h3>A console-size Pokémon</h3>
      <p>Now let’s focus on the good stuff, because there is a lot of it, national 'dex controversy aside.</p>
      <p>It starts with some console-scale world-building. In previous <i>Pokémon</i> games, the environments have always looked more or less like our own, And while we’re told that Pokémon vary widely in size and weight, small portable screens have always (by necessity) sort of flattened the monsters out so that a tiny Caterpie looks not all that different from a 21-foot-long Gyarados. Thanks to the extra power of the Switch, <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield </i>can finally show us a world that’s big enough to show us what a Pokémon-centric society would really look like—<i>Sun </i>and <i>Moon</i> attempted this, but they were held back by the aging hardware of the 3DS.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/grO7u1R866o" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The best example of this is the game’s “Wild Area,” a wide-open field between cities with a free-range camera where dozens of Pokémon of different shapes and sizes roam free. Not only does this make an unprecedentedly large and varied roster of Pokémon available from very near the start of the game, but if you’re not careful you can run into high-leveled monsters that will absolutely wipe your fledgling team out if you’re not ready to deal with them.</p>
      <p>The game’s cities and battles feel bigger, too; each city is built around a gigantic stadium where battles can happen in front of thousands of spectators. And these cities all have distinct and memorable designs that usually complement the Pokémon type used in the stadium. Sadly, though, there’s not much reason to come back to most of these cities once you clear the stadium challenge and break into everyone’s homes to look for items.</p>
      <p>Like most Switch games, <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> deploy some graphical trickery to keep things running smoothly—shadows lose resolution quickly as you move away from objects, for instance, and far-off objects can often pop into existence (the way that Pokémon actually <i>spring up</i> as they pop in makes this graphical artifact more playful and intentional-looking). These aren't the best-looking games on the Switch, or even the best-looking RPGs (<i>Dragon Quest XI</i> running on the Switch manages better draw distance and more detailed environments, for instance, though the resolution is often visibly lower). Still, the monster designs, environments, and big, colorful character models all look good. This is definitely the look that <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> were going for but executed more successfully on new hardware.</p>
      <p>That said, this does look and feel a bit like a scaled-up portable game in a lot of ways. Text size and the information density of the game’s UI all seem tuned for play on the handheld screen rather than a TV screen. The game seems marginally better-optimized for handheld mode, too—the only times I noticed small framerate dips were exclusively in docked mode. On the other hand, the game retains all of the handy and quick-to-access local multiplayer features from the previous 3DS versions.</p>

      <p>One thing that didn’t make the jump from <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i> to <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> are the powered up “Z-moves” bestowed by special held items. In their place is something called a Dynamax battle, where Pokémon grow to Godzilla-esque proportions and get stat boosts and more powerful moves for three turns. Some Pokémon get special Dynamax forms, others are just super-sized versions of their regular selves.</p>
      <p>In the main game’s story mode, Dynamax battles happen mostly during stadium battles. But there are also certain in-game “dens” dotting the Wild Area where Dynamax Pokémon wait to do battle with you and three other trainers (either other human players or computer-controlled NPCs).</p>
      <p>The pacing of Dynamax battles is, frankly, a bit plodding, especially when you’re fighting more powerful monsters who generate protective shields that have to be broken down before you can actually damage them. But it <i>is</i> fun to make one of your Pokémon hulk out to get you out of a tight spot, and battles with wild Dynamax Pokémon can feel tense when they’re close. As <i>Pokémon</i> gameplay gimmicks go, I’d say they're better than Z-Moves but not as fun as <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>'s Mega Evolved Pokémon.</p>
      <h3>Less grinding is good</h3>
      <p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/11/review-pokemon-sun-and-moon-are-solid-entries-aimed-at-newbies/">When I reviewed <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i></a>, I called them good <i>Pokémon </i>games for first-time players because they tried to minimize some of the more frustrating, grind-y aspects of older <i>Pokémon</i> games. <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> aren't quite as welcoming as the 3DS games, but they continue the trend in reducing grinding and repetitive back-and-forth traveling between locations.</p>
      <p>The biggest quality-of-life change is probably the ability to access your PC box from the field without going to a Pokémon Center. That feature, first introduced in <i>Let’s Go, </i>makes it a whole lot easier and more convenient to keep more than six Pokémon in your regular rotation. Ditto for fast traveling, which is now accomplished directly from the Town Map without the need for a separate Pokémon or excessive, time-consuming animations.</p>
      <p>All Pokémon in your party now earn some experience points for every battle, whether they participate or not. Monsters that do participate in the battle get <i>more </i>experience points, though, encouraging you to keep your entire team in the rotation. Lower-leveled Pokémon continue to earn more experience than higher-leveled Pokémon to help new members of your team catch up to everyone else, too.</p>
      <p>For competitive players and collectors, the coolest addition is a class of “mints” you can give to Pokémon to change their natures. This lets you easily customize which of a Pokémon's five basic stats will get a 10% boost and which will get a 10% reduction in exchange. In the past it has been easy to breed Pokémon to get the specific nature you want, but these items let you avoid the gamble of getting an unhelpful nature when catching a rarer Pokémon.</p>
      <p>As in <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/HM">move-teaching HMs</a> are still a thing of the past, but <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> also cut back on the number of <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/TM">unlimited-move-bestowing TMs</a>. In their places are TRs (technical records), earned by battling Dynamax Pokémon, which can only be used once. While you can grind for multiple copies of each TR if you want, it’s no longer quite as easy to teach powerful moves like Surf or Earthquake to every Pokémon on your team.</p>
      <h3>A note on multiplayer</h3>
      <p>Nintendo’s <i>Pokémon</i> servers weren’t online during the review period, so I haven’t been able to experiment at all with the game’s online features (though I can tell you that they’ll require a Switch Online subscription). But I have been able to experiment a little with the local multiplayer features.</p>
      <p>The local multiplayer options you’d expect in a <i>Pokémon</i> game are obviously here—if all you want is a quick battle or trade, it’s easy to set one up. The Wild Area is where the coolest stuff is, though. All players within range will appear in real-ish time in the Wild Area, and when you battle or catch a Pokémon everyone will get a status update notification to let them know what you’re up to. If one player sets up a Pokémon camp, other players can visit your tent and play with members of your team. There’s also a curry cooking minigame that can restore your monsters’ HP and make them more friendly toward you (you can also camp solo or with NPCs throughout the game, if no one else is around).</p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>The short version of this review is that <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> are fun, good-looking <i>Pokémon</i> games with a solid story mode and some welcome changes to the game’s mechanics. That probably won't be enough for longtime fans who are upset about the limited roster, though. The missing piece of this is really <i>Pokémon Home</i>, the upcoming cloud storage system for Pokemon from every franchise entry.  It could either render the national 'dex question moot <i>or</i> serve as a depressing mausoleum for unusable Pokémon that can be looked at but not touched.</p>
      <p>I do think <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield </i>are good entries for anyone who got into <i>Pokémon</i> through <i>Go </i>and <i>Let’s Go</i> and is looking for something a bit more difficult and larger in scale. Seasoned players can still enjoy the new monsters and appreciate the game’s story mode while it lasts (I cleared the main story in around 35 hours). It’s just too bad that, for longtime players, what’s missing is probably going to overshadow everything that’s here.</p>
      <h4>The good</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A good-looking game that finally brings a “real” <i>Pokémon</i> experience to your TV screen.</li>
        <li>Tweaked mechanics reduce grinding and make routine tasks more pleasant.</li>
        <li>The "Wild Area" gives you access to a varied team right off the bat.</li>
        <li>Local multiplayer features are mostly fun.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The bad</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The pacing of Dynamax battles can plod a bit.</li>
        <li>Probably not great entries for newbies—the Wild Area, in particular, seems like it would be a bit bewildering for a first-time player.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The ugly</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The first mainline <i>Pokémon</i> game to shrink the list of usable monsters rather than expanding it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Verdict</b>: First-time players should try <i>Let's Go</i> instead, but even without the full Pokédex this is a worthwhile entry for monster-catching veterans.</p>
