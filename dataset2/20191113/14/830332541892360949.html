      <p>MADISON, Wis. - There is a crisis of trust in this country. And one of the places that crisis shows up with dangerous frequency is in attempts to restrict access to public information and records. Elected officials in their efforts to control what the public knows about their actions and to avoid accountability are making it as hard as possible for reporters to do their jobs. The result is a disregard for, if not outright assault on your right as citizens to know what’s going on in your government…your government.</p>
      <p>The administration of Governor Tony Evers is refusing to honor open records requests. Lafayette County is threatening to prosecute reporters for reporting on what they learn from public records. At a news conference two lawmakers refused to allow a question they deemed not germane to the subject of the news conference. It goes on and on. </p>
      <p>You have a right to know. And it’s our job to make sure you do.</p>
