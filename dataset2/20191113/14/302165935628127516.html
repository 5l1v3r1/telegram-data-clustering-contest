      <p>KIEV, Nov 13 — A Ukrainian anti-corruption watchdog has accused a member of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s staff of bribery after the political novice vowed to tackle the country’s notoriously rampant graft. </p>
      <p>The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said it caught the official and several accomplices receiving a US$150,000 (RM621,375) bribe in a sting operation yesterday.</p>
      <p>Investigators said this was half the amount of a bribe the group had solicited for securing a job at state energy giant Naftogaz. </p>
      <p>Ukrainian media named the detained official as Svitlana Kondzelya, an employee in the presidency since 2009 who currently heads a department dealing with citizens’ requests.</p>
      <p>Prominent Ukrainian news website <i>Ukrainska Pravda</i> quoted a source as saying that Kondzelya had boasted she could “solve any kind of problem through her contacts in the (president’s) office”.</p>
      <p>The president’s Facebook page confirmed the detentions without naming the suspect.</p>
      <p>“There is no ‘us’ and ‘them’ for the head of state. Corruption must be eradicated,” it said.</p>
      <p>Those arrested yesterday also included a former deputy culture minister who served in 2011, the NABU statement said. </p>
      <p>At that time Ukraine was governed by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
      <p>Zelensky was elected president on promises of change after he accused predecessor Petro Poroshenko of failing to curb corruption in the post-Soviet state. </p>
      <p>While the new authorities have tightened anti-corruption legislation and launched proceedings against several senior officials, both former and current, Zelensky’s opponents accuse his team of targeting only officials with close ties to Poroshenko.</p>
      <p>According to Transparency International, Ukraine is ranked 120<sup>th</sup> out of 180 on the NGO’s corruption perception index, faring better than Russia (in 138<sup>th</sup> place) but still falling far behind its European Union neighbours. — AFP</p>
