      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:50:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/362711-google-to-offer-checking-accounts-for-consumers-wsj.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Alphabet Inc’s Google will offer checking accounts to customers starting next year in a finance push, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The project, named Cache, will have accounts by Citigroup Inc and a credit union at Stanford University, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system,” Caesar Sengupta, general manager and vice-president of payments at Google, told the Journal in an interview.</p>
      <p>“It may be the slightly longer path, but it’s more sustainable,” Sengupta was quoted as saying in the report.</p>
      <p>Google did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. (Reuters/NAN)</p>
