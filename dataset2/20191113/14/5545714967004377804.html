      <h1>Original Prey studio closes, Bethesda reopens it under a new name</h1>
      <h2>Now Roundhouse Studios</h2>

      <p>A well-established development studio shut its doors recently, and that's not exactly uncommon in the games industry. However, this is the rare example where a failing business didn't necessarily lead to a large group of people suddenly out of work.</p>
      <p>Human Head Studios -- best known for<i> Rune</i> and 2006's <i>Prey</i> -- has gone defunct after 22 years. The Wisconsin-based developer won't have any downtime, though. Bethesda immediately acquired the team and reopened it as Roundhouse Studios. In a statement announcing the transition, Human Head co-founder Chris Rhinehart said "Bethesda offered every employee of Human Head a position at the new company." </p>
      <p>While evidently on good terms now, Human Head and Bethesda have had a checkered past. The two butted heads on the development of a <i>Prey </i>sequel, with Bethesda allegedly withholding funding that the studio needed to operate. Eventually, it's said that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../predation-bethesda-tried-to-buy-human-head-255483.phtml">Bethesda tried to buy the developer outright</a>, which Human Head refused. They parted ways after the <i>Prey</i> sequel was canceled. Bethesda opted to reboot the entire game, trusting Arkane to lead production on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-prey-435993.phtml">2017's <i>Prey</i></a> that ended up critically-lauded.</p>
      <p>Starting immediately, Roundhouse Studios is working on unannounced projects at Bethesda. When asked whether Roundhouse is serving as a support studio or if it's acting as the lead on a new game, Bethesda told Destructoid "Right now we have nothing specific to announce on this."  </p>
