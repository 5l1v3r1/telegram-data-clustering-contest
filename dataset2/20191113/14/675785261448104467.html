      <p>Rylan Clark Neal collapsed to the floor in tears after completing his exhausting 24 hours Karaoke challenge for Children In Need.</p>
      <p>The It Takes Two host had been tasked with singing for a whole day and night while Radio 2 listeners spurred him on with their donations.</p>
      <p>At 9:15am on Wednesday morning, Rylan's stint finally came to an end with a rousing rendition of Tina Turner's The Best.</p>
      <p>For his finale hurrah, Rylan was joined by his Strictly co-presenter Zoe Ball and Pudsey Bear himself as they counted down the final seconds on the clock.</p>

      <p>"Oh my God. This is unbelievable, I can’t believe it. This is not actually happening," Rylan cried. "Craig knows how much of a fan I am and I’ve met him before but to do that, I’m actually on cloud nine right now."</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Rylan has showed off his vocal skills in public.</p>

      <p>The new Supermarket Sweep host became a household name following his controversial appearance on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> .</p>
      <p>Rylan was picked to be in Nicole Scherzinger's category back in 2012.</p>
      <p>Despite his frequent clashes with Gary Barlow, Rylan became a firm fan favourite and finished the series in fifth place.</p>
      <p>Since then Rylan's career has gone from strength to strength and he's even buried the hatchet with his former nemesis.</p>
