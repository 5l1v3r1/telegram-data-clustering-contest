      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - A German court has convicted a 49-year-old woman of child abuse and fraud for claiming her children suffered from bogus medical conditions for years to receive additional social assistance.</p>
      <p>News agency dpa reported the woman was sentenced to eight years in prison in Luebeck state court Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The woman was convicted of claiming that four of her five children suffered from chronic illnesses. She was accused of having them use a wheelchair to convince school officials and doctors.</p>
      <p>Her 27-year-old daughter testified the children were threatened if they didn't go along. She said she moved out and didn't participate. The others didn't testify.</p>
      <p>The mother was found to have caused the children psychological damage and to have defrauded social services of 135,000 euros ($149,000), plus 1 million euros in unnecessary medication.</p>
