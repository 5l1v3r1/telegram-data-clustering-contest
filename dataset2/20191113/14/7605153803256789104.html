        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 13 – Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka has ordered a probe into the claims that maize products with high levels of aflatoxin are still being sold to Kenyans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lusaka Wednesday directed the Senate Agriculture Committee to file its preliminary findings by Wednesday next week.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Lusaka’s directive followed Senators Moses Wetangula and James Orengo’s call for criminal prosecution against millers and retailers found to be in violation of a product recall order issued by the Kenya Bureau of Statistics (KEBS) against five maize flour brands.</p>
      <p>Orengo and Nominated Senator Millicent Omanga said the government must intensify its surveillance systems to curb retailers who have resorted to lowering prices to clear their stocks.</p>
      <p>The affected millers are Dola Maize Meal, Kifaru Maize Meal, Starehe Maize Meal, 210 Two Ten Maize Meal, and Jembe Maize Meal.</p>
      <p>Appearing before the National Assembly Agriculture Committee Agriculture CS Mwangi Kiunjuri said the government will take stern action against any of the five millers who are yet to comply with the KEBS directive.</p>
