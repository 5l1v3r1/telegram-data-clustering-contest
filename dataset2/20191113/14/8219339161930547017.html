      <h1>16-inch MacBook Pro maxes out at over $6000 with 8TB SSD, 64GB RAM, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T14:27:44+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Apple’s new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-new-16-inch-macbook-pro/">16-inch MacBook Pro is available to order now</a>. It starts at $2,399, which is much lower than some supply chain rumors had suggested. At the high-end, the 16-inch MacBook Pro maxes out at $6,099 and gets you quite a bit of power.</p>
      <p>For $6,099 you get 64GB of 2666MHz DDR4 memory, an AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 8GB of GDDR6 memory graphics card, and an 8TB SSD, which Apple says is a first for a laptop.</p>
      <p>Here are the SSD upgrade options from the base 512GB configuration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1TB SSD +$200</li>
        <li>2TB SSD +$600</li>
        <li>4TB SSD +$1,200</li>
        <li>8TB SSD +$2,400</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What’s interesting to note is the price delta between the entry-level Mac Pro. While Apple has yet to publish the online configurator for the Mac Pro, we do know that it will start at $5,999 with 256GB of SSD storage. While the Mac Pro has other benefits, such as expandability, the SSD pricing on the 16-inch MacBook Pro and the 512GB base option is particularly notable.</p>
      <p>Apple did announce today that the Max Pro and the Pro Display XDR will <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/13/apple-announces-mac-pro-availability/">start shipping in December</a>. We should learn build-to-order configuration options soon.</p>
      <p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro also features a new Magic Keyboard, which should greatly improve the reliability compared to the butterfly keyboard.
