      <p>The Trump administration is proposing to make it tougher for asylum-seekers to obtain permission to work in the United States while their immigration cases are pending.</p>
      <p>US Citizenship and Immigration Services said Wednesday that a proposed rule would double the time asylum-seekers must wait for a work permit to a year and bar those who crossed a border illegally from applying for the permits at all.</p>
      <p>The agency says the rule aims to discourage <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/immigrants">immigrants </a>who don't qualify for asylum from seeking it.</p>
      <p>The public can comment on the proposed rule until January 13. It is the latest in a series of proposals by the Trump administration aimed at deterring <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/immigrants">immigrants </a>from seeking asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
