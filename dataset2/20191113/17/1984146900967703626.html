      <h1>Sunderland's FPP loan: Ten questions Stewart Donald and Charlie Methven must answer</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland's owners have borrowed £9m from US investors, putting up the Stadium of Light and the Academy of Light as security</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:18:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>FPP Sunderland's investment in the football club has been revealed as £9m loan secured against the Stadium of Light and the Academy of Light, according to documents filed at Companies House.</p>
      <p>The investment by FPP, a vehicle for US-based businessmen Glenn Furhman, John Phelan, and Robert Platek, was first revealed a fortnight ago but save for the fact that the money amounted to a sum 'approaching eight figures' and had been funnelled through Madrox Partners - the holding company through which <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/stewart-donald">Stewart Donald</a> , Juan Sartori, and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/charlie-methven">Charlie Methven</a> own <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland AFC</a> - the details of the deal were shrouded in mystery.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://rokerreport.sbnation.com/2019/11/9/20956498/exclusive-charlie-methven-discusses-sunderlands-investment-transfer-window-scouting-plans">Roker Rapport podcast on Saturday</a> , Methven said: "The arrangements between FPP and Madrox - which is Stewart, mine and Juan Sartori’s holding company - are entirely private.</p>
      <p>"They [FPP] have no financial connection with Sunderland AFC and that's the way it will stay."</p>
      <p>But a charge registered at Companies House has meant that some of those details are now a matter of public record, and they have revealed that the money is in fact a $12m (approximately £9.3m at today's exchange rates) loan, secured against club assets including the stadium and training ground.</p>

      <p>FPP were widely reported in September to be considering a takeover at Sunderland but that did not materialise, and they have not made any public statement regarding their decision to invest in the club, nor their future intentions.</p>
      <p>While the initial news of new investment was welcomed by fans, the lack of clarity surrounding the situation followed by the Companies House filings has caused considerable concern amongst supporters and left a number of unanswered questions.</p>
      <p>Methven has said that he and majority shareholder Donald 'should be held accountable for for what happens at Sunderland, the decisions that are made, the way in which the club is run'.</p>
      <p>And in that spirit, here are some of the questions that they need to address:</p>
      <h3>1. What are FPP's intentions?</h3>
      <p>Are FPP looking at a full-blown takeover of the football club further down the line?</p>
      <h3>2. Why have the owners taken out this loan rather than invested their own money in the club?</h3>
      <p>When they arrived on Wearside, Donald and Methven said that they had the resources to run the club in League One. Given that they have since brought Juan Sartori on board, and that the club is still in League One, why do they need external investment now?</p>
      <h3>3. When is the loan due to be repaid?</h3>
      <p>Does the money have to be repaid to FPP on a fixed date, in certain circumstances - if promotion is achieved, for instance - or is the arrangement open-ended?</p>
      <h3>4. Is the loan interest-bearing, and if so at what rate?</h3>
      <p>Could Madrox end up having to pay back more than the $12m they borrowed?</p>
      <h3>5. The loan has been taken out by Madrox, and Methven has said the money will not be repayable by Sunderland AFC. How does Madrox intend to repay the loan?</h3>
      <p>Madrox's only asset is the football club.</p>
      <h3>6. What will happen to the stadium and the training ground if the loan is not repaid by Madrox?</h3>
      <p>The charge on file at Companies House suggests that ownership would pass to FPP.</p>
      <h3>7. Is the football club itself part of the deal?</h3>
      <p>If the loan is not repaid by Madrox, would the football club itself pass to FPP or merely the properties including the stadium and training ground?</p>
      <h3>8. If the answer to the above is that only the properties are being used as security, does that mean the club could find itself paying to play at the Stadium of Light?</h3>
      <p>At present the club owns its own stadium and training ground. Clubs who do not own their own ground have run into problems in the past, as Coventry City will attest.</p>
      <h3>9. Donald and Methven have gone to great lengths to communicate with fans since they arrived. Why do they regard the details surrounding the FPP investment in Madrox as a private matter when club assets are being used as security?</h3>
      <p>In most areas, the transparency brought by Donald and Methven has been a breath of fresh air, but when there is a refusal to discuss the details surrounding this deal it is not surprising that fans begin to wonder why.</p>
      <h3>10. Exactly what will this money be used for?</h3>
      <p>Methven has suggested it will be used for repairing a lift at the academy, replacing speakers at the Stadium of Light, bringing in more recruitment staff, and investing in the academy to ensure it retains category one status. But will any of this cash be used for everyday running costs, and will any of it be available to Phil Parkinson in the January transfer window?</p>
