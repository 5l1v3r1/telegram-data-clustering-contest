      <h1>Piers Morgan says Simon Cowell is 'wasting away' and insists 'something is going on'</h1>
      <h2>Piers 'can't believe' it's all down to a vegan diet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:05:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has revealed he thinks there's more to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/simon-cowell-unrecognisable-as-he-appears-to-have-lost-more-weight/">Simon Cowell's weight loss</a> than meets the eye and insisted "something is going on".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> host, 54, has said he doesn't believe the music mogul, 60, managed his transformation by simply switching to a vegan diet.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the programme earlier today (13.10.19), Piers said: "I couldn't believe Simon was [at the ITV Palooza] actually. He is wasting away, Cowell.</p>
      <p>"I cant believe he is actually on a vegan diet, I don't think he is. Something is going on. Something is going on."</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor</a> boss Simon has addressed rumours surrounding his weight loss and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/simon-cowell-hits-back-at-claims-hes-had-gastric-band-after-weight-loss/">insisted he hasn't had the help of a gastric band</a>.</p>
      <p>In a chat with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bestmagazine/">Best magazine</a>, he said: "People have said, 'Oh, he's had a gastric band fitted' but I haven't. If I had, I would admit to it. This diet is all about what you put into your body."</p>
      <p>Speaking further, Simon said a doctor in LA told him his diet was "appalling" and advised that he cut out certain fatty foods and drinks.</p>

      <p>After turning his diet around and cutting out sugar, Simon said he "could see the difference", although the first few weeks without it "were difficult".</p>
      <p>Simon previously revealed that his good pal and ex-girlfriend Sinitta was the one who originally encouraged him to lose weight.</p>

      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/simon-cowell-weight-loss-sinitta-18674295">Daily Star</a>: "I've never felt better. It was Sinitta who pointed at my stomach last year in Malibu and I went, 'I get it'."</p>
      <p>Sinnita has also spoke about the moment she confronted Simon about his weight, although <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/x-factors-sinitta-on-helping-simon-cowell-lose-weight/">she insisted it was nowhere near as "brutal" as Simon made it sound</a>.</p>
      <p>She explained: "He makes it sound much more brutal than it was. We had just finished filming X Factor last year."</p>

      <p>Sinitta reportedly told Simon he's "too handsome" and "too fabulous" to let himself go.</p>
      <p>The star explained how she had her arms around Simon as they were hugging, and she "just kind of grabbed him a little bit around the love handles and the waist, and his little cheeks".</p>
      <p>She continued, in a clip aired on ITV daytime show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/lorraine/">Lorraine</a>: "I just said, 'You know, I just want you to be healthy and I want you to look good and feel good. This is not you and you need to address this'."</p>
