      <h3>What type of camera is best for you?</h3>
      <p>Buying a camera isn’t as simple as it may seem. There are lots of different types of camera, and even within each type there can be huge differences in quality between them.</p>
      <p>Compact cameras are the place to start if you’re looking for a bump in quality compared with your smartphone’s camera offerings at a low price. They’re small and easy to use, and sometimes referred to as ‘point-and-shoot’.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye out for compact cameras that include WiFi, which makes transferring photos from your camera to your phone, tablet or computer much quicker and is a nice bonus if there’s a good enough deal.</p>
      <p>Bridge cameras offer slightly better quality photos and a better zoom than a compact camera, and are generally still easy to use, but they are usually a lot bigger. You still can’t change the lens on a bridge camera, but could be worth considering if you’re new to photography but want to capture great photos on a special holiday like a safari when the subjects of your photos will be far away.</p>
      <p>A compact system camera, or CSC, offers more control over your photos and the ability to swap lenses, but are more portable than a DSLR. The downside is that they tend to be quite pricey.</p>
      <p>And then there’s the DSLR itself, which tends to be the camera of choice for serious photographers and professionals. You’ll get full manual control over your photos, the ability to change lenses and other customisation such as a mount for a flash and more.</p>
      <p>A DSLR can be heavy, though, and they can take a lot of practice to master, but if you’re considering taking up photography as a serious hobby or career, a DSLR is the camera for you.</p>
      <p>Finally, you might want to consider an instant camera. Far from being retro throwbacks, there's now a whole range of instant cameras and print formats, including from top brands like Leica and Lomography. Check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/photo-video/best-instant-cameras-3666890/">best instant cameras</a> to find out what to look for.</p>
      <p>We’ve picked out the very best from around the web and you can find them below.</p>
