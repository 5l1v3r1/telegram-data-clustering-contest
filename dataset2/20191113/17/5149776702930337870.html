      <h2>Defendant Anton Daniels is alleged to have provided, in some way, a handgun, jury told</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:49:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Sherdley</a></address>
      <p>A 'weapons in a van' trial has heard one defendant is "not directly connected with the van or the weapons".</p>
      <p>According to the prosecution's case, Anton Daniels allegedly provided, in some way, a handgun, which he denies.</p>
      <p>Daniels is on trial with others accused of conspiracy to wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm and conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>
      <p>James Beck, representing Daniels, said he had not given evidence in his own defence and he is "perfectly entitled under our law to do that".</p>
      <p>He also said his client "has nothing to tell you" and "he is here as a defendant, not as a witness" and "he is here because the prosecution put him in the dock".</p>
      <p>Earlier he said: "You have heard nothing from Anton Daniels. What actually is the case against him? He is not connected directly to the van or weapons. It all hinges on text messages and phone calls".</p>
      <p>Events began when co-accused Lewis Anderson is alleged to have been filmed by men from Radford, not in the dock, on their mobile phones at a Co-op in Arnold Road, Bestwood.</p>
      <p>Anderson was said to have got hold of three men to help him, and a van.</p>
      <p>That group had a pistol, ammunition, two knives, a truncheon, three balaclavas, a woollen hat and two pairs of gloves when they went looking for the Radford males that they "could shoot, stab or batter in the back of a van", claim the prosecution.</p>
      <p>Anderson - who the jury has heard has admitted possessing a firearm on March 1 - has told the jury he had been storing a pistol for someone he would not name as a favour.</p>
      <p>He decided to move the gun from its hiding place the same night he was caught by police inside the van with three of his co-accused - which did not include Daniels - and weapons. Anderson denies the people in the van knew anything about the gun he was storing.</p>
      <p>Mr Beck referred to the prosecution case, saying: "He (Daniels) is said to have provided in one way or another the handgun Mr Anderson had in the van. Mr Anderson has provided you with an alternative explanation".</p>
      <p>He also said "the prosecution case is he [Anton Daniels] provided, in some way, the hand gun".</p>
      <p>Anderson told the jury last week how he was trying to get back three bags of cannabis he had lost earlier that night.</p>
      <p>He had called Daniels to check whether or not he had left them in his car.</p>
      <p>The jury heard about Anderson's attempts to contact Daniels, and how on many occasions he did not respond.</p>
      <p>Later, Anderson was in the van with others when he went to check if Daniels' car was still where it was, because he was not answering his phone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/jury-hears-movements-van-nottingham-3479941">The van </a>was parked up in Belconnen Road, Bestwood, and was being watched by undercover police.</p>
      <p>After getting out of the van, Anderson went down an alleyway. He took a coat out of a bag he had with him and got the gun from its hiding place.</p>
      <p>He had told the jury how he had remembered the gun was still under the bin and "thought it was a good time to move it" and "anyone could get access to it". The van was later stopped by police.</p>
      <p>Anderson, 25, of Thane Road, Nottingham, Dean Johnson, 26, of Shakespeare Street, Nottingham, Daniels, 29, of Cairns Close, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bestwood">Bestwood</a>, Trevan Dickson, 20, and Jason Dickson, 47, both of Ashover Close, St Ann's, and three defendants, who cannot be identified, plead not guilty to conspiracy to wound with intent and conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>
      <p>The remaining charges involve the men arrested in the van. Anderson, Johnson and two of those who cannot be identified deny three charges of having offensive weapons - a truncheon and two knives.</p>
