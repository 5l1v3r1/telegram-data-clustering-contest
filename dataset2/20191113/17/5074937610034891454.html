      <h1>Amidu’s suit to compel A-G to retrieve judgment debt dismissed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:20:38+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Hafsa Obeng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA – The Supreme Court has dismissed an application by Mr Martin Amidu, the Special Prosecutor seeking to compel the Attorney General’s Department to retrieve the £47million wrongfully paid to Waterville Holdings Company.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Justice Paul Baffoe- Bonnie, dismissed the application, saying after listening to both parties, at the previous sitting, the court deems the application as incompetent.</p>
      <p>The court said well-meaning as the applicant may be, his application had no premise before any rule of law.</p>
      <p>Mr Amidu, at the last sitting moved his application for the court to enforce the Court’s judgment in 2014 against Waterville to refund the money paid to it by the state, saying that he was in court representing the public interest to ensure that the judgement was enforced and that he has evidence that could help the state retrieve the money.</p>
      <p>He said he could establish that it was possible for the people of Ghana to get their money back and that the Attorney-General (A-G) was not doing enough to enforce the judgement, adding that the AG claimed it could not trace Waterville but he had communicated with the company and has documents that could help in the retrieval of the money, but claimed it would be suicidal to hand over such documents to the AG.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Attorney General, Mr Godfred Yeboah Dame in his response at the time refuted the claims of Mr Amidu, saying that he had personally visited Mr Amidu to have access to the documents but he refused to give them to him.</p>
      <p>He said the application lacked merit, did not indicate any access to Waterville, and was unknown to any of the rules of procedure.</p>
      <p>The court however ordered both parties to go and collaborate to see how best to enforce the judgement for the money to be retrieved.</p>
      <p>However on Wednesday morning when the case was called Mr Amidu told the court  he had supplied what he had to support the AG in the execution of the judgment, adding that the documents he has provided were not part of  his statement of case but was meant to assist the AG execute the judgment.</p>
      <p>He said he had tried his best to ensure that the judgment be executed and if the AG cannot submit itself he cannot submit himself for their corporation.</p>
      <p>Mr Dame said the order made was for them to collaborate but Mr Amidu chose to file a written submission indicating that he intends to battle the ongoing case, but AG would work with the document.</p>
      <p>The court then dismissed the application and urged the AG to take a look at the document to ascertain whether it would help in the execution of the judgement.</p>
      <p>In June 2014 the Supreme Court ordered Waterville to refund an amount of £47million paid to it by the state, because the payment were unconstitutionally made.</p>
