      <p>“You took your time, Boris,” one person told Johnson as he walked through the area accompanied by local officials, while another asked him: “Where’ve you been?”.</p>
      <p>Another resident was more welcoming, telling Johnson: “Go get ‘em.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of a national election on Dec. 12, Britain’s two main opposition parties have criticized Johnson and his Conservative government for a slow response to the flooding, which claimed one life last week.</p>
