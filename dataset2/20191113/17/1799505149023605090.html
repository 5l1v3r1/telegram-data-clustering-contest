      <p>ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish authorities have re-arrested a journalist a week after he was released from prison, where he had been serving a 10-year sentence on terror convictions.</p>
      <p>State-run Anadolu Agency said Ahmet Altan was detained at his home late Tuesday and returned to custody after prosecutors objected to his release and a court ordered his re-arrest.</p>
      <p>Altan together with another journalist, Nazli Ilicak, were convicted on Nov. 4 of aiding the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuse of masterminding a 2016 failed coup. Altan’s brother, columnist Mehmet Altan, was acquitted of the charge.</p>
      <p>The two were, however, released from prison for time already served — after three years in detention — under laws that allow early release in certain cases. They were freed on condition that they regularly report to police and don’t leave the country.</p>
      <p>Altan and Ilicak deny the accusations that they supported the coup.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International’s Europe director, Marie Struthers, criticized Altan’s re-arrest, saying “it compounds an already shocking catalogue of injustice he has been subjected to.”</p>
      <p>The European Union said Altan’s renewed imprisonment “further damages the credibility of Turkey’s judiciary,” which it said was soiled by a high level of political interference.</p>
      <p>“This interference needs to halt,” EU Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said. “Journalists need to do their job – they do not belong in jail.”</p>
      <p>Altan and Ilicak were among hundreds of thousands investigated and tens of thousands arrested and charged for being allied with Gulen during a widespread crackdown that drew international condemnation.</p>
