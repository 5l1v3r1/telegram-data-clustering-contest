      <p>Netlix has <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1194662370485919744">already ordered</a> a second season of <i>The Witcher</i>. The first season of the show, starring Henvil Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, hasn’t even aired yet.</p>
      <p>Announced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/17/15651948/the-witcher-netflix-series-platige-image">in 2017</a>, <i>The Witcher</i> is based on the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski and will include nods to the critically-acclaimed role-playing games by CD Projekt Red. The cast includes Freya Allan (<i>The War of the Worlds</i>, <i>Bluebird</i>) as Ciri, and Anya Chalotra (<i>Wanderlust</i>, <i>The ABC Murders</i>) as Yennefer. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/31/20940302/netflix-witcher-trailer-release-date-bathtub-geralt-meme">The series premieres on Dec. 18</a>.</p>

      <p>Promotion of the show has not been without its controversies. Early on, fans of the game franchise in particular took issue with casting Cavill, best known for his time as Superman. The recent trailer, however, seems to have calmed down concerns quite a bit. It looks every bit as gritty as it needs to, and the lighting and color grading has reduced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/31/18049084/the-witcher-netflix-geralt-memes-henry-cavill">the reflectivity in Cavill’s brilliant silver wig</a>, so that’s a plus.</p>
