      <h1>Trial of man accused of murdering Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe put back for 'logistic reasons'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:55:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/alison-o%E2%80%99riordan/" target="_blank">By Alison Oâ€™Riordan</a></address>
      <p>The trial of the man accused of murdering Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe, which was due to begin on Monday, has been put back until January for "logistical reasons" following a series of pre-trial hearings at the Central Criminal Court.</p>
      <p>At a hearing this afternoon, Mr Justice Michael White said there was no reality to a jury being sworn in next Monday and he would have to fix a new trial date again.</p>
      <p>However, the judge said the court will "engage actively" with the matter between now and January, in order to deal with all outstanding issues.</p>
      <p>Aaron Brady (27), with an address at New Road, Crossmaglen, Co Armagh was due to go on trial on Monday but a defence application has caused a delay in the start date.</p>
      <p>Mr Brady is charged with the murder of a member of An Garda Siochana, Detective Garda Adrian Donohue, in the course of his duty, at Lordship Credit Union, Bellurgan, Co Louth on January 25, 2013.</p>
      <p>Prosecution counsel Brendan Grehan SC said today it was appropriate that a decision "be made sooner rather than later" regarding the start date as he realised arrangements needed to be put in place for empanelling an enlarged jury.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice White previously said he would swear a 15-person jury for the trial which is expected to last several months.</p>
      <p>Addressing Mr Brady today, Mr Justice White said his trial would commence for "logistical reasons" on January 13, 2020.</p>

      <p>"The court will put in place logistical administration measures to have an enlarged jury on that date," he explained.</p>
      <p>The judge also said the court would endeavour to have all "outstanding matters" dealt with before January.</p>
      <p>The pre-trial hearing will continue before Mr Justice White tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>Mr Brady's trial was originally scheduled to begin on October 8 and then on November 11 but was put back on each occasion in order to deal with pre-trial issues.</p>
