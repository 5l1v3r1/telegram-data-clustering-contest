      <h1>Achimota School Headmistress calls for adequate security</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:18:12+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Obeng, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 11, GNA - Ms Marjorie Affenyi, Headmistress of the Achimota Senior High School, has called for adequate security in the school to save lives and properties.</p>
      <p>She said the inadequate security personnel in the School threatened lives and opened up the school to miscreants who constantly broke into bungalows, cars and stole from staff and school properties and if this was not checked, it could be extended to sensitive areas of the school.</p>
      <p>Ms Affenyi made the call at the 92nd Speech and Prize-Giving Day of the School at Achimota in Accra.</p>
      <p>It was on the theme “Re-enforcing Critical skills in Pre-Tertiary Institution: The Role of the Stakeholder”.</p>
      <p>Ms Affenyi said the non-functioning of streetlights as a result of faulty cables and squatters occupying the forest boundaries of the School were becoming issues of concern.</p>
      <p>She said other problems facing the school were sewage network and inadequate science laboratories for the teaching and learning of science.</p>
      <p>The Headmistress said the interventions put in place by Management with the support of the Ghana Education Service, Board of Governors, the Parent-Teacher Association, Staff and Old students to ensure a better performance in 2019, yielded the intended results.</p>
      <p>Ms Affenyi called on the students to take their studies serious to enable them to be reflective thinkers.</p>
      <p>She said before a child could be a creative and reflective thinker, teachers and parents have a collective role to play.</p>
      <p>Ms Affenyi said that the development of the nation hinged on critical thinkers and promised management’s commitment to raise excellence future leaders who possess creative thinking ability.</p>
      <p>Mr Bernard Joe Appea, Group Chief Executive Officer of Pentax Management Consultancy Limited, said to develop critical thinking skills, the students need to be self-critic, active listener, focused, futurist, and they should engage in assertive communication.</p>
      <p>He said to think more critically the students also needed to ask basic questions, basic assumptions, examine and evaluate evidence and always confident to defend self-reached results and outcomes.</p>
      <p>Mr Appea commended the authorities of the School for impacting many lives most of them occupying higher positions. </p>
      <p>Mrs Olive Antwi Dadzi, a member of the 1994 Year Group of the Old Achimota Association, encouraged parents to support their children to enable them achieve their goals.</p>
      <p>She commended various Year Groups of the school for their contributions to the development of the school.</p>
