      <p>LONDON — Boris Johnson urged people to vote Conservative because it is the only party that can “get Brexit done now.”</p>
      <p>“We must get Brexit done because we’re democrats,” the prime minister said in a speech Wednesday, blaming a “paralyzed parliament” and Jeremy Corbyn for stymying his progress.</p>
      <p>Delivering Brexit is “the best thing for our politics and our psychological health,” he said. “We have a great deal, it’s ready to go — just add water, stir in pot.”</p>
      <p>Johnson said he wanted to make the U.K. “the greatest place on earth” although “not necessarily the most powerful.” He claimed leaving the EU would allow the government to strike free trade deals, establish <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-free-ports-and-the-promise-boom-britain-forgotten-north-middlesbrough-tees-valley/">freeports</a>, ban the export of live animals and cut VAT on tampons.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an electric car factory in Coventry in the West Midlands, Johnson said the alternative to a Tory government would be two “soul-destroying” referendums, one on Brexit and one on Scottish independence, under the Labour Party. “Let’s give that madness a miss,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Do you want to wake up on Friday 13 [December] and find a nightmare on Downing Street — a Corbyn-Sturgeon technicolor coalition of chaos?” he asked, referring to the Labour and Scottish National Party leaders.</p>
      <p>A copy of Johnson’s speech circulated by the Conservative Party to journalists ahead of the speech accused Labour of political “onanism” or masturbation. The word was missing from his speech and when asked why, he said it was “a stray early draft.”</p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister was heckled and criticized during a visit to Yorkshire, which has been hit by severe flooding.</p>
      <p>Johnson said on Tuesday that he would send an additional 100 troops to help the recovery effort. But one member of the public in Stainforth in South Yorkshire told him that was “a pittance.”</p>
      <p>“You’ve taken your time, haven’t you?” another voter in Yorkshire said to Johnson.</p>
      <p>Asked during the press conference in Coventry whether he would apologize to those affected in the north of England, Johnson dodged the question and said there was financial compensation available. The government has committed to giving £500 for each eligible household and £2,500 for each small business that has been impacted by flooding.</p>
