      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest transfer news | The Reds have recently been linked with a move for the Tottenham Hotspur forward who is currently on loan at Leeds United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:54:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have recently been recently been linked with a move for Jack Clarke when the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old is currently on loan at Leeds United from Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, although he has seen little game time.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.sportinglife.com/football">Sporting Life</a>, he is “likely” to be recalled by his parent club in January as, it is claimed, a couple of other Championship clubs “have expressed an interest in taking him for the second half of the season”.</p>
      <p>It is said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">the Reds</a> could be one of those teams interested as they may look to add another winger when the window opens.</p>
      <p>So what do we know about the latest player linked with a move to the City Ground?</p>
      <h3>The basic info</h3>
      <p>Jack Clarke is a wide forward/winger at Spurs, currently on loan at Championship outfit Leeds.</p>
      <p>Clarke was born in York on March 23, 2000 and started his career with the Whites as he progressed through the club’s youth set up.</p>
      <p>He stands at 5ft11” tall and has been capped four times at England Under-20 level in his relatively young career.</p>
      <h3>Career so far</h3>

      <p>Clarke worked his way through the youth ranks at Elland Road to eventually make his first-team debut for the Whites in October 2018 against Brentford in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Under manager Marcelo Bielsa, Clarke was named on the substitute’s bench and replaced Stuart Dallas in the 70th minute – he was 17 years old when he made his debut.</p>
      <p>His first goal would come just over two months later when he scored Leeds’ first goal in a 3-2 win over Aston Villa at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>Leeds were trailing that game 2-0, but Clarke’s strike started the comeback which enabled the Whites to claim all three points in B6.</p>

      <p>He would go on to to make 47 appearances for Leeds in his debut season in the first-team, with 27 of those coming in the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s performances impressed in the Premier League as Tottenham saw fit to sign the 18-year-old on a deal until 2023, with Spurs paying around £10m for his services.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino then loaned Clarke back to Leeds for the 2019/20 season - but he has rarely featured this term.</p>
      <p>He is yet to make an appearance for Leeds in the Championship this season, with both of his two outings for the Whites coming in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <h3>What could Clarke add to Forest?</h3>

      <p>There is no doubting Clarke’s ability to beat a defender on the wing and cause serious problems for the opposition.</p>
      <p>Spurs saw that talent and decided to take a chance and sign him up, but they also know he is not the finished article.</p>
      <p>Two goals in his debut season is still a pretty low return for a player in a team who have large amounts of possession.</p>
      <p>At 18-years-old, you do not expect him to be the complete player – if he was, he would be in one of the top leagues in Europe.</p>
      <p>The talent is there, and a loan spell at the City Ground could provide an opportunity to home his skills, as well as boost Forest’s attacking prowess.</p>
