      <h1>Pedro Pascal May Have Revealed The Mandalorian’s Real Name</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:49:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>Well, it seems like Pedro Pascal has involuntarily brought an early Christmas gift to <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> </b>fans. In a recent interview with Screen Slam, <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian">The Mandalorian</a> </b>star presumably revealed the real name of the titular character he is portraying in the recent Disney+ series. Now, there is no official confirmation about this at the moment, but still… who better than Pascal knows the name of the character he is portraying?</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian, whose name is Din Jarren, is your iconically cool, flawed, mysterious, loner gunslinger that harkens to the best of the samurai movies and the westerns,” he said.</p>
      <p>You can check the full interview out in the player below.</p>

      <p>Then Pascal revealed also some of the source material he got inspiration from in preparing for the role.</p>
      <p>“In talking to Jon [Favreau], I asked him what should I be looking at? I know he loves movies, I love movies. ‘What would you like me to watch?’ I asked him,” Pascal added. “He immediately brought up Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa’s <b>Yojimbo</b>, [Leone’s] <b>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</b>… So [the Mandalorian] is very samurai, Clint [Eastwood], and me. Just wedge me into those two iconic characters. I love the opportunity to make him as human and accessible as possible, which is strange to say because it’s impossible to get to him because he’s covered in armor from head to toe.”</p>
      <p>The first episode of <b>The Mandalorian </b>aired yesterday, November 12, on Disney+. We still don’t know if the real name of the titular character is a big deal, but at the moment the story hasn’t mentioned it yet. And until it’s officially said onscreen, things can change. Nevertheless, <b>Star Wars </b>fans seem really happy to travel once again in a far, far away galaxy.</p>
      <p>The next chapter of <b>The Mandalorian </b>airs November 15 on Disney+. What do you think about the Mandalorian’s real name? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.</p>
