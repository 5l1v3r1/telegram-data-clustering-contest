      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:22:17+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/business/362747-african-development-bank-group-becomes-shareholder-in-afc.html" target="_blank">Press Release</a></address>
      <p>Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), a leading infrastructure solutions provider in Africa, today announces that the African Development Bank Group, Africa’s highest investment-grade rated (AAA with stable outlook) multinational finance institution, has invested $50 million in the equity of AFC.</p>
      <p>The bank group’s investment in AFC will enable both institutions to accelerate infrastructure development and delivery on the continent by deepening co-financing opportunities, joint implementation, knowledge transfer and capacity development for the benefit of Africa.</p>
      <p>The addition of the African Development Bank Group as a shareholder and development finance institution member of AFC, complements the corporation’s strategy of addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit. It also marks a further step in the bank’s undertaking to help reduce poverty, improve living conditions for Africans and mobilize resources for the continent’s economic and social development.</p>
      <p>The equity investment in AFC further broadens its shareholder base and follows recent equity investments in the corporation by African Re-Insurance Corporation and the Republic of Ghana. The African Development Bank Group will have representation on the AFC Board of Directors as part of the equity investment.</p>
      <p>Samaila Zubairu, President and Chief Executive Officer of AFC, commented on the completion of the equity investment by the bank: “AFC welcomes the African Development Bank Group as a shareholder and strategic partner, with whom we would continue our collaboration journey to address Africa’s Infrastructure deficit and challenging business environment. AFC’s mandate is a strategic fit for the Bank’s objective to integrate, energize and industrialise Africa.”</p>
      <p>Akinwumi Adesina, President, African Development Bank Group remarked: “We share AFC’s vision of developing Africa-led responses to the continent’s socio-economic development. To date, we have worked jointly to deliver transformational projects with tangible impact over the years.</p>
      <p>“This development is, therefore, a natural evolution in our partnership, which in turn, will result in delivering solutions to Africa’s infrastructure challenges at a faster pace. These solutions will adopt the highest standards, generate value to stakeholders, and foster sustainable development and economic growth across the African continent.”</p>
