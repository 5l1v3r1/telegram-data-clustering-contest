      <p>Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal suffered a devastating defeat at the ATP Finals in London, where he was beaten 6-2, 6-4 by Alexander Zverev in his opening match of the tournament on Monday.</p>
      <p>As disastrous as his loss was, however, it was nothing compared to the press conference that followed.</p>
      <p>While Nadal sat behind a table and fielded questions from reporters, a Spanish journalist asked about the athlete’s recent wedding (Nadal married longtime girlfriend Xisca Perello in Mallorca last month).</p>
      <p>In long and rambling question, uttered in broken English, the reporter said, “For many people to get married is a very important and distracting thing. Before the marriage, during the marriage, after the marriage.”</p>

      <p>The reporter continued to meander, contending that “concentration on your tiniest life has been bit different” after getting married, while Nadal listened and seethed.</p>
      <p>After the question trailed off, Nadal issued a scathing response. “Honestly, are you asking me this?” he said, asking the reporter whether his query was a “serious question or a joke?”</p>
      <p>When the reporter responded that he was indeed serious, Nadal furiously rubbed his forehead while replying, “It’s serious? Yeah?”</p>
      <p>Nadal admitted he was surprised to be asked that question, given that he and Perello had been together for 15 years and had a “very stable and normal life. It doesn’t matter if you put a ring on your finger or not,” he added before having a brief exchange with the reporter in Spanish.</p>
      <p>“Okay,” he added, “we move to Spanish because that’s bulls**t.”</p>
