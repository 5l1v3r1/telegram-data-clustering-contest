      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:22:35+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Joyce Danso, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov.13, GNA - Akua Donkor, a supposed leader of the Freedom Party has withdrawn a suit she filed at the Supreme Court seeking the removal of the President and the Vice President of the Republic whose names were mentioned in Journalist Anas Aremeyaw Ana's corruption expose.</p>
      <p>Mr Sylvester Williams, a Chief State Attorney said he has been showed a letter written by Madam Donkor seeking to withdraw the suit.</p>
      <p>The Attorney confirmed this to the Supreme Court which had indicated that it could not decide on the matter because the panel of justices were not properly constituted.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court Panel presided over by Justice Jones Dotse ordered that a hearing notice be served on Madam Donkor to appear before it on November 27, this year.</p>
      <p>The Court directed that the hearing notice should be serve on her by November 20.</p>
      <p>On June 20, last year, Madam Donkor filed a writ at the apex seeking the removal of President Nana Addo and Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia over the Anas expose over football corruption in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Madam Donkor in her statement of case said in the expose, the two public officeholdersâ€™ names were mentioned by Mr Kwesi Nyantakyi former President of the Ghana Football Association 9GFA) as people he could influence in the award of contracts.</p>
      <p>She therefore wants the two to step down to enable fair investigations into the matter.</p>
      <p>The Anas' investigations alleged that over 70 referees, junior and senior sports administrators have been collecting bribes.</p>
