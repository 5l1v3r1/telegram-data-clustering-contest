Typically selling for $300, just like you’ll find at retailers like Best Buy, today’s offer amounts to $110 in savings, is $9 under our previous mention, and marks a new Amazon all-time low. Samsung Gear S3 rocks a 46mm circular touchscreen and features upwards of three-day battery life on a single charge.

      <h3>Bundle Nest Thermostats with Nest Hub, more from $169</h3>
      <p>BuyDig currently offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/12/nest-learning-thermostat-nest-hub-bundle/">Nest Learning Thermostat bundled with a Google Nest Hub for <b>$249</b></a>. With the thermostat usually selling for $249 by itself, this is like getting the smart display for free instead of the $100 it typically fetches. Today’s offer is one of the best values we’ve seen all-time and comes within $32 of both devices combined all-time lows. Swap in a <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/12/nest-learning-thermostat-nest-hub-bundle/">Google Home Speaker</a> for the same price. Featuring one of the more aesthetically-pleasing designs on the thermostat market, Nest’s model allows you to cut back your heating bill this winter thanks to a suite of tools that help make sure your heating only runs when it needs to. Throw in the Nest Hub, and you’ll be able to take full advantage of its smart home capabilities.

      <h3>Acer Chromebook 14 sports all-day battery at $179</h3>

Usually selling for around $260 at Amazon, today’s offer beats the all-time low there by $20. That’s without factoring the sleeve’s value, which bumps the overall savings here to 33%. This is also the best we’ve tracked to date. Acer’s high-end Chromebook sports a 14-inch display, which is built into an aluminum housing. On top of that, there’s 4GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in storage. You’re looking at up to 12 hours of battery life per charge, and in terms of ports, there’s dual USB 3.0 and HDMI.</p>

Usually selling for $349 at Amazon, today’s offer is the first discount we’ve seen so far and good for an overall 20% savings when you consider the $60 value of the SIM kit. Nokia’s new 7.2 Android smartphone features a 6.3-inch HD+ display with HDR10 support, as well as a three-camera setup comprised of 48MP quad-pixel, a 5MP depth sensing, and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor. This handset runs Android Pie out of the box, but Nokia also promises you’re looking at two or more years of software updates. Check out<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/11/nokia-7-2-review/"> our hands-on review</a> for more.</p>
