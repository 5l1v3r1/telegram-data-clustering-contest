      <p>Now, in line with the launch of new streaming service Disney+, the scene in question has finally seen the light of day.</p>
      <p>Langford plays Morgan Stark, the teenage daughter of Tony (Robert Downey Jr), and the new scene on Disney+, titled ‘Director’s Commentary: Tony at The Way Station’, sees a grown-up version of Morgan talking to Tony about her fate, before she reveals her pride at her father’s sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Tony whispers “I love you 3,000” to Morgan as the scene ends.</p>

      <p>Disney+ has had mixed reviews in its first day of business. The launch of the streaming service tied in with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-mandalorian-episode-1-fans-react-as-new-star-wars-tv-show-launches-2567122">new <i>Star Wars</i> spin-off TV show <i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, which shared its first episode to mark the arrival of the new streaming service yesterday (November 12).</p>
      <p>Simpsons fans, meanwhile, are unhappy after <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-simpsons-fans-angered-as-disney-alters-viewing-format-of-classic-episodes-2567575">Disney+’s widescreen aspect ratio has cropped out a number of iconic jokes from classic episodes of the show</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/avengers-endgame-review">An NME review of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> crowns it “the best comic book movie ever”, saying: “There really is very little that could be improved about <i>Endgame</i>. There’s certainly no more that could be thrown at it.</p>
      <p>“Whether your heart belongs to the original team or one of the newbies, you’ll see them get their time to shine. You will almost certainly cry. Probably more than once.”</p>
