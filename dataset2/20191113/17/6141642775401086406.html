      <h2>Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London is listed as Britain’s oldest manufacturing firm and produced Big Ben.</h2>

      <p>Controversial plans could see the former home of Britain’s oldest manufacturing company – a foundry that produced some of the world’s most famous bells – redeveloped to include an on-site hotel.</p>
      <p>The Whitechapel Bell Foundry was established in East London in 1570 and is famed for making Big Ben and the Liberty Bell, the symbol of American independence.</p>
      <p>But in 2017, owners Alan and Kathryn Hughes announced the closure of their Whitechapel Road foundry due to a “downturn in orders” and moved the operation elsewhere in the UK.</p>
      <p>Now, a contentious planning application to turn part of the site into a 108-bed hotel is due to go before Tower Hamlets Council on Thursday.</p>

      <p>While the plans have been recommended for approval, 780 objections and two petitions against the scheme have been lodged with the council. Six representations were submitted supporting the proposals.</p>
      <p>Ehtasham Haque, a Tower Hamlets councillor and spokesperson for the Save The Whitechapel Bell Foundry campaign, said plans to build a hotel on the site were a “travesty”.</p>
      <p>“(If the plans are approved) we will continue to protest against them and will go for a judicial review (of the decision),” Mr Haque said.</p>
      <p>“The alternative plan is that we can keep it as a full foundry. We don’t need a hotel here. We could and would preserve the whole site.”</p>

      <p>Part of the listed foundry building would be refurbished to provide new workshops and a cafe, which will serve as a “living museum” and provide “long-term public access through the site”, a council report on the application said.</p>
      <p>The foundry’s former owners said they both supported the plans, according to the council report.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the UK Historic Buildings Preservation Trust (UKHBPT) is leading an alternative campaign to save the site with the aim of restarting foundry manufacturing.</p>

      <p>Historic England said it believed the proposals would provide a “high degree” of heritage benefits through repair, restoration and public access.</p>
      <p>The foundry is listed in the Guinness World Records as the oldest manufacturing firm in Britain and moved to the Whitechapel Road site in 1738.</p>
      <p>Its most famous creation was Big Ben, the bell in Elizabeth Tower at the Palace of Westminster.</p>
