      <h1>MG Hector Continues To Dominate Over Compass, XUV 500 And Harrier In Oct 2019</h1>

      <h3>MG’s first offering for the Indian market, the Hector continues to outperform all its competitors in the mid-size SUV segment</h3>
      <p>The month of October saw a growth in all of the SUVs in the mid-size segment. The offers and discounts during the festive period helped the industry get back on track last month, and we witnessed a growth in all SUVs in the mid-size segment.</p>
      <p>The MG Hector, which was launched in July this year, has outsold all its chief rivals including Mahindra XUV500, Tata Harrier and Jeep Compass continually every month.</p>
      <p>MG managed to ship 3,536 units of the Hector in the month of October 2019, which is 928 units more than what the brand sold in September, and has resulted in a 35.58% MoM growth.</p>

      <p>The Mahindra XUV 500 came the closest to the MG Hector in the segment, but Mahindra could only sell 1,378 units of the seven-seat SUV last month. Although the car sold 258 additional units as compared to September 2019, the Indian SUV has seen a YoY de-growth by 36% as Mahindra shipped 2,156 XUV 500s in October last year.</p>

      <p>The Tata Harrier secured the third spot, just behind the XUV 500. Tata sold a total of 1,258 units of the Harrier in the month of October, which means it saw a MoM growth of 33.68% as Tata could only sell 941 units in September 2019.</p>

      <p>The only mid-size SUV with a three-digit sale was the Jeep Compass, which sold just 854 units last month. The compass saw a YoY decline of 26% in terms of sales, as compared to the same month last year.</p>
      <p>The MG Hector is powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged 48V mild-hybrid engine that churns out 143 PS of peak power and 250 Nm peak torque mated to a 6-speed manual transmission along with an optional 6-speed DCT, and a Fiat-sourced 2.0-litre diesel unit that makes 170 PS power and 350 Nm torque and comes with 6-speed manual gearbox as standard.</p>
