      <h1>Rod Stewart Unveils Model Railroad City 23 Years In The Making</h1>

      <p>For the last 23 years, Rod Stewart has been working on a massive model railroad. The successful singer has been featured in both <i><a href="https://peco-uk.com/pages/railway-modeller">Railway Modeller</a></i> (published in his native UK) and <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42ZW9kyoszg">Model Railroader</a></i> (published in the US) over the years, showing off his ever-growing model of a US city inspired by Manhattan. And in the latest issue of <i>Railway Modeller</i>, he’s unveiled the finished product. It features many, many buildings, bridges, houses, and a very detailed landscape with tracks and trains snaking throughout.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people laugh at it being a silly hobby, but it’s a wonderful hobby,” Stewart said when he called into <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50403561">a BBC Radio 2 show</a> to talk about his model. “I would say 90% of it I built myself. The only thing I wasn’t very good at and still am not is the electricals, so I had someone else do that.”</p>
      <p>Per <i>Railway Modeller</i>, Stewart would work on some of the construction while on tour, requesting an extra room in his hotels to do so. “When I take on something creative like this, I have to give it 110%,” he told the magazine. “For me it’s addictive. I started, so I just had to finish. I’m lucky I had the room. If I’d have realised at the start it would have taken so long, I’d have probably said, ‘No! No! Nah!'”</p>
      <p>The railroad is housed in his Beverly Hills mansion, taking up its entire third floor. It measures 23 feet wide by 124 feet long.</p>

      <p>Stewart is not the only musician that has caught the model railroad bug. Here’s an honestly iconic <i>Nick News</i> segment showing off some of Neil Young’s tracks:</p>
