      <h1>Former Arsenal star sends transfer message to Tottenham board amid Pochettino speculation</h1>
      <h2>Ray Parlour has been speaking about Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham's form and the January transfer window</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:40:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal man Ray Parlour has offered his verdict on <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>'s future at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Pochettino wanted an overhaul of his squad this past summer but didn't quite get the full backing of Daniel Levy despite some big-money deals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the likes of Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld are all unsure of their futures, which has led to more unrest in the camp.</p>
      <p>Pochettino himself signed a new five-year deal last year but has come under increasing pressure amid a poor start to the season for <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>, who sit 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Parlour, however, is adamant that Levy should give the Argentinian his full backing, especially in the transfer market.</p>
      <p>"They got to the Champions League final last season and they just haven't really pushed on in the league," Parlour told <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1194527820141060097">talkSPORT</a>.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't help when players are running their contracts down and the dressing room is split at the moment.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing to see that Spurs are 14th with the players and the squad that they have got.</p>
      <p>"I think he needs to be backed up a little bit more. They know they need to reinvest.</p>
