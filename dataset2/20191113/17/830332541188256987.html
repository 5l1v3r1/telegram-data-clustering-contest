      <p>(CNN) - Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday depicted a robust US economy with a healthy job market and rising incomes, but warned of "noteworthy risks" that threaten future growth.</p>
      <p>"In particular, sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks," Powell said in prepared remarks for testimony before the Joint Economic Committee.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Fed cut rates for the third time this year, to a range of 1.5% and 1.75%. Powell said the series of rate cuts have helped to keep the US economy and inflation nearing its target of 2% â€” the level the central bank considers healthy.</p>
      <p>In his remarks, he underscored his message at a press conference following last month's policy-setting meeting, pointing to persistent trade tensions and slowing global growth as a rationale for recent rate cuts.</p>
      <p>He stressed to lawmakers that "policy is not on a preset course," and the Fed would continue to monitor ongoing developments and act as needed.</p>
      <p>"We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective," said Powell.</p>
