      <p>There’s been a major blow dealt to Maritzburg United ahead of their big Telkom Knockout clash with Kaizer Chiefs, and it leaves Eric Tinkler with a decision to make… </p>

      </p>
      <p>Siyanda Xulu has been a big player for the Team of Choice since they snapped him up as a free agent from the Amakhosi in 2017, and he’s continued to shine in 2019/20 after Tinkler decided to deploy him in a different position as a defensive midfielder. </p>
      <p>Now though, with a chance to reach the TKO final on the line, the Maritzburg head coach will have to find an alternative in that number six position after the Bafana Bafana international picked up an ankle injury that is set to rule him out for at least a month. </p>
      <p>Xulu picked up his injury in the 2-2 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic last Friday as his teammates heroically fought back from 2-0 down to keep up their unbeaten run despite being reduced to 10 men when the 27-year-old had to be stretchered off. </p>

      </p>
      <p>According to Siya sources, the former Amakhosi man will now miss around four weeks of action as he recovers from the ankle knock, meaning that he will definitely not be available for their semifinal on November 24.</p>
