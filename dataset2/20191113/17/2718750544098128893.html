      <p>Annette Bening says y’all are going to jail … <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoUWEnUwB3Q"><i>periodt!</i></a> In the new political thriller <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/the-report-trailer-adam-driver-annette-bening.html"><i>The Report</i></a>, Bening plays Senator Dianne Feinstein, facing off with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough (Jon Hamm). Feinstein’s aide, Daniel Jones (Adam Driver, <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/the-cut-on-tuesdays/gmhr7r">large</a>), is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/sundance-2019-the-report-is-the-anti-vice.html">investigating the CIA’s use of torture</a> following the September 11 attacks on the United States; the White House and CIA are undermining the titular report. “The legislative branch should declare war on the CIA. Heads should roll, people should go to jail,” Feinstein says. McDonough is unmoved. “Is that what you want? To send people to jail?” Cue Annette Bening — <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/annette-bening-elizabeth-warren-resemblance.html">light of our lives, defender of justice</a> — sipping her tea: “We do have jails for a <i>reason</i>.” See <i>The Report</i> — and Annette’s supreme scowl — in theaters this Friday.</p>
