      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 13, GNA - The Eastern Regional Chief Imam, Alhaji Yusif Amudani, has called on Moslem communities to motivate the girl-child to stay in school.</p>
      <p>He said the world was changing fast and girls in Moslem communities needed to be trained to be able to take advantage of any decent opportunity available to girls.</p>
      <p>The Chief Imam said this at a training workshop in Koforidua for imams and traditional rulers in Zongo communities in the Eastern Region. </p>
      <p>It was organized as part of the Girls’ Advocacy Alliance Project, which focuses on combating violence against girls and young women and increasing their economic participation in developing countries.</p>
      <p>The Project is being implemented by the International Child Development Programme, in collaboration with Plan International, Ghana, and funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Amudani said his office would take on the issue of child marriages and educate communities that continued to practice it to stop.</p>
      <p>Mr Shadrack Majisi of the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice, advised parents to keep their children’s birth certificates safely as those documents helped to protect the children during critical situations.</p>
      <p>He warned that people who knew about female genital mutilation and refused to report could be guilty of abetment of the crime.</p>
      <p>Mr Majisi advised the traditional authorities to desist from settling criminal issues at home and report such cases to the police.</p>
      <p>He said the laws of the country was strongly against girl marriages, which was treated as a crime.</p>
      <p>The Girls’ Advocacy Alliance Project is being implemented in New Juaben North and South, Akuapem North, and the Okere districts.</p>
