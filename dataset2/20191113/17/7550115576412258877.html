        <b>The international week hasn’t really kicked off yet, but it’s never quiet where Liverpool are concerned—and injuries continue to play a role.</b>

      <h3>Ankle breakers, ankle breaks</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> know they’ll be in for a tough game once domestic action resumes, but it might just be that they’re feeling strangely optimistic right now.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ focus was massively geared toward <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> over the last month, with rotations, rests and general fans’ attentions all tuned toward winning that match. As ever, after the big game, there can be a bit of a comedown, making it hard to perform with the same intensity in the next fixture.</p>
      <p>Added to that, Liverpool are already concerned about two key starters for the fixtures: <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a>.</p>
      <p>Late yesterday evening, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/mohamed-salah-the-latest-liverpool-player-to-pull-out-of-international-duty/">Salah’s withdrawal from the Egypt squad</a> was confirmed, raising fears he might miss the first game back—just as he did after the last international break with the troublesome ankle.</p>
      <p>Same reason, same worry: <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/andy-robertson-hasnt-been-training-amid-fears-over-long-term-injury-impact/">Andy Robbo explained his pull-out from Scotland duty</a>, saying he’ has been unable to train and could face extended time out if he doesn’t let it heal fully.</p>
      <p>Quick reminder: we have no natural, direct replacement for either player.</p>
      <h3>Gomez keeping low profile a sign of maturity</h3>

      <p>Unless you’re living under a rock, you’ll know the buildup to England’s game has been dominated by news of Raheem Sterling being dropped after assaulting <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/joe-gomez/">Joe Gomez</a>.</p>
      <p>While debate has raged about if the punishment was too harsh, why Liverpool fans are to blame and every other nonsense opinion possible, spare a thought for Gomez.</p>
      <p>The club are thought to be angry that the defender was put in this position to begin with, and Dominic King of the <i>Mail</i> has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7678057/There-brash-Joe-Gomez-Raheem-Sterling-storm-disconcerting-Liverpool-man.html">written</a> why Gomez is the last player to cause this type of problem in a squad and how he is innocent of any blame in the matter.</p>
