      <h2>Two witnesses have begun testifying at the Democratic-led impeachment probe in the US Congress, which could see Donald Trump removed from office</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:24:03+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, Agency staff</a></address>
      <p>US President Donald Trump has lashed out at two witnesses who have begun testifying in the first public hearing of the impeachment investigation to determine whether he should be removed from office.</p>
      <p>The inquiry is looking into allegations the President used his power to pressure Ukraine officials for personal political gain.</p>
      <p>Reuters reports today marks a new and unparalleled chapter in Trump's tumultuous presidency, as the Democratic-led impeachment probe in the US Congress went public with televised hearings.</p>
      <p>House investigators are looking into allegations that Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine unless the new leadership agreed to investigate the son of Democratic political rival Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Mr Biden's son sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.</p>
      <p>Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said: "The matter is as simple and as terrible as that.</p>
      <p>"Our answer to these questions will affect not only the future of this presidency but the future of the presidency itself, and what kind of conduct or misconduct the American people may come to expect from their commander in chief."</p>

      <p>Ultimately is it up to the President to steer US foreign policy but the question is whether Trump used this power for personal political gain.</p>
      <h3>Conflicting narratives</h3>
      <p>Democratic and Republican lawmakers presented dueling narratives.</p>
      <p>Democrats leading the US House of Representatives probe have summoned three US diplomats - all of whom have previously expressed alarm in closed-door testimony about Trump's dealings with US ally Ukraine - to detail their concerns under the glare of wall-to-wall news coverage this week.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The panel's senior Republican, Devin Nunes, accused the Democrats of conducting a "carefully orchestrated smear campaign" and of using the hearings as a "televised theatrical performance."</p>
      <p>He hewed to the Republican strategy of arguing that Trump he did nothing wrong or impeachable when he asked Ukraine's new president to investigate prominent Democrat Joe Biden, a former U.S. vice president and key 2020 re-election rival.</p>
      <p>"It's nothing more than an impeachment process in search of a crime," Nunes said.</p>
      <p>Before the inquiry began, Mr Trump lashed out at the two witnesses who will testify on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump tweeted "NEVER TRUMPERS!" before Wednesday's hearing opened on Capitol Hill with testimony from William Taylor, the charge d'affaires in Ukraine, and George Kent, a career diplomat.</p>

      <p>He sought to undermine Mr Kent and Mr Taylor, with the tweet suggesting they are among members of the foreign policy establishment that never supported him.</p>
      <p>However, the pair have worked for Republican and Democratic administrations and there has been no evidence they engaged in partisan activity opposing Mr Trump.</p>
      <p>A State Department official, Mr Kent has told the House committee today that he does not believe the US should ask other countries to engage in "selective, politically associated investigations".</p>
      <p>George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, is testifying in the first public hearing.</p>
      <p>Mr Kent said such "selective actions" undermine the rule of law regardless of the country.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Mr Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, said in testimony that he noticed there were two policy channels operating with Ukraine, a "regular" and an "irregular" one.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor said the President's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani was guiding requests through the irregular channel.</p>
      <p>He said it slowly became clear to him that conditions were placed on Ukraine's new president Volodymyr Zelensky - and that he was being urged to order investigations into possible Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US election and also look into Joe Biden's son Hunter.</p>
      <h3>The July 25 phone call</h3>

      <p>The impeachment inquiry by the House Intelligence Committee centres around a July 25 phone call that Mr Trump had with Ukraine's leader and the President's attempt to pressure the government to investigate his political rivals.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump maintains that the telephone conversation was "perfect" and that he did nothing wrong in his relations with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The Republican president also tweeted Wednesday: "READ THE TRANSCRIPT!"</p>
      <p>For the past month, witnesses have testified under oath about the call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the alarms it set off in US diplomatic and national security circles.</p>
      <p>In a secure room in the Capitol basement, current and former officials have been telling lawmakers what they know.</p>
      <p>They have said an earlier Trump call in April congratulating Mr Zelenskiy on his election victory seemed fine and the former US reality TV host and the young Ukrainian comedian hit it off.</p>
      <p>But in the July call, things turned.</p>
      <p>An anonymous whistleblower first alerted officials to the phone call. "I have received information from multiple US Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election," the person wrote in August to the House and Senate Intelligence committees.</p>
      <p>Defying White House orders not to appear, witnesses have testified that Mr Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, was withholding US military aid to the budding democracy until the new Ukraine government conducted investigations Mr Trump wanted into Democrats in the 2016 election and his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.</p>
      <p>It was all part of what Mr Taylor, the long-serving top diplomat in Ukraine, called the "irregular" foreign policy being led by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, outside of traditional channels.</p>

      <p>Mr Taylor said it was "crazy" that the Trump administration was withholding US military assistance to the East European ally over the political investigations, with Russian forces on Ukraine's border on watch for a moment of weakness.</p>
      <p>Mr Kent told investigators there were three things Trump wanted of Ukraine: "Investigations, Biden, Clinton."</p>
      <p>On Friday, the public is scheduled to hear from Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, who told investigators she was warned to "watch my back" as Mr Trump undercut and then recalled her.</p>
      <h3>Trump's Facebook ad blitz against hearings</h3>
      <p>President Trump's re-election campaign is ramping up a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> ad blitz against efforts to impeach him, buying more ads on the topic in recent weeks than all the Democratic White House candidates combined.</p>
      <p>The contrast between the president and the Democratic field is a sign that Trump is betting the impeachment inquiry could help him win the November 2020 election.</p>
      <p>Public opinion polls show support for impeachment is concentrated among Democrats.</p>
      <p>Last Friday alone, the president sent out more than 400 Facebook ads asking for donations that would be rewarded with a personalized "Impeachment Defense Membership Card."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The ads are designed to energize Trump's supporters, encouraging them to turn out to vote in next year's election, and help him win over independents skeptical of the impeachment process, said Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist.</p>
      <p>"The Democrats are fired up no matter what. He has to make sure that he's able to match and exceed the Democrats' intensity," said O'Connell, who worked on the 2008 presidential campaign of Republican John McCain.</p>
      <p>Trump also launched new ads on Wednesday calling the hearings "fake" and a "scam," while separately asking supporters via email to donate money to help him fight impeachment.</p>
      <p>The Democratic candidates typically combine to run more ads than the president every day. But Trump's campaign and backers pumped out more than 2,900 Facebook ads in the two weeks through last Friday that mention "impeach" or "impeachment," according to a Reuters analysis of Facebook ad data.</p>
      <p>The 15 Democratic candidates running new ads in the same period had just more than 200 mentioning impeachment, according to the data, which was gathered by computer scientists at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University.</p>
      <p>The Trump campaign declined to comment specifically on the ads, but communications director Tim Murtaugh said the impeachment proceedings were getting Trump supporters "more fired up."</p>

      <p>"We are in the fight of our lives right now," the text of one of the ads said. "The President is counting on YOU to be there with him on the front lines of this nasty impeachment battle."</p>
      <p>Biden has called for Trump's impeachment in speeches and has run a few dozen ads in recent weeks inviting viewers to respond to the question: "Should Trump be impeached?"</p>
      <p>His ads have focused more on attacking Trump over past incendiary remarks, including the president's comment in 2017 that there were "very fine people on both sides" at a rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a self-described neo-Nazi drove his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing a woman.</p>
      <p>U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another leading Democratic contender, has called for Trump's impeachment in Facebook ads.</p>
      <p>But her ads in recent weeks have focused more on her plans for universal health insurance and improving access to higher education.</p>
      <p>Bookmaker Coral makes it a 7-2 chance that US President <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> is impeached during his first term in office.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be an uncomfortable few weeks for Donald Trump and we go 7-2 that his first term in office becomes his only one via impeachment before the end," said Coral's Harry Aitkenhead.</p>
