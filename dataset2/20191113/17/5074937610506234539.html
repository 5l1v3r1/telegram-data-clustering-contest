      <p>Kwahu- Mpraeso (E/R), Nov. 13, GNA - Over 398 farmers in the Kwahu South District have benefitted from the government's 'Planting for Food and Jobs(PFJ)' programme.</p>
      <p>The farmers benefited from subsidised fertilizers and seeds.</p>
      <p>Mr Emmanuel Atta Ofori, the District Chief Executive (DCE), speaking at the assembly's meet-the- press forum at Mpraeso, said the assembly would continue in its efforts to ensure that the public benefited from government's flagship programmes.</p>
      <p>The DCE said many of the farmers have also signed on to the Planting for Export and Rural Development (PERD) initiative and were into coffee and coconut production.</p>
      <p>He said the district agriculture extension officers are also continuing with their efforts to educate farmers on modern farming ways such as proper application of fertilizers, diseases and pests control, planting using the required spaces etc.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori said the assembly also procured 420,000 coffee seedlings out of which 187,989 have already been distributed to farmers.</p>
      <p>He said the introduction of PERD has led to the cultivation tree crops such as mangoes, coffee, cocoa, oil palm, cassava, coconut and cashews.</p>
      <p>He said the PFJ and PERD initiatives are making significant impacts on the economy of the district.</p>
      <p>Mr Ofori called for the support of the governmentâ€™s policies in agriculture to help reduce food imports and create employment in the country.</p>
      <p>The media engagement was an initiative by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development in collaboration with the Ministry of Information to get Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to interact with the media to account for their stewardship.</p>
