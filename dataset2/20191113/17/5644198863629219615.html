      <p>“"We are still investigating how much evidence has been found at the scene related to the explosive materials,” said Prasetyo. “So far, we found a battery with 9V, metal plate, lots of nails in various sizes, and some slice wires that we will investigate further.”</p>
      <p>Also, there was a switch, some body parts that will help us to identify the perpetrator and check through its DNA. The result from fingerprinting will be supported by the result of the DNA test."</p>
