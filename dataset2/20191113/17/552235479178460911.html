      <h2>The Reformer revealed last week how parents said their children were being "failed" by the school they described as chaotic</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:01:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:01</time> by <a rel="author">Edel Kenealy</a></address>
      <p>Following on from our front page story last week over parental concerns with the standard of education offered at Rutherglen High, a disillusioned dad has told the Reformer he removed his son from the school.</p>
      <p>Chris Harrison decided to take third -year pupil Michael, who has autism and is nonverbal, out of school after a number of alleged incidents.</p>
      <p>He said: “My son is still intelligent. He sits at home, reads and looks things up and researches them.</p>
      <p>“Then they have him sitting in school watching a Finding Nemo DVD or Mr Tumble.</p>
      <p>“It’s not right.”</p>
      <p>Chris says this has had a devastating impact on his son, with the once confident learner now lacking any enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>He continued: “My son has always been the sort of pupil who liked going to school.</p>
      <p>“He was keen to go. Over the past year his whole demeanour has changed – all his enthusiasm is gone, and that’s because of the school.”</p>
      <p>One of Chris’ main concerns centred around Michael’s relationship with food.</p>
      <p>Pupils at Rutherglen High are expected to have a co-ordinated support plan (CSP) in place to help them deal with some of their issues.</p>
      <p>Sensory needs are an issue for Michael, affecting what he eats, processes and the environment that he can be in.</p>
      <p>Chris says that the school’s support plan was intended to improve his diet, only for that to never happen.</p>
      <p>“Improving his exposure to different foods and textures was set into Michael’s CSP as he lives on toast and yoghurt and has had dieticians involved to change this.</p>
      <p>“His diet is the main risk to his wellbeing, so the school were to offer a range of the usual greens, chips, chicken, pasta etc to further support his progress in scents, taste and so on.</p>
      <p>“I spoke with both teachers and support staff two months ago, and they asked me about his diet.</p>
      <p>“They revealed he hadn’t been receiving any hot food, never mind asked if he’d like some.</p>
      <p>“It has been pretty much the opposite of exposing him to new smells or tastes.”</p>
      <p>In a hard-hitting e-mail to the school, Chris also detailed other issues including pupils “spending hours unattended”, which he says places the youngsters safety at risk.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council is investigating a number of complaints from concerned parents.</p>
