      <p>Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo is on track to return to game action.</p>
      <p>For his first full-court, 5-on-5 practice since rupturing his right quadriceps tendon in January, Oladipo was assigned to the Pacers’ G League affiliate in Fort Wayne on Tuesday, where he practiced with the team and then rejoined the Pacers to continue his rehab.</p>
      <p>Pacers head coach Nate McMillan was present at the practice. He said Oladipo isn’t ready to run full court every day, but the workout was noteworthy progress.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think this will be something he continues to do, the full court. I think he’s still in the half court now playing 5-on-5, but we haven’t been able to practice a lot in the last week or so because we’re limited with the players that we have,” McMillan said. “(Oladipo) hasn’t been able to get in a lot of work with those off-days and us having to manage the group that we have.”</p>
      <p>Team president Kevin Pritchard said over the summer the Pacers were “hopeful he’ll be back December or January.”</p>
      <p>The two-time All-Star injured the tendon in his right knee in a Jan. 23 win against the Toronto Raptors and had surgery later that month.</p>
      <p>Oladipo, 27, averaged 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 36 starts before the injury.</p>
      <p>Oladipo was the league’s Most Improved Player in 2017-18, also earning first-team All-Defensive and third-team All-NBA honors that year.</p>
