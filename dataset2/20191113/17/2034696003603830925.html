        <b>He choo-choo-chooses to build model railways in his spare time.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/rod-stewart">Rod Stewart</a> has spoken about his love for model railways in a new interview.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://peco-uk.com/pages/railway-modeller#RM-2"><i>Railway Modeller</i>,</a> Stewart revealed that he has spent almost 26-years building a huge, 124-ft-long intricate model of a city influenced by both New York and Chicago.</p>
      <p>Later, after the interview was shared, Stewart rang BBC Radio 2’s <i>Jeremy Vine Show </i>to refute accusations that he hadn’t made the model railway himself.</p>
      <p>Sir Rod said: “I would say 90% of it I built myself. The only thing I wasn’t very good at and still am not is the electricals, so I had someone else do that.”</p>
      <p>“A lot of people laugh at it being a silly hobby, but it’s a wonderful hobby,” he continued. You can see Stewart’s handiwork below:</p>

      <p>Speaking to <i>Railway Modeller</i>, Stewart said that he often worked on the model whilst on tour, sometimes requesting an extra room for his constructions in hotels.</p>
      <p>“We would tell them in advance and they were really accommodating, taking out the beds and providing fans to improve air circulation and ventilation,” the musician said.</p>
      <p>“When I take on something creative like this, I have to give it 110%,” Stewart added. “For me it’s addictive. I started, so I just had to finish. I’m lucky I had the room. If I’d have realised at the start it would have taken so long, I’d have probably said, ‘No! No! Nah!'”</p>
      <p>Rod revealed that he works on the railway in the attic of his LA home.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Stewart voiced his support for his “mate” <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/aap-rocky">A$AP Rocky</a> following the rapper’s arrest and incarceration in Sweden.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/asap-rocky-arrested-street-fight-sweden-2523369">Rocky was arrested in Stockholm on July 2</a> along with two members of his entourage on suspicion of assault following a performance at the Smash music festival.</p>
      <p>Rocky received a message of support from Stewart, who said he was “dismayed” at Rocky’s alleged “mistreatment… at the hands of Swedish police”.</p>
