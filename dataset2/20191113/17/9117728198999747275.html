        <b>Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille and Haas F1 team have extended their partnership. The two will continue to work together into the 2020 Formula 1 season having been together since Haas first entered into the F1 world in 2016. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“I’m delighted that Richard Mille will continue to partner with us in Formula One. We share a passion for detail and innovation, and I think it was the belief in doing things a little differently that attracted them to us in the first place. Our attributes are very much aligned, and I’m pleased to see our partnership further maturing into the 2020 season,"</i> team boss Guenther Steiner said in the statement. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/romain-grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kevin-magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a> will wear the advertisement on their wrists. The logo will be splashed around the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/haas-f1-team">Haas</a> F1 car. </p>
      <p>Haas, who this time last year were chasing <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> for the 'best of the rest' position in the F1 world championship, find themselves neared the bottom. With two races remaining in 2019 season, only <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> sit below them. The American team must score at least eight points to beat <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/alfa-romeo-racing">Alfa Romeo</a>. </p>
