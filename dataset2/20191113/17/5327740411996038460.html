      <p>A charge of sexual assault has been stayed against Port Moody Mayor Rob Vagramov.</p>
      <p>A lawyer appeared on Vagramov’s behalf in provincial court in Port Coquitlam on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The mayor has completed B.C.’s alternative measures program, special prosecutor Michael Klein told the court.</p>
      <p>The program allows an accused person to deal with a criminal charge outside the court process. Such cases are considered if the charge is minor, it is their first offence, and/or they admit they were responsible. The measures themselves can include financial compensation, an apology, or community service work.</p>
      <p>It is not clear what Vagramov had to complete.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The charge was announced shortly after Vagramov was elected mayor in 2018, in connection to an incident in 2015 when he was a city councillor.</p>
