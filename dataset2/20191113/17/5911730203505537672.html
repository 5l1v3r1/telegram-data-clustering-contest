      <p>Just in time for the busy holiday season, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/local-news/water-cooler/aldi-offering-beer-wine-delivery-to-your-home">ALDI is delivering premium beer and wine to your front door.</a></p>
      <p>The grocery store chain is partnering with Instacart to offer alcohol delivery to homes nationwide.</p>
      <p>As a bonus, first-time customers can get free delivery through the Instacart app. Just use the code ALDIHOLIDAY19 until Dec. 31.</p>
      <p>Customers ordering alcohol must be at least 21 years old, and must enter your date of birth at checkout and provide a valid government ID at delivery.</p>
      <p>ALDI started food delivery through Instacart in 2017, but this is its first foray into beer and wine delivery.</p>
      <p>To see if your local ALDI store qualifies for alcohol delivery, <a href="https://shop.aldi.us/">click here</a> <b/>or open the Instacart mobile app, enter your city and ALDI store, and search for beer and wine to add to your virtual basket.</p>
