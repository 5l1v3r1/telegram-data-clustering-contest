      <h1>Lee O'Connor in Ireland boost as Celtic kid handed chance to impress Mick McCarthy</h1>
      <h2>The full-back signed for the champions on deadline day in the summer but has yet to make his Hoops debut.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:23:04+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Lee O’Connor is set to make his Republic of Ireland debut on Thursday night  – even though he has yet to make his senior bow for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>The full-back signed for the Parkhead side on deadline day in the summer but has played only for the reserves.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Ireland</a> boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mick-mccarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> will give O’Connor his debut in a friendly against New Zeland with one eye on Monday's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> showdown with Denmark.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was called up after picking up a suspension for the Under-21s and McCarthy said: Lee O'Connor, Troy Parrott and Jack Byrne will all start.</p>
      <p>“Lee has been good, he looks to be settling in.</p>
      <p>“Young players come in and they're always a bit quiet but the other lads are great in making sure they settle in well.</p>
      <p>“Lee is in a bit by default I guess, given the fact that he is suspended for the under-21s for their game against Armenia.”</p>
