      <h1>Varcoe: Curtailment pinches spending plans as $2.6B oilsands project on hold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:36:54+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>One year ago, Imperial Oil injected some much-needed optimism into Canada’s energy sector, giving the go-ahead to a promising new greenfield oilsands project called Aspen.</p>
      <p>Today, months after hitting the delay button on the development — in part because Alberta’s oil curtailment policy was introduced — Imperial still has the $2.6-billion initiative <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/commodities/energy/imperials-aspen-project-was-the-exception-to-canadas-stagnant-oil-growth-outlook-not-anymore/wcm/45d6bf34-8e26-484b-a682-909a8e901a18">on the back burner</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s not about to change, at least not yet.</p>
      <p>“We have spent some money on Aspen this year, but we have largely wrapped up spending. And for us to resume activities at Aspen, we are going to be looking for the provincial curtailment program to go away,” Imperial CEO Rich Kruger said Tuesday after the company’s investor day.</p>
      <p>“At this point in time, we don’t see material expenditures on Aspen in the year 2020.”</p>
      <p>The issue around the Aspen project highlights the delicate balancing act confronting the Alberta government and industry regarding provincially mandated production limits.</p>
      <p>As Kruger told reporters, it doesn’t make much sense to develop new projects today when you’re still concerned about not being able to produce existing capacity.</p>

      <p>Canada’s largest oil refiner has made no secret of its disagreement over the province putting temporary production quotas in place to bolster prices for Alberta crude. Integrated refiners such as Imperial, Suncor Energy and Husky Energy oppose government intervention in a free market.</p>
      <p>Integrated producers benefit from lower feedstock prices in their refining operations when the price discount is wider, although most petroleum producers back curtailment to prevent another collapse in Canadian oil prices.</p>
      <p>Uncomfortably stuck in the middle has been the Alberta government — initially the NDP, and now the UCP — trying to juggle a number of competing interests and concerns.</p>
      <p>The province has been compelled to keep curtailment going to protect prices due to an ongoing pipeline bottleneck, but it is also dampening future capital spending and new projects.</p>
      <p>Last fall, the price differential between U.S. benchmark crude and Western Canadian Select (WCS) oil exceeded US$50 a barrel at one point, costing the province and country millions of dollars in lost revenue each day.</p>
      <p>Production quotas were introduced in January and, while they have somewhat eased, the initiative has been <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/alberta-to-limit-oil-production-to-end-of-2020-as-pipeline-delays-persist/wcm/7ca20574-75f0-4aa4-a27f-75405effebeb">extended into 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>Ending production restrictions without having sufficient pipeline capacity in place could cause the price differential to blow out again, leading to job losses and substantially less revenue for the province and producers.</p>
      <p>“I’m the last person in the world to want to be in curtailment,” Energy Minister Sonya Savage said last week. “We are in it because we have to be in it.”</p>
      <p>The price discount can move quickly. A <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/commodities/energy/canadas-tc-energy-declares-force-majeure-after-keystone-pipeline-spill-sources/wcm/011b8bab-c7c1-466b-adf0-3fae400665c6">recent spill from the Keystone pipeline</a> in North Dakota caused the differential to widen sharply to above US$22 a barrel last month, although the discount dropped into the $18.75-a-barrel range Monday afternoon, according to Net Energy.</p>

      <p>The question of companies increasing their 2020 capital spending depends, in part, on their ability and desire to add more production. New pipelines must be built, crude-by-rail shipments have to increase and the province needs to be able to exit curtailment for that to happen.</p>
      <p>Aspen, an innovative thermal project northeast of Fort McMurray that’s expected to add about 75,000 barrels per day of bitumen output, was initially expected to start production by 2022.</p>
      <p>However, the company <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-imperial-blames-curtailment-as-it-ramps-down-aspen-oilsands-project">announced in April</a> it would slow the pace of development for at least a year due to market uncertainty tied to curtailment and other issues, including market access concerns.</p>
      <p>The Alberta government recently made several changes to curtailment to allow for more incremental oil production, hoping to attract additional investment and jobs into the sector.</p>
      <p>The province agreed last month to let companies produce more than their monthly output cap, if they <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/alberta-set-to-let-producers-hike-oil-output-if-companies-add-rail-shipments">add additional crude-by-rail shipments</a>.</p>
      <p>Last week, Savage said conventional oil production from new wells would be exempt from curtailment, in an attempt to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-cnrl-suggests-easing-curtailment-on-conventional-oil-to-boost-drilling">trigger more drilling</a>.</p>
      <p>Precision Drilling Corp. applauded the move, calling it an important step to improve investor sentiment heading into the new year.</p>

      <p>From Imperial’s perspective, Kruger doesn’t think the change will have a significant impact on the company.</p>
      <p>“These things are all, in my mind, tinkering around the edges,” he said.</p>
      <p>During its investor day, Imperial discussed moving ahead with its Grand Rapids development, a project that involves injecting solvent with steam to improve bitumen production at its Cold Lake properties.</p>
      <p>The first of several phases is expected to start drilling in the second quarter of next year, with production starting up in late 2021, although a final investment decision has yet to be made.</p>
      <p>The initial development cost is pegged at $450 million with production of 15,000 barrels per day.</p>
      <p>Imperial projects its capital program this year will be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Next year, spending is initially expected to drop to around $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, down from Imperial’s plans of a year ago, mainly due to the delay on Aspen.</p>
      <p>As long as curtailment is in place, it will continue to undercut growth prospects for the industry, although it will protect prices, revenue levels and jobs.</p>
      <p>Analyst Jon Morrison of CIBC Capital Markets expects industry capital spending will fall by about five to 10 per cent for conventional oil and natural gas next year, while oilsands spending will drop by 10 to 15 per cent.</p>
      <p>He doesn’t anticipate curtailment will come off until more progress is made on building pipelines. But once that happens, more spending and more production should follow.</p>
      <p>“If you build pipelines, (growth) will come. The resource is there, the sustainability of the business is there, the durability of that long-term output is there. But you need to see pipelines moving first,” Morrison added.</p>
      <p>“Given what has gone on in the market, I don’t think anybody is going to do it too early.”</p>
