      <p>Presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> butted heads with a guest on Good Morning Britain who suggested the the song Rule, Britannia! should be banned.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">GMB</a> host, 54, was incensed on Wednesday's (13.11.19) episode at the suggestion that the patriotic tune - which dates back to 1700s - should be kept off the airwaves.</p>
      <p>The Apprentice star Joanna Jarjue was on to debate the issue and told Piers: "The song was written in the middle of the 1700s and that was when Britain was fully partaking in the slave trade.</p>

      <p>"So to have lyrics like rule Britannia and Britons will never be slaves while then fully participating in slavery, in 2019 I find that completely outdated."</p>
      <p>Asked by Piers if she would ban the song, Joanna replied: "Yeah, I would! Well, banning it completely... if people want to, kind of, sing it in their own private homes..."</p>
      <p>Piers, clearly annoyed by the idea, demanded: "You'd ban it from the airwaves? We'd never play it in public again? One of the greatest patriotic anthems this nation has ever had."</p>

      <p>But Joanna questioned why it was even "patriotic".</p>
      <p>Piers offered: "Because it stirs the soul and it reminds us of the fact we're a great country!"</p>

      <p>Joanna also told him: "What I think is it reminds us of colonial rule. When I listen to it, especially on days like Remembrance Day, I think it's a little bit insensitive, I think for the fallen soldiers, especially the ones from the Commonwealth."</p>

      <p>GMB shared a clip of the conversation on Twitter and a number of viewers were outraged at the suggestion that Rule, Britannia! should be banned.</p>
      <p>One said: "Not often I agree with @piersmorgan... it's a no from me."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "They fought and fell so these little snits could voice their opinions - makes me wonder sometimes though!"</p>

      <p>A third put: "At the end of the day, someone will take offence at something all the time. I'm offended by wasting oxygen on people who continually take offence."</p>
      <p>Someone else tweeted: "It is wrong to eradicate memories from history. They are there to be learnt from."</p>
