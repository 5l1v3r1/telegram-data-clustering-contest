      <p>Calling November the month of <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29783635/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-matching-tattoo-meaning/">Selena Gomez</a> may be a safe bet. The singer and actor has released not one but two singles to massive applause. Now, she's making headlines again for another type of art: a tattoo.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Harper's Bazaar</i>, Gomez posted slides to her Instagram stories featuring fellow singer-songwriter Julia Michael and her getting <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29783971/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-matching-tattoos-photos/">matching tattoos</a>. In the images the "Lose You To Love Me" singer added to her stories, fans see both she and Michaels backstage as they each get new bits of ink. In a caption, Gomez wrote, "It's tatted...my arrow points to you forever," before showing the new tattoo which is, well, an arrow.</p>
      <p>The symbol is small and minimal with no added embellishment, and it's an exact match to Michaels's ink except for one thing. In the following slide, Gomez and Michaels take a photo together that shows their new matching arrows are on different hands so that the arrows will point inward toward one another when combined.</p>
      <p>As for Michaels's posts about the ink, they reveal she and Gomez actually drew the arrows themselves backstage at her show. Tattoo artists <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bradreis_tattoo/">Brad Reis</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/londonreese/">London Reese</a> then tattooed each woman seemingly after the show where Gomez joined Michaels on stage.</p>

      <p>Gomez and Michaels have been friends for some time now, and just a day ago, the "Look At Her Now" singer helped Michaels celebrate her birthday with a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8543277/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-birthday-party">prom-themed party</a>. Gomez, Niall Horan, Shawn Mendes, and Camila Cabello were all in attendance at the event.</p>
      <p>The pair aren't just friends, though. They're also musical collaborators. According to <i>People</i>, Michaels helped write Gomez's first number 1 single <a href="https://people.com/music/selena-gomez-julia-michaels-kiss-matching-arrow-tattoos/">"Lose You To Love Me"</a> as well as her other recent release "Look At Her Now." The pair have also worked together on Michaels's single "Anxiety" that released earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Gomez and Michaels aren't the only famous best friends to get matching tattoos, though. Prior to their reported falling out after the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/jordyn-woods-denied-being-intimate-with-tristan-thompson-in-her-candid-red-table-talk-interview-16423281">alleged Tristan Thompson cheating scandal</a>, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/178630-kylie-jenner-jordyn-woods-are-friendshipgoals-to-the-max-photos">Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods</a> got matching ink. Model and actor <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/27660-cara-delevingne-and-jourdan-dunns-matching-tattoos-solidify-their-bff-status">Cara Delevingne </a>also has a friendship tattoo with fellow model Jourdan Dunn, and while brothers (though also likely friends), <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/nick-joe-jonas-matching-tattoos-vmas">Nick and Joe Jonas </a>have the same bits of ink as well (that just so happen to be arrows just like Gomez's and Michaels's tattoos).</p>

      <p>Clearly, matching friendship ink isn't going out of style. Fans just have to wait to see which celebrity BFFs are next.</p>
