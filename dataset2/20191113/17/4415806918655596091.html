      <h1>Tim Roth reveals he turned down huge role in Harry Potter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:04:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Tim Roth has revealed he turned down the role of Snape in the Harry Potter films because he was worried he would end up just being known for that part.</p>
      <p>The actor, 58, said he thought that while playing the professor might have got his face on lunchboxes, that would have been all he was famous for.</p>
      <p>He added his three children still mention the fact he missed out on being in the hugely popular franchise.</p>
      <p>Opening up about his decision on TV show There’s Something About Movies, he said: “There are films that I do for my kids … and so I got offered Planet Of The Apes and it was Tim Burton and it was make-up and I thought it would be fun.</p>
      <p>“At the same time as that they came to me and asked me to do Snape in the Harry Potter films.</p>
      <p>“I was like ‘OK OK that’s interesting’ and then I just thought ‘I’ll be on every lunchbox or whatever it is, but that will be it really, I’ll be known for that’.”</p>
      <p>Roth said he would rather have a career that is “completely bonkers”.</p>
