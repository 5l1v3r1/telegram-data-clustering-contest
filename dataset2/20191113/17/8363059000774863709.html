      <p>Amazon's Black Friday deals don't start until 22nd November, but that only applies to physical products. It seems as though the retailer has already gone and discounted a bunch of its services ahead of the big sales period, and you can enjoy money off Amazon Music Unlimited, Fire for Kids, and Kindle Unlimited right now.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/music/unlimited">Amazon Music</a> is the one that shouldn't surprise anyone, since we get these deals every year. Right now new subscribers can get four months of Amazon Music Unlimited for £0.99, provided they get their subscription in before the 6th January. And it is only new subscribers, sadly, so if you've subscribed or used this deal before than you're out of luck - unless you create a brand new account to try and get round it.</p>
      <p>Just remember to cancel, or you'll be charged £8 a month after the four month trial period is up.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ftu/plans/PREPAID_1YEAR">Fire for Kids Unlimited</a>, which has loads of kid-friendly stuff for them to enjoy, is currently 40% off the normal annual price. In other words you can get a year's subscription for £47 instead of the usual £80. It's a family plan, too, so that offers access for up to four children</p>
      <p>That will renew automatically at the end of the year, though, with Amazon taking £8 a month if you don't cancel or choose for a different renewal plan. No T&amp;Cs as far as I can tell, but it's only available until 27th November so you'll need to get an order in before Black Friday itself.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku">Kindle Unlimited</a> is totally free right now, with Amazon offering three months without taking any money away from you. The catch, of course, being that you'll end up automatically enrolled on an £8 a month subscription if you don't cancel everything before your third month is up.</p>
      <p>The offer is valid until 8th December, and comes with access to over a million books, comics, magazines, and audiobooks.</p>

      <p>The final deal for Black Friday involves upping the free trial period on two Prime Video Channels - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/offers/?benefitId=hayu">Hayu </a>and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/video/offers/?benefitId=starzplay">StarzPlay</a>. You need to be a Prime Video member to get these channels, but as part of this deal you get 30 days free instead of seven. After that, though, you will have to cancel unless you want to pay an extra £5 a month for StarzPlay and £4 a month for Hayu.</p>
      <p>Prime Video itself also comes with a 99p offer that gives you a seven day trial of the service - then charging £8 a month when it's done.</p>
      <p>No word on when this <i>fabulous</i> deal expires, so if you're interested get yourself sorted quickly.</p>
