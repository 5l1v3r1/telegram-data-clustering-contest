        <b>Labour’s leadership says it has a “very good relationship” with NHS England’s chief executive Simon Stevens, and has highlighted his record working for the party during Tony Blair’s government.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Presenting their NHS plans this morning, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow health and social care secretary Jon Ashworth referred several times to the party’s commitment to roll back various forms of “privatisation” in the health service.</p>
      <p>After working for Tony Blair’s Labour government, which extended the role of competition, choice and the independent sector in the NHS, Mr Stevens worked for UnitedHealth, a major US healthcare company.</p>
      <p>This background, the fact he was appointed to NHS England under a Conservative-led government in 2014, as well as his approach to transformation within the NHS, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-health-department-nhs-legal-action-americanise-privatisation-customers-id-pay-a8033986.html">have long prompted left-wing campaigners including Labour MPs to accuse him of being part of a policy to “Amercianise” the NHS</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked by <i>HSJ</i> if Labour would look to replace Mr Stevens, given the concerns of many of the party’s supporters, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said: “Simon Stevens is a public official… and was actually [former Labour health secretary] Frank Dobson’s special advisor as well.</p>
      <p>“It’s not my style to comment on the appointments of public officials, but for what it’s worth I’ve got a very good relationship with Simon Stevens and respect him.”</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell appeared to support Mr Ashworth’s line, adding: “we’ve worked with Simon Stevens in the past”. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/obituary-frank-dobson/7026352.article">Mr Dobson was broadly opposed</a> to the NHS competition reforms under Mr Blair, which came under subsequent Labour health secretaries.Mr Stevens went on to advise his successor Alan Milburn, eventually becoming Tony Blair’s senior health policy advisor.</p>
      <p>In its announcement this morning, Labour pledged to increase NHS England’s budget by an average 3.9 per cent per year in real terms over the next four years if it forms the next government.</p>
      <p>This compares to the current 3.4 per cent average in the five-year spending settlement running to 2023-24.</p>
      <p>The party says it would also inject £15bn into the capital budget - spread over a five-year parliament - and increase the non-NHS part of the wider Department of Health and Social Care budget.</p>
      <p>Mr Ashworth said Labour would also announce plans for a publicly funded “National Care Service” in the coming weeks, to address problems within social care provision.</p>
