      <p>Fruitcake is always contentious. It’s a dessert that dates back to ancient Rome, according to the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/fruitcake-101-a-concise-cultural-history-of-this-loved-and-loathed-loaf-26428035/">Smithsonian</a> — with other cultures creating their own iterations as dried fruits proliferated. Somewhere along the way, fruitcakes evolved from holiday indulgence to <a href="https://www.visitcos.com/events-calendar/annual/fruitcake-toss/">worldwide punching bag</a>. The Smithsonian suggests it’s tied to when “mass-produced mail-order fruitcakes became available,” when the cakes were aligned more with bricks than delightful, homemade treats.</p>
      <p>Either way, everyone either loves or hates — mostly hates — fruitcake. Even Sims in <i>The Sims 4</i>. But disgust tied to fruitcake in <i>The Sims 4</i> went behind one mere unpleasant experience; Sims that hated fruitcake had their tastebuds altered permanently, thanks to a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Bug-Reports/FIXED-Eating-fruitcake-reaction-gets-stuck-for-all-foods/td-p/6513232">bug that caused food reactions to get “stuck” after eating the dessert</a>. Sims reacted as if they’re eating fruitcake to <i>any</i> food. If they liked fruitcake, they’d be stuck in “permanent delight.” If they hated fruitcake — like many do — they’d be damned to “permanent disgust.”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, a new update to <i>The Sims 4</i> has fixed this bug, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/21/17488208/sims-4-seasons-impressions">just in time for fruitcake season</a>.</p>
      <p>“Sims that dislike Fruitcake no longer react negatively to all other food,” <a href="https://simscommunity.info/2019/11/12/the-sims-4-pc-mac-new-update-patch-notes-november-12th-2019/"><i>The Sims 4</i> developer Maxis said in its patch notes</a>. “On the other hand, Sims that like Fruitcake no longer will react positively to Poor Quality foods. You can say the Fruitcake was the culprit, jury is still out on that one.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Thank Santa!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Also in time for the holidays, Maxis fixed a bug wherein idle Sims were drinking water excessively. “They will now hydrate appropriately,” the developer said. Sure, hydration is important — especially during the stress of the holidays — but some Sims have clearly been overdoing it, and they won’t anymore.</p>
