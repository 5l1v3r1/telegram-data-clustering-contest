      <p>A top official at the Majalengka administration in West Java has allegedly shot a contractor who asked him to pay back debts in a dispute over a construction project.</p>
      <p>The civil servant worked as the head of the financial and development unit of the Majalengka Regional Secretary Office and is also reportedly Majalengka Regent Karna Sobahi's son. The incident happened on Sunday when the victim, identified as Panji Pamungkasadi, requested that the official pay back his supposed debts.</p>
      <p>Panji sustained a bullet wound on his left arm and is currently being hospitalized at Majalengka General Hospital. </p>
      <p>Majalengka Police chief Sr. Comr. Mariyono said they had yet to name the top official a suspect, but he did not rule out the possibility that he was the one who injured the contractor. The police are investigating the incident and determining whether the debt collection process had already been completed. The police have questioned six witnesses in the case.</p>
      <p>"We are still investigating the case," Mariyono told <i>The Jakarta Post </i>on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mariyono's deputy, Comr. Hidayatullah, said as quoted by Antara news agency on Tuesday that "the perpetrator is suspected to be the Majalengka regent's son".</p>
      <p>Based on their investigation, the police found that the shooter used a 9 mm caliber pistol with rubber bullets. The gun was licensed and registered under the Indonesian Shooting Association. The accused official himself was also revealed to be the chairman of the association’s branch in Majalengka. (dpk)</p>
