      <h2>Chelsea winger Willian is out of contract at Stamford Bridge next summer and while Frank Lampard is keen to keep him, two of Europe's elite are keen to sign him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:30:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> winger Willian is a target for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> with his contract coming to an end next summer.</p>
      <p>The Italian and Spanish champions have been circling the 31-year-old for some time and could try to land him on a pre-contract in January.</p>
      <p>Willian looked set for a bit-part role at Stamford Bridge before Eden Hazard’s departure and Frank Lampard’s arrival during the summer.</p>
      <p>But he was again outstanding wearing the armband in the 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last Saturday.</p>

      <p>Willian also remains the longest-serving squad member behind Cesar Azpilicueta and forgotten-man Marco van Ginkel.</p>
      <p>Lampard admitted after Saturday’s win that Willian is still one of his key players, despite his age.</p>
      <p>Lampard said: “The word isn’t 'no brainer' because I can’t get involved in the money. That’s up to the club to do.</p>
      <p>“But everyone sees how much I’m relying on him, and picking him and in what he is producing, I love him at this football club. So there’s my answer.”</p>

      <p>Lampard added: "When I looked at him at the start of the season, I saw him being huge for me and the way we want to play.</p>
      <p>"The off-the-ball work he's done is an absolutely outstanding example for Callum Hudson-Odoi, Christian Pulisic and other young wingers who think the only part of the game is going past people and crossing or shooting.</p>
      <p>"He does the other side brilliantly, with absolute humility, so he's been a joy and one of the experienced players that's really helping the young boys."</p>
      <p>Willian has won the Premier League, League Cup, FA Cup and Europa League since his arrival in west London from Anzhi Makhachkala in 2013.</p>
