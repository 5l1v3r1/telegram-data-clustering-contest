      <p><b><i>Spoilers ahead for Episodes 1-3 of </i><a href="https://nerdist.com/article/castle-rock-season-2-stephen-king-easter-eggs/">Castle Rock<i> Season 2</i></a><i>. </i></b><i>Castle Rock </i>Season 2 may only be loosely connected to Season 1<i>, </i>but it still has plenty of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-stephen-king-easter-eggs-in-castle-rock-harken-back-to-your-favorite-spooky-tales-from-the-horror-master-9852127">Stephen King Easter Eggs</a>. In the three episodes released thus far, it primarily draws from three of King's novels: 1991's <i>Needful Things,</i> 1975's <i>Salem's Lot</i>,<i> </i>and 1987's <i>Misery</i>, the last of which is most prominent, considering Season 2 follows <i>Misery </i>villain Annie Wilkes (played by Lizzie Caplan). However, the story unfolds before the events of <i>Misery</i>, instead functioning like a prequel.</p>
      <p>Season 2 also features Pop Merrill (played by <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>'s Tim Robbins), a character mentioned in <i>Needful Things</i>, as well as his nephew Ace, who is a major character in <i>Needful Things</i> but may be best remembered as the antagonist of the movie <i>Stand By Me</i>,<i> </i>based on King's short story "The Body." Finally, Season 2 introduces the neighboring town Jerusalem's Lot, also known as <i>Salem's Lot,</i> which is a King novel about vampires.</p>
      <p>Like Season 1, there are some meta references too. The <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-castle-rock-credits-include-a-lot-of-stephen-king-lore-which-could-help-fans-solve-this-mystery-10028657"><i>Castle Rock </i>opening<i> </i>credits</a> highlight pages from King's works that inspired the series. As for the rest of the Easter eggs, here's a detailed breakdown (which will be updated throughout the season).</p>
      <h3>Episode 1, "Let The River Run"</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>When Annie Wilkes is introduced, she's decorating her nurse's uniform with pigs. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Misery-Novel-Stephen-King/dp/1501156748">the novel <i>Misery</i></a><i>,</i> Annie has a pet pig that she names after her favorite character — and a statue version of said pig plays a role in her ultimate death.</li>
        <li>The fact that Annie's daughter is named Joy, the emotional opposite of misery, is also a callback to the book.</li>
        <li>Annie and Joy are searching for "The Laughing Place," a concept taken from <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/uncle-remus-tales">Joel Chandler Harris' <i>Uncle Remus</i> tales</a> that Annie references in <i>Misery</i>.</li>
        <li>Annie's car crashes in Castle Rock, and <i>Misery</i> begins with a car crash too.</li>
        <li>Ace calls Annie "Nineteen" after her cabin number, and <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/19">19 is a significant number</a> in the King canon.</li>
        <li>The Merrill family owns the junk shop Emporium Galorium, a <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/The_Emporium_Galorium">key location in <i>Needful Things</i></a> that also shows up in <i>Pet Sematary</i> and a novella called "The Sun Dog."</li>
        <li>Joy tells her mom that she feels "cabin fever-y" after being cooped up in Star Gazer Lodge. The psychological effects of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-shining-heeeeres-a-conspiracy-theory-8219343.html">cabin fever is a major theme of <i>The Shining</i></a><i>, </i>as well as<i> Misery.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Episode 2, "New Jerusalem"</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/10/22/9f7b577d-6a68-4e56-a380-33288bd88aeb-casr_202_ds-1135rt_f.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Dana Starbard/Hulu</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Killing Ace Merrill didn't totally stick, which may have something to do with the haunted construction site where Annie dumped his body — and could be a <a href="https://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/pet_sematary.html">reference to <i>Pet Sematary</i></a><i>,</i> in which a burial ground brings dead pets (and people) back to life.</li>
        <li>After dumping Ace's body, Annie winds up in a long tunnel that leads to the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/where-was-castle-rock-season-2-filmed-one-location-was-terrifying-19255008">Marsten House, a key location in <i>Salem's Lot</i></a>.</li>
        <li>There were a number of <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/47420-castle-rock-stephen-king-easter-eggs-canon-connections-full-list"><i>Cujo</i> references in Season 1</a>, so keep an eye on Ace's dog just in case.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Episode 3, "Ties That Bind"</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/10/22/db6877a4-1fe1-43d7-8421-1f347b2b710f-casr_203_ds-673rt_f.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Dana Starbard/Hulu</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Joy's new friend Chance knocks on her door and asks if she wants to go look for a dead guy. Teenagers hiking in pursuit of a dead body happens to be <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092005/">the plot of <i>Stand By Me</i></a>/"The Body." In King's story, Ace Merrill trails the young heroes, and in <i>Castle Rock</i> he's the dead guy in question.</li>
        <li>Actually, if the Wil Wheaton-esque haircut didn't already give it away, it's blatantly apparent by Episode 3 that Chance is the <i>Castle Rock </i>version of Gordie LaChance, the protagonist of <i>Stand By Me.</i> Her friends Vera and Timothy are therefore Vern and Teddy, respectively.</li>
        <li>In self-defense, Joy drugs her mother and ties her to the bed — which is what Annie does to an unsuspecting author in <i>Misery</i>. She even enters a scene asking, "Are you ready?" which is a reference to Annie asking. "Are you ready for the next chapter?" in <i>Misery</i>.</li>
        <li>When Ace returns from the dead, he tells his dad that he's been in Derry, the town plagued by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1396484/">a murderous clown named Pennywise in <i>It</i></a><i>.</i></li>
        <li>Back at the Marsten House, a real estate agent mentions Hubie Marsten, who infamously killed his wife prior to the events of <i>Salem's Lot</i>.</li>
        <li>Greg Grunberg's appearance as a cop isn't a Stephen King Easter Egg, but <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a800667/greg-grunberg-jj-abrams/">Grunberg is a JJ Abrams Easter Egg</a>. Abrams is an executive producer on <i>Castle Rock</i>, and his pal frequently appears in his projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Episode 4, "Restore Hope"</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/10/29/9c87e773-877c-4a1e-b5ad-8bd8c32abdb8-casr_202_ds-1135rt_f-1.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Dana Starbard/Hulu</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>This episode calls back to <i>Castle Rock</i>'s first season with the return of Pastor Drew, played by Aaron Stanton. His new role may be a twist on a character named <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Donald_Callahan">Father Callahan from <i>Salem's Lot</i></a><i> </i>and the <i>Dark Tower</i> series.</li>
        <li>Nadia finds some letters from <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Dale_Lacy">Dale Lacy, the former warden of Shawshank</a> who was played by Terry O'Quinn in Season 1. In the first episode of the series, Lacy died by suicide, and his headless body was found at the bottom of Castle Rock lake — an incident that Chance and her friends referenced in Season 2, Episode 3.</li>
        <li>Annie is watching <i>The Wizard of Oz, </i>which is a favorite cultural touchstone for King. He <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/172878-19-books-with-dark-tower-connections-you-didnt-know-about">references <i>The Wizard of Oz</i></a> multiple times in the <i>Dark Tower </i>series.</li>
        <li>This is maybe a stretch, but is Councilwoman Pinto's name a nod to <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1114302343774916608">the Ford Pinto from <i>Cujo</i></a>?</li>
        <li>Ace, or whoever/whatever is speaking through Ace, takes Chris to the Church and gives him a history lesson about the true founders of Jerusalem's Lot. In the <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Jerusalem%27s_Lot_(story)">short story "Jerusalem's Lot,"</a> a prequel to <i>Salem's Lot </i>that you can find in the collection <i>Night Shift</i>, King reveals that the town was founded by a cult that split away from the Puritans, which practiced both witchcraft and incest.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Episode 5, "The Laughing Place"</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/5/2465d303-0ffe-447e-be8e-eb0985c11c01-casr_205_ds-1352rt_f.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Dana Starbard/Hulu</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Annie's dad calls her his "number one fan," which is how Annie introduces herself to her victim in <i>Misery</i>.</li>
        <li>Annie's tutor (who later becomes her stepmother and Joy's birth mother) is named Rita K. Green, which is quite possibly a reference to <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Desjardin">Rita Desjardin, one of the teachers from </a><i><a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Miss_Desjardin">Carrie</a>.</i> The name "Desjardin" means "of the gardens" in French, which is a similar enough parallel to "Green." In King's novel, Miss Desjardins is sympathetic towards Carrie, but laughs at the prank the mean girls pull on Carrie at the Black Prom. Carrie feels betrayed and attacks her. This parallels how Annie feels betrayed by Rita at the end of the episode. However, also like Miss Desjardins, Rita survives.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Episode 6, "The Mother"</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>King has talked extensively about his struggles with drug and alcohol misuse — especially in his memoir<i> On Writing </i>— which came to an abrupt end when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/21/stephen-king-shining-sequel-interview">his family intervened in the '80s</a>, per the <i>Guardian</i>. As a result, alcoholism often shows up in his work, so it's not surprising to see Rita struggling with her own sobriety.</li>
        <li>Insects are a motif that King has employed with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugqykElOAHQ">scorpion-flies in <i>The Mist</i></a> and the <a href="https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/Can-tam">can-tam <i>Insomnia</i></a><i>, </i>and they come into play again here with the cicada-like bugs following Ace around town.</li>
        <li>Perhaps this is looking too much into it, but the name on one of the coffins underneath Castle Rock, Amity Lambert, could be a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2019/04/04/stephen-king-dennys-and-the-dead-mary-lambert-talks-pet-sematary-30-years-on/#64f834b04c6e">Mary Lambert, who directed</a> 1989's <i>Pet Sematary</i>.</li>
        <li>Annie shoots Rita right through the torso, just as she did with <a href="https://youtu.be/SAZLuoavL3s?t=26">Buster</a> (Richard Farnsworth) in <i>Misery.</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
