      <h1>AMA suffers setback in revenue generation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:11:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Dodoo, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 13, GNA – Mr Mohammed Adjei Sowah, the Accra Metropolitan Chief Executive, has said over the last three years the Assembly has suffered a setback in its revenue generation efforts due to the creation of new assemblies.</p>
      <p>He said the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) in 2018 fiscal year budgeted GH¢22 million revenue but could only collect GH¢17 million.</p>
      <p>He said the Assembly’s revenue generation was also affected because there was no increment in the payment of the Business Operating Permits since 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.</p>
      <p>Mr Sowah made this known at the Assembly’s Meet-the-Press held in Accra on Monday. </p>
      <p>He said in view of the shortfall in revenue mobilisation, the Assembly could not meet its desired goal of providing the needed infrastructure and therefore there is the need for landlords to pay their property rates for development to occur.</p>
      <p>Some of the projects, he said, undertaken by the Assembly include the completion of the new AMA office, construction of market sheds to accommodate 180 stalls at the Makola Market, and the construction of a two-storey maternity ward extension for the Ussher Clinic at James Town.</p>
      <p>Others are a 30-unit classroom block with modern facilities at Sempe Basic School in Accra, furnishing of a 18-classrooom block at St Joseph Anglican Cluster of Schools at Bubiashie, provision of 23 toilet facilities, asphalting of some selected roads, and the construction of a storm drain at Kaneshie First Light.</p>
      <p>Under the Road Safety Strategy Plan for Accra, Mr Sowah said, some equipment were supplied to the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service, which were 200 led-light batons, 300 reflective vests and 100 traffic cones.</p>
      <p>The rest were 70 mounted directional sign posts, 50 raincoats, two boxes of latex gloves, remarking of pedestrian crossing and pavement of markets, and training of MTTD personnel on the use of a new speed guns.</p>
