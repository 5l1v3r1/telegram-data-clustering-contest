      <p><b>Mick McCarthy has named his Republic of Ireland side to face New Zealand over 24 hours before kick-off in the Aviva Stadium. </b><br/><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/ireland-troy-parrott-lee-oconnor-jack-byrne/">As previously confirmed</a>, Tottenham striker Troy Parrott will become the youngest player to make his debut since Robbie Keane, who also made his international debut at 17.</p>
      <p>Parrott is named in an exciting front three alongside Robbie Brady and Sean Maguire while fellow U21 star Lee O’Connor is also set to make his debut in defence alongside Kevin Long, Ciaran Clark and Derrick Williams.</p>

      <p>Jack Byrne will also make his first start for the Republic of Ireland in midfield with Josh Cullen and Alan Browne either side of him.</p>
      <p>McCarthy has opted to take no chances with Darren Randolph ahead of Monday’s decisive Euro 2020 qualifying game against Denmark with Burton Albion’s Kieran O’Hara named in goals.</p>
      <p>Kick-off in the Aviva Stadium is 7.45pm.</p>
