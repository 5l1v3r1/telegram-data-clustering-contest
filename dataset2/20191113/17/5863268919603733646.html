      <p>However, the amendment to the Army Act will be only applicable to the International Court of Justice’s judgments. The purpose of the amendment is to determine the legal procedure of filing an appeal against military court decisions.</p>
      <p>Currently, cases under trial in the military courts and under the Army Act law forbade such individuals or groups from filing an appeal and seeking justice from the civilian court.</p>
