      <p>The negotiations are taking place with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/oman.html">Oman</a>, a Gulf Arab country that borders both Yemen and Saudi Arabia, as the mediator.</p>
      <p>The two sides have communicated via video conference over the past two months, Gamal Amer, a negotiator for the Houthis, told the Associated Press news agency. </p>

      <p>They have also talked through European intermediaries, according to three Houthi officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to reporters on backchannel negotiations.</p>
      <p>The Oman-mediated talks began in September after a Houthi-claimed drone <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/saudi-oil-attacks-latest-updates-190916102800973.html">struck</a> a key crude processing plant in Saudi Arabia - the world's largest - and dramatically cut into global oil supplies. The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> blamed <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iran.html">Iran</a>, which denied involvement.</p>
      <p>The current talks focus on interim goals, such as reopening Yemen's main international airport in Sanaa, shut down by the Saudi-led coalition in 2016. Also under discussion is a buffer zone along the Yemen-Saudi border in areas under Houthi control.</p>
      <p>Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, a former Yemeni foreign minister, told the AP from Oman that the Saudis' main concerns include dismantling the Houthis' ballistic and drone capabilities and the kingdom's border security.</p>
      <p>The Saudis are also looking for assurances the Houthis will distance themselves from Shia power, Iran, the Sunni kingdom's archrival.</p>
      <h3>Divided nation</h3>
      <p>Yemen remains a divided country. The Iran-backed Houthis have controlled the capital, Sanaa, and much of the north since 2014.</p>
      <p>The Saudi-led military coalition, which entered the war in 2015, is fighting on behalf of Yemeni President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abd-rabbu-mansour-hadi.html">Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi</a> and his internationally-recognised government.</p>
      <p>Last week, a senior Saudi official told a group of reporters in Washington that "there is a sense that we need to move to resolution of this conflict." He said the ongoing talks are also focusing on prisoner exchanges between the warring sides.</p>
      <p>The recent rapprochement could pave the way for more high-profile negotiations early next year, a Houthi official said.</p>
      <p>However, the Oman-mediated talks are not inclusive for all parties to the conflict, according to a Yemeni government official.</p>
      <p>President Hadi's adviser, Abdel-Aziz Jabari, who is also deputy speaker of parliament, said the government has been kept in the dark about what its Saudi patrons are negotiating.</p>
      <p>He said he fears that Saudi Arabia could strike a deal to leave Sanaa, and other key Houthi-held areas, exclusively under rebel control - cementing the country's divide.</p>
      <p>"That would be a grave mistake and the Saudis would deeply regret it," Jabari said.</p>
      <h3>'Open window'</h3>
      <p>Talks between the Yemeni rebels and the Saudis are not new.</p>
      <p>The two sides struck a ceasefire deal in 2016 after a meeting in the southern Saudi region of Asir but the truce later fell apart.</p>
      <p>Amer, the Houthi negotiator, said an exchange of messages between the two sides never stopped and that they "kept a window open" for dialogue.</p>
      <p>The Houthis and Hadi's government have also sat at a negotiating table several times, most notably at the<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/un.html"> United Nations</a>-brokered talks in Sweden last December, when they reached a tentative peace plan that involved a ceasefire in the flashpoint port of Hodeidah, the main passageway for Yemen imports and a lifeline to Houthi-controlled areas.</p>
      <p>The recent rapprochement - if materialised - could put an end to a war that has killed more than 100,000 people, destroyed Yemen's infrastructure, displaced millions, and pushed the country's 30 million people into one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. </p>
      <p>Salman al-Ansari, a Saudi commentator who heads the pro-Saudi lobbying organisation known as the Saudi American Public Relations Affairs Committee, said the Saudis were emboldened by their success in brokering a deal earlier this month between Hadi's government forces and the UAE-backed southern separatists to halt their months-long infighting in southern Yemen.</p>
      <p>"The kingdom never concedes anything," al-Ansari said. "Especially when [it is about] securing its own borders and deterring Iranian influence."</p>
