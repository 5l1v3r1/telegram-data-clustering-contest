      <h1>GCB Bank donates furniture to ACHISCO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:14:16+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author">Kwadwo Fordjour Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Acherensua (Ahafo), Nov. 13, GNA – The management of GCB Bank has donated a set of furniture totalling 1,500 to the Acherensua Senior High School (ACHISCO) at a short but impressive ceremony at Acherensua in the Asutifi South District of the Ahafo Region.</p>
      <p>Handing over the chairs on behalf of the management of the GCB Bank at the school’s Assembly Hall, Mr Samuel Amankwah, the Deputy Managing Director of the Bank in-charge of Operations, said the donation was part of the bank’s social and corporate responsibility effort to assist the school.</p>
      <p>Mr Amankwah, the Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, and an old student with the 1974 Group who did not give the estimated cost of the furniture, called on the management of his alma mater to ensure that the students take good care of the chairs.</p>
      <p>Mr George Awuah, the Headmaster of ACHISCO received the items on behalf of the school, and thanked the bank for its kind and wonderful gesture.</p>
      <p>He appealed to public-spirited individuals and organisations to emulate GCB Bank’s shining example.</p>
      <p>The Headmaster said management would soon take a decision to name a dormitory block under construction after Mr Amankwah because of his positive contributions to the development of ACHISCO.</p>
