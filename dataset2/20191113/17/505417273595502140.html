        <b>The UFC’s BMF champion Jorge Masvidal wasn’t too sure about the nature of Nick Diaz’s call-out, when the Stockton native spoke to ESPN’s Ariel Helwani earlier this week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Diaz, who hasn’t fought since 2015, took exception to Masvidal’s promise to “baptize” his younger brother Nate should the duo meet in a rematch of the UFC 244.</p>
      <p>”You want to talk about baptizing my younger brother? That’s on you,” Nick Diaz <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/11/20960136/where-nick-diaz-stands-on-comeback-its-on-you-dana-its-on-you-ufc">said in an interview with ESPN</a>.</p>

      <p>“I never had nothing disrespectful to say. But you don’t talk about baptizing my younger brother. You’re already in a f*king position if you fight with me. You don’t talk like that to nobody.”</p>
      <p>Nate may not be keen on running it back again with Masvidal but judging by his brother’s reaction, its clearly a fight that interests the former UFC welterweight title challenger.</p>
      <p>Nick Diaz hasn’t fought since his no contest against Anderson Silva at UFC 183 in January of 2015, but despite his comments Masvidal isn’t too sure if the 36-year-old is actually interested in a fight with him.</p>
      <p>“Is he asking to fight?” Masvidal said. “I was confused or are we going for a walk some place? He’s asking for a fight? He’s asking for a fight or to go for a walk? Does he know who he’s asking for a fight?</p>

      <p>“Cause I love to fight, especially when I get a little something on top of that.”</p>
      <p>Masvidal is on an impressive run of three wins in a row, including two highlight reel KOs against Darren Till and Ben Askren, and given the nature of his contest against Diaz, his next fight is set to be a huge affair.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know who’s next but everybody’s looking like cash symbols, cash money to us right now,” Masvidal explained. “The next person is going to be the one that puts the most zeros in the bank account, who that [is].</p>
      <p>“A lot of people are saying my name now. They didn’t want to fight me before, like a year or two [ago], they didn’t want to fight me. Everybody wants to call me out now. So it’s funny to me because these same guys didn’t want to fight me two or three years ago.”</p>
