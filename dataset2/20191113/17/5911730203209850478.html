      <p>VENICE, Fla. — Shark fishing from the Venice Fishing Pier is now illegal after city officials passed a new ordinance on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The change comes after the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission implemented new shark fishing regulations in July.</p>
      <p>According to the ordinance, city officials found it unlikely that shark fishing from the pier would comply with the new regulations.</p>

      <p>The new regulations require those fishing for sharks from shore, who are age 16 and over, to pass an online educational course and get a no-cost permit that has to be renewed annually.</p>
      <p>According to FWC, the regulations don't apply if you're fishing for sharks from a boat. It does, however, include those 65 and older who are normally exempt from needing a fishing license.</p>
      <p>FWC says the permit is required if you plan to fish from shore for any species of fish and will be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fishing with a metal leader more than 4 feet long,</li>
        <li>Using a fighting belt/harness, or</li>
        <li>Deploying bait by any means other than casting (kayaking for example) while using a hook that is 1 ½ inches or larger at the widest inside distance.</li>
      </ul>
