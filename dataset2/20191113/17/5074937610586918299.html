      <p>Accra Nov. 13, GNA - Judicial Service Staff Association of Ghana (JUSAG) on Wednesday commenced its indefinite strike with the various courts closed to the public.</p>
      <p>JUSAG on Tuesday announced a nationwide strike over nonpayment of their reviewed salaries approved by the Judicial Service and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance due them.</p>
      <p>A visit by the Ghana News Agency to some lower courts showed that the court rooms had been locked with red banner hanging on them.</p>
      <p>Private and judicial security men were also seen at post. Some litigants who did not know about the strike action were found seated at various locations.</p>
      <p>Kwame Asumadu a trader said he came to court for his case to be heard but the court rooms have been locked.</p>
      <p>Asumadu said if he had known about the strike action he would not have turned up in the court.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Supreme Court sat over some cases today.</p>
      <p>Last week, JUSAG announced a nationwide strike over nonpayment of the reviewed salaries by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
      <p>It therefore embarked on the indefinite strike commencing today.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the National Labour Commission (NLC) has described the JUSAG strike action as illegal.</p>
