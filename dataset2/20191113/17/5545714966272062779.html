      <h2>Play it again, Sam</h2>

      <p>At this point, the only thing that can tear me away from playing more <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-death-stranding-568760.phtml">Death Stranding</a> </i>is a barrage of "install this update, ya dummy!" prompts. That's all the respite my PS4 is gonna get right now.</p>
      <p>The latest <i>Death Stranding</i> update, which brings the game to version 1.05, is a succinct one â€“ it includes "various performance improvements." It's hard to take that at face value, but it's the lone note.</p>
      <p>I can't say I've had many (or really any?) notable performance issues, but then again, I'm playing on a PlayStation 4 Pro, and after 16 hours, I'm <i>still</i> chipping away at Chapter 3 even though it's become clear that Sam should move on to bigger and better things. Oh well. There's no rush. I can already tell it's going to take me the rest of the year to finish this game, and I happily accept that slow-burn fate.</p>
      <p>I'm having a ball clearing out MULE camps, topping up Auto-Pavers, and making sure my compatriots have access to Generators, especially in nasty, far-off places. Speaking of: more people should use the "Request Upgrade" feature on the map screen. Help me help you. I'll even smash that like button.</p>
      <p>Seeing the on-screen message "a path you laid down was used by someone else" pop up at regular intervals is the video game equivalent of those scalp-massager tools. I can't get enough.</p>
      <p>As for future <i>Death Stranding</i> updates, I'd expect to see further optimizations and adjustments, at least in the short term. That's been the trend since launch, but I hope some surprises await us.</p>
