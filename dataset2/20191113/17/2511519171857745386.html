      <h1>Simpsons fans slam Disney+ for changing format of original episodes: 'Some of the jokes have been lost'</h1>
      <h2>Episodes from the show's 20 first seasons are available in a 16:9 aspect ratio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:06:16+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author">Clémence Michallon</a></address>
      <p>Fans of <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-simpsons">The Simpsons</a> </i>have criticised <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Disney">Disney</a>+ for changing the format of many of the show’s original episodes.</p>
      <p>Disney+ <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/streaming/disney-plus-best-movies-shows-list-2019-service-launch-date-when-a9195681.html">launched on 12 November</a> with 30 seasons of the animated show (which is currently in its 31st series) available to stream.</p>
      <p><i>The Simpsons</i> used a 4:3 aspect ratio throughout its first seasons before switching to a more rectangular 16:9 format.</p>
      <p>On Disney+, episodes from the show’s first 20 seasons are currently streaming in a 16:9 format, meaning the image appears stretched.</p>
      <p>Some fans have pointed out that some essential elements located towards the edges of the screen have been cropped out in some instances.</p>
      <p>For example, as <a href="https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1194298167824650240">pointed out</a> by Twitter user Tristan Cooper, in the sixteenth episode of the <i>Simpsons</i>‘ fourth season, “Duffless”, Bart Simpson tours a Duff brewery, where his beloved Duff beer is made.</p>
      <p>While the brewery claims to sell three different versions of the beverage – original, lite and dry – but an extended shot in the 4:3 format reveals that all three brews are poured from the same tube.</p>
      <p>In the 16:9 version available on Disney+, the tubes are partially cropped out, meaning it’s not clear that all three beverages are actually the same.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that <i>The Simpsons</i>‘ aspect ratio has become a subject of controversy.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, the US cable channel FXX aired a <i>Simpsons </i>marathon that also switched earlier episodes from a 16:9 to a 4:3 ratio, also attracting criticism.</p>
      <p><i>The Independent</i> has contacted Disney+ for comment.</p>
