      <p>HONG KONG: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group is poised to launch a Hong Kong share sale expected to raise up to US$15 billion as soon as Thursday, according to two sources with knowledge of the discussions.</p>
      <p>While Alibaba executives are preparing for a Thursday launch, sources said the timing could slip depending on developments in Hong Kong's ongoing protests.</p>

      <p>The deal - the world's biggest cross-border secondary listing - will be seen as a boost for Hong Kong, which recently entered its first recession in a decade as more than five months of street protests and worries about the U.S.-China trade war take their toll.</p>
      <p>Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The company had been planning to sell the shares earlier this year but in August postponed the deal as the protests rocking Hong Kong since June became increasingly violent.</p>
