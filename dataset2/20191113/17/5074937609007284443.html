      <h1>Free SHS programme increases enrolment in Dormaa Central Municipality - MCE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T17:32:30+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Tachie Menson, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Dormaa-Ahenkro (B/R), Nov. 13, GNA â€“ The Free Senior High School (SHS) Programme has increased enrolment figures of SHSs in the Dormaa Central Municipality of the Bono Region.</p>
      <p>Available figures show a substantial increase in enrolment for the two SHSs in the Municipality.</p>
      <p>The Dormaa SHS, which hitherto the implementation of the Programme had 1,876 students, now has 3,338 student population and that of Salvation Army SHS too has risen from 400 to 1,058.</p>
      <p>Mr Drissa Ouattara, the Dormaa Central Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), said this at a Meet the Press event organised by the Municipal Assembly at Dormaa-Ahenkro in the Bono Region.</p>
      <p>The programme gave account of major developmental activities of the Assembly since January 2017.</p>
      <p>Participants of the programme aside media practitioners were representatives from the public and private sector and traditional leaders.</p>
      <p>Mr Ouattara said the double track system is a measure introduced by government to address the challenge of congestion in schools following the implementation of the FSHS programme.</p>
      <p>He said efforts are being made to reduce the number of SHSs running that system because work is ongoing to complete a number of Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) projects to accommodate more students.</p>
      <p>Mr Ouattara said seven out of nine Zonal Councils in the Municipality have been restructured and resourced with personnel to assist the Assembly to disseminate information on government policies to the communities.</p>
      <p>He said the Assembly has assigned data collection on rateable properties and business entities in the Municipality to the Councils to help strengthen its revenue base.</p>
      <p>Some of the on-going projects the MCE mentioned were Six-Unit Classroom Block, Office and Store at Aboabo Number Four, a Community Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Compound at Atesikrom, a Two-Unit Kindergarten Classroom Block with dining hall, resting room, office, store and a Six-Seater Water Closet Toilet at Gyediem Municipal Assembly Primary School.</p>
