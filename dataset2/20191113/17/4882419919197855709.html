      <p>With six first team players and 16 from the B team, Barca face Cartagena in a benefit match on Wednesday. The ideas is to gather funds for those affected by the flooding in Murcia in September.</p>
      <p>Taking advantage of the FIFA break, Barca brought their first team players who aren't going with their countries to play matches.</p>
      <p>That's Neto, Piqué, Junior, Sergi Roberto, Aleñá and Dembélé, while Carles Perez is there too, another player who has featured for the first team this season. Another starter is Riqui Puig, who is one of Barca's most promising young talents.</p>
      <p>The starting line up is:</p>
      <p>Neto</p>
      <p>Morer</p>
      <p>Pique</p>
      <p>R Araujo</p>
      <p>Junior Firpo</p>
      <p>Sergi Roberto</p>
      <p>Carles Alena</p>
      <p>Riqui Puig</p>
      <p>Ousmane Dembele</p>
      <p>Carlees Perez</p>
      <p>Saverio</p>
