        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> are yet to confirm who will line-up alongside <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> in the 2020 F1 season, but it's looking more and more likely to be Nicholas Latifi. The Canadian will drive in a third straight FP1 session in Brazil. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Latifi will replace <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> in the first practice session of the weekend. The 24-year-old says it's good for his rhythm to be back out on track so often. </p>

      <p><i>"I am excited to get another opportunity to jump back in the car in Brazil. It will be my third FP1 in a row, in such a short period of time, so that’s good for the rhythm. I drove in FP1 there last year, so I know the track and that will help me get up to speed,"</i> Latifi said. </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It is a unique circuit, and an older style compared to the more modern venues. It is smaller, tighter, but the track has a lot of character and has been on the calendar for a while. I’m looking forward to getting out there and experiencing it once again."</i>
      </p>
      <p>In total, this will be Latifi's sixth practice session of the season. He had a further five practice sessions under his belt with Force India/Racing Point in 2018. He currently sits 2nd in the Formula 2 championship standings with one round remaining. </p>
