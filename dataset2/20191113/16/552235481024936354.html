      <h1>New Carlisle United manager: Former Kilmarnock star is bookies favourite to land job</h1>
      <h2>The Blues are looking for a new boss after sacking Steven Pressley today.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:14:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p>Gavin Skelton has today been installed as the bookies favourite to become the new manager of Carlisle United.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> midfielder heads the betting after the Blues sacked former Hearts star Steven Pressley.</p>
      <p>Skelton – who made over 50 appearances for Killie in a two-year stint between 2008 and 2010 – is currently assistant manager at English Sky Bet League Two side Carlisle.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old had a seven-month spell in charge of SPFL Championship outfit Queen of the South three years ago and spent a week as manager of non-league Workington Reds at the turn of 2019.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pressley paid the price for a disappointing sequence of results this season which have left the Cumbrian club languishing in 19th place in the table.</p>
      <p>It looked like he had turned a corner with a 2-1 league victory over Macclesfield Town followed by a 4-1 thumping of Dulwich Hamlet in the FA Cup – a result which earned the Blues more than £100,000 in TV revenue and competition prize money.</p>
      <p>But last night's 3-1 defeat to Morecambe – who had ex-Ross County boss Derek Adams making his dugout debut for the Shrimpers – in the Football League Trophy proved to be the end of the road.</p>
      <p>Carlisle chairman Andrew Jenkins said in a club statement: “Steven has given his all and has worked tirelessly since the day he joined us.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We understand the challenges and have supported him throughout, but we haven’t seen the evidence of progress we expected or needed to see.</p>
      <p>“This is not something we can allow to continue, so sadly it is time to change, move on and look forward.</p>
      <p>“I want to say a personal thank you to Steven, he has been a pleasure to work with and this has not been an easy decision for us to make. He leaves with our very best wishes.”</p>
      <p>Skelton was listed as favourite by BetVictor ahead of former Ross County boss and Airdrieonians legend Owen Coyle with Annan Athletic boss Peter Murphy and ex-<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> gaffer Lee Clark, now at English National League North side Blyth Spartans, also in the running.</p>
