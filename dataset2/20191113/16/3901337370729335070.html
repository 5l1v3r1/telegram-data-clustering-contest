      <p>Salah, who suffered a recurrence of an ankle injury during Liverpool's 3-1 Premier League win over Manchester City on Sunday, has now been ruled out of Egypt's upcoming AFCON qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros.</p>
      <p>The Pharaohs confirmed via a post on their official Twitter account that the nation's star striker will play no part in the November internationals as a result of the injury, and included an image of Salah wearing a protective boot on his left foot.</p>

      <p>Salah's most recent appearance for Egypt came during AFCON 2019, when the seven-time champions were eliminated by South Africa in the round of 16.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old's latest injury also raises concern for league title-chasing Liverpool, who could be without the two-time Premier League Golden Boot winner for the club's next clash against Crystal Palace.</p>
