      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. â€” There's a new path for bikers and pedestrians in Fort Myers.</p>
      <p>Fox 4 was at the ribbon-cutting for the Palomino Lane shared-use path.</p>
      <p>The Lee County Department of Transportation recently completed the one-and-a-half-mile path that connects to existing pathways and sidewalks.</p>
      <p>This created a 20-mile route in the area.</p>
      <p>Part of the $1.6 million-dollar DOT project also includes storm water improvements along Palomino.</p>
      <p>Crews also raised the banks of a pond near the new path.</p>
      <p>To prevent overflow during flooding.</p>
