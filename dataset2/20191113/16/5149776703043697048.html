      <h1>Police reveal what happens when people go missing in Nottinghamshire</h1>
      <h2>One man was found two years later living on a river boat, with others saved from suicide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:11:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:11</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>The leader of a police team which searches for thousands of missing people every year has revealed how lives have been saved thanks to the unit's work.</p>
      <p>More than 3,000 people are reported to Nottinghamshire Police's Missing Persons team every year - 60 percent of which are children.</p>
      <p>The group is based at the force's Sherwood Lodge headquarters and it has helped find two Vietnamese teenage girls who went missing from the care system. They were found in Scotland and the West Midlands two years later.</p>
      <p>Another case involved a man who went missing from his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Nottingham</a> home and did not use his bank account for two years. He was eventually found living on a river boat.</p>

      <p>Sergeant Ian Birkin, who heads up the Missing Persons team, said his unit had helped save lives "a number of times."</p>
      <p>He said: "We have negotiated with people on the phone who we suspected were going to take their lives.</p>
      <p>"We have had people who have taken tablets, negotiated with them to meet and then got them to the emergency department.</p>
      <p>"You get attached to the missing person, you may not have met them before, but they don't realise how much we know about them and their habits.</p>
      <p>"If someone is harmed you get displeasure in that."</p>
      <p>Sgt Birkin said it takes on average 18 hours to find a missing person and each call is risk assessed from low, medium to high.</p>
      <p>High is when there is immediate danger to their lives, which could include a suicide threat or an elderly lady with dementia who has escaped from her care home.</p>
      <p>Sgt Birkin said: "It is a constant process of reassessing risk."</p>
      <p>Once a category has been identified, officers will then search their home address, looking for notes, browsing laptop history, and social media activity.</p>
      <p>"We will also see if they are still at home. Sometimes they are in the garden or hiding behind the shed," he added.</p>
      <p>They then look at risk such as any incidents of self harm, exploitation, and if they have packed bags or taken their passport.</p>
      <p>"If you know the passport is at home you know they are not leaving the country," he added. "If it is suicide then the golden hour is key."</p>
      <p>For repeat missing people, a file is prepared which can indicate where they were found last time and a list of people they associate with.</p>
      <p>He said: "Going missing means there is an aspect in their lives which is a cause for concern.</p>
      <p>"It could be child sexual exploitation or county lines or mental health or suicide or it could be they wanted to stay at a friend's house but they were not allowed.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of children in care that are not wanting to be housed at a care facility.</p>
      <p>"They want to get back to where they originally came from, sometimes to get back to family.</p>
      <p>"Five percent of our missing people are over 65, not all of them are dementia or Alzheimer cases.</p>
      <p>"An adult went missing from his address two years ago. He left his house and vanished. No mobile phone or social media footprint.</p>
      <p>"He did not use a bank account for years. We covered all enquiries but could not trace him."</p>

      <p>He said through a bank, they finally managed to find him "safe and well" in February.</p>
      <p>"He had been living in a boat on a river and did not want anyone to know he was there.</p>
      <p>"There was no mental health or exploitation. It was just the choice he had made.</p>
      <p>"But people were concerned because he had left them behind. It was a nice closure for his family."</p>
      <p>Sometimes the team find that a missing person is the beginning of a murder enquiry.</p>
      <p>"It is rare but it does happen," he added. "When they don't return home eventually it is reported to us by loved ones and friends."</p>
      <p>He said those who arrive in the country illegally and are put into care but then disappear are difficult to track as they don't have a 'footprint' in the UK.</p>
      <p>The team - made up of 14 staff including two sergeants and seven staff on attachment - said they won't stop looking whatever the case might be.</p>
      <p>"We don't give up on people," Sgt Birkin said.</p>
