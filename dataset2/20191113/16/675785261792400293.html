      <p>With just over a month left until <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas,</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lidl">Lidl</a> has launched a huge half price toy sale.</p>
      <p>Hitting stores next week (Thursday 21 November), there's big discounts on both Lidl's own brand offerings, as well as a number of other popular toy brands including Lego, Frozen 2 and Star Wars.</p>
      <p>Prices start at just £2.99, with the affordable German supermarket offering up to 50% off their huge selection of toys.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a big present, there's an impressive Ride-On Audi TT for £129, which comes packed full of features including two speed settings, LED headlights and taillights and a 90 minute battery life.</p>
      <p>However, while it may not be exactly the same one, Smyths are also selling a ride on Audi TT, for just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Foutdoor%2Felectric-ride-ons%2Fc%2FSM060313&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Flidl-launch-huge-half-price-20875007">£89.99 right now.</a></p>

      <p>With this Christmas likely to be overrun by Frozen 2, Lidl also has a lot of Disney Frozen items on sale, such as a Snow Glow Elsa Doll (£34.99), Frozen Dressing Table (£29.99) and a Mini Bluetooth Tower Speaker with Microphone (£29.99).</p>
      <p>Christmas isn't Christmas without at least one bit of Lego, with Lidl also slashing the price of a Lego Star Wars set to £39.99, and a Harry Potter one to £11.99.</p>
      <p>Of course, there's also some slime involved, with cult favourite Colour Changing Slime also included in the mix, now £4.99.</p>
      <p>The sale event comes at the perfect time, as Lidl shoppers all across the country start getting Christmas presents prepped for their little ones, because while we always want to give our kids the best of the best, it's also important to stay within the budget.</p>
