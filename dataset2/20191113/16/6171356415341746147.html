      <h1>Let's get physical: Dead Zebra releases series of sports-themed Android figures</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:45:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Andrew Bell, the artist behind the company Dead Zebra, has been releasing fun Android-themed figures <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/tags/dead-zebra/">for years</a>. If you just can't get enough of the little bugdroids, or if you haven't purchased any already (you monster!), the company now has 12 more figures available.</p>
      <p>The new 'Activate!' series contains 12 mini figures, available in individual boxes ($12 a pop) or in a complete set ($132). The designs include Baseball, Basketball, Gaming, Boxing, (American) Football, Golf, Hocket, Running, Skateboarding, Soccer, Swimming, and Tennis. As always with Dead Zebra, the designs are pretty great.</p>

      <p>You can buy the complete set or individual items at the link below. If you'll excuse me, I need to finish purchasing the gaming figure.</p>
