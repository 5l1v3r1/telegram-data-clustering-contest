      <h1>The Iconic Coca Cola Christmas Truck Is Going on Tour and Here's Where You Can Find It</h1>

      <p>The Coca Cola truck has become synonymous with Christmas and it's going on tour for photo ops.</p>
      <p>It's not Christmas if there's not a geriatric old man or a couple of polar bears pushing sugar-filled drinks onto your kids, while a big, glowing red truck ominously sails past in the background, and you can visit that very same truck on its UK tour that starts his weekend and wraps up next month.</p>
      <p>Apparently the truck has been doing the rounds for almost a decade, and this year, new stops have been added to the list, making for a total of 19 locations ahead of its final London stop.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.coca-cola.co.uk/stories/keep-on-trucking">Coca Cola site</a> mentions a "glittering winter wonderland setting" for your photos, so I'm assuming they'll be sprucing up the place to draw in the masses. Visitors to the truck will get a 150ml Coca-Cola zero sugar, and if you swing by its Asda and Sainsbury's stops, you can buy a pack of 250ml glass bottles of Coca-Cola personalised with your name. Let's hope they're printing out labels there and then, because the likelihood of finding a bottle with 'Shabana' emblazoned across it is zero, and I'm sure there are equally ridiculous names out there that'll struggle.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of Christmas, there's a bit of fundraising going on, with Coca Cola donating 10p to <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/">Crisis</a>, the national homelessness charity, for every can tossed into its recycling bins throughout the truck's tour, so you're now obliged to chug a can while visiting the truck and disposing of it there and then to make sure the charity actually benefits.</p>
