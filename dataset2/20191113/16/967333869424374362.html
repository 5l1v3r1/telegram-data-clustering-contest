        <b>Workers from six McDonald's stores coalesced at the Wadsworth Town branch demanding better pay and an end to zeros hour contracts. A list of their demands was also delivered to Downing Street for the leaders of all the UK's political parties.</b>
      </p>
      <p>12 November 2019 saw the execution of what was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911061077230538-mcstrike-largest-ever-walk-out-planned-as-workers-demand-15-per-hour-respect-and-dignity/">expected to be</a> the largest planned walkout of workers from the world's largest fast-food restaurant. </p>

      <blockquote>“It is inspiring and motivating to see so much support from the trade union movement, and community for our demand for a New Deal for McDonald’s workers. It’s liberating to see workers come together from different stores striking for a common cause. We are coming together to win a New Deal of £15 an hour, guaranteed hours and a union,” Lewis Baker, a McStriker from Crayford, said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to union representatives, it is the fourth time he has gone on strike.</p>
      <p>In his op-ed for <i>The Guardian</i>, Baker expressed hope that this is the last time he has to go on strike.</p>
      <blockquote>"People are saying that other workers don’t get paid that much, but we say that everyone should be organising in their workplace and demanding a fair wage that they can afford to live off," Baker wrote.</blockquote>
      <p>Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn came out in support of the strikers:</p>

      <h3>"Fast Food Global Day of Action"</h3>

      <h4>An Open Letter Calling for a "New Deal" for McDonald's Workers</h4>
      <p>​The letter said, "We are mums, dads. We are daughters and sons. We are Londoners. We are workers. We work hard at McDonald’s". According to a union spokesperson it pointed out that McDonald's is "one of the richest corporations on Earth" yet they remain "underpaid" and can't afford "basic things that you need to survive".</p>
      <p>"Many of us have gone without food. Many of us work two jobs just to survive", the letter says. </p>
      <p>The letter called for a " New Deal" for MCDonald's workers which it listed as: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We need a minimum wage of £15 an hour for all ages </li>
        <li>We need to abolish zero-hours contracts </li>
        <li>We need notice of our hours of work at least four weeks in advance </li>
        <li>We need the recognition of our union and union access rights </li>
        <li>We need our freedom of speech at work, guaranteed in law </li>
        <li>We deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and not face bullying and sexual harassment. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Sputnik contacted the McDonald's press office for a right of reply but no response was forthcoming by the time of publication.</p>
