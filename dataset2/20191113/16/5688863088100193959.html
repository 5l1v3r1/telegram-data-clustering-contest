        <b>While the day-night Test is scheduled within three days of the conclusion of the first Test, which starts tomorrow, Bangladesh players are yet to practice with the pink ball. Bangla skipper Monimul accepted that none of the players have any idea how the pink cherry behaves off of the pitch.</b>

      <p>After quite an entertaining T20 series, the historic Test series between the neighbouring nations is all set to start tomorrow (November 14). But with the historic day-night Test to start after only three days of the first Test, Bangladesh players are yet to feel the pink ball on the willow.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Indian team have had their share of knocking the pink ball as the team management had requested for pink cherries from the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association. Bangladesh Test captain Monimul Haque acknowledges the fact that they are yet to practice with the pink ball in India and informed that they did practice a little back at their home. Haque also stated that the players are still unaware of the pink balls behavior off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“When we were in Dhaka, we had a little bit of pink ball practice but we haven’t done it after coming here. We will get three days time before the day-night Test starts [from November 22], we plan to practise with the pink ball then," Sportstar quoted Haque.</p>
      <p>“I have not played much with the pink ball and none of our players have experience of the pink ball, how it behaves or swings.”</p>
      <p>India seem to be ahead of the visitors when it comes to experience with the pink ball and that of matches under lights. While India has had the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/duleep_trophy">Duleep Trophy</a> and Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Finals played with the pink cherry. But the last time the pink ball was used in Bangladesh was six years ago during the Bangladesh Cricket League final between Central Zone and North Zone. And to add to the word nine of the players in the Test squad was a part of the fixture.</p>
      <p>Let alone the affair under lights, the Bangladesh side might very well be under prepared for the first Test of the series which will be a day match. The visitors will be directly shifting from the shortest format of the game to the longest without a warm up match or sufficient gap in between. While many consider it as a concern, Haque is confident about the preparations as he shared that the players have had enough of the four day games before the tour.</p>
      <p>“Eight players in this Test team are coming from four-day domestic cricket back home. As all the players were playing red ball cricket in Dhaka, I don’t think it will be a problem. Talking about the Indian pacers, I don’t see it as threat. I see it as opportunity. There is no pressure,” said Haque, adding he is aware of India’s multiple skill-sets across pace and spin. “They are capable of throwing different challenges to different teams. They may also challenge us with spin. We have prepared accordingly.”</p>
