      <p>Larger than life and always smiling, this is tragic Mark Connelly who died after collapsing in the Bigg Market.</p>
      <p>Friends of the popular city pubs regular have paid tribute to their pal, saying <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a> has lost one of its biggest characters.</p>
      <p>It is understood Mark, whose real name is John, had been out for a drink with a pal <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/man-died-bigg-market-newcastle-17240976">when he collapsed</a> while walking from the Beehive to the Rose and Crown, at around 5.30pm on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses said passing police officers attempted to revive him, but nothing could be done to save his life and he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Mark, who is thought to be from the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/felling">Felling</a> area of Gateshead, was a familiar face around the pubs in Newcastle city centre, and a regular at the Beehive, the Rose and Crown, the Duke of Northumberland and Pumphrey's Bar.</p>

      <p>Fellow drinkers at his favourite haunts were told of the sad news when they turned up for their morning pint.</p>
      <p>And tears flowed at the Duke of Northumberland, also known as the Clock, as staff and customers heard of their pal's death.</p>
      <p>Barmaid Mary McDaid said: "He was in here nearly every day. Everybody knew him. There's been people crying in here this morning."</p>
      <p>Rose and Crown customer Bill Irwing has also paid tribute to Mark.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/benwell">Benwell</a>, said: "He was one of the city's biggest characters without a doubt. He was very well liked. He was always happy. He will be a big miss."</p>
      <p>Mary, who has worked at the Clock for 17 years, said Mark had been in good spirits when he came to the pub last Monday to celebrate his 50th birthday.</p>
      <p>"He was singing on the Karaoke," said Mary, 45, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fenham">Fenham.</a></p>

      <p>And Lynne Wright, 60, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gosforth">Gosforth</a>, who works with Mary behind the bar, added: "He was just happy-go-lucky. He liked to sing and dance. If anyone was short of money he would buy them a pint. He will be a miss, he really will."</p>
      <p>Rose and Crown worker Emma Wilson said she never imagined it would be Mark when she heard of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old was told of her customer's death when she arrived at work on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't here on Monday night but a few of the regulars ran out to try and help," she said. "When I came in this morning and they said it was Mark it was such a shock to hear.</p>

      <p>"He's drank in here for years. He was lovely. He was mad as a hatter but he was dead canny. He would do anything for you.</p>
      <p>"If I was on my own at the bar he would help out, or if it was busy he would go to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> and get me a sandwich. He had a heart of gold.</p>
      <p>"I don't think he had a bad bone in his body. He was dead placid."</p>
      <p>Another Rose and Crown regular, Pete Bowman, 63, from Benwell, added: "He was a character. He was a good laugh. He always has a smile on his face. I would bump into him in all the pubs."</p>
      <p>Staff and customers at the Clock are now planning to raise money for Mark's family.</p>
      <p>Bar manager, Joseph Chappell, 32, said: "He was such a good lad. He never had a bad word to say about anyone.</p>
      <p>"He was in my pub celebrating his birthday last Monday singing George Ezra's Shotgun on the Karaoke."</p>
