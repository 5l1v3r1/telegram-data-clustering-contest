      <h1>Trial of mum accused of supplying drugs to teen son before he died is postponed</h1>
      <h2>Holly Strawbridge has pleaded not guilty to supplying 15-year-old son Tyler and another boy with the Class A drug morphine</h2>

      <p>A trial of a mum accused of supplying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/drugs">drugs</a> to her teenage son before he died has been postponed.</p>
      <p>Holly Strawbridge, 34, allegedly supplied 15-year-old Tyler Peck and a friend with drink and morphine in the kitchen of the family home in Salcombe, Devon.</p>
      <p>They are also accused of sniffing aerosols together in February - before Tyler was found dead hours later.</p>
      <p>Strawbridge went on trial at Plymouth Crown <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> this week but the case was halted when her solicitor fell ill.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Darlow has now discharged the jury after he said the court no longer had time to hear the full trial - scheduled to last between five and seven days.</p>

      <p>Several young witnesses, including the 15-year-old friend allegedly involved in the alleged drugs binge, were due to give evidence.</p>
      <p>A new trial in front of a fresh jury has been listed for December 3.</p>
      <p>Strawbridge has pleaded not guilty to supplying Tyler and another boy with the Class A drug morphine at the home between January 31 and February 3.</p>
      <p>The defendant has also denied two further charges of cruelty towards the two boys between the same dates.</p>
