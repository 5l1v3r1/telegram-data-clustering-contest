      <h2>The 'Military Moments' 2020 calendar will feature four Plymouth children</h2>

      <p>Four beautiful Plymouth children have been selected to star in a national military calendar which will raise money for Little Troopers, a charity that supports children whose parents are serving in the British Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>The 'Military Moments' 2020 calendar will feature local children Evie Robson, aged two, Georgia Baring, aged three, seven-year-old Neave Walsh, and little Eleanor Owen, just 20 months, in a series of heart-warming photos that capture special moments from British Armed Forces families.</p>
      <p>Army veteran and founder of Little Troopers, Louise Fetigan said: "We are delighted that so many Royal Navy families in Plymouth submitted images for our calendar. All of the images encapsulate the special bond that military children have with their serving parents.</p>
      <p>"One of the biggest challenges military children face is being regularly separated from their serving parent for long periods, at unpredictable times and sometimes at very short notice. That’s why Little Troopers exists, to champion and support all our military children, whatever forces life sends their way."</p>

      <p>Evie's mum, Carly Robson said: "The photo was such a beautiful moment between father and daughter having a cuddle together after she missed him at work.</p>
      <p>"It is definitely hard having a husband who works away for long periods of time.</p>
      <p>"Having an amazing bond with the girls is very important and moments like this are extremely special.</p>
      <p>"Little Troopers is a fantastic organisation. It can be so tough when your partner deploys so any help to make it easier on the girls is appreciated more than anything."</p>

      <p>Eleanor’s mum, PO Laura Owen, who also serves with the Royal Navy on HMS Drake, said: "We are very happy to have been chosen to be included in the Little Troopers calendar to help raise money for such an important cause.</p>
      <p>"As James and I are both serving, the times we spend altogether as a family are very important and moments like the one shown in the picture are very special to us."</p>

      <p>Neave's mum, Hayley said: "We’re absolutely honoured to be part of the calendar for such a fantastic charity. Living the majority of their lives apart Neave enjoys spending time on board with Claire whilst the ship is in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>"This is so she can feel like she has a role in Navy just like Mummy, and try to share some of the ship’s day-to-day experiences together to create those important memories. Little Troopers are adding to those memories with experiences like this one.”</p>

      <p>Georgia's dad, PO Graham Baring, was in the middle of a nine-month deployment when Georgia was born and flew home for her birth before flying back to complete his tour just six weeks later.</p>
      <p>Georgia's mum, Zoë Baring said: "I’m so excited and proud that this image has been chosen for the calendar.</p>
      <p>"It encapsulates how our world changed overnight and the role that the Royal Navy plays in balancing work and family life."It was part of a range of images that Graham was able to take away with him and have next to his bed to look at whilst away and missing his newborn daughter.”</p>
      <p>The Military Moments 2020 calendar is now on sale, with all proceeds helping Little Troopers.</p>
