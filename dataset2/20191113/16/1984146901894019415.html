      <h1>Cadbury warns shoppers not to eat its chocolate bars over allergy fears</h1>
      <h2>The company which Cadbury's have told customers who have bought the product to get a refund</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:37:31+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Sean Seddon</a></address>
      <p>Cadbury has issued a recall for Dairy Milk Little Robins over a labelling error which could have been dangerous for people with nut allergies.</p>
      <p>The chocs are being recalled because some packs contain almonds (nuts) which are not mentioned on the packet.</p>
      <p>Mondelez UK, which owns Cadbury's, are recalling the packs that have been incorrectly packed with  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/day-chocolate-heaven-cadbury-world-16700495">Cadbury</a>  Dairy Milk Little Robins Daim Chocolate.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by the Food Standards Agency: "The product has been incorrectly packed with Cadbury Dairy Milk Little Robins Daim Chocolate.</p>
      <p>"This means the product is a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to nuts."</p>
      <p>The batch affected is the CIS3092812 &amp; CIS3092822, the 93g bag, with a best before date of March 31 2020.</p>
      <p>Customers are told to return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund, or to contact the Mondelez consumer care line on 0800 818181, according to the Food Standards Agency (FSA).</p>
      <p>No other Cadbury's products are affected.</p>
