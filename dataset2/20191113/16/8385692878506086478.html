      <p><a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> has just announced new updates for its Brave Browser, and the major one for Android users is the addition of dark mode.</p>
      <h3>Brave Browser update brings dark mode to Android app</h3>
      <p>New Brave Browser update brings dark mode support for Android users, while the company also made some changes under the hood to make it work even better on Android.</p>
      <p>That being said, the company also made Brave Ads available in more regions. Up until now, Brave Ads were available in the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland.</p>

      <p>With this update, Brave Ads are becoming available in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Switzerland, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Israel, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Sweden, Singapore, Venezuela, and South Africa.</p>
      <p>Now, the company also launched an iOS version of the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/android-app-game-news">app</a> today. Brave Browser is now available on iOS as well, which completes its multi-platform availability. This browser is now available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS.</p>
      <h3>Brave claims that its browser offers 3-6x faster browsing experience</h3>
      <p>The company also announced Brave 1.0 for desktop platforms, and the company claims that the browser offers 3-6x faster browsing experience. It also says that it utilizes privacy-preserving advertisements and rewards.</p>

      <p>As part of this announcement, the company revealed that Brave Browser has 8.7 million monthly active users all over the world. The company also said that the privacy and security of its users is its top priority.</p>
      <p>The company reiterated that your browsing data, while using Brave Browser, will stay private, on your phone. Brave will never see or store the data on its servers, or sell user data to third-parties.</p>
      <p>The company said that users can support their favorite publishers and content creators by activating Brave Rewards. This way, you can tip (using BAT, more on that in the next paragraph) your favorite creators, if you want.</p>

      <h3>Brave Ads allow you to earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT)</h3>
      <p>Now, Brave Ads allow you to earn BAT (Basic Attention Tokens), which you can then used to tip content creators. So you actually have some use of watching ads, while keeping your privacy at the same time.</p>
      <p>Brave says that if you opt into Brave Rewards, Brave Ads will be enabled by default. That is something to note if you're planning on using Brave Browser.</p>
      <p>Brave Shields is also a feature worth noting. It is enabled by default, and its goal is to block invasive third-party ads, trackers, and autoplay videos.
