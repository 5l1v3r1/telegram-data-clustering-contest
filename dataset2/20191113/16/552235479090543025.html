      <h1>Car free zones to be introduced around Rutherglen primary schools</h1>
      <h2>It is scheduled to begin on April 20, 2020, the start of the summer term and last for 18 months.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:33:55+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Edel Kenealy</a></address>
      <p>Streets surrounding three Rutherglen primaries look set to become car-free zones in a move to make roads safer for pupils travelling to and from school.</p>
      <p>The scheme – which will prevent cars from entering specific streets between 8am and 9.15am and between 2.30pm and 3.30pm – has been earmarked for Burnside, Loch and St Anthony’s schools.</p>
      <p>In Burnside,motorists including staff and parents will be prevented from parking in Glenlui Avenue.</p>
      <p>In Rutherglen, Lochaber Drive, west of Ross Place, and Mar Gardens will be closed off to drivers.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Council says its proposed pilot project aims to reduce the volume of traffic past school gates, improve the air quality where there is greatest concentration of children and encourage more pupils to walk or cycle to school.</p>
      <p>It is scheduled to begin on April 20, 2020, the start of the summer term and last for 18 months.</p>
      <p>Richard Tawse, chairman of Burnside parent teacher council, said the committee was “very much in favour” of the proposal.</p>
      <p>The Burnside man, whose son attends the school, said he was relieved a practical solution had been proposed before a child was seriously hurt by poor driving and parking at the school gates.</p>
      <p>He said: “From a parent council perspective and from my perspective personally, this is very welcome.</p>
      <p>“What we feared was that it would take an accident to happen before something was done, that we were being perceived as over- cautious.</p>
      <p>“There have been near misses, where cars have been reversing and parents have pulled their kids out of the way. So I am glad it has not taken an accident like that to affect change.”</p>
      <p>Richard added: “The biggest question people have is how will this impact surrounding streets. If people have concerns come to the information night and let’s try and get those issues resolved.</p>
      <p>“This is for the benefit of our children. It is not for any other reason.”</p>
      <p>Recognising the potential for other streets to be flooded with traffic as a result of school restrictions, South Lanarkshire Council says it aims to identify ‘park and stride’ areas which will highlight safe spaces in which parents, who have to drive their children to school, can park and then walk their children the remainder of the way.</p>
      <p>Residents of the affected streets would also be able to apply for an exemption, as could blue badge holders.</p>
      <p>People who ignore the restrictions would be hit with a £50 fixed penalty notice.</p>
      <p>An information evening setting out the details of the proposal will take place at Burnside Primary next Wednesday, November 20, between 3.30pm and 6.30pm and a second event for Loch and St Anthony’s will be scheduled at a later date.</p>
      <p>A consultation seeking people’s views will also run until December 13.</p>
