      <p>Prince Harry admitted last month that he and Prince William were “on different paths at the moment” in his royal tour documentary for ITV.</p>
      <p>For the Festival of Remembrance at London’s Royal Albert Hall on Saturday, the brothers were accompanied by their wives Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton.</p>
      <p>Ever since Prince Harry confirmed that there was a rift between him and his brother, they have just made their first appearance together.</p>

      <p>Prince Harry finally confirmed that he and Prince William were not in good terms in an interview last month.</p>
      <p>In the ITV documentary, “Harry and Meghan: An African Journey,” the prince revealed that the brothers are “on different paths at the moment.”</p>
      <p>“Part of this role and part of this job, this family, being under the pressure that it’s under, inevitably stuff happens,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But look, we’re brothers, we’ll always be brothers,” he added. “We’re certainly on different paths at the moment but I’ll always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me. ”</p>
      <p>Meghan was dressed in a beautiful black dress and her hair combed back into an updo while Kate donned a navy dress with a glitzy black headband.</p>
      <p>The ladies wore poppy pins to mark Remembrance week.</p>
      <p>The event is to commemorate all those who have lost their lives in conflict.</p>
      <p>The Queen and other royal members of the royal family were present for the event.</p>
