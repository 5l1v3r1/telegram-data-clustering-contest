      <p>The <b>Hyundai Vision T</b> concept has been teased ahead of its debut at the <b>Los Angeles motor show</b> next week.</p>
      <p>It's not clear if the concept previews a new coupe crossover model for the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> range, but it's likely many of these design elements will pop up on future production models, including the next-generation <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/tucson/">Tucson</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/801070/2021-hyundai-tucson-spied-once-more/">Spy photos</a> snapped recently at the Nurburgring, show the new Tucson has a grille, squared off wheel arches and slashes along the side which are very similar to those of the Vision T concept.</p>
      <p>The two shadowy preview images released overnight show a coupe crossover body with a steeply raked tailgate, frameless side windows, and heavily sculpted side panels.</p>

      <p>Up front, the Vision T features headlights which are tightly integrated into a grille with a heavy 3D effect.</p>
      <p>Like the recently revealed <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/hyundai-grandeur/">Grandeur</a> facelift and the earlier Le Fil Rouge concept, there will be lighting elements hidden inside the grille for a distinctive night-time signature.</p>
      <p>According to Hyundai, the concept's grille is completely closed at standstill, but thanks to an automatic parametric air shutter system, it gradually opens up as speed increases.</p>
      <p>Hyundai says the concept will have a plug-in hybrid drivetrain, but details have yet to be released.</p>
