      <h1>Multi-partisan district assemblies will consolidate nation’s democracy – Adu </h1>

      <p>Wenchi, Nov. 13, GNA – The introduction of multi-partisan system in the country’s Local Level Elections (LLEs) is essential to deepen and consolidate the gains of our democracy.</p>
      <p>Mr Richard Kwadwo Adu, former Wenchi Constituency Youth Organiser of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), said this in an interview with the Ghana News Agency on Monday at Wenchi in the Bono Region.</p>
      <p>He called on all especially women to participate and vote “yes” in the referendum set to determine the amendment of Article 55(3) of the 1992 Fourth Republican Constitution.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, December 17, the Electoral Commission would be organising District Level Elections (DLEs) and Referendum in fulfilment of the Constitutional requirement for the electorate to approve or reject a question, if Article 55(3) should be amended to introduce multi-partisan system into LLEs.</p>
      <p>Article 55(3), which is an entrenched clause of the 1992 constitution, prohibits partisan participation in LLEs and political parties are thus prohibited from sponsoring a candidate, the use of existing political parties’ symbols and canvassing for votes on the platform of a political party by a candidate.</p>
      <p>Mr Adu, who is also a former Assemblyman for Ntoase Electoral Area in the Wenchi Municipality, said the referendum is an opportunity that would create a level playing field for women to aspire higher on both the local and national political landscape.</p>
      <p>“Since women constitute the majority of the population, a yes vote will create opportunities for them to select their leaders of choice and women who want to become public servants will have equal chances of been included in the contest”, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Adu urged more women to develop the interest to contest in LLEs, and called on the electorate to vote for female candidates to occupy key positions on the political space.</p>
      <p>He said public education on the LLEs and the referendum must be intensified for particularly voters in rural areas to understand the idea of the referendum to enable them make informed decisions.</p>
