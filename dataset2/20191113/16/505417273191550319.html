        <b>Munster have added 20-year-old out-half Ben Healy in place of Alex Wootton to their Champions Cup squad ahead of Saturday’s Pool 4 opener against the Ospreys.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With first-choice ten Joey Carbery out injured and back-up J.J Hanrahan a doubt for this weekend, Munster are light of options with Tyler Bleyendaal the side’s only available out-half.</p>
      <p>Despite Johann van Graan suggesting that both Rory Scannell and Conor Murray could provide emergency cover at out-half, it is expected that youngster Healy will be involved in the matchday 23 squad off the back of his inclusion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Leinster have added five players to their squad with Scott Penny, Ryan Baird, Ciarán Frawley, Cian Kelleher and Bryan Byrne replacing Dan Leavy, Jack Conan, Barry Daly, Fergus McFadden and Vakh Abdaladze.</p>

      <p>Ulster have not made any changes to their squad ahead of their meeting with Bath on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Connacht have added two players to their squad ahead of Saturday’s meeting with Montpellier. 20-year-old lock Niall Murray and prop Peter McCabe come into the squad in place of the injured duo Sean O’Brien and Paddy McAllister.</p>
      <p>Montpellier, meanwhile, have registered former All Blacks out-half Aaron Cruden in place of Springboks World Cup winner Handré Pollard.</p>
      <p>Each of the nominations may be reversed before the knockout stages.</p>
