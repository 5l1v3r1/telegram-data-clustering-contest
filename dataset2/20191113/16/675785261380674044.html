      <h1>Conor McGregor's coach hints at UFC star ramping up training ahead of return</h1>
      <h2>John Kavanagh's tweet on Wednesday appeared to suggest McGregor may be back in Dublin preparing to return to the octagon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:32:29+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor's coach John Kavanagh has dropped a massive hint that 'The Notorious' is back in training ahead of a possible return to UFC.</p>
      <p>McGregor has not been in action since his loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018, announcing his retirement from the sport five months later.</p>
      <p>However, it appears highly likely he will return in the near future, and he signed off a recent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> post with the message: "Onwards we go. Happy Tuesday everyone."</p>
      <p>Referring to the Straight Blash Gym, the MMA-specialist gym where McGregor usually trains, Kavanagh tweeted saying: "Due to reasons @SBG_Ireland is no longer open to non-members during the hours of 10am to 4pm. Please feel free to drop in outside these hours for pics or to visit our shop etc. Thank you for your understanding."</p>

      <p>This led fans to speculate that McGregor must be training there, and they reacted with delight on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>"Conors back in town! Let the training begin!" said one, while another added "The champ is back to business."</p>
      <p>There is still no official confirmation as to when McGregor will return or who he will be fighting, but Donald Cerrone is one of the favourites to take him on next.</p>
      <p>McGregor recently reflected on his career-defining victory against Eddie Alvarez, which took place three years ago.</p>
      <p>The win meant he made history by becoming the UFC's first simultaneous two-weight world champion.</p>

      <p>He took to Instagram to write: "3 years ago today I became a multiple-time, multiple-weight world champion at Madison Square Garden, New York City. What a moment in my life.</p>
      <p>"To capture the double once. Wow! To do it twice. Lord have mercy.</p>
      <p>"We can all work hard for a minute. Itâ€™s the consistency to do it over and over and over again that will lead you to these iconic moments. Year after year of focused work!</p>
