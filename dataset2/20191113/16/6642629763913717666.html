      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/north-korea.html">North Korea</a> has threatened to retaliate if the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a> goes ahead with scheduled military drills with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-korea.html">South Korea</a>, ramping up pressure on Washington to change course as a year-end North Korean deadline for US flexibility approaches.</p>
      <p>The statement on Wednesday came even though Washington said last week that the joint aerial exercise planned for next month would be reduced in scope from previous drills.</p>
      <p>"It is self-defense rights" to retaliate against any move which threatens its sovereignty and security, according to a statement from the State Affairs Commission, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>It is rare for the Commission, the supreme governing body chaired by North Korean leader <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/kim-jong.html">Kim Jong Un</a>, to release a statement.</p>
      <p>Last week, a senior North Korean diplomat also blamed the US joint aerial drill for "throwing cold water" over talks with Washington. Pyongyang opposes US-South Korean joint military exercises, viewing them as a rehearsal for invasion.</p>
      <p>In its latest statement, Pyongyang said it had taken measures to calm Washington's concerns but that the US had failed to reciprocate, leaving it with a "feeling of betrayal".</p>
      <p>Kim gave the US a year-end deadline in April to show more flexibility in stalled denuclearisation talks with Washington, after his talks with Trump collapsed in Hanoi in February.</p>
      <p>North Korea has tested the limits of engagement with a string of missile launches, emboldened by the impeachment inquiry into Trump in Washington, analysts and officials say.</p>
