      <p>A total of 41 passengers, as well as the driver, sustained injuries, according to Mahamba.</p>
      <p>Netcare 911, however, said it only had a record of 34 people who had sustained minor to moderate injuries.</p>
      <p>"All the patients were treated on scene and once stabilised were transported by various ambulance services to hospital for further treatment," spokesperson Shawn Herbst said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Local authorities were on the scene for investigations.</p>
      <p>A case of culpable homicide has been opened for further investigation.</p>
      <p>Moloto Road has since been cleared and opened to motorists.</p>
