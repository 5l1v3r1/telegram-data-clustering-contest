      <p>Aberdeenshire and Moray will be most affected with wintry showers above 200m away from the coast, with 1-2cm of snow possible.</p>
      <p>Other regions affected include Falkirk, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> , Dundee, Perth and Kinross, Stirling, East Lothian and Scottish Borders.</p>
      <p>The yellow warning is in place for the rest of this evening (Wednesday) and into Thursday.</p>
      <p>Walkers are warned to watch for any black ice patches on untreated roads and pavements.</p>
      <p>A number of gritters will be on alert across the country ready to treat major roads to ensure Scotland keeps moving.</p>
