      <h1>Meet the young Devon dairy farmer with big plans for the family business</h1>
      <h2>Since returning to the family farm as a young graduate, Kate Dymond has been focused on improving profitability and livestock welfare. Karina Oxley met her to find out more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:50:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">Athwenna Irons</a></address>
      <p>Kate Dymond is an ambitious young farmer continually working to upgrade and improve her family’s dairy farm in North Devon.</p>
      <p>Located near Shebbear, Battledown Farm has been part of the Dymond family since 1989, the year of Kate’s birth. Her parents, Rodney and Jayne, set up the dairy farm alongside a contracting business based at the same site.</p>
      <p>Kate spent her formative years working at the farm, rearing calves and helping out, alongside a part-time job at the local village shop. After completing her A-Levels, Kate left the farm to attend university, studying agriculture at the prestigious Harper Adams University.</p>

      <p>Although she originally planned to find a job outside the farm, on completion of her degree, Kate returned home and began taking on more and more responsibility for the day-to-day running of the farm.</p>
      <p>She now heads up the dairy side of the business and is working hard to drive efficiency and improve profitability, constantly looking to make improvements to the farm.</p>
      <p>The farm owns 250 cows, as well as 100 young stock, farming over 145 hectares – 39 of which are owned by the Dymond family, who also farm their own arable crops to feed the herd. The farm solely supplies Crediton Dairy with milk, with 80% of its income coming from milk sales.</p>
      <p>Kate said: “Around three years ago, we reached a crunch time. The shed for our cows was no longer fit for purpose. We had too many cows for the space and we needed a plan to move forward.”</p>
      <p>It was around this time that Kate’s father met Peter Brown, director of Thomas Westcott’s Agricultural Consultancy Service, and engaged him to do a one-off appraisal of the farm.</p>
      <p>Thomas Westcott’s Agricultural Consultancy Service has proved to be instrumental in helping Kate to achieve her short-term, and long-term, goals for Battledown Farm.</p>

      <p>The service offers bespoke support to farming and agricultural businesses across the South West. Kate has been working closely with Peter and his colleague Nikki Smale for the past three years.</p>
      <p>To deliver improved performance from the cows and to get the farm’s finances in better order, Peter and Kate worked closely together to draw up a business plan. This was instrumental in securing agreement from the farm’s bank to construct a brand-new upgraded barn, which was completed in October 2018. Kate’s herd is now much more comfortable, and feeding is more consistent and efficient.</p>
      <p>Peter said: “At the moment, the focus is on trying to increase output, reduce costs and therefore improve profitability for Battledown Farm.</p>
      <p>“Our motto is ‘By Your Side. On Your Side.’ That’s what we are focused on doing for Kate. I am committed to giving her the best advice, provide her with data and make contacts on her behalf.”</p>
      <p>Battledown Farm is also one of the first businesses to take advantage of Thomas Westcott’s Dairy Technical Service, which the firm launched in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Every month, Thomas Westcott reports the outcome of the farm’s milk yield and uses the data to identify particular areas where management might be improved. The report analyses milk production and feeding efficiencies, milk quality, somatic cell count and fertility. This can lead to enhancements in performance, and ultimately, profitability. A number of farms across the South West are now benefiting from the service.</p>

      <p>Kate said: “Thomas Westcott provides us with a rounded service. Other consultancy firms would simply come in and give us information, then leave us to it. Peter, on the other hand, makes himself available, helping us to assess what we have done and advising us on what we plan to do next. <br/><br/>“If he sees something in the accounts, he will ring up and ask questions and suggest how we make something better.</p>
      <p>“Working with the Agricultural Consultancy Service has driven us forward, made us more sustainable and given me more confidence.”</p>
      <p>Kate has built a strong team around her that works together to help her achieve her goals for the farm. Alongside Peter and Nikki from Thomas Westcott, Harpers Feeds nutritionist, Rich Waters and Jo Wingfield, NatWest's Relationship Agricultural Director for Cornwall and North Devon, support Kate and offer advice.</p>
      <p>Kate added: “We have regular meetings all together, and our cows are now performing much better. Providing a detailed plan, and getting the right people on board, has helped give our bank more confidence to help us move forward.”</p>
      <p>Over the next four years, with help from the team around her, Kate aims to improve performance and clear debt.</p>

      <p>Kate concluded: “We would like to increase our yield by 20% to 9,000 litres per cow, per year. We are currently producing just over 8,000 up from 7,000, just a few years ago.</p>
      <p>“We are looking to increase cow comfort, utilise feed and forage better and make sure the right cows get in calf.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to use the information that Thomas Westcott provides to better make decisions about the farm and our business.”</p>
