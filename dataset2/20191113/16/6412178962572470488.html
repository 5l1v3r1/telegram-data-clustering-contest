        <b>Wolves’ chief scout John Marshall has responded to the rumours the midland club may go in for a midfield target they were heavily linked with over the summer, and has opened up on the slow start experienced by star striker signing Patrick Cutrone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a Europa League campaign to juggle, Nuno Espirito Santo elected to bring in promising Italian attacker Patrick Cutrone to offer stern competition for Raul Jimenez in the number nine position.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has made 19 appearances so far for the club but starts have been in short supply for the Italian international.</p>
      <p>Speaking to TMW at the Wyscout Forum in Amsterdam (via <a href="https://www.milannews.it/le-interviste/marshall-wolves-cutrone-e-gia-un-idolo-kessie-a-gennaio-non-credo-351883"><i>MilanNews.it</i></a>)</p>
      <p>“He’s doing exactly what we expected,” said Marshall.</p>
      <p>“He is settling well, the competition is strong but he is giving his contribution. He has everything to become more and more of a protagonist in our eyes.</p>
      <p>“And besides, he is a player much loved by the fans. On the field he always gives everything, we are happy with him.”</p>

      <p>Wolves were <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/wolves-to-make-fresh-january-bid-for-e30m-serie-a-star">persistently linked with another Milan player during the summer</a></b> – <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/franck-kessie">Franck Kessie</a></b>.</p>
      <p>The Ivory Coast international’s slide down the pecking order this campaign at the San Siro had been predicted, leading to mass speculation a move to <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/wolves">Molineux</a> </b>could materialise.</p>
      <p>On the Kessie links over the summer, Marshall added: “There was an interest, but there was never a real negotiation.</p>
      <p>“January bid? I don’t think so, we have so many players in midfield.”</p>
