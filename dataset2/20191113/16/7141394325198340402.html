      <p>From a peek behind the curtain of a massive crypto trading operation to a sharp rise in developer activity on the Ethereum network, here’s a look at some of the stories breaking in the world of crypto.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bitcoin</b>
      </p>
      <p>The head of Alameda Capital is revealing the strategy behind the company’s lucrative crypto trading operation.</p>
      <p>Two of the company’s crypto accounts are listed in the top 10 most successful of all-time on BitMEX, having earned more than $60 million each. CEO Sam Bankman-Fried tells <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/billion-dollar-a-day-crypto-trader-finds-accolades-top-anonymity?srnd=cryptocurrencies">Bloomberg</a> the company now executes about $1 billion in trades every day largely by spotting arbitrage opportunities between crypto exchanges.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“One of the trades in his first year was taking advantage of the over 30% premium Litecoin was selling for on the exchange Coinbase. He would buy Litecoin elsewhere and sell it at the premium on the biggest U.S. digital exchange.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Huge price disparities like that don’t exist anymore, and Bankman-Fried says the company now looks to average a profit of two basis points per trade.</p>
      <p>He says he decided to become a known figure in the public this year to boost the company’s profile and expand its clientele.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ethereum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pace of development on the Ethereum network appears to be rising at a rapid rate.</p>
      <p>According to new data from <a href="https://app.santiment.net/projects/ethereum?enabledViewOnlySharing=true&amp;from=2018-11-11T15%3A00%3A00.000Z&amp;interval=2d&amp;isShowAnomalies=true&amp;metrics=historyPrice,volume,devActivity&amp;projectId=57&amp;scale=auto&amp;slug=ethereum&amp;timeRange=1y&amp;title=Ethereum%20%28ETH%29&amp;to=2019-11-12T15%3A00%3A00.000Z">Santiment</a>, the number of “events” happening on Ethereum’s GitHub has more than doubled in the last month.</p>
      <p>An event can be a comment, Wiki edit, press release or the sheer number of projects on a GibHub repository.</p>

        <b>Ripple and XRP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ripple’s global hiring spree continues.</p>
      <p>The company says it’s now looking for a business analyst based in London who will help monitor the company’s payment network, RippleNet. Ripple currently has 56 <a href="https://ripple.com/company/careers/all-jobs/?gh_jid=1933813&amp;gh_src=b8941bc61#">open positions</a>.</p>
