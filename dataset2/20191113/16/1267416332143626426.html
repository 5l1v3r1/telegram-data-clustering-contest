      <h2>The company says that the new system cuts road noise by half</h2>

      <p>Hyundai has announced that it has developed new and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-noise-cancellation-technology/">advanced sound-cancelling technology</a> for its vehicles.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer says that the ‘Road Noise Active Noise Control’ (RANC) has more sensors and computing power than standard active noise control systems. It is able to analyze a variety of different sounds in real-time.</p>
      <p>Hyundai says that RANC can detect and counteract noises that impact the driver, passenger and back-seat occupants individually. It can do so by 3 decibels, which for reference means that it can reduce noise inside a vehicle by half.</p>
      <p>RANC uses an acceleration sensor that is able to detect vibrations coming from a car rolling down the road. A computer analyzes this information and then emits a counter-wave from a processor.</p>
      <p>This technology took Hyundai six years to develop and obtain a version that was ready for mass production.</p>
      <p>To ensure that Hyundai will be the first to market a vehicle with this system, it hold patents for the technology behind the RANC.</p>
