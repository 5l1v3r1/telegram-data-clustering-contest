      <p>In this day and age it seems almost every moment is captured on a smart phone with the intention of sharing it on social media.</p>
      <p>And while we're often told that it's better not to live your life looking through a camera lens, as there's so much you miss, one <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">dad</a> is feeling pretty good about the important memory he recently filmed.</p>
      <p>Neil Granger from South East London managed to film the heart-warming moment his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> boy, Finley, took his very first steps.</p>
      <p>Also captured in the video are the priceless reactions to Finley's stunned relatives, which makes it an even better watch.</p>

      <p>Not every parent is lucky enough to capture the once-in-a-lifetime moment, but Neil managed to film his son tottering around the living room on his first birthday.</p>
      <p>In the clip, one-year-old Finley can be seen pulling himself up on a coffee table before toddling over to his mum, who is sat on the sofa opposite.</p>
      <p>As they watch him do so, his family members are bursting with shock and delight, their expressions of elations are made all the more joyful to watch as the clip stretches out in slow motion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Neil shared the touching footage with his followers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> where the video garnered almost half a million views.</p>
      <p>The proud dad said: "My family were visiting last weekend for my son's first birthday. We had a feeling that he wasn't far off walking so decided to film him just in case.</p>
      <p>"To our surprise, he bravely set off towards his mum. We couldn't believe we managed to catch such an amazing moment in front of the people who love him most in the world."</p>
      <p>He added: "I put the video out on Twitter and couldn't quite believe the response we got - people seemed to get almost as emotional as we got.</p>
      <p>"I feel proud to think my boy's first steps brought even just a little bit of joy at this most divisive of times."</p>
