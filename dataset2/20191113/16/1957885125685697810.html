      <p><b>News</b> by Imogen Beckhelling, Reporter Intern Updated on 13 November 2019</p>
      <p>Mark the 10th of December on your calendar, Shovel Knight fans, as Yacht Club Games is releasing a hefty amount of Shovel Knight content for you to sink your spade into.</p>
      <p>First up we have Shovel Knight: King of Cards, the spin-off 2D platformer that focuses on King Knight which also includes the card game Jaustus.</p>

      <p>Next is Shovel Knight Showdown, the local four-player battler. Both of these are the final additions to Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove, and anyone who already owns the Treasure Trove bundle can get both King of Cards and Showdown for free. Alternatively, these can be bought separately (except by players using the Nintendo 3DS or PS Vita, as Showdown will not be available for those platforms).</p>
      <p>A Treasure Trove amiibo three-pack and a Shovel Knight Gold Edition amiibo will also release on the 10th December, along with a physical edition of Treasure Trove - though, the release of the PS4 physical version has been pushed back to 2020 <a href="https://yachtclubgames.com/2019/11/final-release-date-for-all-things-shovel-knight-treasure-trove/#">"due to unforeseen manufacturing issues"</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-28-shovel-knights-long-awaited-king-of-cards-campaign-and-showdown-spin-off-out-in-december">Yacht Club games revealed a heap of info about these upcoming games</a> back in August, also giving us our first look at Shovel Knight Dig. There's a little ways to go before we see that one get any sort of release date, but for now we have the trailer below to get an idea of what's in store.</p>
