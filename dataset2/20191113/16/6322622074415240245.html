      <p>PONTIAN (Nov 13): Pakatan Harapan (PH) deputy president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has urged the police to be fairer pertaining to campaigning activities carried out by the candidates standing for election in the Tanjung Piai Parliamentary by-election to ensure it runs smoothly and safely.</p>
      <p>He said as of today he had not received any reports on any worrying trend from the security standpoint, and that he urged the police to show special consideration to ensure a less restrictive campaign.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, we hope that the police will be more considerate as long as there are no fights, no alarming situation.</p>
      <p>“This is because political parties must be given space when campaigning. Party workers also need to adhere to the rules and so forth to avoid any untoward (incident),” he told reporters after attending a briefing on PH machinery in the main operation room in Rambah here today.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin was commenting on the new electoral ruling issued by the police and the Election Commission (EC) for the political parties to obtain permits to carry out house-to-house campaigning and the walkabout programme which were considered as mobile campaigning.</p>
      <p>The new ruling has sparked dissatisfaction among many, especially in Barisan Nasional (BN), as it was only issued yesterday after the campaigning for the by-election had been carried out for 11 days.</p>
      <p>Muhyiddin said complaints about the strict new ruling were not only received by the PH but also the other candidates.</p>
      <p>“I have been been thrugh elections many times and there have never been such strict conditions imposed. As soon as the EC announced the start of the campaigning period, all parties involved did their part to attract the support of voters,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Muhyiddin, who is also Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president, said the remaining two days of campaigning period before polling day on Saturday (Nov 16) is critical for the PH machinery to win votes including that of the nearly 12 percent of voters who are fence-sitters.</p>
      <p>“I can say that there have been encouraging signs and the positive effects from the campaigning activities that we (PH) carried out, and response from the voters — the Malays, Chinese and Indians — has improved,” he said.</p>
      <p>Although it was an exciting development, he said PH could not be complacent and needs to intensify its campaigning efforts.</p>
      <p>On voters residing outside the constituency, Muhyiddin said between 7,000 and 8,000 people had been contacted to ensure that they would return to Tanjung Piai to vote.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Muhyiddin was also optimistic that the percentage of voters turning up to cast their votes would be high based on the response of voters during the campaigns.</p>
      <p>“Usually in a by-election, we are aware that the turnout will be not as high as in the general election. I can see that the majority of the people in the Tanjung Piai constituency are likely to go out and cast their votes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the video in which DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng was allegedly criticising civil servants during an election campaign, Muhyiddin admitted that he had yet to watch the video, but he believed that Lim, who is also the Finance Minister, did not mean (to criticise).</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he (Lim) was criticising the civil servants, as we are aware that to continue implementing PH policies, the most important thing is the cooperation of civil servants, both at the Federal and State levels as well as the local authorities. Perhaps, because we (the PH government) are new, they (civil servants) may not be able to adopt our policies yet,” he said.</p>
