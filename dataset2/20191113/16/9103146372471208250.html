      <p><b>Tonight, they will face off against the KIU Rangers, in a match that should quench the thirst after a long spell without NBL action.<br/></b> <br/><i>NBL semi-final League Playoffs<br/></i> <br/><i>Lugogo Arena<br/></i> <br/><b><i>Today <br/></i></b><i>Fixtures<br/></i> <br/><i>Women<br/></i><i>JKL Lady Dolphins v KIU Rangers 6:30 pm<br/></i> <br/><i>Men<br/></i><i>UCU Canons v Betway Power 8:30 pm<br/></i> <br/><b>Coming off a successful FIBA Africa Zone V Women championship in Tanzania, the JKL Lady Dolphins are favourites to win game one of the National Basketball League (NBL) women’s semifinal playoffs at the Lugogo arena.<br/></b> <br/>Tonight, they will face off against the KIU Rangers, in a match that should quench the thirst after a long spell without NBL action.<br/> <br/>They boast of a dream team in terms of a roaster and against the KIU Rangers, they are expected to rise to the occasion, Captained by veteran and Zone five MVP Flavia Oketcho the expectations are quite high.<br/> <br/>JKL have a scintillating record in the regular season as they lost only two matches, couple that with a 10 match winning streak they can be irresistible.<br/> <br/>In the second match of the evening, the UCU Canons will face the highly experienced Betway Power in one of the most anticipated matches of the postseason.  <br/> <br/>Regular season table-toppers UCU will face Power who struggled during the postseason to finish fifth. Their only saving grace in this one is the regular playoff experience in the squad from players like Joseph Ikong, Cyrus Kiviri, and Paul Odong.<br/> <br/>The Canons that have a largely young side will look to Isaiah Mabeng’s three-point prowess and his contribution to their attack. Based purely on paper the canons have a minuscule edge overpower while JKL are overwhelming favourites for the women. That said game one will set the tone for the five-game series of the playoffs.</p>
