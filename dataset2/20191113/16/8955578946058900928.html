      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 13 – RIA Tomsk. </b>The aero probe technology, created by biologists of <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU), was examined for the creation of a startup in the European Union (EU); in early 2020, it is planned to create an enterprise on the territory of the EU, which will promote this technology, it is reported on Wednesday on the website of TSU.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was reported that in 2016 scientists of the Biological Institute (BI) of TSU patented an aero probe - a device that allows to clean the bottom of water-contaminated reservoirs. The principle of its operation is to supply air under pressure to the bottom of the water basin, after which the bottom oil "sticks" to the air bubbles and rises to the surface.</p>
      <blockquote>"Aero probe technology, developed by scientists of the BI TSU for purification of bottom deposits of reservoirs from oil, will become the basis of a startup working on the market of the European Union. In early 2020, it is planned to create an enterprise on the territory of the EU, which will promote the technology of the Tomsk State University", – the message says.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the press service of the university with reference to the Director of the BI TSU Daniil Vorobiev, in 2019 the institute began to work with the reactor of commercialization – a platform that is engaged in the creation of new technological start-ups in the EU. During the Ignition Event in Riga BI TSU successfully presented its development.</p>

      <p>"At the stage of selection projects are considered by a large number of experts. We have successfully passed the selection and have already met entrepreneurs who will be engaged in promotion of environmental technologies of TSU", – the press service quotes Vorobiev. The companies that will implement the project in Europe are not named.</p>
      <p>The advantage of the aero probe is the environmental friendliness of the technology. Reservoirs are cleaned without the use of drugs and soil extraction, which is the basis of most existing methods. In particular, the aero probe allows to clean the bottom of large ports from petroleum products, where hydrocarbon residues have accumulated for decades, the report marks.</p>
      <p>Along with the European market, the Americas are of great interest, where oil production is active and soil and water pollution with hydrocarbons is quite high. It has been previously reported that Singapore-based Golden Anchor International Trading PTY Ltd will promote Tomsk aero probe in South-East Asia (ASEAN countries) and India.</p>
