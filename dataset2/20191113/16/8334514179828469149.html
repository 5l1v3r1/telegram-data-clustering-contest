      <p>(Reuters) - New York’s insurance regulator has formally notified a group of opioid manufacturers and distributors that it will launch a civil enforcement action against them for contributing towards a rise in health insurance premiums in the state, said two sources familiar with the matter.</p>

      <p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has sent letters to around 23 opioid manufacturers and distributors, notifying them that the regulator would begin the process to hold a hearing on the issue in an administrative proceeding, the sources said.</p>
      <p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in September the state would launch a legal action against drug companies and distributors that sell opioids in order to recoup about $2 billion in insurance rate increases that were passed on to New York consumers because of opioids.</p>
      <p>Premiums surged because insurers had to cover prescription costs and opioid-related issues such as emergency room visits and addiction treatments, Cuomo had said.</p>
      <p>Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths in the country <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/index.html">here</a> between 1999 and 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
      <p>Opioid litigati<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-opioids-litigation-overview-factb/factbox-billion-dollar-lawsuits-accuse-drugmakers-distributors-of-fuelling-u-s-opioid-crisis-idUKKBN1X016I">here</a> is playing out across the United States, including some 2,600 lawsuits brought by states, towns, cities, counties and tribal governments over the opioid epidemic.</p>
      <p>The two sources familiar with the NYDFS action declined to name the companies to which the letters were sent.</p>
      <p>Cuomo, on Sept. 10, published a list of entities the regulator had subpoenaed <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-action-against-opioid-industry-recover-2-billion-overcharges-defrauded,">here</a> including Purdue Pharma Inc, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc, McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp and Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p>
      <p>“Janssen acted as a responsible manufacturer and seller of its opioid pain medications, which play in an important role in the lives of patients with severe pain,” the company said.</p>
      <p>Other companies mentioned above could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>A letter of intent to bring an enforcement action follows a determination by the regulator that there is sufficient evidence to bring the case, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The entities will first have an opportunity to try to convince the regulator not to start the proceeding. The case would be heard by a hearing officer within the agency.</p>
      <p>Funds that New York would collect from the suits would be returned to consumers, possibly in the form of rebates of lower insurance premiums, NYDFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell has said.</p>
