      <h1>Google Maps update makes it easier to travel in cities where you don't speak the language</h1>
      <h2>Google has combined Google Maps and Google Translate in its new feature, which allows your phone to speak out a place's name in the local language</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>While exploring a new city can be an exciting experience, it can be a bit tricky if you don’t speak the local language.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> has your back, thanks to a new translation feature within its Google Maps app.</p>
      <p>Google explained: “When you're in a foreign country where you don't speak or read the language, getting around can still be difficult - especially when you need to speak with someone.</p>
      <p>“Think about that anxiety-inducing time you tried to talk to a taxi driver, or that moment you tried to casually ask a passerby for directions.”</p>
      <p>The feature combines Google Maps with Google Translate, and allows your phone to speak out a place’s name and address in the local language.</p>

      <p>To access it, simply tap the new speaker button next to the place name or address and Google Maps will say it out loud.</p>
      <p>Google added: “This text-to-speech technology automatically detects what language your phone is using to determine which places you might need help translating.</p>
      <p>“For instance, if your phone is set to English and you’re looking at a place of interest in Tokyo, you’ll see the new speaker icon next to the place's name and address so you can get a real-time translation.”</p>
      <p>The new feature is rolling out this month on Android and iOS with support for 50 languages.</p>
