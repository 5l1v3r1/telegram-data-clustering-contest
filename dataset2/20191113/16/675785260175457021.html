      <h1>General Election: Labour's four day week 'to be introduced within a decade'</h1>
      <h2>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the changed working conditions will apply to everyone, and 95% of people would not pay additional tax</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:31:11+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">George Ryan</a></address>
      <p>Labour's shadow chancellor says all employees will work a 32 hour week in just a decade.</p>
      <p>John McDonnell outlined plans to slash the working week to four days in central London today.</p>
      <p>And he said 95% of taxpayers would pay no additional tax under the proposal.</p>
      <p>The move would not lead to loss of earnings, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> says.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell rubbished fears it would damage the economy and lead to job losses, saying the change would be "planned and negotiated".</p>
      <p>He stated: "It's a 32-hour working week, implemented over a 10-year period. It will apply to everybody."</p>
      <p>And he continued: "The Tories have given this impression that we get elected on December 12... that on December 13 suddenly everybody is on a four-day week.</p>
      <p>"No, that's not what we said."</p>

      <p>He compared the move to the introduction of the minimum wage under the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> government, which was opposed by the Tories at the time.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said: "It's a bit like the implementation of the minimum wage, which was opposed then - if you remember - saying it will cost thousands of jobs and the economy would collapse etc.</p>
      <p>"What we've said, just like every other reduction in the working week, it is planned and negotiated between employers and trade unions over time.</p>
      <p>"We've said, realistically, as we put this investment into our economy, we will become more productive, there will higher wages, because of the higher skills that we're producing, and over time as the economy grows we want - as that wealth is created - a proportion of that wealth should be shared more fairly with the workforce.</p>

      <p>"And we can share it in two ways. Higher wages, of course, but also traditionally what the trade unions in this country have negotiated to do is a shorter working week."</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell also outlined Labour's tax proposals which will be set out further when its manifesto is published.</p>
      <p>Echoing its 2017 manifesto, Mr McDonnell said 95% of taxpayers would pay no additional tax.</p>
      <p>He said: "The day-to-day funding increase will be funded by taxing, yes, the top 5% a higher rate of income tax.</p>
      <p>"Let me just make this clear, and cut through the lies and the fake news from the Tories over last couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>"As I've said before, income tax rates, national insurance and VAT will not increase for 95% of earners. It's only the top 5% we will ask to pay a little bit more."</p>
