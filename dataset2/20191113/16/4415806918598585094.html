      <h1>Munster add academy out-half to Champions Cup squad to ease injury problems</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:52:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/simon-lewis/" target="_blank">By Simon Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Munster have moved to ease their fly-half problems by adding academy number 10 Ben Healy to their Heineken Champions Cup squad.</p>
      <p>Johann van Graan faces the prospect of kicking off this season’s European campaign this Saturday at Ospreys without first-choice Joey Carbery and possibly JJ Hanrahan, leaving Tyler Bleyendaal as the only fit out-half in the province’s 41-man squad for the competition.</p>
      <p>Neither Carbery (ankle) nor Hanrahan (hamstring) has been deselected from that nominated panel, however.</p>
      <p>Instead, Ireland Under-20 star Healy has been promoted at the expense of wing Alex Wootton and is now in line for a European debut in Swansea this weekend as back-up to Bleyendaal, should Hanrahan not pass fit.</p>
      <p>Champions Cup organisers EPCR today released a list of the tournament’s squad changes with 10 players involved in the recent World Cup prominent among the 35 players swapped out by their clubs.</p>
      <p>They include World Cup final man of the match Handré Pollard and France captain Guilhem Guirado, both removed by Montpellier, and Leinster’s No.8 Jack Conan, who along with long-term injury victim and fellow back-rower Dan Leavy was replaced by Ireland U20 forwards Ryan Baird and Scott Penny.</p>
      <p>Leo Cullen has made three further changes to his squad, with Cian Kelleher and Ciaran Frawley replacing backs Fergus McFadeen and Barry Daly while Bryan Byrne is a front-row replacement for Vakh Abdaladze.</p>
      <p>Connacht have altered their front-row options with Peter McCabe in for Paddy McAllister and back-row Sean O’Brien has been replaced by Niall Murray, while Ulster’s squad remains unaltered.</p>
