      <h1>WATCH: 'The wall collapsed. She was trapped' - heartbreak as KZN tornado claims lives, destroy homes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:19:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:19</time> by <a rel="author">Kaveel Singh</a></address>
      <p>While a rand value estimation of damages is yet to be determined following a KwaZulu-Natal tornado, the loss of life has left the eMpolweni community in New Hanover outside of Pietermaritzburg heartbroken and devastated.</p>
      <p>Thuleyliwe Ndlovu, a mother of three, lost her 40-year-old daughter Sphe Ndlovu. She was distraught on Wednesday as rescue teams and officials arrived in the ravaged community.</p>
      <p>She said there had been heavy winds and rain which led them to take shelter.</p>
      <p>"We ran into the house and closed the door. After we closed the door, I went to the bedroom to look for a jersey. While I was looking for the jersey, I heard the roof tiles making a huge noise. When I looked up, there were no tiles on the roof."</p>
      <p>Ndlovu then heard "loud screaming".</p>
      <p>"It seems the wall had also collapsed. It means when the tiles were taken off the roof, the wall also collapsed on [Sphe]. She was trapped under the rubble and one of the sofas."</p>
      <p>She said a concrete block was also on top of her daughter.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't move the blocks because they are heavy. I tried and tried until the neighbours came to help me."</p>

      <p>On the other side of the settlement, the family of Nonhlanhla Buthelezi, 45, were in deep mourning. A tree fell onto her home, instantly killing her.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, her friend Kho Ndlovu said Buthelezi was beside herself.</p>
      <p>"She worked for me as a helper, but more than that, she was part of my family. She was coming to work when this happened. She saw the bad weather and went to put pots [down] for leaks from rain, and the tree fell on her."</p>
      <p>She said Buthelezi was a "wonderful person".</p>
      <p>"She was a good decent person. I cannot believe this."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rescue teams and officials</b>
      </p>
      <p>When entering eMpolweni, officials and rescue teams were met with scenes of disaster. Countless roofs had been blown away, houses reduced to rubble and infrastructure, including electricity poles, knocked down.</p>
      <p>The region's sub-station that the tornado went through was not severely damaged, with one Eskom official saying most of the facilities were still in good working condition.</p>

      <p>In a statement on Wednesday,<a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/kzn-tornado-eskom-fixing-network-after-fatal-storm-leaves-15-000-without-power-20191113"> Eskom said</a> it was working to restore the power to around 5 000 customers.</p>
      <p>NGOs such as Gift of the Givers and the Department of Social Development were on the scene to assist those affected.</p>
      <p>Further poor weather conditions were expected on Wednesday evening, heading into Thursday, for KwaZulu-Natal where a total of five people have been killed since Monday due to storms.</p>
      <p>The tornado left many on social media shocked and even doubting the authenticity of the video.</p>
      <p>Disaster management teams have been put on standby once again.</p>
