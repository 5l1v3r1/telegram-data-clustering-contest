      <p>DessertCrazy claims to be Philadelphia's first keto, low carb, gluten-free bakery. <br/><br/>Owner Candace Conway, a scientist with a sweet tooth, is the creative mind behind this array of delectable sweet treats. Conway, who was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, couldn't imagine a life without sugar.<br/><br/>So she put her chemistry background to work, developing delicious desserts that wouldn't cause her sugar to spike. <br/><br/>The result? A shop full of keto sweets from cookies, cupcakes, brownies, lemon bars and cheesecake that she says are life-changing for people who can't or won't eat sugar. The keto coffee is a big hit, too.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://dessertcrazy.com/">DessertCrazy</a>|<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dessertcrazylowcarb">Facebook</a></b><br/><br/>1925 Fairmount Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19130<br/>267) 764-1411</p>
