      <p>The government has allowed migrants to change address on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>by giving self declaration, a move aimed at helping them open bank account and promote financial inclusion. The changes were made by amending the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules, according to a gazette notification issued on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It allows a person with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>number for identification wants to provide address different from what is available in the Central Identities Data Repository, he may give a self-declaration to that effect to the reporting entity, it said. There was long standing demand to ease address change rule.</p>
      <p>The decision will help migrant workers who have address of their native place in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/aadhaar">Aadhaar </a>but wants a bank account with their current address where they are living for work. People may have residential address in their Aadhaar and give work address as current address.</p>
      <p>There are many cases where people may have their address in Aadhaar and want to give a more functional address for know your customer (KYC).</p>
