      <p>Chiefs at two of Dumbarton’s oldest football clubs hope that a new partnership can be beneficial to both.</p>
      <p>On Saturday Dumbarton FC and Dumbarton United officially revealed a new agreement that will see United’s youngsters handed the chance to start on a pathway to senior football with West Dunbartonshire’s only SPFL side.</p>
      <p>The move came about via local business C&amp;G Systems, who are major sponsors of both clubs.</p>
      <p>And Sons chairman John Steele was quick to pay tribute to the company for putting the foundations for the partnership in place.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “When C&amp;G came in as stadium sponsors, they were keen that the Dumbarton community became more involved with us.</p>

      <p>“They’ve organised the whole relationship and I’m delighted that it’s happening.</p>
      <p>“Without being immodest, when I started being involved there was an us and them situation between the board and our supporters, and the same situation existed between the club and the community.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been keen to change that dynamic and we’re taking small steps now in achieving that.”</p>
      <p>United chairman Gerry Docherty echoed Steele’s thoughts and highlighted the benefits that the new agreement has for both sides.</p>
      <p>He told the Lennox: “We’ve been working in the local community for 61 years and we’d been in touch with Dumbarton FC over that time.</p>
      <p>“Over the period we’ve tried to do this a number of times but there’s never been anybody to link the clubs together.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s just the right timing to link the clubs. Everything has a timing and I think just now is just the perfect timing for everybody.</p>

      <p>“It’s a massive opportunity for us to interphase with the club and it’s also a good opportunity for the senior club to interphase with the local community.</p>
      <p>“But it’s a partnership. It’s not a one-way street, there will be lots of benefits for our players looking to progress into senior football.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>C&amp;G Systems’ commercial director, Andy Gordon, expanded on the positives for Dumbarton United.</p>
      <p>He said: “Dumbarton United’s oldest age group at the moment is under-16, but adopting a player pathway they’ll be able to have an under-19s again because it’s very difficult to retain players when they will just go to other clubs who do.</p>
      <p>“It’s a hugely positive step for both clubs.</p>
      <p>“When we started sponsoring Dumbarton FC, David Lavery from Dumbarton United Blacks 2005s got in touch and asked if we’d like to sponsor them, and a big thing for my brother, Dave Gordon MD at C&amp;G, was to get involved in grassroots sport in Dumbarton and a be a bit more front facing in the community.</p>
      <p>“This partnership is very, very positive for Dumbarton to have an outward facing link to the community and for Dumbarton United.”</p>

      <p>Sons’ chairman Steele concluded: “We have to engage with young <br/>people because if we don’t engage with them then the future for clubs like us is not good.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The elderly supporters that are our lifeblood just now will not be there and ultimately the club will not be there.</p>
      <p>“So it’s essential that we work with the community and get them involved with us.”</p>
