        <b>Law Minister Anisul Huq has said the government will take measures to fast-track the Abrar Fahad murder trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The minister made the remarks at a media briefing at the Secretariat on Wednesday after police pressed charges against 25 suspects over the murder of the BUET student.</p>
      <p>Abrar, a second-year student of electrical and electronic engineering, was bludgeoned to death by leaders and activists of BCL in his dormitory on Oct 6 after he criticised the government over a water-sharing deal with India on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The call for a speedy trial was one of several demands placed by angry students during the heated protests on the BUET after the incident.</p>

      <p>The Speedy Trial Tribunal Act requires the trial procedure in a case to be completed in 90 days, with a provision for an additional 45 days.</p>
      <p>The Detective Branch of Police filed charges against 25 suspects in the case within five weeks of the incident on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The home ministry has to apply for a speedy trial. Once that is done, the legal process to hold the hearing at a speedy trial tribunal will be initiated and the trial proceedings will be completed swiftly," said Anisul.</p>
      <p>According to the minister, the case will be disposed of in 135 days at most if it is tried by the speedy trial tribunal.</p>
