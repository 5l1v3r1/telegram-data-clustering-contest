      <h1>SoftBank's Z Holdings and Line eyeing merger: sources</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:03:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Noriyuki Hirata, Sam Nussey</a></address>
      <p>Tokyo (Reuters) - SoftBank’s Z Holdings Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/4689.T">4689.T</a>) is in talks to merge with messaging app operator Line Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/3938.T">3938.T</a>), two sources said on Wednesday, the investment company’s latest bet on a struggling tech firm.</p>
      <p>A deal could see SoftBank Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9434.T">9434.T</a>), which controls internet firm Z Holdings, and Line’s parent Naver Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/035420.KS">035420.KS</a>) form a 50:50 venture that would control Z Holdings, which would in turn operate Line and Yahoo, the sources said.</p>
      <p>The two parties were likely to reach a basic agreement by the end of the month, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Naver was not immediately available for comment outside of business hours. SoftBank said nothing had been decided.</p>
      <p>The talks were first reported by Kyodo news agency.</p>
      <p>Line, which last year sold a majority stake in its mobile unit to SoftBank, has reported three consecutive quarters of operating losses as the company tries to jump start growth.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings, formerly known as Yahoo Japan, made a move in September to take control of fashion e-tailer Zozo Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/3092.T">3092.T</a>) in a $3.7 billion deal, as it bulks up against rivals like Amazon.com (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMZN.O">AMZN.O</a>).</p>
      <p>Dealmaking by SoftBank Corp, controlled by tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9984.T">9984.T</a>), comes despite weak performance of its technology bets of its parent, which recorded an $8.9 billion operating loss in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>The group’s first quarterly loss in 14 years followed a collapse in the value of its investment in office-sharing firm WeWork as investors have turned skeptical about the path to profitability at cash burning startups.</p>
