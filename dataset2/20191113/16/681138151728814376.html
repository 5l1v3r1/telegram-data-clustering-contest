      <p>Jesse Gatehouse, 30, of Defoe Crescent, Colchester, appeared before magistrates in Ipswich yesterday via video link and pleaded guilty to burglary of the Debenham Co-op.</p>
      <p>Police were called around 3.30am on Tuesday following reports that a stolen JCB Teleporter had been used to smash the front of the village store in Chancery Lane.</p>
      <p>Two more stolen vehicles - a white Ford Transit van, which had its roof cut off, and a red Audi S4 - were also used in the raid, with the ATM placed in the Transit van after it had been dragged from the store.</p>
      <p>The whole incident was captured on CCTV, the court heard.</p>

      <p>The Audi fled the scene but the ATM had a tracker fitted and was traced to a disused barn in Syleham, around 13 miles away, where the door had been forced.</p>

      <p>Magistrates heard that as the car tried to avoid police by performing a u-turn in the narrow road, it ended up half in a ditch.</p>
      <p>Two men got out of the Audi and despite a large-scale search, involving the police dog unit, they currently remain at large.</p>
      <p>Gatehouse was sat in the back of the Audi and was arrested by police at the scene.</p>
      <p>He offered no comment in police interview.</p>
      <p>The ATM and its contents were recovered still inside the van at the barn, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Gatehouse was committed to Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing at a date to be fixed.</p>
      <p>No bail application was made and he was remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>The JCB was discovered to have been stolen from a farm in Debenham and the Ford Transit was stolen from an address in Bures St Mary.</p>
      <p>The red Audi had been reported as stolen from an address in Danbury near Chelmsford, between October 29 and October 30.</p>
      <p>Detectives said yesterday they are exploring whether the Debenham incident is linked to a similar ram raid on the Spar store in Glemsford on November 4.</p>
      <p>In that incident, a Land Rover Defender was reversed into the store, causing extensive damage although nothing was stolen.</p>
