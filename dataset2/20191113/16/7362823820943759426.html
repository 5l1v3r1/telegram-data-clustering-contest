      <p>An extremely rare half-dollar coin from 1838, now valued at as much as $500,000, is set for auction this week.</p>
      <p>The 1838-O Capped Bust half dollar is one of only nine that are known to exist, according to auction house Stack’s Bowers Galleries. No more than 20 coins were made of the first issue of half dollars from the then newly-opened New Orleans Mint, it said, in a statement emailed to Fox News.</p>

      <p>“This particular mint was established to produce coins of several different denominations at the time but its main focus was the 50-cent piece, which was needed to convert the flow of uneven quality Latin American silver coins into a sufficient quantity of new United States coins fit for banking and commerce,” explained Stack’s Bowers Galleries.</p>
      <p>The gallery continued: “However, technical issues and the spread of yellow fever in the area limited production of the coin for that year and very few were struck as a result. Now, the 1838-O half dollar is one of the most sought-after coins by collectors and enthusiasts alike due to its rarity and this particular specimen is one of the finest examples available.”</p>
      <p>The rare half dollar has been off the market since the 1980s. It will be auctioned at the Whitman Baltimore Winter Expo at the Baltimore Convention Center on Nov. 15.</p>

      <p>“This is one of those coins that every serious collector dreams about acquiring,” said Brian Kendrella, president of Stack’s Bowers Galleries, in the statement. “It almost seems that it was fated to become a collector’s item from the day it was struck.”</p>
