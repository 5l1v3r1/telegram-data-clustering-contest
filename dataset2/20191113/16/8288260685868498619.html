      <p>Rangers fans have had their say on sporting director Ross Wilson's comments addressing Alfredo Morelos and his future at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Morelos has been heavily linked with a move to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>, while Premier League rivals Leicester City have also been touted as a destination for the Colombian international.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been in fine form for Steven Gerrard's side this season, scoring 22 goals in 26 games including an impressive nine in 12 Scottish Premiership matches for the title challengers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> has courted the interest of English top flight sides, with Gerrard regularly batting away questions about the latest speculation in his star striker.</p>

      <p>But Wilson, who joined the club from Southampton last month, was adamant that his new side would not be forced into selling the former HJK Helsinki man.</p>
      <p>Asked <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-rangers-transfer-news-17251523">if he could state that the club did not have to cash in on its biggest assets</a> , Wilson replied: "Categorically.</p>
      <p>"We want our best players to stay here as long as they possibly can.</p>
      <p>"We understand that like every other club in world football that there comes a point when players have to move on to something else for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We'll be no different to that but it's certainly not on the horizon in January.</p>
      <p>"I was speaking to Steven about (Morelos) at the weekend. He's been well quoted on this already.</p>
      <p>"The first-team has a number of players who could be really interesting for a number of clubs because the club is in a significantly better position than it was before and a lot of that is down to the recruitment and the work Steven and the coaching staff have done with the players.</p>
      <p>"And keeping our best players here for as long as possible is important."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Rangers fans loved Wilson's comments and took to social media to offer their thoughts.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction...</i>

      <p>@ <b>CraigYB1989</b> : So another words he'll be sold at the right price</p>
      <p>@ <b>dballantyne86</b> : Ross Wilson knows how to get a good price for a player he sold a Southampton reserve player for £75 million.</p>
      <p>@ <b>weeshug72</b> : "do not have to" isn't necessarily the same as "won't".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>@ <b>rfc_adam_</b> : What a guy</p>
      <p>@ <b>RangersBanter17</b> : Good to see we have somebody who will come out and say we dont want to sell our top players.</p>
