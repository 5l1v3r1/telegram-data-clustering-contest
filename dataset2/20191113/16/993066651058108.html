      <p>THE first day of strike action by nurses will be held on December 18.</p>
      <p>The unprecedented action by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had been proposed for the first week in January.</p>
      <p>Phased industrial action, short of strike, will be held on December 3, 10 and 11. The RCN said it will include declining to do any task that is not patient-specific, such as working unpaid hours.</p>
      <p>Director of the RCN in Northern Ireland Pat Cullen confirmed its UK Council had "approved schedule of industrial action and strike action". She said that "regrettably this will begin before the Christmas period".</p>
      <p>It was confirmed last week that 92% of RCN members balloted had voted to strike for the first time in the union's 103-year history. The dispute centres on unsafe staffing and pay.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Unison, which is the biggest union in Northern Ireland's health and social services system, also voted to strike after members were balloted over pay and staffing levels.</p>
      <p>RCN chief Pat Cullen said "no nurse" wanted to take the action but "unfortunately we have been left with no choice".</p>
      <p>"Nurses are very disappointed that there has been no further meaningful engagement with the Department of Health regarding the safe staffing and pay crisis that we are facing in Northern Ireland," she said.</p>
      <p>"RCN Council has now approved a schedule of industrial action and strike action. Regrettably this will begin before the Christmas period. The first two weeks of action will be industrial action followed by our first day of strike on 18 December. We are now putting plans in place to determine how this will be managed and delivered.</p>
      <p>"While no nurse wants to take this action, unfortunately we have been left with no choice and we are now carrying out the instructions that our members have clearly voted for. We will have further details on the impact this will have upon services closer to the time."</p>
      <h3>Date of action                               Action planned</h3>
