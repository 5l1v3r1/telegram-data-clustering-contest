      <h1>First Hour Fail: Democrats' 'Blockbuster' Opening Hour Fizzles</h1>
      <h2>Democrats opened public impeachment hearings on Wednesday promising to dramatically detail the case for the president’s impeachment, but there was little excitement in the first 93 minutes.</h2>

      <p>House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff began the proceedings with a solemn statement recounting the events that sparked the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Bill Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, the two bureaucrats selected by Schiff to kick off the public impeachment hearings also failed to deliver much drama.</p>
      <p>Taylor and Kent began their statements recounting the history of diplomacy in the United States as well as the history of Ukraine and their lengthy careers of public service.</p>
      <p>Both bureaucrats expressed their concerns about the president’s actions in Ukraine but proved that they were frequently alarmed and concerned but mostly did not have knowledge of the president’s motives.</p>
      <p>Taylor read his 20-page opening statement, even admitting that although it was lengthy, he hoped Americans would recognize the importance of Ukraine in future diplomatic efforts.</p>
      <p>Taylor said one of his staff claimed to overhear European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland discussing “the investigations” in a phone call with the president.</p>
      <p>No members of Congress were allowed to interrupt the opening of the hearing with questions as the two diplomats droned on recounting their previously released public testimonies about the case.</p>
      <p>Through a parliamentary inquiry, House Republicans successfully tripped up Rep. Adam Schiff to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/adam-schiff-i-do-not-know-the-identity-of-the-whistleblower/">claim</a> that he did not know the identity of the so-called “whistleblower,” despite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/adam-schiff-whistleblower.html">reports </a>that his committee had met with him prior to his claim.</p>
      <p>President Trump shared a White House video on Twitter labeling the entire process as a “swamp” derived hoax.</p>
