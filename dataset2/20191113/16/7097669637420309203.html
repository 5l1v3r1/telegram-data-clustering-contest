      <h1>A Chinese Navy with 10 Aircraft Carriers? It Could Happen.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Richard D. Fisher Jr.</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Point:</b> Limiting China now may prevent this.</p>
      <p>In his reaction to the December 6 Chinese Global Times <a href="http://english.chinamil.com.cn/view/2018-12/06/content_9369401.htm">article</a> quoting experts saying China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) may require five or six aircraft carriers, David Axe wrote an article <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-naval-future-6-aircraft-carriers-38087">asking</a>, “Could Beijing really pull it off?” The short answer is that Beijing is just getting started.</p>
      <p>For the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) one of the most important missions for state media like the Global Times is to ensure that the Chinese people never doubt the increasing power of CCP’s dictatorship and that all others come to accept the inevitability of China’s “benevolent” global leadership. The Global Times and many other outlets daily promote scores of articles touting elements of Chinese power ranging from specific new weapons to China’s grand strategies. From now on, a major goal of China’s state media and its strategic information operations will be acclimating the world to a globally-projected People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</p>
      <p>One key characteristic of such articles is that they usually do not convey new information, but can track with what is already reported or mentioned in publicly available information. For example, on December 31, 2008, Kenji Minemura of the Asahi Shimbun, reporting from Beijing and citing “military and shipbuilding sources,” wrote that China would build two “domestically produced” aircraft carriers in addition to the Varyag/Liaoning, purchased from Ukraine. Then on February 13, 2009, he reported China would build two nuclear-powered carriers “in 2020 or later.” So a decade ago Chinese “military and shipbuilding sources” mooted the goal of five carriers, but why should this be viewed as China’s final goal?</p>
