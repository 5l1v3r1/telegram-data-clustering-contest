      <p>A pile-up near the Tyne Bridge caused late night traffic chaos on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Four cars were involved in the collision on the junction of Askew Road and High Street at around 10pm.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> confirmed that a Nissan, BMW, Volvo and Vauxhall were all involved in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead</a> accident which left wreckage strewn across the road.</p>
      <p>Video footage captured around an hour after it happened shows two badly damaged cars.</p>
      <p>At least two traffic lights were wiped out in the collision, with one car seeming to have crossed over on to the other side of the road and knocking down the signal.</p>
      <p>The late night crash caused heavy traffic for over an hour after the crash.</p>
      <p>Traffic was left almost stationary on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-bridge">Tyne Bridge</a> with cars taking more than half an hour to cross.</p>
      <p>Askew Road was also temporarily closed entirely but reopened a couple of hours later.</p>
      <p>Despite the visible damage to the vehicles involved, no injuries were reported from the crash.</p>
