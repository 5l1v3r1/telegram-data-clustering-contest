      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/disaster-response">firefighter</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/australia">Australia</a> has defended her decision to keep fighting the ongoing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/fires">wildfires</a> even though she is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health/pregnancy">pregnant</a>, saying she "won't just stay behind" as her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters">country burns</a>.</p>
      <p>The most intense fires on Wednesday were concentrated in northeastern New South Wales and Queensland, where hundreds have been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/disasters/warnings">forced to evacuate</a> their homes.</p>
      <p>New South Wales has lost more than 200 homes since Friday, while 14 homes have been destroyed in southeast Queensland. Tony Wellington, mayor of the Queensland town of Noosa North Shore, said Wednesday that residents there were being evacuated for the second time in a week.</p>

      <p>"It's bad enough being evacuated once, let alone multiple times," Wellington told Australian Broadcasting Corp. "It's terribly distressing, always, to be evacuated."</p>

      <p>As nearly 70 wildfires continue to burn across New South Wales, <a href="https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1194570853452853248">fire officials said</a> that about 1,000 firefighters remain on the ground. One of those firefighters is 23-year-old Kat Robinson-Williams, who posted several images of herself and colleagues on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/instagram">Instagram</a> as they battled the flames.</p>
      <p>"For all the females on the ground in NSW right now," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4q70DzhzE2/">she wrote</a>. "We stand together we stand proud !!"</p>
      <p>Robinson-Williams, who is 13 weeks pregnant, defended being out fighting the fires, saying she "won't just stay behind" and that she doesn't care if people "don't like it."</p>

      <p>"I love my country I love my mates and if that means I’m needed on the ground, then I’ll always make the way," she wrote. "As long as I am physically able to help, I’ll always work my best...As I’m a firefighter, Just like all the rest!!"</p>
      <p>Robinson-Williams <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50400238">told the BBC</a> she has been a volunteer with the NSW Rural Fire Service for 11 years and is the third generation in a family of firefighters.</p>
      <p>"I'm not the first pregnant firefighter and I'm not going to be the last one," she told the BBC. "I'm still in a position where I'm able to help so I will."</p>
