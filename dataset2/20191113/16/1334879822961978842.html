      <h1>6 Best Goal Setting Journals to Help You Stay on Track</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:00:49+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Undre Griggs</a></address>
      <p>The challenge most people face when attempting to change their life is feeling everything needs to happen immediately. You are tired of not eating healthy, ready to start that new career, and determined to live your dream life. This tends to lead to a feeling of frustration as most transformations take time. A great tool to help you stay on track and motivated is a goal journal.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/851916/goal-journal#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
      <h3>Goal Journals Give You Perspective</h3>
      <p>How do goal journals help you stay on track you ask? Well, when you are tracking your progress, it helps you to stay motivated because you can see the results. What often happens is you are too close to the issue to notice the changes that have already occurred. So when you are frustrated and feel like quitting, you can simply look in your journal and recall your successes.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/851916/goal-journal#footnote_plugin_tooltip_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
      <p>Think of it like when you were a kid and you would visit your grandparents every so often. Your grandparents could not stop talking about how much you have grown since the last time they saw you. You are sitting there thinking, ‘I may have grown a couple inches.’ The difference is you see yourself every day, so you do not notice the gradual changes.</p>
      <p>When you are transforming your life, the gradual changes can frustrate you because you are not where you want to be. In other words, you are only comparing where you are today to the end goal. By documenting your progress in your goal journal, you allow yourself the ability to compare where you were to where you are.</p>
      <h3>Progress Is the Key Motivator for Everyone</h3>
      <p>When you feel like you are making progress, you are encouraged to continue. That is <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/840380/beliefs-about-success-holding-you-back">why so many people quit</a> their goals each year. They do not feel they are making any progress. This could be the result of them not setting reasonable goals, but it could also be the result of them not realizing all the progress they have made.</p>
      <p>When determining which goal journal is best for you, there are several things to consider:</p>
      <p>When looking at the basics, you want the ability to write your goals in your journal. These goals should be broken down into <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/762937/how-to-set-short-term-goals">short term</a> or <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/788859/long-term-goals">long term goals</a>.</p>
      <p>Categorizing your goals is also a great idea. You can categorize them as to whether they relate to your health, relationships, professional development, and personal development.</p>
      <p>Now these are not the only categorizes you can use, but they are a good starting place. Categories are good because they ensure you are focusing on all aspects of your life. Each of us seek balance when it comes to how we feel about our life. The goals you are making for yourself today are based on perceived aspects of your life where you feel you are lacking. However, if you only focus on the problems of today, you run the risk of creating other problems in the future.</p>
      <h3>One Step Forward, One Step Back</h3>
      <p>For instance, if you feel your career is stagnant and want to focus on professional development, you may set a goal to read five books on leadership or to attend a conference. What you may notice over time is your professional development improves, but your health has declined. As your professional life flourished, you felt you did not have the time to work out or eat healthy anymore. By writing a balanced set of goals, you enable yourself to create a blueprint to your dream life <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/851916/goal-journal#footnote_plugin_tooltip_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to writing your goals, you can use your goal journal to help you focus on being more grateful, productive, or patient with your loved ones.</p>
      <p>There are so many aspects of your life you can focus on with your goal journal, so it is important for you to be clear about your objective.</p>
      <p>Now that you have a good idea about what you are doing with your goal journal, you only need to know which one to buy:</p>
