      <p>The Roborock S5 is one of the best, if not the best, robot vacuums around right now. It does a great job at cleaning up and navigating around your home. Making it perfect for most people. And at this price, it's hard not to pick one up.</p>
      <p>This robot vacuum uses lasers to navigate around your home, so you can let it clean without worrying about it missing any spots. It will map out your home, so you can tell it to clean the kitchen only, or clean everywhere but the bathroom and so forth. Making it very convenient for spot cleaning.</p>
      <p>It also has some really good suction, at over 2000Pa, which is going to get up all of the dirt in your home, without needing to get out the old vacuum to finish. It's really good with pet hair too, thanks to that suction. So if you have pets, this is the robot vacuum to get.</p>
