      <h1>Disney + pulls controversial Michael Jackson episode of The Simpsons from its library</h1>
      <h2>Disney+ has released in the US and includes past seasons of The Simpsons but without the episode starring controversial music icon Michael Jackson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T16:51:35+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>A controversial episode of The Simpsons is not available on Disney+ in the US.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/disney">Disney</a> streaming service launched in the US yesterday (November 12) but according to <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/12/disney-plus-the-simpsons-episodes-michael-jackson-stark-raving-dad-controversy/">comicbook.com</a> one episode is missing from the collection of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-simpsons">The Simpsons</a> episodes on the streaming site.</p>
      <p>The third season premiere episode, entitled Stark Raving Dad, features Homer being institutionalised and meeting a fellow patient named Leon who believes he is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-jackson">Michael Jackson.</a></p>
      <p>An uncredited Jackson himself voiced the character in the episode and sings to a saddened Lisa Simpson in the episode, despite the vocals not being provided by Jackson and instead by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kipp-lennon">Kipp Lennon.</a></p>
      <p>The episode is not available on Disney+ with the following episode being shown as the first of the third season on the service's interface.</p>
      <p>Since the release of documentary series Leaving Neverland earlier this year, which chronicles the child sex abuse allegations against Jackson, the episode was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/simpsons-showrunner-fears-michael-jackson-14132889">pulled from syndication</a> as well as the series' previous home of the FX app in the US.</p>

      <p>"Yes. It wasn't something that makes me happy. It’s something I agree with completely," executive producer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/al-jean">Al Jean</a> told <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-simpsons-boss-al-jean-michael-jackson-used-the-show-to-groom-boys">The Daily Beast</a> earlier this year. "What saddens me is, if you watch that documentary — which I did, and several of us here did — and you watch that episode, honestly, it looks like the episode was used by Michael Jackson for something other than what we’d intended it. It wasn't just a comedy to him, it was something that was used as a tool. And I strongly believe that. That, to me, is my belief, and it’s why I think removing it is appropriate."</p>
      <p>He adds: "I lose a little bit of money financially, it’s not something that’s great personally to lose one of the most successful things I ever did, but I totally think it’s the right move. I don’t believe in going through and making judgments on every guest star and saying “this one was bad, that one was bad,” but the episode itself has a false purpose, and that’s what I object to about it now."</p>
      <p>"I think it was part of what he used to groom boys. I really don’t know, and I should be very careful because this is not something I know personally, but as far as what I think, that’s what I think. And that makes me very, very sad."</p>
      <p>Michael Jackson's family denies all allegations of sexual abuse against him.</p>
