      <p>The Bolivian senator Jeanine Añez declared herself the country’s interim president on Tuesday, swearing in to loud cheers and applause after the resignation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/evo-morales">Evo Morales</a>, who flew to Mexico under pressure from police and the army.</p>
      <p>The move is expected to pave the way for fresh elections after a fiercely disputed election which the Organization of American States found was rigged in Morales's favour.</p>
