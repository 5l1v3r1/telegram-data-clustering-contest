      <p>Scarlett Johansson believes she was “hyper-sexualised” while still a teenager.</p>
      <p>The actress said her image was created by “a bunch of dudes” working in the film industry.</p>
      <p>Johansson, 34, add she was frustrated with roles which limited her to seductive women and plagued her in her late teens and early 20s.</p>

      <p>The actress said her sexualisation by those in the industry seemed “OK to everyone”, and it took time to break out of the limitations of being typecast.</p>
      <p>She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about her experiences as a female star in the film industry.</p>
      <p>Johansson said: “When I was working in my early 20s, and even my late teens, I felt that I got somehow typecast as hyper-sexualised, which I guess at the time seemed OK to everyone.</p>
      <p>“It was another time — even though it wasn’t part of my own narrative, it was kind of crafted for me by probably a bunch of dudes in the industry.”</p>
      <p>Johansson recalls feeling limited by the image she was given, and feared there was little longevity in playing the “other woman” or the ingenue.</p>
      <p>She said she needed something more fulfilling that the roles she was being offered.</p>
      <p>Johansson believes culture has shifted, and women are no longer as limited in the movie industry as they once were.</p>
      <p>She said: “The climate is so different now, there’s so many wonderful opportunities for women of every age to play all different types of people.”</p>
      <p>The full interview with Johansson can be read in The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
