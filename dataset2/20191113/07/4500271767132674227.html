      <p>KARACHI: The police on Tuesday booked two staff members of a private school in Gulshan-i-Maymar for sexually assaulting a four-year-old boy, officials said.</p>
      <p>They said the grandfather of the child contacted the police on Monday evening with a complaint that his grandson was subjected to sexual assault by the two non-teaching staffers of the private school where he was enrolled as a student of nursery class.</p>
      <p>“He said that after the school timing both suspects took the boy into their room, sexually assaulted him and threatened him to keep his mouth shut,” said an official at the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station. “After recording his complaint, we contacted the school management and took the boy for medico-legal formalities. The school management was in shock and its suspicions against the two staff members [were] also strengthened as they had disappeared after knowing about the police involvement in the case.”</p>
      <p>The initial medical examination of the boy, he said, suggested signs of sexual assault which convinced the police to register a case against both the suspects, he said and added that efforts were on to arrest both the suspects.</p>
