      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> was the Indian captain when Bangladesh played their maiden Test match, so it is only fitting that Ganguly is the BCCI president as the two teams get ready to play their first Day/Night Test match - in Kolkata from November 22.</p>
      <p>Ever since that first Test (2000), Bangladesh have not been able to register a victory against India and have managed to draw a Test only twice. Out of the nine Tests played so far, India have emerged victorious 7 times.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Overall Test Head to Head:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Played: </b>9</p>
      <p><b>Won by India: </b>7</p>
      <p><b>Draws: </b>2</p>
      <p><b>Won by Bangladesh: </b>0</p>
      <p>Here, we look at some of the memorable encounters between the two cricketing nations:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dhaka, 2000, Only Test: India won by 9 wickets</b>

      <p>Bangladesh's maiden Test was also Sourav Ganguly's first Test as Indian captain and at 28 years, 125 days, the left-hander became the eighth youngest Indian captain in November 2000. Opener Shiv Sunder Das, wicket-keeper Saba Karim and left-arm seamer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Zaheer Khan</a> were also making their Test debuts for India in that match. Bangladesh gave a good account of themselves in their maiden Test match, at least in the first innings. Aminul Islam became the country's first Test centurion to help the hosts pile up 400, despite a five-wicket haul by Sunil Joshi. The Indian fightback was led by captain Ganguly who struck 84, but it was Sunil Joshi who top scored for the visitors with a 92-run knock. Naimur Rahman took six wickets as India responded with 429. But Bangladesh were skittled out for 91 runs in their second innings to leave India with a victory target of 63, which the visitors achieved with 9 wickets in hand.</p>

      <p>The first Test of the two-match series in 2004 saw Anil Kumble breaking <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kapil-Dev">Kapil Dev</a>'s record of 434 wickets to become India's leading Test wicket-taker and the rise of Irfan Pathan who registered his first ten-wicket haul in Tests on the third day at the Bangabandhu Stadium in Dhaka in December 2004. Pathan's five-wicket haul in the first innings saw Bangladesh being bundled out for 184. From then on, it was the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sachin-Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> show all the way. Sachin completed his 34th Test century to equal <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sunil-Gavaskar">Sunil Gavaskar</a>'s record of Test centuries and also went on to notch up his career-best Test score (248*). Tendulkar, who was dropped when he was on 28 and 47, struck 35 boundaries in his knock and added 164 runs with Ganguly (71) for the fourth wicket and put up a 133-run stand with Zaheer (75) for the last wicket as India amassed 526 runs. Pathan then wrapped up the match early on Day 4 taking 6/51 in the Bangladesh second innings.</p>

      <p>In the second Test of the series in 2004, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Rahul Dravid</a> hit his 18th Test hundred, to become the first batsman to score Test centuries in all ten Test-playing nations. Indian opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> struck his first Test ton. The 259-run stand between Dravid (160) and Gambhir (139) was India's highest second-wicket partnership abroad. Gambhir brought up his 50 off 60 balls, and scored his next 50 off 71 deliveries. His quick innings allowed Dravid the time to bat himself in. Ganguly too contributed with 88 as India piled up 540 runs. Mohammad Ashraful hit a superb, unbeaten 158, but could not save his team either from a follow-on or from an innings defeat. Pathan registered his third five-wicket haul of the series in the Bangladesh second innings, wrapping up the match and the series on Day 4 of the Test.</p>

      <p>After a dull draw in the first Test, Indian openers Dinesh Karthik (129) and Wasim Jaffer (retired ill for 138), captain Rahul Dravid (129) and Sachin Tendulkar (122*) notched up centuries and an unbeaten 50-ball 51 from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahendra-Singh-Dhoni">Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> powered India to 610/3d in the second Test in Dhaka in May 2007. Bangladesh bowlers Mashrafe Mortaza, Syed Rasel, Mohammad Sharif and Mohammad Rafique conceded more than 100 runs in their spells as the hosts were sent on a leather hunt by the Indian batsmen. Zaheer Khan's 5/31 and Anil Kumble's 3/32 ensured Bangladesh were bundled out for 118 and were made to follow-on. Mohammad Ashraful's 26-ball half-century in the second innings delighted the crowd but wasn't enough to prevent India from registering their biggest Test victory (innings and 239 runs) at that time.</p>

      <p>Bangladesh played their first Test on Indian soil in February 2017 and were, almost immediately, hit by the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> storm. Virat notched up his fourth successive double century in four consecutive series, going past Don Bradman and Rahul Dravid who had done it in three successive series. Kohli's 204, coupled with opener Murali Vijay's 108, Ajinkya Rahane's 82 and Wriddhiman Saha's unbeaten 106 enabled India to declare their first innings at 687/6. Taskin Ahmed, Kamrul Islam Rabbi, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam all conceded more than 100 runs in their toiling spells. On Day 4, Ravichandran Ashwin completed 250 Test wickets, becoming the quickest to the landmark. Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim hit 127 to take Bangladesh to 388, but captain Kohli chose not to enforce the follow-on. India declared their second innings at 159/4 to give Bangladesh an improbable 459-run target. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja took four wickets each to dismiss Bangladesh for 250, as India registered their sixth successive series win in their 19th consecutive Test without a defeat.</p>
