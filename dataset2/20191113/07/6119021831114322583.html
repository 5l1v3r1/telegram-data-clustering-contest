      <p>A video of a girl venting out on the school education system and ranting about her daily struggles to wake up and rush to school has been making the rounds on social media.</p>
      <p>A video posted by a police officer named Atul Bothra on Twitter shows the girl demanding a relief (chutkara) from the education system and rants about her struggles to study an array of subjects in school, apart from waking up at 6am, drinking water, brushing teeth, drinking milk and rushing to school everyday.</p>
      <p>When asked about what will she do went she meets the person responsible for setting up the education system, her response was priceless. She said, “Main usse dhoke na, pura paani daal ke na, istri kar daloongi puri! (I will wash the person, pour lots of water on him/her and iron him/her!)</p>
