      <h1>Braun Audio LE speakers revive a classic Dieter Rams design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:00:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/alyn-griffiths/" target="_blank">Alyn Griffiths</a></address>
      <p>The LE speaker range designed by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/dieter-rams/">Dieter Rams</a> for Braun in 1959 has been updated and relaunched as a series of smart <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/speakers/">speakers</a> that retain Rams' minimalist style.</p>
      <p>The collection of three premium hi-fi speakers replicates the pared-back aesthetic of Rams' designs, but updates them with subtle visual tweaks and new technologies.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.braun-audio.com/">Braun Audio</a>, the speakers "celebrate the timeless, essentialist design ethos of their origins" through their pared-back aesthetic and material palette.</p>

      <p>Rams created the original LE speaker range for German electronics brand Braun, where he served as head of design from 1961 to 1995. During that period, he launched a range of iconic products that included audio equipment, calculators and watches.</p>
      <p>The German firm was responsible for the development of some of the 20th century's most influential audio equipment, including the SK 4 turntable and the TP 1 portable record player and radio.</p>
      <p>The company stopped making audio products in 1991, and the Braun name was purchased by Proctor &amp; Gamble in 2005. The current LE speakers are produced by UK firm <a href="https://www.pure.com/uk">Pure Audio</a>, which licensed the rights to develop and manufacture Braun Audio products.</p>

      <p>Key differences between the new speakers and their predecessors include rounded corners that replace the sharp angles of the original design, and scaled-down proportions that are intended to make the speakers fit more comfortably in contemporary living spaces.</p>
      <p>The family of three speakers ranges in size from the large LE 01 to the small, boxy LE 03. The products feature a machined aluminium body and can be accompanied by accessories including floor stands with integrated cable management.</p>

      <p>The LE 01 and LE 02 models can be used as individual stereo speakers in landscape mode, or paired to provide single-channel audio when oriented in portrait mode.</p>
      <p>The speakers also feature the latest wireless technology to enable multi-room functionality, stereo pairing and wireless streaming. Users can tailor equalisation levels and other settings using a dedicated app.</p>

      <p>Privacy issues related to the integrated voice-recognition capacity can be addressed by pressing a button on the top of the speaker that enables users to disconnect the hands-free Google Assistant microphones.</p>

      <p>London studio <a href="https://www.precipice-design.com/">Precipice Design</a> worked on all the consumer and trade touchpoints for Braun's relaunch into the audio sector, including packaging, photography, iconography and digital assets.</p>
      <p>The strategy focused on preserving a link to Braun's heritage as an audio pioneer, while demonstrating how the new products align with the contemporary lifestyles of their target audience.</p>

      <p>In addition to his designs for electronic products, Dieter Rams has a long-standing relationship with furniture brand <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/vitsoe/">Vits≈ì</a>, which manufactures products such as his <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2013/05/10/dieter-rams-620-chair-programme-relaunched-by-vitsoe/">620 chair</a> and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2014/03/13/vitsoe-relaunches-621-side-table-by-dieter-rams/">621 side table</a>.</p>
      <p>The designer was recently the subject of a documentary by filmmaker Gary Hustwit, who <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/03/05/dieter-rams-documentary-gary-hustwit-interview/">told Dezeen that Rams regrets the role he's played in perpetuating a culture of overconsumption</a>.</p>

      <p>Rams himself <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/02/24/dieter-rams-designer-interview-simplicity-key-excellence/">spoke to Dezeen in 2017</a>, explaining how constant design innovation is less important than focusing on the development of simple products that are made to last.</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design">Ten Principles for Good Design</a>, first published in the 1970s, Rams argued that an object's long-term usefulness is intrinsically linked to how it looks. His theories are seen by many as the biggest influence on the approach adopted by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a> for its hardware designs.</p>
