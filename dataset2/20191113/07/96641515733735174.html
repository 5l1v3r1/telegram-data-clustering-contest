      <h1>The Morning After: More 16-inch MacBook Pro rumors</h1>
      <h2>And a 'maclunkey' Disney+ first day.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:15:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>We're bracing for a big update from Apple and digging into a '<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/star-wars-disney-plus-greedo-edit/">maclunkey</a>' first day for Disney+ streaming. <i>Minecraft Earth </i>is available for you to play, and Goldman Sachs is looking into how credit scores are being interpreted for Apple Card offers.</p>

        <b>It is inevitable.</b>
      </p>

        <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-imminent/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">Apple may reveal its 16-inch MacBook Pro today</a>

      <p>Keep an eye peeled for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/macbook%20pro">news out of Apple today</a>. According to <i>Bloomberg's</i> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints">sources</a>, media previews are occurring for a new MacBook Pro that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-imminent/">squeezes a 16-inch screen into the laptop's 15-inch frame</a> and features a new keyboard design to replace the current model's notoriously unreliable butterfly switches. They're also expecting a release date in December for the Mac Pro, which is important news if you're <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-10-calvin-harris-mac-pro.html">not Calvin Harris</a>.</p>

      <p>It took ages, but <i>Minecraft Earth</i> is finally available on Microsoft's home soil. The early access version of the augmented reality game has launched in the US for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftearth">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/minecraft-earth/id1467316099">iOS</a>. While it's still not the full-fledged version Microsoft and Mojang have been hyping for months, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/minecraft-earth-early-access-us/">it will let you create dioramas, collaborate with friends on projects and tackle mobs in adventures</a>.</p>

      <p>First, the good: If you need one reason to sign up for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-vs-the-competition/">yet another streaming service</a>, Devindra Hardawar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus/">thinks <i>The Mandalorian</i> could be it</a>. If that's not enough, there's also the 4K remasters of older Star Wars movies, even if <i>A New Hope</i> has arrived with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/star-wars-disney-plus-greedo-edit/">never-before-seen 'maclunkey' edit tagged on to the Han vs. Greedo scene</a>.</p>
      <p>Other issues included many viewers on their snow day who were unable to connect as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error/">Disney+ servers struggled to serve everyone at once</a>. While we expect that situation to improve, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-widescreen-simpsons-problems/">a trickier issue involves <i>The Simpsons</i></a>, where a decision to post all of the episodes zoomed and cropped for widescreen is cutting out some visual gags that were in earlier episodes formatted for 4x3.</p>

      <p>The Spectacles 3 is a major improvement on Snap's previous video-recording glasses. They're more stylish, a fit better and a new second camera enables the device to capture depth information in your pictures and videos. However, the price is also getting a bump -- these will cost wearers $380.</p>
