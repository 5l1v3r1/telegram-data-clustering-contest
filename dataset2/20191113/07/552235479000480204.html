      <h1>Arsenal 'need Steven Gerrard' as club legend wants Rangers boss to replace under-fire Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Emery has been publicly backed by the Arsenal board but they are eight points adrift of a top-four finish and winless in their last four league matches.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:38:40+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal hero Emmanuel Petit insists the time is now for Arsenal to move on from beleaguered boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a>.</p>
      <p>And the Frenchman reckons <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> would be a perfect candidate to take the reins at the Emirates with the Spaniard feeling the heat.</p>
      <p>Emery has been publicly backed by the Arsenal board but they are eight points adrift of a top-four finish and winless in their last four league matches.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> manager, who has made no secret of his desire to bring trophies to Ibrox, was named by Jurgen Klopp as his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> heir apparent in September.</p>

      <p>But Petit insists the Gunners should also be keen on the 39-year-old who has turned heads with the job he is doing north of the border.</p>
      <p>Gerrard has Rangers competing on four fronts as they look to seal a place in the last 32 of the Europa League. They will also face title rivals Celtic in the Final of the Betfred Cup next month.</p>
      <p>And the French World Cup winner is convinced the Anfield icon is just the man to reignite the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> dressing room after a wretched start to the season.</p>
      <p>Petit told <a href="https://news.paddypower.com/author/emmanuel-petit/">Paddy Power</a>: “Arsenal needs a great leader now,”</p>
      <p>“Someone who can bring back the passion, someone respected by the players, someone who can fill the team with energy and the winning mentality.</p>

      <p>“Steven Gerrard, for example, is like this.</p>
      <p>“I want to see passion, emotion. Someone who, when he takes your hand, you can feel the electricity.</p>
      <p>“I want someone who can bring that to the Arsenal dressing room, because they need to wake up.</p>
      <p>"My opinion is that most of the players have given up on Emery, so it's time for him to go."</p>
