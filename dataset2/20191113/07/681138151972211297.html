      <p>Melissa Knights, 40, of Swallows Close, Hollesley, appeared before magistrates in Ipswich on Tuesday charged with three counts of fraud by false representation and one offence of theft.</p>

      <p>Knights denied stealing a total of £2,709 between October 2017 and June 2018 and pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
      <p>Magistrates declined jurisdiction and the case was sent to crown court.</p>
