      <p><b>TAIPEI – </b>Trading house Sumitomo Corp. will spend some ¥500 million ($4.5 million) by February 2020 to acquire a 6.7 percent stake in Taiwan’s top electric bus-maker, RAC Electric Vehicles Inc.</p>
      <p>The two will seek to capitalize on the Taiwan government’s plan to replace 15,000 conventional buses with electric vehicles by 2030 with a budget of 30 billion New Taiwan dollars (¥107.2 billion), the Tokyo-based company said.</p>
      <p>RAC is the only firm to have a government license for electric buses. The deal came after cooperation with the Taiwanese firm on batteries for electric vehicles, a Sumitomo spokesman said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sumitomo is also involved in the electric motorcycle business in Taiwan but it is comparatively easier to enter the electric bus business, he said.</p>
      <p>“While electric motorcycles require a wide network of charging stations, electric buses only require charging facilities at terminal stations to be operational,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that in the future they plan to sell electric buses outside Taiwan as well, without disclosing further details.</p>
      <p>RAC’s buses have the advantage of efficiency, hill-climbing ability and accuracy when it comes to remote monitoring of battery levels, according to Sumitomo. They have a maximum speed of 100 kilometers per hour, compared to other electric buses, which usually have a top speed of 60 to 70 kph, the company said.</p>
