      <h1>Parts of country could see snow tonight; Rain warning issued for seven counties</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:34:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Snow is being forecast to fall over parts of Munster and Leinster today as the country sees colder than normal temperatures.</p>
      <p>Met Ã‰ireann says rain will turn to sleet and snow over the two provinces later on.</p>
      <p>"Maximum temperatures over the next few days wouldn't be out of place in January or February with colder than normal temperatures expected to persist through the rest of this week and into the weekend," said Meterologist Liz Walsh</p>
      <p>"It is cold enough today, in fact, to see some wintery falls later on and we could see some sleet and snow around, mainly in parts of Munster and parts of south Leinster."</p>
      <p>A status yellow warning for rainfall has been issued for counties Carlow, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Wicklow, Offaly and Tipperary.</p>
      <p>A spell of heavy rain is likely to lead to some spot flooding and will turn to sleet and snow in places later today.</p>
      <p>The warning is in place from 2pm today until 2am tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Dublin's cold weather initiative to house the city's homeless has kicked in for the winter.</p>
      <p>186 permanent and 20 temporary beds are currently in place.</p>
      <p>An extra 156 are to be added to the system by the end of December.</p>
      <p>Forecasters expect the sleet and hill snow to gradually clear southwards tonight, though rain will linger near the east coast.</p>
      <p>The day is expected to be cold, with top temperatures of four to eight degrees nationwide.</p>
      <p>There will be lows of zero to two degrees overnight with some frost and icy patches developing by dawn.</p>
