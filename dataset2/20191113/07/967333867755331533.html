        <b>The unrest was stirred up last month by a public transport peak-time fare hike that caused students to start jumping turnstiles in protest while demanding improvements in education and health care, with the turmoil gradually escalating and spreading nationwide.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Violent clashes broke out between demonstrators calling for President Sebastian Pinera's resignation and security forces near the presidential palace in the city of Santiago on Tuesday, as the country's currency dropped to a historic low after weeks of mass street protests.</p>

      <p>Some 80,000 people took to the streets of Santiago and 100 organisations called for a general strike.</p>
      <p>The protesters are urging the president, who has declared several measures in an effort to meet their demands, including a pledge to change the Constitution, to carry out greater social reform.</p>
      <blockquote>"The discontent is over many things", one of the demonstrators, Karen Delgado, said. "Everything the president has offered is insufficient. It's a joke", he added. "We're asking the president to listen and to stop delaying with these half-baked measures. He's not listening to the people".</blockquote>
      <p>Several shops were looted in the coastal town of Vina del Mar and in the central city of Valparaiso.</p>
