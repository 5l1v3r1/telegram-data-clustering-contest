      <p>WASHINGTON: A Chinese scientist pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Nov 12) to stealing next-generation battery technology from the American petroleum company where he worked, the Department of Justice said.</p>
      <p>Tan Hongjin, 35, a Chinese national who was a permanent legal resident of the United States, was arrested in December 2018 and charged with stealing trade secrets.</p>

      <p>The Justice Department said Tan pleaded guilty in US District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma to theft of a trade secret, unauthorised transmission of a trade secret, and unauthorised possession of a trade secret.</p>
      <p>The market value of the next-generation battery technology Tan was accused of stealing was more than US$1 billion, it said.</p>
      <p>"Tan's guilty plea continues to fill in the picture of China's theft of American intellectual property," assistant attorney general for national security John Demers said in a statement.</p>
      <p>US Attorney Trent Shores said "industrial spies like Hongjin Tan engage in espionage to steal American trade secrets and intellectual property.</p>
      <p>"China's economic aggression poses a threat to America's emerging high-technology industries," Shores said.</p>
      <p>Tan worked as an associate scientist for the US petroleum company from June 2017 until his arrest, the Justice Department said.</p>
      <p>The department did not name the company but a LinkedIn page for Tan Hongjin identifies him as a staff scientist with the disruptive technologies team at Phillips 66.</p>
      <p>He previously worked as a research assistant and visiting scientist at the California Institute of Technology, where he earned his doctorate.</p>
      <p>The Justice Department said sentencing was set for Feb 12, 2020 but did not say what sentence Tan was likely to receive.</p>
