      <h1>Delhi Air Quality In 'Emergency' Category AGAIN; Modi Govt Looks For Solutions In Japan</h1>
      <h2>The Supreme Court asked the Centre to submit a report on the technology it was exploring by December 3. Meanwhile, Delhi chokes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:59:28+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:59</time> by <a rel="author">Rohini Chatterji</a></address>
      <p>After the Diwali weekend,<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/delhi/"> Delhi’s</a> air quality is again headed for the “emergency” category on Wednesday morning as a thick blanket of smoke covered the city. </p>
      <p>According to<i> PTI</i>, at 11.30 am, Delhi’s overall <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/air-quality-index/">air quality index</a>, according to CPCB, read 454. Jahangirpuri and Rohini were the most-polluted areas, the report said, with an AQI of 483, followed by Mundka (479) and Bawana (479).</p>
      <p>Faridabad (436), Ghaziabad (468), Greater Noida (459), Gurgaon (450) and Noida (469) also had terrible air quality on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered ‘poor’, 301-400 ‘very poor’ and 401-500 ‘severe’. An AQI above 500 falls in the ‘severe plus’ category.</p>

      <p>For the second time in a fortnight, the<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/supreme-court/"> Supreme Court </a>has criticised the government over poor air quality that is putting citizens across northern parts of India under risk.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/live/channel/ndtv24x7?pfrom=home-mainnavgation"><i>NDTV</i> tickers </a>quoted the Supreme Court as saying, “The whole of north India is suffering, and little was being done as a solution.”</p>
      <p>The apex court took suo motu cognizance of the situation and sent a notice to the Centre. </p>

      <p>The Centre meanwhile told the court that it was “exploring technology” from Japan as a solution to the air pollution emergency in India. The court asked the Centre to explore this technology and submit a report by 3 December.  </p>

      <p>Delhi Chief Minister <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/">Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday</a> that odd-even scheme may be extended if needed given the pollution in the national capital. </p>
      <p><i>PTI</i> reported weather experts as saying that a drop in temperature and low wind speed has led to this weeks’ poor air quality. The report said that the situation was worsened by clouds that block out the sun. </p>
      <p>While stubble burning season in Haryana and Punjab worsens air pollution in Delhi, the <i>PTI</i> report said SAFAR has predicted the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution to be 22% on Wednesday, it was 25% on Saturday. </p>
      <p>Stubble burning has continued in the two neighbouring states because of lack of financial incentives to farmers. </p>
      <p>On 4 November,<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/delhi-air-pollution-supreme-court_in_5dbffa21e4b0615b8a95b976?utm_hp_ref=in-air-pollution"> the Supreme Court had pulled up the Centre </a>and state governments and authorities saying, “Can we survive in this atmosphere? This is not the way we can survive. No one is safe even inside homes; it is atrocious.”  </p>
      <p>The court had said, “Delhi is choking every year and we are not able to do anything. Question is that every year this is happening. It cannot be done in a civilised country”.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court noted that every year the governments cried hoarse about crop burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh but did nothing about it.</p>
      <p>“Why is there unabated crop burning every year? Every year there is hue and cry. States know this but still they are not tackling this issue,” the court asked.</p>
      <p>The court also criticised the state governments saying they were only interested in politics.</p>
      <p>“They are only interested in electioneering. They have no responsibility towards their own people… Everybody is interested in gimmicks and elections,” the Supreme Court had said. </p>
