      <p>LONDON: Dominic Thiem produced a scintillating display of attacking tennis to beat Novak Djokovic and qualify for the last four at the ATP Finals on Tuesday (Nov 12), leaving the Serbian facing a shootout against Roger Federer.</p>
      <p>In the standout match so far at London's O2 Arena, the Austrian fifth seed took the fight to the world number two, recovering from losing the first set to triumph 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 7-6 (7/5)</p>

      <p>Earlier, Federer put himself back into the mix at the end-of-season event with a 7-6 (7/2), 6-3 win against Italian debutant Matteo Berrettini in their round-robin clash.</p>
      <p>Federer and Djokovic will face off on Thursday in a repeat of the Wimbledon final to determine who else will progress from Group Bjorn Borg.</p>
      <p>Thiem was forced to play high-stakes tennis against the 16-time Grand Slam winner, taking the breath away with some of his inside-out forehands and single-handed backhands</p>
      <p>Forced to play on the limit, he hit 50 winners compared to Djokovic's tally of 27 but also racked up 44 unforced errors.</p>
      <p>In a captivating first set lasting more than an hour, Djokovic, last year's beaten finalist, drew first blood, breaking in the fourth game, but Thiem responded immediately, breaking back with a rasping backhand down the line.</p>
      <p>Neither player managed to force another break and the set went to a tie-break, which Djokovic, a five-time ATP Finals champion, edged 7-5.</p>
      <p>Undaunted, Thiem broke his opponent at the first opportunity in the second set and, with Djokovic's error count climbing, went on to level the match.</p>
      <p>Thiem then broke in the first game of the deciding set and stayed strong to hold under severe pressure.</p>
      <p>The Austrian was again under pressure on his own serve in the sixth game and Djokovic broke back when Thiem went long with a backhand.</p>
      <p>Thiem successfully challenged at 30-30 in the 10th game after his forehand was ruled out, preventing a match point for Djokovic and he toughed it out to level at 5-5.</p>
      <p>He then broke Djokovic to love to earn a chance to serve for the match but stumbled and the decider went to a tie-break.</p>
      <p>Thiem slipped to 4-1 down but recovered to win it on his second match point when Djokovic dumped a forehand into the net.</p>
      <p>"I practised all my life, all my childhood for this," said Thiem. "It was incredible."</p>
      <p>"Novak was in great shape and I had to do something special," he added.</p>
      <p>"I stayed in the match the whole time, came from a set down, I remained offensive, stuck to my game and I'm in the semi-final."</p>
      <p>
        <b>FEDERER STAYS ALIVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Third seed Federer had put himself under the cosh by losing his opening round-robin match to Thiem.</p>
      <p>The six-time champion was not at his fluent best on Tuesday but ultimately had too much for his Italian opponent.</p>
      <p>The Swiss upped his game to take the first set tie-break comfortably and broke immediately at the start of the second set to leave the big-serving Italian with too much to do.</p>
      <p>Federer, 38, will face Djokovic on Thursday in a repeat of July's marathon Wimbledon final, during which he squandered two championship points on his own serve.</p>
      <p>The Swiss was asked after his win against Berrettini whether that defeat had left emotional or mental scars.</p>
      <p>"We'll find out, but I think it's all flushed away from my side," said Federer, who added that it had taken him two weeks at most to get over the loss.</p>
      <p>"A lot of water has gone under the bridge since then.</p>
      <p>"We have played a lot of matches since, and I think we both look back at a great match. I think we both can take away some confidence from the match."</p>
      <p>Djokovic is hunting a sixth ATP Finals title to pull level with Federer's record and is also seeking to pip Rafael Nadal to the year-end number one ranking.</p>
      <p>On Monday, top seed Nadal lost his opener in Group Andre Agassi to defending champion Alexander Zverev while Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Daniil Medvedev.</p>
