      <h1>SC asks govt to explore feasibility of Japanese tech to fight air pollution</h1>
      <h2>The development comes as Delhi's air quality neared the "emergency" zone for the second time in a fortnight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:55:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>on Wednesday directed the Centre to explore the feasibility of a hydrogen-based Japanese technology as a permanent solution to the air pollution in the NCR region and other parts of north India.</p>
      <p>The court directed the Centre to expedite the deliberations on the issue and come before the court with its findings on December 3.</p>
      <p>The development comes as Delhi's air quality neared the "emergency" zone for the second time in a fortnight on Wednesday due to raging farm fires in neighbouring states and unfavourable weather conditions.</p>
      <p>A bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi and CJI designate S A Bobde said since Solicitor General Tushar Mehta has himself brought to the court's notice a technology which is the outcome of a research by a university in Japan, the Centre will explore the feasibility of using it in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Capital Region (NCR) and other parts of north India.</p>
      <p>At the outset, the bench said there is a need for a permanent solution to the air pollution which has been affecting the people in the NCR region and remaining northern India.</p>
      <p>Mehta told the bench that a university in Japan conducted a research keeping in view the air pollution in the NCR region and northern India.</p>
      <p>He said the research is quite innovative and the government thinks it can use the technology to combat the prevailing pollution levels in the region.</p>
      <p>The solicitor general introduced to the bench a researcher from a university in Japan, Vishwanath Joshi, who apprised it about the hydrogen-based technology that has the potential to eradicate air pollution.</p>
      <p>The court also said there are similar matters pending before other benches and they can be amalgamated for the hearing.<br/>Â </p>
