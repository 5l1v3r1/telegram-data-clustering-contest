        <b>Despite Tottenham keen on a move for Memphis Depay, Olympique Lyon Director of Football Juninho has admitted that Manchester United have the first option on the forward. The 25-year-old has impressed since his move from United and has already netted seven goals in 10 league appearances this season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once considered to be one of the brightest prospects in Dutch football, Memphis Depay’s career took him to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> in a now-infamous spell. The 25-year-old struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford and finished his time at the club with just seven goals in 53 appearances for the club. That saw him shipped out to France and Olympique Lyon where the Dutch forward has re-ignited his career.</p>
      <p>This season alone Depay has 11 goals in just 14 appearances in all competitions, a tally that includes four goals in four Champions League games, and is the club’s top scorer. That has seen him heavily linked with a move away with Tottenham considering a £50 million move for the forward. But, Lyon Director of Football Juninho has revealed that Manchester United have top priority when it comes to a move for Depay.</p>
      <p>“Manchester United has the priority if several clubs line up to buy him. But we have not received any offers so far. He is really happy right now in Lyon. Rudi (Garcia) will soon make his decision. He is a technical leader. We will discuss an extension of the contract by the end of the year,” said Juninho reports the Mirror.</p>
      <p>Reports have indicated that while Juninho has admitted that Depay is happy at Lyon, the Dutchman is not and is considering a move away from the club after their recent struggles. While the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/ligue_1">Ligue 1</a> giants do sit second in their Champions League group their performances in the French domestic league has a few players concerned with Depay leading the charge. That combined with the fact that he has just 18 months left on his current deal has seen Lyon consider a move.</p>
