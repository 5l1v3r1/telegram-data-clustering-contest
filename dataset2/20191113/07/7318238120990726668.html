      <h1>Bolivian Senator Jeanine Áñez declares herself interim president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:07:22+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:07</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>Bolivia's opposition leader declared herself the country's interim president on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Senator Jeanine Áñez was sworn into the post as the South American country scrambles to restore order after weeks of protests.</p>
      <p>Former president Evo Morales resigned after the military asked him to step down. He has said he was forced out in a coup d'état.</p>
      <p>Morales has since arrived in Mexico where he was granted political asylum.</p>
      <p>Protests broke out in Bolivia after a disputed October 20 election in which Morales, who had been in power for almost 14 years, was reelected.</p>
      <p>The Organisation of American States (OAS) said it found "clear manipulations" of the voting system calling into question Morales' slim victory over centrist rival Carlos Mesa.</p>
      <p>Áñez said she would "return democracy to the country".</p>
      <p>"I will work in this short time because Bolivians deserve to live in freedom, they deserve to live in democracy. Never again will the vote be robbed," the senator said.</p>
