      <h1>Russell Crowe's property torched by raging Australian bushfires</h1>
      <h2>Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe could only watch on as bushfires destroy buildings at his rural property in Eastern Australia as help try to douse flames</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:05:58+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:05</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Russell Crowe's sprawling mansion in New South Wales has been hit by the raging bushfires that are spreading across eastern Australia.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winning actor revealed on social media that his rural property had seen two buildings destroyed by the fires.</p>
      <p>The Gladiator star tweeted that while he was out of the country, his 400-hectare property near Coffs Harbour was hit by the "catastrophic" bushfires.</p>
      <p>After confirming that his family and friends were safe, the 55-year-old posted a video and pictures on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> feed of a helicopter water-bombing smoke-filled trees near a fence and driveway, commenting "Top shot son!"</p>

      <p>He added three pictures of the grounds around his home on fire, showing firefighters containing the blaze.</p>
      <p>Crowe did not specify how badly his property was affected but no photos showed the house on fire. He did not say who took the photos.</p>
      <p>Bushfires are a common and deadly threat in Australia's hot summers, but the blazes have arrived earlier this year, spurred by dry conditions after three years of drought, and have already claimed three lives.</p>
      <p>In a post showing burned ground and charred objects at his his property in northeast New South Wales state, Crowe said: "lost a couple of buildings, but overall very lucky so far. Chapel roof scorched."</p>
      <p>He thanked those on the ground and said no livestock or horses had died.</p>

      <p>"Let the chickens out and they are back, warm worms for breakfast!", the actor tweeted.</p>
      <p>There were a few non-plussed residents in Nana Glen though, as they claimed firefighters prioritised Crowe's property, which had led to some of their homes getting damaged.</p>
      <p>One resident, Debbie Waldon, was emotional as she tearfully told Seven News that she thought there was an unfair biased being shown towards Crowe's residence.</p>

      <p>She bemoaned: "I'm angry because our friends' house is there burning and all the trucks go to Russell Crowe's.</p>
      <p>"What about normal, everyday people?"</p>
      <p>This claim has been refuted by the NSW Rural Fire Service who said that Ms Waldon's claims were nonsense.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson said: "Firefighters are not aware of whose homes they are being sent to â€“ aerial crews wouldn't be aware of whose property they are going to either.</p>
      <p>"Crews are dispatched on priority of jobs and the properties that need it the most, we are not aware of who owns the properties."</p>
