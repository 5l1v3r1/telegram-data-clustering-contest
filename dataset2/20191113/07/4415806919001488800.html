      <h1>New advocacy service to provide support for concerned patients</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:14:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A new way for patients to raise complaints about the Irish health system is being launched today.</p>
      <p>The advocacy service will be government-funded but will operate independently and give patients the opportunity to voice any concerns they have in a confidential manner.</p>
      <p>The new service offers a confidential helpline with experienced advocates on-hand to provide information and support to patients who want to make a formal complaint to the HSE about the care they experienced in a public hospital.</p>
      <p>Health Minister Simon Harris, who is launching the service, says it is the first of its kind in the country.</p>
      <p>"There is a confidential helpline and a website, <a href="https://www.patientadvocacyservice.ie/">PatientAdvocacyService.ie</a>, and it is an opportunity to talk to someone independent of the health service," he said.</p>
      <p>"You can be provided with information on how to make a complaint and indeed provided with supports that you might need through the complaints process.</p>
      <p>"I hope this is an easier way for somebody who had a bad experience or indeed feels vulnerable or wishes to have assistance to navigate the health service."</p>
      <p>The Patient Advocacy Service, funded by the Department of Health and independent of the HSE, is a free and confidential service. The tender to provide the service was awarded in 2018 to the National Advocacy Service, which has many yearsâ€™ experience of delivering advocacy in the public sector.</p>
      <p>You can contact the Patient Advocacy Service by calling 0818 293003.</p>
