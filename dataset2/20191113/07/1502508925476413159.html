      <p>How low could Q2 FY20 growth really be? An <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi">SBI </a>Research Report puts the number at a dismal 4.2%.</p>
      <p>A severe contraction in factory output has prompted observers of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-economy">Indian economy </a>to downsize their <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp">GDP </a>estimates. Most have put the headline number at 4.2-4.7 per cent.</p>
      <p>September saw the manufacturing sector, which makes up 78 per cent of the index, slow down at a faster pace. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/industrial-output">Industrial output </a>in September contracted by 4.3 per cent for the second straight month, falling to an eight-year low. But this time around, service sector activity too has pulled down growth in Q2, economists said.</p>

      <p>According to India’s largest public sector bank, India’s <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp">GDP </a>growth will slow down further in the second quarter (July to August) after it hit a six-year low of 5% in the first quarter (April to June) of the current financial year. For the full fiscal year, it has given the lowest estimate so far, at 5 per cent. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nomura">Nomura </a>chief economist Sonal Varma has put the Q2 growth at 4.2 per cent, similar to what <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sbi">SBI </a>has estimated.</p>
