      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 13 — Actor Hairul Azreen has refuted claims that his shirtless appearance in <i>Wira</i> was just a cheap stunt to lure viewers to the theatre.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old said he chose to show some skin in the action flick to do justice to his character of an ex-military man.</p>
      <p>“Sorry, I am not selling my body but I am selling action scenes to attract moviegoers to the cinema.</p>
      <p>“The shirtless scenes were made for the fight sequences featured in the film,” he was quoted as saying by <i>Harian Metro</i>.</p>
      <p>Hairul said he was acting under the requests of <i>Wira</i> director Adrian Teh, who also directed and produced Hairul’s previous film <i>Paskal</i>.</p>
      <p>The father-of-two added that he even tore the ligament of his right leg during the rigorous filming process.</p>
      <p>“I was only following (Teh’s) orders as he wanted the shirtless scenes to solidify the storyline.</p>
      <p>“I did hurt myself while filming <i>Paskal</i> but the injury I suffered to make <i>Wira</i> possible has been the worst so far.</p>
      <p>“But it’s okay because <i>Wira</i> is the action film I’ve been dreaming of for a long time.”</p>
      <p>Hairul plays the role of Hassan, an ex-military man who is tasked with freeing his family from the clutches of a local thug named Raja.</p>
      <p>Other Malaysian and Indonesian stars in <i>Wira</i> include Fify Azmi, Henley Hii, Yayan Ruhian, Ismi Melinda, Dain Said, Hilal Azman, and Josiah Hogan.</p>
      <p>It’s set to open in Malaysian cinemas on November 21.</p>
