        <b>Veteran batsman Gautam Gambhir believes that BCCI president Sourav Ganguly should continue to remain in office after his 10-month term as it will be a shame if he leaves. Gambhir is in support of ex-cricketers taking up administrative roles in cricket as they understand the sport better.</b>

      <p><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> joined office last month and according to the Supreme Court’s guidelines, the current board President will no longer stay in office after his term ends. Gambhir has revealed that there are talks going on with regards to extending the tenures of the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a>’s newly elected office-bearers, according to the agenda circulated for the December 1 AGM of the board.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of talk about ways and means being discussed to extend the tenure of newly-elected BCCI office-bearers. The agenda circulated for the December 1 AGM of the board clearly suggests that we haven't heard the last on this matter. The voice from the Lodha camp is that this will be "ridiculing Supreme Court". This is understandable considering the efforts that the RM Lodha Committee had put in to suggest reforms for the BCCI constitution. I hope we are not heading for another episode of courtroom deliberations," Gambhir wrote in his column for TOI.</p>
      <p>With Sourav Ganguly on the top of the Indian cricket hierarchy, Gambhir believes, it can only do good to the sport. He heavily lauded the former Indian captain’s vision and the ability to lead. Further on, the cricketer turned politician did not deny the work done by the Lodha committee for Indian cricket. </p>
      <p>"Personally speaking, I am not a big fan of cooling-off period for office-bearers. I have said this before and I will say it again that Indian cricket needs individuals like Sourav Ganguly. They not only have minds of their own but they also have vision and ability to lead inclusive growth. Besides, he knows his weaknesses better than his strengths and knows how to work on them. It will be a shame if Dada has to leave after 10 months. At the same time, I am not suggesting to undo the fantastic work done by Lodha Committee," Gambhir added.</p>
