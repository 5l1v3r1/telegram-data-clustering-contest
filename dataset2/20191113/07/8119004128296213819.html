        <b>A man sprayed a corrosive chemical inside a kindergarten in southwest China, injuring 51 students and three teachers, according to the official state news agency.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The attack, which took place Monday afternoon in the Yunnan province city of Kaiyuan, left two people with serious injuries that were not considered life-threatening, according to the Xinhua news service.</p>
      <p>An hour after the attack, police detained a 23-year-old man, whose surname they gave as Kong. Authorities said he sprayed the chemical, called caustic soda, “as a revenge on society,” Xinhua reported.</p>
      <p>Caustic soda, also known as sodium hydroxide, can be a colourless to white substance appearing as flakes, beads or a granular form, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The substance can cause irritation to the eyes, burns to the skin and a temporary loss of hair.</p>
      <p>The episode is the latest instance of violence at Chinese schools this year. In September, a man attacked an elementary school in Hubei province in central China on the first day of the semester, killing at least eight students and wounding two others, police said.</p>
      <p>In April, a man armed with a knife killed two students and injured two others at an elementary school in Hunan province in central China.</p>
      <p>And in January, 20 children were injured after a man with a hammer attacked an elementary school in the Chinese capital, leaving three students seriously injured, authorities said at the time.</p>
