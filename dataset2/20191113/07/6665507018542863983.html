      <h1>BCCI Doesn't Acknowledge Fact-Check On Its Deepak Chahar Tweet</h1>
      <h2>BCCI said Deepak Chahar was "the first Indian to pick up a hat-trick in T20Is" and no one was happy.</h2>

      <p>Two days ago, Deepak Chahar’s six wicket haul against Bangladesh helped India win the third and final T20 International by 30 runs. The pacer’s haul also included a hat-trick and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/BCCI/">BCCI</a> celebrated the feat with a tweet. </p>

      <p>Several Twitter users and other reports did a fact check for BCCI and reminded the cricket body of Ekta Bisht.  </p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.thequint.com/sports/cricket/is-deepak-chahar-the-first-indian-to-take-a-hat-trick-in-t20is"><i>Quint</i></a>’s report said, Chahar is the first Indian man to achieve a hat-trick in the shortest format of the game. The first Indian, however, to do this was Ekta Bisht for the Indian Women’s Team. </p>
      <p>She achieved the feat in 2012 in a T20I against Sri Lanka. </p>
      <p>Other reports (see <a href="https://www.dnaindia.com/cricket/photo-gallery-fact-check-is-deepak-chahar-first-indian-bowler-to-claim-hat-trick-in-t20i-cricket-2801156">here</a> and <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/cricket/bcci-gets-trolled-for-calling-deepak-chahar-first-indian-to-take-a-hat-trick-in-t20is">here</a>) also pointed out the problem with BCCI’s tweet.</p>
      <p>Despite several reports and tweets (see below), BCCI’s tweet, at the time of writing this, is still there.</p>
