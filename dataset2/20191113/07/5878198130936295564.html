      <p>“I was excited, but I was a little scared at the same time because it’s a lot of pressure,” the entertainer tells PEOPLE in this week’s cover story.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s going to be picking me apart to see if I’m sexy enough to hold this title. I’m [also] <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/the-2018-sexiest-man-alive-is-here-and-he-is-black"><i>following Idris Elba</i></a>, which is not fair and is not nice to me!” an elated Legend said.</p>
