        <b>The hearing of Rahul Dravid's case regarding conflict of interest has been concluded and the BCCI ethics officer DK Jain says that the order will be out soon. MPCA life member Sanjiv Gupta had lodged a complaint against Dravid regarding his dual role as NCA coach and India Cements employee.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rahul Dravid's conflict of interest case has gained a lot of limelight lately and finally, the hearing has been concluded and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> ethics officer DK Jain has assured that there will be a judgment soon.</p>
      <p>"The hearing has been concluded. You can expect my order soon," Jain told TOI.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old former Indian captain had spoken about his case on September 26 in Mumbai but the officials have asked him to visit again on Monday. "There is no special reason(to recall Dravid). I had some doubts and I thought I must clarify them," Jain asserted.</p>
      <p>Dravid has been working closely with young Indian talents as India's U19 coach and also as the head coach of the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Banglore. But he is also the vice president of the India Cements group who are the owners of IPL franchise <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/chennai_super_kings">Chennai Super Kings</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite mentioning well beforehand that he had asked for a leave of absence from India Cements and that he has nothing to do with Chennai Super Kings, Dravid was still issued conflict of interest notice. According to BCCI's constitution, no person can hold two posts at the same time.</p>
      <p>Before demitting, the CoA had submitted their final status report to the Supreme Court in which they had mentioned some amendments in theÂ "straight-jacketed" conflict of interest clause in the BCCI constitution.</p>
      <p>Should the amendment is accepted by the Supreme Court's Apex Council, former players with less than two-year contracts with BCCI will be allowed multiple roles like being a part of the Cricket Advisory Committee whilst also taking up commentary stints.</p>
