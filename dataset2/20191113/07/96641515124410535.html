      <h1>Netflix UK offers the first episode of 'The Crown' season 3 for free</h1>
      <h2>The experiment is designed to attract older viewers to the platform.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T07:01:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 07:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/rachel-england" target="_blank">Rachel England</a></address>
      <p>As the so-called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/27/please-stop-making-streaming-services/">streaming war</a> intensifies, companies have to seek out new ways to attract subscribers to their platforms -- and Netflix thinks offering freebies might be the way to go. When season three of smash hit period drama <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/netflix-the-crown-season-three-trailer/">The Crown</a> </i>hits UK Netflix on November 17th, the first episode will be available for free.</p>
      <p>It's not a completely original move -- Netflix has done the same with other shows in India and South America, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/01/apple-tv-launches-today/">Apple TV+</a> made a bunch of episodes available for free when it first launched. Obviously the idea is to hook people onto a series and encourage them to sign up for the whole shebang. In the case of <i>The Crown</i> specifically, though, the deal is likely to appeal to older folks who rely on the BBC or ITV for their TV dramas, and could help coax them away from regular television.</p>
      <p>The free episode launches on November 17th -- the same time as the rest of the series, which this time around features the likes of Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham Carter. It'll be available on a dedicated site, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/netflix-uk-first-episode-the-crown-season-3-free/netflix.com/thecrown">netflix.com/thecrown</a>, until December 15th.</p>
