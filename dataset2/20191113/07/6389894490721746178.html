      <p>He is leaving to focus on his investment and advisory firm, Novalis Life Sciences, but will stay on as a non-executive director, Unilever said today.</p>
      <p>“It has been a huge honour to serve as chairman of Unilever and I am very proud of the work we continue to do as a truly purpose-driven company,” Dekkers said.</p>
      <p>“My decision to step down has been a difficult one to make but I look forward to seeing Unilever go from strength to strength under Nils as chairman.”</p>
      <p>Andersen has been a Unilever board member since April 2015, and currently serves on the board’s audit committee.</p>
      <p>He will quit a non-exec director role at BP and a chairman role at the private Salling Group in March ahead of Unilever’s annual general meeting.</p>
      <p>“On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Marijn for his strong leadership and the</p>
      <p>contribution he has made as chairman,” Andersen said.</p>
      <p>“I am very proud to have been asked to succeed Marijn and I look forward to working with the board and the Unilever Leadership team to support the company’s continued growth.”</p>
      <p>Dekkers’ departure follows former chief executive Paul Polman’s retirement at the end of last year.</p>

      <p>Unilever’s internal candidate, Alan Jope, replaced him in the role after 10 years at the top of the company.</p>
      <p>The maker of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream missed its latest estimates as a slowdown in emerging markets hurt sales, seeing it book underlying growth of 2.9 per cent in its third quarter.</p>
