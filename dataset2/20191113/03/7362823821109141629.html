      <h1>Trump impeachment inquiry a 'threat to the presidency,' Graham says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T03:59:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 03:59</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham">Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.</a>, said the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment inquiry</a>, as constructed, is a threat to the presidency and should not be legitimized.</p>
      <p>Graham told "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">Hannity</a>" on Tuesday the allegation <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukrainian officials is also not true.</p>
      <p>"I think it would be a danger to the presidency in the future for us to legitimize what's going on in the House," he said.</p>
      <p>"There's no civil proceeding in America -- no criminal proceeding in America -- that denies a person to tell their side of the story by calling witnesses except in the House."</p>

      <p>Graham was referring to the situation that, to-date, has not allowed Trump or members of his administration to engage in proceedings. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has also not yet approved Republicans' request to have the whistleblower testify publicly.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Sean Hannity, Graham said every American -- including the president of the United States -- has the right to confront their accuser.</p>
      <p>"That's not being done in this case, so I don't want to legitimize this because it's a threat to the presidency," he said.</p>
      <p>He added he did not believe there was evidence confirming allegations lodged against Trump relating to Ukraine.</p>

      <p>"The allegation is that Donald J. Trump withheld aid to Ukraine unless the Ukrainian government investigated Joe Biden and Hunter Biden for corruption," he said.</p>
      <p>"The problem with that allegation is that it's not true. The aid was delivered to the Ukrainian government and there was no investigation of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden."</p>
      <p>In addition, Graham remarked that the Trump proceedings are not the first impeachment investigation he's been a part of.</p>
      <p>In the late 1990s while serving as a U.S. congressman from Upstate South Carolina, Graham was involved in House proceedings against then-President Bill Clinton.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I've done this before," he remarked.</p>
