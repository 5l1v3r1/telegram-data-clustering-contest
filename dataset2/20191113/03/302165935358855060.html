      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 13 — Malaysian singer and actress Datin Seri Shaila V is back with a new film <i>Pulanaivu</i>.</p>
      <p>But unlike her previous endeavours of comedy films, namely <i>Mayangaathey</i> in 2016 and <i>Maindhan</i> in 2014, she is exploring a more serious role as a cop this time.</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Shalini Balasundaram and Sathish Natarajan, the husband and wife duo are tapping into an action-packed genre and unveiling a murder mystery with a dose of romance.</p>
      <p>Without giving too much away, Shaila hinted that <i>Pulanaivu</i>, which means “intelligence” or “investigation”, is a romantic crime thriller where a cop (played by her) will be in pursuit of a murderer who committed a crime at a college.</p>
      <p>She said the directors had tried to tweak the stereotypical characteristics of a cop by adding emotions to her role.</p>
      <p>“We tried to portray a cop that’s firm and hard at work, but once she returns home for the day, she becomes a key part of her family as a wife and mother,” she added.</p>

      <p>Bankrolled by Shaibha Vision and Story Films, the film boasts a talented cast including Shalini, Shaila, Kabil Ganesan, Sarankumar, Krithigah Nair, Shabby Ley, Shahrwind, KS Maniam, Shashi Tharan, Desmond Dass, Mardinii, Irfan Zaini, Pashini Sivakumar, and Ramkumar Ravichandran.</p>
      <p>The film has garnered much attention since the release of its trailer earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Shaila admitted that the script and movie narration was what truly captured her interest in the role.</p>
      <p>The cast spent two months before filming started.</p>
      <p>“Preparing for my character was quite difficult as I had to transit my personality from being feminine and soft-spoken to something more serious and rough in order to fit into the role,” she said.</p>
      <p>Despite the challenges, Shaila said the role made her feel more mature as compared to playing “the girl next door” roles in her previous two movies.</p>

      <p>She added that working with a young director like Shalini meant things were done differently as she and the production team tried to incorporate a new type of focus to the film.</p>
      <p>“As a result, the movie was able to come together with such ease,” she added.</p>
      <p>Shalini, meanwhile, began her stint as an actor and director in 2015 with romantic comedy film <i>Geethaiyin Raadhai</i>, which was released in 2016.</p>
      <p>She then moved on to explore a drama/action genre with <i>Thirudathey Papa Thirudathey</i> in 2018.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the Malaysiam-made Tamil films, the 26-year-old director noted that the industry here was slowly gaining momentum and hoped it would grow even stronger in the near future.</p>
      <p>Shalini also pointed out that Malaysian-Tamil movies have great potential to be screened in India and Sri Lanka due to Malaysia’s unique culture.</p>
      <p>“Although we speak the same language, the Malaysian-Indian culture can make our movies unique and sellable in countries like India and Sri Lanka,” she added.</p>
      <p><i>Pulanaivu</i> will be screened for two weeks from tomorrow in 64 cinemas nationwide, making it the first Malaysian-Tamil film with the highest number of cinema listing ever.</p>
      <p>Shalini said it is a great feat for a locally-produced film to secure that many theatres for its release.</p>
      <p>The film runs for 1 hour and 58 minutes.</p>
