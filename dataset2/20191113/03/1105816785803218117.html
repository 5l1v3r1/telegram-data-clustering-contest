      <h1>Remittances slow down to $7.48b</h1>

      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis in the first four months of the current fiscal year (July-October 2019) remained almost flat at $7.48 billion.</p>
      <p>According to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Tuesday, the remittances were 1.82% lower than $7.62 billion sent home from abroad in the same period of the previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Talking to The Express Tribune, BMA Research Executive Director Saad Hashmi termed it a flat trend and said the number came in line with market expectations.</p>
      <p>“The number was in line with our expectations and if the pace of remittances remains steady, the number for the full fiscal year 2019-20 is expected to be between $20 and $21 billion,” he said. Arif Habib Limited Head of Research Samiullah Tariq termed it a minor movement compared to the previous year.</p>

      <p>“A decline in crude oil prices in the Middle East in the past few months was reflected in the slowdown in remittances in the four months under review,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, remittances grew 14.46% on a month-on-month basis to $2 billion in October. According to Hashmi, it was due to the seasonal effect because a rise in remittances was also seen from September to October 2018.</p>
      <p>Endorsing his views, Tariq explained that remittances had recorded a sharp spike in July and August due to Eid and they fell in September but picked up again in October as a sign of stability.</p>
      <p>Compared to October 2018, the remittances fell 2.88%, which could be attributed to the rupee devaluation. Country-wise details revealed that inflows from Saudi Arabia amounted to $468.18 million in October 2019 compared to $494.53 million in the same month of the previous year.</p>
      <p>Pakistanis living in the UAE remitted $398.96 million last month compared with $419.41 million in the same period of the previous year while from the US, they sent $322.38 million compared to $325.19 million last year.</p>

From the EU countries, the expatriate Pakistani workers sent $60.94 million compared with $57.42 million remitted a year earlier.</p>
