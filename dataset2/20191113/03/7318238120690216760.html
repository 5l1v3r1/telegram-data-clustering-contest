      <h1>U.S. orders family of government employees to leave Bolivia</h1>

      <p>LA PAZ, Bolivia — The United States on Tuesday ordered family members of U.S. government employees to leave Bolivia because of civil unrest in the South American country, the State Department said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The department also warned American citizens against traveling to Bolivia and said the U.S. government had limited ability to provide emergency services after a disputed election sparked protests that led Evo Morales to resign as president and flee the country.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/bolivia-political-uncertainty-after-president-would-be-successors-resign-n1079831?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma&amp;fbclid=IwAR2p95rC7IPyrBBxeIMPKpvxqDRWnY1XD9HlxxXoHwPUFKmKTn-9NqFFoyU">Morales resigned Sunday</a> after nearly 14 years in power.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, a women's rights activist and former television presenter who became an opposition leader in the Senate declared herself Bolivia's interim president, promising to guide the country out of a deep crisis.</p>
      <p>Jeanine Añez, 52, was a second-tier opposition figure until Morales' resignation.</p>
      <p>But as the Senate's second vice president, she moved Tuesday to take temporary control of the body even though she lacked a quorum to appoint her. The Senate leader is next in line to the presidency, and she then proclaimed herself interim president to guide the Andean nation before new elections.</p>
      <p>Celebrations and clashes quickly broke out in Bolivia among<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/bolivia-s-evo-morales-pleads-peace-his-resignation-leaves-severe-n1080296">supporters and foes of Morales</a>, who flew to exile in Mexico earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Bolivia's crisis erupted after the last elections, on Oct. 20, were marred b<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/bolivian-president-announces-resignation-amid-accusations-election-fraud-n1079561">y allegations that Morales fixed the results in his favor</a>. Violent protests swept the country, leading to police defections and finally a call from the chief of the military for Bolivia's first indigenous president to resign.</p>
      <p>In a dramatic scene Monday, Añez wept as she told journalists that she wanted to "give certainty" to Bolivians in the midst of a power vacuum.</p>
      <p>"I just want to provide a solution to the horrible crisis that we're living through," Añez said.</p>
      <p>Morales' exit, along with the resignations of the Senate president and other senior leaders, opened the way for Añez to step into the void left by their departures.</p>
      <p>Añez needed the support of her fellow lawmakers to become Senate president, and there were no guarantees of that in a congress dominated by Morales loyalists.</p>
      <p>Still, she assumed the presidency even though there was no quorum for a formal debate on accepting Morales' resignation, and no one swore in. Lawmakers from Morales' Movement for Socialism boycotted the assembly session.</p>
      <p>If it stands up, Añez's self-proclamation would make her the second woman to become interim president of Bolivia. Lidia Gueiler held that role in 1979 and 1980.</p>
      <p>Añez was a lawyer before getting into politics and has campaigned against gender violence. She also worked as a TV presenter and director of the Totalvisión station in the city of Trinidad, which is in the Amazonian province of Beni.</p>
      <p>She belongs to the opposition Democratic Unity party, which is led by Rubén Costas, governor of Santa Cruz province, an opposition stronghold.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Añez was elected to an assembly that Morales called to reform the Bolivian constitution after his ascent to power.</p>
      <p>Añez's efforts to guide her country toward stability appear perilous, but at least some Bolivians are happy to see her in a prominent role.</p>
      <p>Fernando Llapiz, who is from the Beni region, was among those hoping Añez will succeed.</p>
      <p>"She is not alone," he said.</p>
