      <p>[<b>Update: </b><i>Five Night's at Freddy's 4</i> has just recently been added to the Nintendo Switch listings on Nintendo's European site, with a release date of November 29. (Thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2019/11/13/five-nights-at-freddys-4-has-also-been-confirmed-for-a-nintendo-switch-release-on-november-29th/">Nintendo News</a>)]<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure anybody saw the phenomenal success of <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> coming. At first glance it was easy to dismiss Scott Cawthon's spooky indie title as another in a long line of independently-made jump-scare horror titles for the streaming crowd. But since its initial release back in 2014, <i>Five Night's</i> has undoubtedly become a household name, spawning several sequels, novels, a planned movie, and a glut of weird Rule 34 fanart... So I'm told.<br/><br/>And now, we have the opportunity to get freaky with Freddy Fazbear all over again, as publisher Clickteam has announced that the first three <i>Five Nights at Freddy's</i> games will be crawling onto Switch on November 29, bringing the camera-staring, door operating action to the Nintendo platform. Listings for these releases are now live on the Nintendo store, but it should be noted that there are currently no similar listings for third sequel <i>Five Nights at Freddy's 4</i> or spin-off title <i>Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location.</i><br/><br/><i><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/five-nights-at-freddys-switch/">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/five-nights-at-freddys-2-switch/">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a></i> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/five-nights-at-freddys-3-switch/"><i>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</i></a> will be available to download on Nintendo Switch November 29, costing around $8 each.</p>
