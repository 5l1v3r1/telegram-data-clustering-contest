      <p>Caitlyn joked ahead of entering the jungle camp that she didn't know that there wouldn't be stylists on hand to help keep her looking on point at all times.</p>
      <p>She asked: "Do we get hair and make-up? Noooo?! We don't get hair and make-up? Oh my god!"</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of hair help in the camp, Caitlyn has indicated that it will be her fellow campmates that might end up bugging her more than any insects.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn said: "People are far tougher than any snake or spider," before adding that she would try to "keep the peace" and will act as the "parent" of the camp.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity bosses have paid big bucks to bring Caitlyn Down Under, with reports that she is receiving a£500,000 payday for her appearance.</p>
