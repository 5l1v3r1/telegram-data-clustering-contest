      <p>Luka Mucic, finance chief, said SAP will reduce the number of research centres to five from 25 now. The budget for research and development will remain steady at 14per cent of revenue, he said.</p>
      <p>The company will also cut management costs and the number of its suppliers.</p>
      <p>The capital markets day was the first major outing for new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. The duo have taken over from long-time boss Bill McDermott, who is leaving to head up ServiceNow</p>
