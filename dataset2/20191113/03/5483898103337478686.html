      <h3>Bagot Avenue in Cowandilla has been closed and police are searching for a silver Subaru following an assault and car theft.</h3>
      <p>Channel 9’s Harvey Biggs told FIVEaa’s Leith Forrest on Tuesday afternoon:</p>
      <blockquote>“The street is now blocked off on Bagot Ave on Sir Donald Bradman Drive right in front of the Hilton Plaza. Around 1pm an incident occurred here. When we arrived paramedics walked into a property across the road from the plaza and about 10 minutes later walked out with a man who was transported to hospital.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to SAPOL:</p>
      <blockquote>Just before 12pm today (Wednesday 13 November) police were called to a house in Bagot Avenue, after reports that two men and a woman assaulted the victim with an unknown weapon, stole property from his house and also stole his car, a 1997 silver Subaru sedan, with South Australian registration of VXN303, from a nearby car park.<br/><br/>The victim suffered minor injuries and was taken to hospital for treatment.<br/><br/>Anyone who sees the Subaru is asked to call the Police Assistance Line immediately on 131444.</blockquote>
