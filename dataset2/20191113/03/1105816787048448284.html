      <h1>Car sales plunge 56% in October</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T03:30:06+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8754/our-correspondent-6/" target="_blank">​ Our Correspondent</a></address>
      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>The condition of the automobile sector continued to worsen in Pakistan as car sales plunged 56% on a year-on-year basis, posting the largest decline since March 2009 mainly due to high prices following massive rupee depreciation and higher interest rates for auto financing.</p>
      <p>According to data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (Pama), auto sales were recorded at 10,853 units in October 2019 compared to 24,850 units in the same month of the previous year.</p>
      <p>“The decline is primarily attributable to the recent government drive to document the economy, higher automobile prices post-rupee devaluation, higher interest rates for auto financing and overall economic slowdown,” said Topline Securities’ analyst Hammad Akram.</p>
      <p>The situation remained dismal for all the three major market players as they posted a significant year-on-year decline in sales.</p>

      <p>Honda Atlas Cars remained the major laggard with a 72% year-on-year drop in sales to 1,384 units in October 2019, its highest monthly decline in 7.5 years.</p>
      <p>“Sales of City and Civic variants fell 77% year-on-year amid a significant increase in their prices while BR-V sales declined 33%,” the analyst said.</p>
      <p>Indus Motor Company fared no better and recorded a drop of 61% in sales to 2,496 units in October 2019.</p>
      <p>Sales of Pak Suzuki Motor Company were down 48% year-on-year to 6,973 units, posting the largest decline in over seven years.</p>
      <p>“The decline in sales was led by Wagon-R and Cultus, whose sales were down 84% and 51% respectively, due to a recent shift in customer interest towards Alto and newly launched Picanto by Kia-Lucky Motors,” the analyst added.</p>

      <p>In the first four months of the current fiscal year, auto sales fell 46% to 45,161 units against 83,201 units in the same period of the previous fiscal year.</p>
      <p>On a month-on-month basis, Indus Motor surprisingly reported an increase of 18% in volumetric sales.</p>
      <p>“This is mainly due to 10% and 86% month-on-month increase in Corolla and Hilux sales respectively,” Akram said. “We believe this has occurred due to different waiver schemes offered by the company in collaboration with commercial banks.”</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Pak Suzuki Motor faced the largest month-on-month decline in car sales of 15%, followed by Honda Atlas, which reported a fall of 4% in sales.</p>
