      <h1>'I'm not backing down': Cherry not apologizing, admits to poor choice of words</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- A day after being fired for suggesting immigrants don’t wear poppies, hockey broadcaster Don Cherry isn’t apologizing, but wishes he had chosen different words to illustrate his opinion.</p>
      <p>Cherry was fired Monday, after nearly 40 years of working the first intermission broadcast of “Hockey Night in Canada,” following the fallout from Saturday night’s show.</p>
      <p>"You people … that come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that," he said during the show. "These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."</p>
      <p>In an interview with CTV News’ Omar Sachedina on Tuesday, the 85-year-old Cherry said Sportsnet “absolutely buried” him with the sudden firing, but added that he wasn’t going to apologize for the comments. </p>
      <p>“I was taught never to back down and I'm not backing down now,” he said. “If I got to go out, I'm going out the way I said it and the way I mean it. I'm not going to be a phony.”</p>
      <p>Cherry does admit, however, he would’ve chosen his words differently if given the choice.</p>
      <p>“I wish I had used something else besides ‘you people,’” he said. “I think I would've said: ‘Everybody else. Everybody should be wearing poppy,’ instead of you people.”</p>
      <p>Cherry added his comments weren’t’ meant to single out minorities.</p>
      <p>“It could have been Irish, it could have been Scotch, it could have been anybody.”</p>
      <p>Cherry said Sportsnet offered to let him keep his job, provided he agreed to a set of conditions that included remaining quiet for two days. Sportsnet said it has nothing further to add.</p>
      <p>Cherry’s remarks, the latest in a <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/don-cherry-s-history-of-controversial-comments-1.4680505">decades-long string of controversial comments</a>, were widely criticized. The Canada Broadcast Standards Council <a href="https://www.cbsc.ca/make-a-complaint/">issued a plea</a> on Monday for people to stop reporting the comments, as the agency had already received more complaints than it was able to process.</p>
      <p>The statements were also panned by long-time co-host Ron MacLean, who is seen nodding and giving a thumbs-up during the segment. MacLean apologized during a broadcast the next day for intervening during the show.</p>
      <p>Cherry suggested MacLean’s comments on Sunday felt like a betrayal. </p>
      <p>“I thought we were both in it together,” he said. “I was disappointed in him, but he's still a friend.”</p>
      <p>Cherry has occasionally attracted controversy for deriding Europeans, French-Canadians and people who ride bicycles. Given his pervious comments on French-Canadians, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Cherry’s firing was a long-time coming.</p>
      <p>“I am happy that he’s not at Sportsnet anymore,” he said. “I will be able now to watch hockey games on the English channel, because I won't have to support Don Cherry.”</p>
