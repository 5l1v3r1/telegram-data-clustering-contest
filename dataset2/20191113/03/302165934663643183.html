      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 13 — Suria FM radio presenter Feeya Iskandar was left puzzled after social media users thought she had a bundle of joy on the way.</p>
      <p>It all started when the 29-year-old posted a picture on Instagram and followers got into a tizzy over what they believed was a baby bump.</p>
      <p>“It’s so funny. If you have a belly it means you’re pregnant?</p>
      <p>“I think people are confused and don’t know the difference between a baby bump and a belly,” she told <i>mStar</i>.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who is affectionately known as Cik Piah, said it was normal for mothers to have a protruding belly.</p>
      <p>“No time to do sit-ups,” she said with a laugh.</p>
      <p>Following a flood of congratulatory messages from social media users, Feeya has since deleted the image.</p>
      <p>She then uploaded another picture to clear up any assumptions.</p>

      <p>In her follow-up post yesterday, Feeya told fans to stop asking if she was pregnant and said she would block those who did.</p>
      <p>Feeya clarified saying she has no plans to have any children for now and plans to spend more time with her two children, aged two and one.</p>
      <p>“I deleted that picture because it was so annoying to see people congratulating me.</p>
      <p>“The second picture is the right one with the right posture which lets me prove to followers that I’m not pregnant — if I am, it’s impossible to hide my belly.</p>
      <p>“For the time being, I’m not planning to become pregnant. My children are really close, I want to focus on them,” she said.</p>
