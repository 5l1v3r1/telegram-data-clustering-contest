      <p><b>Geely</b> has already bought Lotus and Volvo, invested in Smart, and joined Toyota in partnering with search engine Baidu. Now, if Geely's willing, <b>Jaguar Land Rover</b> could be pencilled into its increasingly full dance card.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/jaguar-owner-is-said-to-approach-geely-bmw-in-hunt-for-partners"><i>Bloomberg</i> </a>reports <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/jlr/">Jaguar Land Rover’s</a> owner, the Tata Group, has approached <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/geely/">Geely’s</a> owner, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, to discuss a partnership. The Indian-owned automaker has also reportedly reached out to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a>.</p>
      <p>Geely has released a statement saying there have been no talks with either <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tata/">Tata</a> or JLR. BMW, however, declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The German automaker has already <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/763496/bmw-jaguar-land-rover-ev/">agreed to partner with JLR</a> on next-generation electric drive units but its former CEO, Harald Kreuger, said in August there were no plans for an equity investment in JLR.</p>
      <p>Tata has made clear it’s <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/801408/jaguar-land-rover-not-for-sale-tata/">not interested in selling JLR</a>. Instead, any partnership they enter is to share costs, particularly in electric vehicle development.</p>

      <p>JLR beat its European competition to the electric vehicle market with the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/i-pace/">I-Pace</a> and it has many more electric vehicles planned, including electric versions of the next-generation <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/xj/">Jaguar XJ</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/range-rover/range-rover/">Range Rover</a>.</p>
      <p>EV development is expensive, however, especially for a relatively small automaker. The softening of EV sales on the Chinese market is also cause for concern, the Chinese government reducing the subsidies available to EV buyers.</p>
      <p>JLR’s financial situation has taken a turn for the worse. The company announced <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/757856/jaguar-land-rover-loses-6-7-billion-during-financial-year/">it lost £3.6 billion</a> ($6.7 billion) in the financial year ending 31 March 2019, most of that loss attributable to a Tata Motors <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/725363/jaguar-land-rover-seeking-funding-after-huge-write-down-report/">writing down</a> their investment in the company.</p>
      <p>Even before those figures were released, the company revealed it was seeking to find US$3.2 billion (A$4.68 billion) in cost savings by mid-2020. Part of that goal has been achieved through the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/716120/jaguar-land-rover-4500-job-cuts/">cutting of thousands of jobs</a> worldwide, though the company has yet to reveal if it fully achieved the goal.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Tata Motors provided JLR with a $910 million (A$1.3 billion) equity infusion, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/755509/tata-denies-jaguar-land-rover-sale-is-close-to-completion/">swatting away rumours</a> it was planning to end its 11-year ownership of the company and sell it to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/psa/">Groupe PSA</a>.</p>
      <p>Partnering with a Chinese automaker would be beneficial for the company, though hopefully it would work out better than JLR’s current Chinese partnership with <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/chery/">Chery</a>.</p>
      <p>Jaguar and Land Rover models built in China via this joint venture have been affected by poor quality control and a spate of recalls, sales tumbling by half last year. Fortunately for JLR, sales have subsequently been on the mend, monthly sales growing by double digits for the past four months.</p>
