      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past three sessions, there were <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/ethereum-eth-stuck-in-range-while-bitcoin-is-sliding/">mostly range moves in Ethereum</a> above the $182 support against the US Dollar. ETH tested the $182 support recently, settled below the 100 hourly simple moving average, and it is currently recovering higher.</p>
      <p>It corrected above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $192 swing high to $182 low. Moreover, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>However, the price faced a strong resistance near the $187 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $192 swing high to $182 low.</p>
      <p>At the outset, Ethereum is trading with a bearish angle below $187 and the 100 hourly SMA. It might continue to decline, but there are many supports on the downside, starting with $184.</p>
      <p>The next key support is near the $182 area, where the bulls are likely to take a stand. To push the price further into a bearish zone, the bears need to gain pace below the $182 and $180 support levels.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the $187 level and the 100 hourly SMA are initial hurdles. A convincing break above the $187 and $188 resistance levels could push the price towards the $192 high.</p>
      <p>Finally, a clear break above the $192 level is must for upside continuation. The next key resistance are near the $198 and $200 levels, above which it could test $205.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is showing a few positive signs, but it is facing a lot of hurdles such as $187, $188 and $190. On the downside, the $182 and $180 support levels hold the key. If there is a breakdown below $180, the price may perhaps decline towards $168.</p>
