      <p>Popular health websites are sharing private, personal medical data with big tech companies, according to an investigation by the Financial Times. From a report:<i> The data, including medical diagnoses, symptoms, prescriptions, and menstrual and fertility information, are <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/614708/health-websites-are-sharing-sensitive-medical-data-with-google-facebook-and-amazon/">being sold to companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Oracle and smaller data brokers</a> and advertising technology firms, like Scorecard and OpenX. The FT analyzed 100 health websites, including WebMD, Healthline, health insurance group Bupa, and parenting site Babycentre, and found that 79% of them dropped cookies on visitors, allowing them to be tracked by third-party companies around the internet. This was done without consent, making the practice illegal under European Union regulations. By far the most common destination for the data was Google's advertising arm DoubleClick, which showed up in 78% of the sites the FT tested.</i></p>
