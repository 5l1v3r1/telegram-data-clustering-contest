      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- A U.S. guided missile cruiser traveled through the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and mainland China on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Beijing has previously condemned similar operations as "wrong practices and provocative activities."</p>
      <p>The USS Chancellorsville was navigating the strait during a "routine" mission that is "in accordance with international law," said Cmdr. Reann Mommsen of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/navy-sends-guided-missile-cruiser-through-taiwan-strait-in-eighth-transit-there-this-year-1.607095">Stars and Stripes</a> reported Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Navy uploaded a photo from Chancellorsville taken in the strait on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"The sun sets as Chancellorsville transits through the Taiwan Strait in support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. #PressOn!" the photo's caption read.</p>
      <p>Japanese television network NHK reported the U.S. ship is passing through the Taiwan Strait only 53 days after the USS Antietam sailed through the area in late September.</p>
      <p>U.S. naval ships have traveled through the strait a total of nine times in 2019. The Chancellorsville sailed on Tuesday ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark-Esper/?tps=1">Mark Esper</a> and Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Esper is embarking on a tour of Asia to tend to urgent matters.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/trump-price-tag-for-troops-in-south-korea-looms-over-esper-trip">Bloomberg reported</a> Wednesday Esper is expected to arrive in South Korea on Thursday to address Seoul's latest concerns, including a demand from U.S. President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> for a five-fold increase in defense burden sharing.</p>
      <p>Esper is also likely to address friction between Seoul and Tokyo that has culminated in a South Korean decision to not renew GSOMIA, a military intelligence-sharing agreement with Japan.</p>
      <p>The deal expires Nov. 23 if it is not renewed.</p>
