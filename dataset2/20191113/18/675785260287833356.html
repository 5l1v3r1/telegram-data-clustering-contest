      <h1>UK weather forecast: Snow and ice to hit before rain swamps flood-ravaged towns</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office has issued three severe weather warnings saying up to 60mm of rain is possible in parts of the country as other places deal with snow and ice that threaten travel chaos</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snow">Snow</a> and ice are set to hit parts of the UK as torrential rain threatens to bring further misery to flood-ravaged towns where residents are exhausted and frustrated.</p>
      <p>Three separate severe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings have been issued by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">Met Office</a> as Mother Nature brings a mixed bag of conditions and colder-than-usual temperatures over the next 48 hours.</p>
      <p>From Wednesday night, up to 60mm of rain could fall in South West England and as much as 5cm of snow could blanket South Wales, while surfaces in eastern Scotland will become icy as temperatures drop overnight.</p>
      <p>Flood-weary residents in Yorkshire and the Midlands face a dreadful forecast from Thursday as forecasters warn up to 45mm of rain could cause swollen rivers to rise again and inundate more homes.</p>

      <p>Fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible and could pose a danger to life, and some communities could be cut off by flooded roads, the Met Office warned.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday morning, 34 flood warnings were in place, mainly in Yorkshire and the Midlands, and more than 75 alerts had been issued by the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>Residents were bracing for the worst on a day when Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he visited the worst-hit towns.</p>

      <p>Met Office spokeswoman Nicky Maxey warned that parts in the South West, such as Bristol, Bath and Gloucester, could see as much as 40mm to 60mm of rain.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxey said that within the northern yellow warning between 10mm and 20mm of rain is expected, with some spots potentially seeing as much as 35mm to 45mm.</p>
      <p>Homes and businesses will be at risk of flooding in that region.</p>

      <p>The areas that are likely to see snow and/or sleet include higher routes in South Wales, including the Brecon Beacons, (up to 5cm), and Aberdeenshire and Moray in Scotland (1-2cm).</p>
      <p>Ice could disrupt Thursday morning's commute in Edinburgh and western Scotland as rain freezes overnight.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxey said drier, colder conditions can be expected towards the end of the working week.</p>

      <h3>PM accused of doing nothing to help victims</h3>
      <p>Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he took a break from electioneering to visit one of the worst hit areas.</p>
      <p>One resident in flood-hit Stainforth in South Yorkshire told Mr Johnson: "I'm not very happy about talking to you so, if you don't mind, I'll just mope on with what I'm doing."</p>
      <p>The woman, clutching a wheelbarrow alongside the troops sent to the area to help, added: "You've not helped us up to press. I don't know what you're here today for."</p>
      <p>Another told him: "You've took your time Boris, haven't you?", to which Mr Johnson replied: "We've been on it round the clock."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at the scene, Mr Johnson said: "I perfectly understand how people feel and you can understand the anguish a flood causes.</p>
      <p>"The shock of seeing your property engulfed by water is huge and also the anxiety of what may still be to come and I do thank the emergency services for everything they are doing."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson arrived in the area as nearly 100 soldiers began assisting communities cut off by the flooding.</p>
      <p>The Government has announced a relief fund with £500 available to each eligible household.</p>
