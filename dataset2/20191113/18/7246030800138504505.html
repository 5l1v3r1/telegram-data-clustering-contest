      <h1>‘I Told You We Would Choose Right Time,’ Netanyahu Tells Council Heads Living Near Gaza</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:02:08+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>During a conference call with the heads of the regional councils located along the Gaza border, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, “We are changing the equation.”</p>
      <p>The prime minister told the community leaders, “I told you that we would choose the right time.</p>
      <p>“The right time was the day before yesterday. As the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) director Nadav Argaman said, ‘The stars aligned.'”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu went on to say, “The heads, commanders and operatives of the terrorist organizations in Gaza know they are in the cross hairs and that at any time we could act against them anywhere. They understand this message well.</p>
      <p>“We decided to strengthen our deterrence with new means that they have not even imagined. We carried out an action with surgical precision.</p>
      <p>“Instigators of terrorism and commanders know that we can reach them personally. They fire from within civilian populations and hide behind civilians. We broke this equation by targeting him while he was hiding.</p>
      <p>“I very much appreciate your steadfastness and support, and that of your residents.”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu asked the council heads to instruct their residents to listen to IDF Home Front Command directions, and also told Prime Minister’s Office Acting Director General Ronen Peretz to stay in contact with them, to assist them with whatever is needed.</p>
      <p>The council heads said that they will remain in touch and commended the Prime Minister on the action. They added that in recent years there has been growth in the cities and a significant increase in population by dozens of percentage points.</p>
      <p>In addition, the council heads said the residents are strong and give the government their continued backing.</p>
