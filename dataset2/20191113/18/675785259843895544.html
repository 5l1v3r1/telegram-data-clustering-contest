      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:42:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:42</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Bird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-bird/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deandre-yedlin">DeAndre Yedlin</a> has hit out at Newcastle United's critics and claimed they “want this club to fail.”</p>
      <p>The USA defender reckons Steve Bruce's men are under a magnified spotlight, but will prove they are not relegation fodder every season.</p>
      <p>Owner Mike Ashley and Bruce have both faced flack in the last few months but consecutive wins have lifted United out of the danger zone.</p>
      <p>Yedlin said: "For whatever reason, this club’s in, I don’t want to say the spotlight, but I get the feeling that people want this club to fail, for some reason.</p>
      <p>"I think we can prove them wrong, and it is quite a good feeling – not in the sense that we’re proving them wrong, but proving the fans and supporters that believe in us right.</p>

      <p>"It’s good for them, and for us. We’re not this relegation team every year that everybody seems to think we are.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> risk losing England U20 midfielder Matty Longstaff for just £400,000 unless he signs a new deal in the next month.</p>
      <p>The youngster is in contract talks with Newcastle and is close to agreeing a pay rise as reward for becoming a first team player this season – including scoring the Goal of the Month winner against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Longstaff junior plays in Portugal for England youth this week in a game that will attract European sides knowing he can be pinched for minimal compensation because his deal ends this season.</p>

      <p>Both brothers, however, are keen to stay on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>Sean signed a new deal until 2022 last December before his first team breakthrough, and he wants another to reflect his emergence as a regular starter.</p>
      <p>But Newcastle chiefs will not match his representatives demands to become one of the top earners, and want him to prove himself again this season before continuing talks.</p>
