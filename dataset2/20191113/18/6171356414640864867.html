      <h1>Android backups to Google Drive have been disabled on many phones for months — no proper fix in sight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:12:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/rita/" target="_blank">Rita El Khoury</a></address>
      <p>For over nine months now, Android users have been complaining about an issue with backups to Google Drive. The phone simply stops backing up data without a warning and the only workaround available isn't sustainable, while the only potential fix requires some adb commands. Google has yet to acknowledge or address the problem.</p>
      <p>The bug affects both Android 9 and 10 devices, across all manufacturers from Google to Samsung, Moto, OnePlus, Huawei, and more. It's very widespread and not linked to G Suite accounts, multiple or single accounts on a device, or a specific security patch.</p>
      <p>Under your phone's <i>Settings &gt; System &gt; Backup</i>, you should see the feature enabled, but even then, some users notice that the <i>Back up now</i> button is greyed out and inaccessible, while all data categories say they're <i>Waiting to back up</i>. If you see this, your phone isn't making any backups and you were probably never alerted to the issue.</p>

      <p>If you decide to go this route, remember, it's a temporary workaround. You should immediately re-enable your phone's security method afterwards, and yes, that means, you'll lose the ability to back up again, until you repeat the steps.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-8/how-to/guide-google-backup-waiting-to-backup-t3895101">XDA forum post from January</a> mentions a better long-term fix that doesn't require you to disable lockscreen security, but needs adb (and may also require clearing Google Drive app data). With a couple of commands, you get backups again.</p>
      <p>For now, these are your only "solutions" for Google Drive backups on Android 9 and 10. Given that the issue has been reported for nearly a year and not acknowledged, there's little hope that a proper fix will soon be available. We've reached out to Google, asking if it's aware of the problem or working on a solution, but haven't heard back. We'll update this post if we do.</p>
