      <p>It’s already been a monumental year for triumphant big-screen homecomings, but <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482322/frozen-ii-is-earth-shatteringly-great-according-to-jonathan-groff">the best may be yet to come</a>. <i>Frozen</i> is one of Disney’s most beloved films and a sequel is coming in a little over a week. <i>Frozen II</i> will once again follow sisters Anna and Elsa on an epic adventure full of catchy music and empowering messages.</p>
      <p>The film’s star Kristen Bell recently talked about how proud she was of the original film’s themes on self love and familial love over <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484402/why-frozen-iis-princesses-wear-pants">Disney princesses</a>’ typical leaning into the romantic. For <i>Frozen II</i>, here’s what she’s most excited for audiences to latch on to:</p>
      <blockquote>The thing I think I’m proudest of the way that they represented Kristoff. In the first one, it’s like two females, it’s great. But in the second movie Kristoff has a song that is going to blow your mind, sung by Jonathan Groff. It’s called ‘Lost in the Woods’ and it’s about his big feelings for Anna. Little boys don’t often see representation of other boys having really big loving feelings. And there’s a line in the song that says ‘You feel your feelings and your feelings are real.’</blockquote>
      <p>So often do we talk about the two-dimensional representation of women in past Disney movies, we forget the men could use a little added depth as well. The other half of iconic Disney couples are often strong princes oozing with valor and suave. How often do they longingly sing about their strong feelings of love? Even if they are part of a love story, their big solo songs are often about their personal journeys such as <i>Hercules</i>’ “Go the Distance” or <i>Aladdin</i>’s “One Jump Ahead” not their ladies. Now things are changing with Kristoff’s upcoming song titled “Lost in the Woods”.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Groff’s Kristoff sounds like he’s finally getting a huge moment in <i>Frozen II</i>. The Tony-nominated, Broadway talent known for starring in the original casts for <i>Spring Awakening</i> and <i>Hamilton</i> finally has a full-length song in the sequel! His debut six years ago only gave him <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478927/frozen-iis-kristen-bell-shares-her-one-critique-from-the-original">40 second diddy “Reindeers Are Better Than People” and it just wasn’t enough</a>! Kristen Bell couldn’t help but continue gush about his character. In her words:</p>
      <blockquote>And he also has two lines that I love. Where he rescues Anna at one point and it’s in the midst of battle. And he looks at her and the first thing he says is ‘I’m here, what do you need?’ He doesn’t say ‘Stand back, I’ve got this.’ I stood up when I first saw it. Do you know how profound that line is? And then in the end Anna apologizes for something and he says ‘It’s ok my love is not fragile.’</blockquote>
      <p>Whoa! These exchanges between <i>Frozen</i>’s cute couple Anna and Kristoff sound monumental. The sequel seems to be representing a healthy and mature relationship in the film that is rooted in them being equals and having strong and true love for one another! It certainly helps that the two have been together for much longer than most Disney couples.

      <p>Kristen Bell’s words to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8blLj7xQBxI"><i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i></a> add to the already big hype for <i>Frozen II</i>! Ahead of the film’s release, critics have <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484270/frozen-ii-has-screened-see-what-people-are-saying">highly praised the film</a>, some calling it better, darker and more complex than the original. At the box office, the movie is also tracking higher than the 2013 classic, with an <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483630/frozen-ii-poised-to-do-better-than-frozen-at-the-box-office">expected $100 million opening weekend</a> on its hands.</p>
