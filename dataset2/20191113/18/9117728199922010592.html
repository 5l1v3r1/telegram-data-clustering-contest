        <b>We're now at the back-end of the 2019 F1 season.<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton"> Lewis Hamilton</a> wrapped up the championship last time out, but races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi continue to offer points. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> is in a battle with both <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> drivers <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/charles-leclerc">Charles Leclerc</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> for third place. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tom Coronel believes only a victory will really count for Verstappen. The Dutchman has recorded good results at Interlagos and one of those stand-out results came in 2016. Verstappen finished on the podium after a frantic race in the rain. Coronel knows previous results like this gives the Aston Martin Red Bull Racing driver a boost. </p>

      <p><i>"First of all, he (Verstappen) himself is already very positive so you are already going there with a good feeling. That is because of the past years and we know that both Max and the car are going well on the circuit. Also the circuit really radiates motorsport out, there is a good vibe and that has to give energy. If you add everything together, it looks good,"</i> Coronel told Motorsport. </p>
      <p><i>"Ultimately, Formula 1 is all about results and the points that are awarded on Sunday. According to the WTCR driver, a podium should not be the goal, but a win: “He smells a victory every time. I think a podium is normal these days. If he doesn't make it, you have to ask yourself what went wrong. He and the team want more, especially with next year. For that, you want to give a few ticks and that is possible in Brazil,"</i> with which he means a victory.</p>
