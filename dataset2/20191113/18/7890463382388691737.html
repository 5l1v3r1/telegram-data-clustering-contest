      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 PC update promises Nvidia stuttering fixes and free stuff</h1>

        <b>Red Dead Redemption 2 is great on PC – when it’s working correctly. Unfortunately, it’s been a pretty rough launch for a lot of players, and while several <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2/Rdr2-pc-patch">improvements and patches</a> recently, not everything is up to snuff just yet. Rockstar has <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1194669204802281476">issued a statement</a> on the continued issues, and it looks like some specific fixes for stuttering problems are set to land very soon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rockstar says it believes these stuttering issues are “due to unforeseen issues related to specific combinations of Nvidia graphics drivers, Nvidia GPU cards, and certain CPUs. We will be rolling out an update to the game today which will address the stuttering issue alongside a host of other fixes.”</p>
      <p>However, today’s update will not be a total fix, as Rockstar says it’s “currently working together with Nvidia to completely resolve the stuttering issue in a future update, and it may take us up to a few days to properly test everything and ensure the next update completely solves the problem.”</p>
      <p>In a “show of gratitude to our PC fans,” anybody who plays RDR2 on PC into the holidays will get a handful of free items for Red Dead Online, including a Prieto Poncho and “an assortment of provisions and ammo.”</p>
