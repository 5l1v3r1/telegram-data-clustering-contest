      <p>The student body president at the University of Florida is facing impeachment after he used student fees to book Donald Trump Jr. and Trump campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle to campus.</p>
      <p>The student body president, Michael Murphy, was served with a formal resolution for his impeachment on Tuesday afternoon for agreeing to pay the duo $50,000 for the event, which took place last month, according to the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i>. The resolution had more than 100 students and alumni signatures on it.</p>
      <p>Those who are pushing for Murphy's impeachment argue that using the student fees to pay <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lions-den-don-trump-jr-abandons-book-event-after-being-drowned-out-by-angry-supporters">Trump and Guilfoyle</a> was a misuse of funds because they are now allowed to use that money to support or oppose a "political party at any level." They point to Murphy's correspondence with a Trump fundraising consultant as evidence that he was trying to plan and promote the event for partisan reasons, which was first <a href="https://www.alligator.org/news/emails-released-between-student-body-president-and-donald-trump-campaign/article_7dad41f0-fb7a-11e9-9b4f-3795b8d7df23.html">reported</a> by the university's student paper, <i>The Alligator</i>.</p>
      <p>“By using student fees to advance his own expressed political beliefs at the expense of the … Student Government writ large, Mr. Murphy not only endangered students marginalized by the speakers’ white nationalist supporters, but also abused his power to advance a particular political party at the expense of the students he should represent,” the impeachment resolution <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6547791-Michael-Murphy-Impeachment-Resolution.html">states</a>.</p>
      <p>Murphy has also faced scrutiny for his political leanings and how that played a role in his actions. He has posted photos on social media at Trump events in Washington, D.C., and his father, Dan Murphy, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/?data_type=processed&amp;committee_id=C00580100&amp;contributor_employer=BGR+group&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2020">donated $5,600</a> to Trump’s campaign this year.</p>
      <p>He has maintained that the event was not a campaign event, thus not violating any rules, and has pointed out that he tried getting Sen. Bernie Sanders to speak on campus, but he declined.</p>
