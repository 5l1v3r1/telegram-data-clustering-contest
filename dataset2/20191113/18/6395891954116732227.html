      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Massachusetts residents can now have a non-binary gender designation on state driver's licenses.</p>
      <p>The state's Registry of Motor Vehicles says it now recognizes three gender designations: "male," "female," and "non-binary."</p>
      <p>The change took effect Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to the state Department of Transportation, those designations are available for new credentials, renewals and amendments of licenses and IDs.</p>
      <p>
        <i>&gt;&gt; Previous: <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/massachusetts/bill-allows-non-traditional-gender-designation-on-state-ids/942296235">Bill allows non-traditional gender designation on state IDs</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>Massachusetts joins several other states that have legalized gender-neutral license designations including California, Maine and Idaho.</p>
      <p>Massachusetts Senate President Karen Spilka, an Ashland Democrat, called the development "an important step towards letting people be who they are."</p>
      <p>The addition of the non-binary designation was folded into the second phase of the state's registry system upgrade which took place last weekend.</p>
