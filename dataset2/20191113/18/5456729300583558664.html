      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:16:18+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/video/362762-video-sss-officers-shoot-to-disperses-unarmed-peaceful-protesters.html" target="_blank">Mohammed Lere</a></address>
      <p>Despite video and photo evidence of its officers’ brutality against protesters and journalists on Tuesday, the State Security Service has claimed it conducted itself as a “professional and responsible organisation.”</p>
      <p>Peter Afunanya, a spokesperson for the SSS, said in an email Wednesday afternoon that operatives initially allowed the protesters to gather, but intervened when attempts were made to breach its facility.</p>
      <p>“As a normal global security practice, the operatives stood in defence of their facility when some group of persons made unruly attempts to forcefully break into the place and effect the release of Omoyele Sowore,” the SSS claimed.</p>
