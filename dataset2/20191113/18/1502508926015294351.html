      <h1>Prices of copper, other metals slip after Trump's tariff threat to China</h1>
      <h2>While Trump said in a speech that a phase-one trade deal was close, the market focused on his comments about raising tariffs on Chinese goods</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:24:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Onstad | Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The price of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/copper">copper </a>and other base metals slipped on Wednesday, after US President Donald Trump threatened more tariffs on China, disappointing inve­stors keen on a trade deal.</p>
      <p>While Trump said in a speech that a phase-one trade deal was close, the market focused on his comments about raising tariffs on Chinese goods “very substantially” if a deal failed to be agreed upon.</p>
      <p>“It raised the level of uncertainty again, coming at a time when the market’s been in risk-on, happy-days mode for the past month,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>“If you look at copper, it’s breaking down a bit. We’ve had this uptrend since the start of October, but we failed to break above $6,000 and the 200-day moving average.”</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/copper">copper </a>touched $6,011 a tonne, the highest in more than three months, after gaining about 8 per cent since the start of October. Hansen said traders were focusing on support at $5,800, a key technical level.</p>
      <p>Three-month <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/copper">copper </a>on the London Metal Exchange (LME) shed 0.3 per cent to $5,850 a tonne in official open-outcry trading after touching $5,830, the lowest since November 1. It was on track to fall for a fourth straight session.</p>
