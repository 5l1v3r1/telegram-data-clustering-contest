      <h1>'Why don’t we just build a big-ass chicken?': Small Georgia town plans to build world record rooster</h1>

      <p>A small town in Georgia hopes the construction of an enormous topiary chicken will help it gobble up tourism.</p>
      <p>Work is underway in Fitzgerald, a town of about 8,700, to construct a monstrous 62-foot rooster that will cost $150,000, use at least 16 tons of steel, and feature an apartment inside its body cavity that can be rented out to visitors.</p>
      <p>The project is Fitzgerald Mayor Jim Puckett’s idea. Puckett <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-town-in-georgia-has-big-plans-for-an-enormous-chicken-11573663155">told</a> the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> that he found unused special tax funds and decided on a bold move to lure tourists to the shrinking town.</p>
      <p>“I was thinking about it,” he said, “and thought, ‘Why don’t we just build a big-ass chicken?’”</p>
      <p>Although the initial plan was to build the verdant fowl 57-feet tall — in a nod to Marietta, Georgia, whose non-topiary chicken structure stands 56-feet tall — Puckett said he wanted to go bigger after learning that the world record for largest topiary structure belongs to a 59-foot Mickey Mouse in Dubai.</p>
      <p>“When I heard that I said, ‘Screw it, let’s go to 62-feet,’” he explained.</p>
      <p>Why a chicken? In the 1960s, Georgia stocked a forest near the town with wildfowl from South Asia as a way to promote game hunting. Although many of those birds died out, a few found their way to Fitzgerald and interbred with the local chickens. Their population is now in the hundreds, and they are a staple feature of the small town.</p>
      <p>Residents in Fitzgerald, located about 155 miles south of Atlanta, have mixed reactions to the bushy bird.</p>
      <p>Paul Dunn, 90, said he hopes the plan can bring vitality to the town, which has about 39% of its residents living in poverty.</p>
      <p>“It’s something different,” Dunn mused. “Fitzgerald needs rejuvenating. It’s drying up on the stem.”</p>
      <p>Dunn’s neighbor, 26-year-old Justin Phillips, said that the structure was “stupid” and a “waste of money.”</p>
      <p>“Nobody’s coming to Fitzgerald to see a giant chicken,” Phillips said.</p>
      <p>Puckett is taking any criticism in stride. He said that at least he is working toward the goal of revitalizing the small town.</p>
      <p>“You may not like everything I do as mayor, but you damn sure aren’t going to be able to say I didn’t do anything,” Puckett said.</p>
