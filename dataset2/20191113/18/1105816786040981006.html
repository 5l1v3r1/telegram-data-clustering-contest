      <h1>PML-N rejects govt’s ‘conditional permission’ for Nawaz to travel abroad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:13:33+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/7761/news-2/" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>PML-N Information Secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that the party had rejected the government’s “conditional permission” to Nawaz Sharif for travelling abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>The reaction came after Law Minister Farogh Naseem and Adviser to PM on Accountability Shahzad Akbar announced that the “one time” permission for four weeks is subject to the Sharif family submitting an indemnity bond “to the tune of Rs7-7.5 billion”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif has called a meeting of the party’s senior leadership on Thursday to devise a future strategy.</p>
      <p>According to the party spokesperson, the leadership will be taken into confidence over the future strategy in response to the government’s decision.</p>
      <p>Marriyum termed the government’s move of setting a condition to take Nawaz’s name off the no-fly list as “political victimisation and [Prime Minister] Imran Khan’s biased attitude”.</p>

      <p>“All legal and constitutional obligations were met at the time of [Nawaz’s] bail and surety bonds were also submitted to the court,” she said, adding that government is not above the court.</p>
      <p>“On one hand, the government is accepting the seriousness of Nawaz’s health and on the other, it is creating hurdles in his treatment abroad,” the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Shehbaz will hold an important press conference on Thursday at 3pm after the party’s meeting, she added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the former premier had refused to travel abroad for his medical treatment under the conditions proposed by the government.</p>
      <p>He was shifted from Kot Lakhpat jail to the hospital last month after his personal physician Dr Adnan Khan raised an alarm over his deteriorating health.</p>
      <p>The PML-N president had then submitted a request to the Interior Ministry as well as National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for the removal of Nawaz’s name from the ECL so that the PML-N supremo could travel abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>He was granted bail by the Lahore High Court, whereas his sentence was suspended by the Islamabad High Court for eight weeks on medical grounds.</p>
