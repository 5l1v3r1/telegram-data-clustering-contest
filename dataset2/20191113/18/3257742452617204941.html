      <p>Developers taking part in the test program can acquire the new build via the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Center</a>, or as an over-the-air update on enrolled devices. Participants in the public <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple Beta Software Program</a> can typically expect a similar beta update to be issued shortly after the developer versions. <br/><br/>The second beta build for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/macos">macOS</a> Catalina 10.15.2 follows Apple's release of the first beta, which landed on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/apple-releases-first-beta-for-macos-catalina-10152">November 7</a>. <br/><br/>For that build, the main addition related to how it handled HTTP Strict protections, including making certain top-level domains like .dev and .app part of the Foundation URLSession and NSURLConnection HTTP Strict Transport Security preload list. Apps that take advantage of URLSession to visit a matching URL will do so by using the https:// prefix, rather than the less secure http://, and never does so as cleartext. <br/><br/>At this stage, it is unknown what changes Apple has made in the second beta. <br/><br/>Both <i>AppleInsider</i> and Apple itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/04/dont-run-the-ios-12-macos-1014-mojave-betas-if-you-value-your-data">strongly recommend</a> users don't install the betas on to "mission-critical" or primary devices, as there is the remote possibility of data loss or other issues. Instead, testers should install betas onto secondary or non-essential devices, and to make sure there are sufficient backups of important data before updating.<br/><br/><i>Find any changes in the new betas?
