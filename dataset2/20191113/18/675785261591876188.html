      <h1>Danny Rose admits he never realised how much Liverpool fans 'dislike' Raheem Sterling</h1>
      <h2>Sterling was constantly booed by Liverpool supporters during his side's 3-1 defeat at Anfield on Sunday and Rose said he was surprised by the level of animosity</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:41:27+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham full-back Danny Rose said he was taken aback by the reception Raheem Sterling received from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> supporters in Manchester City's game against the current league leaders on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sterling left the Reds to join City in 2015 after turning down a new contract.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has gone on to win two Premier League titles and become one of the best players in the country, labelled by some as the Three Lions most important player.</p>
      <p>Sterling received a hostile reaction from the Anfield faithful on Sunday as the Premier League title chasers did battle, with Liverpool running out 3-1 winners.</p>
      <p>And Rose believes the abuse may have indirectly influenced Sterling's confrontation with Joe Gomez on Monday, which has led to him being dropped from the England squad.</p>

      <p>"It's probably the first time I have sat back and actually realised and took note of how much the Liverpool fans dislike him," Rose said speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50404849">BBC Radio 5 Live.</a></p>
      <p>"I take that for granted whenever I'm watching Raheem.</p>
      <p>"I think he just gets on with it and maybe it had a part to play in whatever happened."</p>

      <p>Sterling will play no part in England's European Championship qualifier against Montenegro on Thursday following the altercation with Gomez, but Rose insists the squad have already put the fight behind them.</p>
      <p>"We have moved on," he added. "You know the media and everyone will have their fun today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"But I hope it can be put to bed as soon as possible because obviously Joe is- and I'm not just saying this - one of the nicest people I have come across in football.</p>
      <p>"He won't want this to fester and Raheem won't want this to fester.</p>
      <p>"Obviously I'd like to think that everybody knows if I ever played against them, then my will to win for my team will always override any friendships or relationships.</p>
      <p>"But when I come here for England it is all put to one side."</p>
