      <h1>Nottingham Forest tipped to miss out on promotion to Premier League by the smallest margin</h1>
      <h2>Latest Nottingham Forest news | The Reds are in fifth place in the Sky Bet Championship table going into the final international break of the calendar year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will feel in confident mood going into the November international break.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Reds </a>beat arch rivals Derby County 1-0 at the City Ground at the weekend to enter the two-week hiatus in fifth place in the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi’s side are three points outside of the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfers-january-latest-3534689">automatic promotion places</a> with a game in hand, with Leeds United and Preston North End currently occupying the top two spots in the table.</p>
      <p>So could this be the year that Forest finally get promoted and return to the Premier League?</p>
      <p>Respected statistics and analysis website<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/"> <u>FiveThirtyEight</u></a> has forecast the final standings in the Sky Bet Championship this season, based on a complex model which takes into account a host of factors.</p>
      <p>They have crunched the numbers and are predicting that Forest will finish in seventh place in the final standings, and narrowly miss out on the play-offs.</p>
      <p>The prediction has tipped the Reds to accumulate 71 points, level on points with Swansea City who are predicted to finish sixth.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the prediction also says that both teams will finish with a plus-eight goal difference, which would imply that Swansea score more goals than Forest over the course of the season, in order to end up above the Reds in the table.</p>
