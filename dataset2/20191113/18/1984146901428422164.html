      <p>This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby broke down in tears on air as her co-star Eva Speakman revealed her history of domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/holly-willoughby">Holly</a> and Phillip Schofield, therapist Eva admitted that she still found it hard to talk about the abuse.</p>
      <p>Talking about an unnamed ex-boyfriend, Eva said that she felt "shame and guilt" for allowing the abuse to happen.</p>
      <p>The life coach also revealed that only recently told her mother about the abuse, and that she had "lied all the way through" the relationship to her family.</p>
      <p>She said: “It was most definitely grooming in that there is a gift and validation of being loved.</p>
      <p>“Having been bullied at school and having low self esteem I think that made me more vulnerable and more needy.</p>
      <p>“I’d probably become somewhat desensitised to verbal abuse.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phillip-schofield">Host Phil</a> asked: “What was being said? How did it progress?”</p>
      <p>She replied: “It progressed to being made to feel that I was stupid. That I shouldn’t be speaking to certain people.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of control, which I didn’t realise at the time.”</p>

      <p>Eva, who was joined by her now-husband Nik Speakman, then admitted that she knew he was going to violent by "a look on his face".</p>
      <p>She said: “There was a look, and I knew that if that look came about then I’d have to be really careful.”</p>
      <p>Recalling a harrowing moment that took place in public, she said: “I was talking to my friends, having a really good time and I got the look.</p>
      <p>“I felt a little bit brave because I was with people I trusted.</p>
      <p>“I asked the question ‘what was that look for?’ And then I got headbutted three times.</p>
      <p>“I remember hitting the deck, I think I hit the bar, and then I remember excruciating pain that I have never felt before.</p>
      <p>“And even though there was so much pain physically, and I was really frightened, I felt shame again because people had seen this.”</p>
      <p>After being taken to hospital by her cousin, Eva revealed that she tried to beg her cousin not to tell her parents.</p>
      <p>But after realising that something needed to be done, she decided that she needed to open up about the abuse.</p>
      <p>The violent ex-broke her father’s nose for not allowing him to see Eva after she had left the hospital.</p>
      <p>Eva said: “You can hurt me but you don’t hurt my family. That made me say ‘enough’."</p>
      <p>Eva also revealed an incident where her ex smashed the windows of her car while she was inside.</p>
      <p>The life coach managed to escape the situation after driving to her parents house with the smashed up car.</p>
      <p>She admitted that her ex became furious purely because she had spoken to somebody, leaving him ‘embarrassed and ashamed’.</p>
      <p>Holly praised Eva for opening up about her past, saying: “You are so brave. I’m full of admiration for you.”</p>
      <p>Asked what advice she would give to people going through an abusive relationship, she said: “There is no shame in this, you are the victim not the perpetrator.</p>
      <p>“One in four women face some sort of abuse or violence. You have to talk it through, you have to realise that it’s not your fault."</p>
