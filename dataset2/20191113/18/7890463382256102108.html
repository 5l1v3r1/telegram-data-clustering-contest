      <h1>Rare will reportedly unveil a new third-person adventure IP at X019</h1>

        <b>Microsoft’s X019 event this week promises a veritable font of news for Xbox Game Studios titles across the console and Windows PCs. Stuff like the <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/age-of-empires-4/gameplay-reveal">Age of Empires 4 gameplay reveal</a> have been heavily hinted for the show, and it looks like there are some surprises in store, too – including the debut of a brand-new IP from Rare.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rare’s new game “a third-person adventure game based on a totally original IP,” according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/rares-scarlett-adventure-game-will-be-announced-at-x019/">VGC</a>, and is “still several years away from release” – so expect to see the console version on the next-gen Scarlett platform. VGC’s report is by Andy Robinson – who previously worked at Playtonic among many former Rare staffers – and comes in the wake of a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1194646580919459842">tweet</a> from analyst Daniel Ahmad, who also says “new IP from Obsidian and Rare” will debut at the show.</p>
      <p>We’ve got details on <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/x019-how-to-watch-inside-xbox-stream">how to watch Microsoft’s Inside Xbox event at X019</a> on November 14, which is where you should expect all the big news to debut. Ahmad also says we’ll get firm 2020 release dates for titles like Bleeding Edge, Minecraft Dungeons, and Wasteland 3 as part of the show.</p>
      <p>Rare has already confirmed plans for a new IP in <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/rare-happy-to-see-battletoads-return-but-focused-on-new-ip/">various interviews</a> over the past couple of years, but this will be the first official look at the new project. (Here’s hoping for a colourful new <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-platform-games">platform game</a> to fill the void that Banjo-Kazooie has left behind.)</p>
      <p>X019 is set to bring details on 12 upcoming first-party titles, so stick with us for all the news as it comes through.</p>
