      <h1>Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, and Archie Will Be Spending Christmas With Her Mom, Not the Royal Family</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:56:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey , Carolyn Durand</a></address>
      <p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be spending Archie's first Christmas with Meghan's mother Doria Ragland, not the royal family, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's spokesperson confirmed in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month," the spokesperson said. "Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchessâ€™ mother Doria Ragland. This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen."</p>
      <p>The statement did not specify whether the family would celebrate the holiday at Meghan and Harry's home in Windsor, England or if they would spend it in Los Angeles, where Ragland is based.</p>
      <p>It's not unusual for royal family members to take a year away from the Queen's festivities at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, to spend Christmas with their other side of the family.</p>
      <p>For example, when they aren't with the Queen at Sandringham, Kate Middleton and Prince William spend their holidays with the Middleton family in Bucklebury. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last spent Christmas with the Middletons in 2016. Kensington Palace has not confirmed the family's plans for 2019.</p>
