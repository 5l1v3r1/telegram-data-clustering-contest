      <h1>Pelosi to Democrats: 'We need to have a common narrative'</h1>

      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told fellow Democrats ahead of Wednesday’s impeachment hearings to stick to a uniform narrative in response to media questions.</p>
      <p>“This is a very serious event in our country,” the California lawmaker told Democrats Wednesday morning in a closed-door meeting. “We wish it could have been avoided. None of us came here to impeach a president. All of us take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, but as I just said, we’re legislating at the same time.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi coached Democrats on messaging about President Trump, who the party accuses of abusing the office of the presidency and obstructing Congress.</p>
      <p>Pelosi told Democrats, Trump “must be held accountable, he is not above the law. No president is. And we have a responsibility to make sure that that is the message, not only for today but for the ages.”</p>
      <p>Democrats plan two weeks of public hearings featuring many of the witnesses deposed in closed-door sessions by a special impeachment panel.</p>
      <p>Pelosi said she had asked Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, who is overseeing the impeachment proceedings, to provide Democrats with “a narrative at the end about a summation of what happened there.”</p>
      <p>She warned Democrats to “not to get distracted” if Republicans disrupt the hearings. “The press will say, ‘What do you think of the Republicans doing this?’ They don’t think so I don’t think about what they think, but I do think that we need to have a common narrative.”</p>
