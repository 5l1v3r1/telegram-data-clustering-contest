      <h1>Fortnite update v11.11: What's new in the Fortnite patch notes?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:39:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/joseph-knoop/" target="_blank">Joseph Knoop</a></address>
      <p>What's in the latest Fortnite patch notes 11.11? Epic Games is no longer a fan of publishing detailed patch notes, which makes our job a bit tougher, but that doesn't mean we can't keep you in the loop.Â </p>
      <p>We've scoured the company's Trello board to get you all the latest information and give you a head start against your battle royale rivals. Also thanks to leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX">@HYPEX</a> we could be getting a Black Friday skins sale, new music packs, and a fresh search menu. Here's everything we can glean about the latest Fortnite update.</p>
      <h3>What's new?</h3>
      <p>Fortnite's item and skin locker (that felt weird to type) is getting a <b>search function</b>, so you no longer need to scroll through your collection of faux military garb and banana peels. Simply search for the item name and it'll pop up. You can even filter by item type.</p>
      <p><b>Grenade stack sizes</b> are also getting a significant reduction. Previously, grenades stacked to 10, which some players found pretty ludicrous when they were getting endlessly pelted with explosive ordinance. Grenades now only stack to six.</p>
      <p>An <b>updated match stats screen</b> is giving players a more in-depth look at how they performed after a run. Besides typical stats like eliminations and assist counts, you'll also see the various medals and achievements you earned over the course of a match (like lasting until the top 10 players, for example), or how much material you used, to name just a couple. Check out the pic below from Reddit user Daronh for a better look.</p>

      <h3>Preliminary Fortnite patch notes 11.11: expected bug fixes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Due to an issue, disabled Motorboats are disabled in competitive playlists and Tournaments.</li>
        <li>Cosmetic issue: the Kitbash Outfit's head appears to be floating.</li>
        <li>The Magma Wrap looks different than intended.</li>
        <li>Working to resolve an issue in which players who gift the Battle Pass are not granted the associating gift wrap.</li>
        <li><b>Save the world: </b>Fixed issue causing wireframe sphere to appear around some pet Back Blings</li>
        <li><b>Creative: </b>Rarity of the Nightfall Schematic can now be increased</li>
        <li>Fixed issue involving locked missions appearing for some players in Hexsylvania.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fortnite Bandage Bazooka returns?</h3>
      <p>The Bandage Bazooka is one of the more potent boomsticks introduced by Epic as part of Chapter 2, but various issues have seen it pulled from the game. It's not in Epic's Fortnite Trello board of updates and bug fixes, so we can only assume it's still being worked on.</p>
