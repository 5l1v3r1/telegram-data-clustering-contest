      <h1>Northumberland mobile phone mast approved despite concerns over 5G</h1>
      <h2>Concerns were raised about the impact of 5G on people's health, but it was not a planning consideration</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben O'Connell</a></address>
      <p>Fears over the health implications of the 5G mobile network failed to derail plans for a replacement mast at the airport roundabout near <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ponteland">Ponteland</a>.</p>
      <p>A bid to replace an existing mobile phone mast with a new, taller mast, on a site across the A696 from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-international-airport">Newcastle Airport</a> , was unanimously approved by the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/morpeth">Castle Morpeth Local Area Council</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The new monopole will be five metres taller and provide improved 2G, 3G, 4G and new 5G coverage to the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>Despite the height increase, the only reason that it needed planning permission is because it is to be sited 4.5 metres away from the current mast; if it were in the same position, it would be permitted development.</p>
      <p>The committee heard objections from John Blundell and Ian Mclean about the health risks of 5G and claims that it causes cancer and DNA breaks - something which is by no means universally accepted by scientists or medics.</p>
      <p>Ponteland Town Council had also objected, with Coun Alan Hall saying that members did not have expertise in the effects of 5G, but did have 'health and safety' concerns.</p>
      <p>However, planning manager Liz Sinnamon pointed out that the national planning rulebook (the NPPF) makes clear its support for 5G technology.</p>
      <p>She quoted paragraph 112, which says: "Planning policies and decisions should support the expansion of electronic communications networks, including next generation mobile technology (such as 5G) and full fibre broadband connections."</p>
      <p>Coun David Towns said: "The principal objections have very little to do with what we are here to decide. Stopping the national roll-out of 5G is not within the power of this committee.</p>
      <p>"We are being asked to approve this development, not make a moral or medical decision on this."</p>
      <p>Coun Richard Dodd added: "It's away from residential areas and the airport hasn't objected.</p>
      <p>"As a council, we are trying to roll out 5G and improve communications in rural areas."</p>
      <p>Coun Elaine Armstrong agreed that it was 'an ideal location' and that's it needed as 'communication in parts of Ponteland is bad', affecting people trying to run businesses, for example.</p>
