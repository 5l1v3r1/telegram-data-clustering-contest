      <h1>John Cena reveals Tic Tac addiction from WWE days: 'It's pretty much 10,000 calories of straight sugar'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/john-cena-girlfriend-shay-shariatzadeh">John Cena</a> recently confessed to having a Tic Tac addiction during his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe">WWE</a> days.</p>
      <p>The wrestler-turned-actor would go through boxes of the mints before every match, he said during an interview earlier this month on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr_6zzzpa9w&amp;feature=emb_title">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a>.”</p>

      <p>“My thing was always Tic Tacs," he told host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kelly-clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>. "It’s a nervous superstition that I’ve always had before we go on a broadcast, and I’ve had to wean myself off of them because I was up to, like, three boxes a day, and it’s right in the 20 minutes before broadcast."</p>
      <p>“That’s like a child!” Clarkson said.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, it’s pretty much 10,000 calories of straight sugar,” Cena said.</p>

      <p>Cena, 42, said the addiction began as a way to circumvent body odor when stepping into the ring with his opponents.</p>
      <p>“You always want to try to smell your best,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s given a few mulligans in the B.O. and the breath category, but we also have a nice form of policing ourselves, where if somebody has a few more mulligans than he should we kind of give him the old, ‘Hey man, it’s our office out there, could you keep it together?’” Cena explained.</p>

      <p>For more than a decade, Cena was the face of WWE before slowly easing his way out of the ring.
