      <p>A school at the centre of Government legal fight after it was found to have significant structural defects is to be reopened.</p>
      <p>Ardgillan Community College in Dublin is now subject of a remediation plan and will take about two years to rebuild.</p>
      <p>Parents were informed of the plans on Tuesday night by the school principal.</p>

      <p>The building is to be restored and reopened, a senior source said, with the existing steel frame, floors, roof and internal walls to remain in place, with appropriate remediation where necessary, and external walls removed and replaced.</p>
      <p>A programme is now being finalised to complete the design.</p>
      <p>There will be some internal changes to the building, which the school has asked for.</p>
      <p>It was forced to partially close last year after a number of structural defects were found throughout the school and has been using a shared community hall and some facilities at a nearby school ever since to accommodate pupils.</p>

      <p>The Minister for Education and Skills Joe McHugh said on Tuesday that significant improvement has been made on the remediation programme for 40 schools constructed by Western Building Systems (WBS).</p>
      <p>Tyrone-based company WBS, which was contracted to build a number of schools across the state by the Government, is now subject to court proceedings after alleged defects were found in a number of institutions.</p>
      <p>The building company, now facing legal action from the Department of Education, said it will vigorously contest any litigation.</p>
      <p>The department said it continues to liaise with the Chief State Solicitor’s Office and the Attorney General’s Office on the ongoing legal process.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been consistent in saying where responsibility lies, it should be followed up,” Mr McHugh said about the case.</p>
      <p>A programme of work took place during the summer 2019 in relation to the 40 schools in which structural and fire safety deficiencies were identified.</p>
      <p>The department has confirmed about 40 million euro has been spent this year on the remediation programme, covering the cost of investigations, precautionary measures, fire safety upgrades and structural repairs.</p>
