      <p>Iraqi officials must ramp up their response to mass demonstrations demanding an overhaul of the political system, the United Nations' representative in Baghdad told AFP in an exclusive interview Wednesday.<br/><br/>Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, who heads the UN's Iraq mission (UNAMI), said the country's authorities must "step up to the plate and make things happen".<br/><br/>"They are elected by the people, they are accountable to them," she said.<br/><br/>The UN has put forward a phased roadmap, backed by the country's top Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, calling for an immediate end to violence, electoral reform and anti-graft measures within two weeks.<br/><br/>That would be followed by constitutional amendments and infrastructure legislation within three months.<br/><br/>Hennis-Plasschaert discussed the plan with lawmakers on the sidelines of a parliamentary session on Wednesday, telling them: "now is the time to act, otherwise any momentum will be lost -- lost at a time when many, many Iraqis demand concrete results."<br/><br/>Protests broke out in Baghdad and the country's Shiite-majority south in early October over rampant corruption, lack of jobs and notoriously poor services.<br/><br/>Protesters have escalated their demands to deep-rooted regime change, but political forces have rallied in recent days to prop up the government of Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi.<br/><br/>Politicians closed ranks following a series of meetings with top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, an extremely influential figure who often brokers deals among Iraq's fractured political class.<br/><br/>Hennis-Plasschaert told AFP on Wednesday she did not seek to be a counter-weight to Iranian influence but said she feared "spoilers" could prevent progress.<br/><br/>"This country unfortunately knows many actors, external, internal, that could act as spoilers (and) undermine the legitimate demands of the people," she said.</p>
