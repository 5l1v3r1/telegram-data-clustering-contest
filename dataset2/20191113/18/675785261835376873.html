      <p>The reality TV scarlet, 31, blamed social media for "destroying our generations ability to be truly happy" and slammed unrealistic images of perfection posted to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Queen of the jungle shared a duo of snaps with an iconic before and after comparison.</p>
      <p>In the first, she dazzled on the red carpet at last month's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pride-of-britain-awards">Pride Of Britain Awards</a> and another image of her the next morning as she went make-up free and pulled a funny face.</p>

      <p>She shared the lengthy post with her 4.4 millions followers.</p>
      <p>Vicky wrote: "Unpopular Opinion: I think social media has absolutely destroyed our generations ability to be truly happy.</p>

      <p>After admitting how scrolling on the app made her feel it, Vicky said it was a "shame" and a "real waste" as the service could be "an international support system of people motivating each other".</p>
      <p>The telly star encouraged users to change their ways and show "their truth, their vulnerability and their authentic self" instead of posting filtered pictures to hide insecurities.</p>
      <p>Vicky finished her heartfelt post by touching on mental health.</p>
      <p>She penned:"You're telling people that it’s OK to not be perfect, to struggle sometimes, to feel pain, to not be OK.</p>
      <p>"So this is me, showing you a little glimpse behind the glamour... my silly truth after the pride of Britain the other week.</p>
      <p>"Sending lots of love and positivity to anyone reading this. You are beautiful, you are worthy, you are more than a Valencia filter, you are enough."</p>
