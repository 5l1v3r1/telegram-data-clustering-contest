      <p>Coldplay have teamed up with the studio behind Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep for their new music video.</p>
      <p>The band unveiled a sneak peek of their collaboration with Aardman Animations with a teaser trailer on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The video, for Coldplay’s new song Daddy, is “an atmospheric journey through a girl’s fragmented memory about her father”.</p>

      <p>Directed by Aardman’s Asa Lucander, it uses live-action puppetry, digitally painted sets and 2D animation to create a tapestry of styles that symbolise the girl’s memories of her dad.</p>
      <p>The clip shared online shows a girl riding a giant fish across the sky.</p>
      <p>Lucander said: “It was such an honour to direct this video for Coldplay.</p>
      <p>“The first time I listened to the track it spoke to me on a deep level – I immediately started to imagine storylines and images formed in my mind’s eye.</p>
      <p>“When this happens, you know you’re on to something very special.</p>
      <p>“I’m often drawn to emotional stories and I knew very quickly that this was one I wanted to tell.”</p>

      <p>Daddy is the fifth track on Coldplay’s eighth album, Everyday Life.</p>
      <p>The band’s creative director Phil Harvey said: “Daddy isn’t a single in the traditional sense but we always wanted to make a video for it as the song feels like a story within itself.</p>
      <p>“Asa and her team have done an incredible job in bringing the story to life.”</p>
      <p>The full music video for Daddy will premiere shortly after the album’s release on November 22.</p>
