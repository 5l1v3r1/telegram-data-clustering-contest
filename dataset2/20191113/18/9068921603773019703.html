      <p>Luca Maestri is a senior vice president at Apple and the company's chief financial officer, reporting directly to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>. He oversees Apple's accounting, business support, financial planning and analysis, treasury, M&amp;A, investor relations, internal audits, and tax functions at Apple. <br/><br/>The Andrea Bocelli Foundation's goal is to empower people and communities in situations of poverty, illiteracy, distress due to illness, and social exclusion by promoting and supporting national and international projects that aim to overcome these barriers. <br/><br/>The current bid on the lunch with Maestri is at $10,500, and its estimated value is $50,000. The auction will end on December 5 at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time. <br/><br/>Apple CEO ‌Tim Cook‌ in past years has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/16/tim-cook-2017-charitybuzz-auction-ends/">done charity lunches</a> facilitated by Charitybuzz to earn money for the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights, but the last one was held in 2017. That auction earned $680,000.</p>
