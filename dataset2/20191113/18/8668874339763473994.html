      <h1>Gatland names nailed-on 2021 Lions and they're mostly Englishmen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:08:05+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:08</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> head coach Warren Gatland has suggested that his squad to face world champions <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in the 2021 Lions tour could be loaded full of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> players.</p>
      <p>Speaking to 2009 Lions tourist <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/watch-ugo-monye-takes-worcester-warriors-jack-singleton-commentary-box/">Ugo Monye</a> on BBC Radio 5 Live, the Kiwi listed <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/jamie-george/">Jamie George</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/maro-itoje/">Maro Itoje</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/anthony-watson/">Anthony Watson</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/manu-tuilagi/">Manu Tuilagi</a> as the five players that are definitely going to be picked.</p>
      <p>This may not come as a surprise to many after the sensational <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> that many of those players had, which saw the 21-year-old flanker Curry nominated for World Rugby player of the year.</p>
      <p>This is obviously a position that no coach wants to be put under, as so much can happen in the next year-and-a-half before the series begins, but the longtime <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach is clearly an admirer of the squad that Eddie Jones has assembled.</p>

      <p>A number of the current England squad have already toured with the Lions, but the emergence of the likes of Curry and his back-row partner <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/sam-underhill/">Sam Underhill</a> since 2017, as well as the form of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/george-ford/">George Ford</a> in Japan, means the 2021 Lions could be another fruitful tour for England’s players.</p>
      <p>Gatland was also full of praise of Scotland’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/stuart-hogg/">Stuart Hogg</a> and Ireland’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/tadhg-furlong/">Tadhg Furlong</a>, suggesting they are both guaranteed to take on the three-time RWC winners. He of course said that his captain Alun-Wyn Jones is likely to go, as is winger Josh Adams. However, he also listed 22-year-old blindside flanker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/aaron-wainwright/">Aaron Wainwright</a> as a player who could provide an x-factor to the Lions.</p>
      <p>This was a breakthrough tournament for the Dragons loose forward, and it looks like he will be a feature of the Wales pack for years to come. The prospect of him playing alongside <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/sale/players/tom-curry/">Tom Curry</a> is one that will leave all fans in Great Britain excited.</p>
      <p>Of course, Gatland was reluctant to enter into such a discussion, as there is still a lot of rugby to be played before 2021, including two Six Nations.</p>
