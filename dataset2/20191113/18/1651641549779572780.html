      <p>GitHub today announced that official GitHub mobile app is coming to iOS and Android devices. With GitHub for mobile, you can review code, merge changes and share feedback from anywhere. Since GitHub for mobile is built as a native app, it can automatically adapt to different screen sizes, even in dark mode based on your system preferences. GitHub for mobile is available now in beta for iOS and it will be coming soon for Android. You can sign-up for <a href="https://github.com/mobile">GitHub Mobile preview here.</a></p>
      <p>In addition to GitHub for mobile, GitHub today made several big announcements including the general availability of GitHub Actions and Packages, redesigned the notifications experience, new ways to navigate your code on GitHub, a new search experience, two options for distributing work across the team: round robin and load balance, scheduled reminders and more. You can learn about these new features <a href="https://github.blog/2019-11-13-universe-day-one/">here</a>.</p>
