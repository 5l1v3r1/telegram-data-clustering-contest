      <p>On Wednesday, Governor Charlie Baker announced Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Mason as the new superintendent, effective Friday. Mason is a 26-year veteran of the department. </p>
      <p>"At a pivotal time for Massachusetts State Police, Chris Mason has the experience and vision to lead the Department forward with reforms and innovation that will shape its future," said Governor Charlie Baker. </p>
      <p>“I am grateful for the remarkable trust that Governor Baker and his Administration have placed in me,” said Colonel Mason. “I promise to earn that trust every day with the men and women of the Massachusetts State Police who reflect our values of honesty, integrity, and service.  These values are foremost in my mind as we move the Department and our public safety mission forward.” </p>

      <p>Mason, a 26-year veteran of the department, currently serves as a lieutenant colonel and deputy superintendent of the Department of State Police. He also worked for many years as a trooper, sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and commanding officer for the Cape and Islands State Police Detective Unit, where he investigated homicides, sexual assaults, and other violent crimes. </p>
      <p>During Wednesday's announcement, Mason discussed his commitment to modernizing the department, including some initial first steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring all Troop E Internal Affairs investigations are completed, and that the cases for terminated or retired troopers are referred to the State Retirement Board for pension forfeiture consideration if wrongdoing is found;</li>
        <li>Implementing mandatory ethics training for all members, focusing on time and attendance issues and supervisors’ duties;</li>
        <li>Directing the State Police Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity to immediately review options for promoting women and people of color into key positions; and</li>
        <li>Changing the State Police Academy curriculum to rely less on paramilitary training and more on modern policing skills such as empathy, de-escalation, identification of vulnerable populations, and the response to emerging public safety threats.</li>
      </ul>
