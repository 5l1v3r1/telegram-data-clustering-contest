      <h1>Military-Run Media Advises China to Reward Soldiers With Cryptocurrency</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:11:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Cynthia Turcotte</a></address>
      <p>In yet another example of China’s changing view of cryptocurrency, the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) media mouthpiece is calling for its soldiers to be rewarded with crypto to incentivize performance.</p>
      <h3>A Tokenized Rewards and Demerits System</h3>
      <p>A recent article in the military-run <i>PLA Today</i> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3037592/reward-chinese-soldiers-cryptocurrency-military-mouthpiece-says">suggested</a> that some form of cryptocurrency could be used as part of a performance assessment rewards system that would gauge how well soldiers completed tasks, progressed in their training, and other criteria.</p>
      <p>Such a system could “award or deduct tokens according to one’s daily performance and thus generate an objective assessment would effectively energize human resource management,” the article said.</p>
      <p>In addition, several military use-cases for blockchain technology were also proposed to improve information security and logistics.</p>
      <p>One such use-case called for the storing of classified military secrets on a <a href="http://mil-embedded.com/guest-blogs/blockchain-for-embedded-systems/">blockchain-based embedded system</a> that would provide an increased level of encryption and security. This would limit access to documents stored on the system to read-only, meaning that they could be distributed and viewed, but not copied or manipulated.</p>
      <p>It was also suggested that the integration of blockchain technology could improve the accuracy and efficiency of tracking soldiers’ training progress.</p>
      <p>The article cited the example of an electronic shooting range that would automatically detect when a target was hit and generate blockchain records for each trainee. This would “maximize the authenticity of training results” and provide “a technological guarantee to clean and open training and examination.”</p>
      <h3>China’s ‘About-Face’ on Crypto and Blockchain</h3>
      <p>The release of Facebook’s Libra whitepaper back in June lit a fire under the People’s Bank of China, causing them to dramatically speed up the development of its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chinas-cciee-chair-we-will-be-the-first-to-launch-central-bank-digital-currency/">planned central bank digital currency</a>. It was Xi Jinping’s public declaration of the critical importance of blockchain, however, that resulted in a near 180-degree change in the country’s stance on the technology – and, by extension, on cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the 18th Collective Study of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee in China last month, Xi expounded on the importance of blockchain, telling committee members:</p>
      <blockquote>“The integrated application of blockchain plays a critical role in technology innovations and industrial revolutions. Blockchain should be made an essential way and main direction to drive China-led technology innovation. We must increase investments in the blockchain sector, resolve critical technical problems, and accelerate the development of blockchain and industrial innovation.”</blockquote>
      <p>On Monday, less than three weeks after Xi’s speech, an <a href="http://xh.xhby.net/mp3/pc/c/201911/11/c708360.html">editorial</a> published on the front page of China’s state-run <i>Xinhua News Agency website</i> proclaimed Bitcoin to be “the first successful application of blockchain technology.”</p>
