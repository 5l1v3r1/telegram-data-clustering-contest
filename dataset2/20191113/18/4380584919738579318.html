      <h1>Let Chuck D design every baseball stadium</h1>

      <p>Most people know Chuck D as one of the most influential Hip-Hop artists of all time. He formed Public Enemy -- rapping about everything from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj9SeMZE_Yw">civil rights</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FmPskTljo0">Jesus Shuttlesworth</a> to just being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCx5Std7mCo">really, really cool</a>.</p>
      <p>But Chuck D is also a gigantic baseball fan.</p>
      <p>He's been one since his days rooting for the Mets growing up on Long Island. He often sports a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MrChuckD/photos/a.403784153028667/1231586893581718/?type=1&amp;theater">Pirates hat</a> because of his love for Roberto Clemente. He once wrote an ESPN Sunday Night Baseball song that I had no idea about and now <a href="https://slamjamz.com/music/singles/espn-sunday-baseball-theme">can't stop listening to</a>.</p>
      <p>And he also, quite charmingly, has been sketching his own ballparks since he was a little kid. He tweeted a photo of one of his recent creations and it's fantastic.</p>

      <p>I love the crowd heads popping up in front, the hanging, double-decker bleachers and the cozy feeling of it all. You can almost hear vendors screaming about their peanuts and see hitters <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cum4NKXnho">blasting baseballs</a> up and over the rooftops.</p>
      <p>It's no surprise the photo is so good -- not just considering Chuck's baseball fandom, but the fact that he got his <a href="https://alumni.adelphi.edu/au_news/chuck-d-84-13-hon-returns-to-adelphi-to-talk-hip-hop-history-and-getting-his-start-at-adelphi/">B.F.A. degree in graphic design</a>. His work has appeared in <a href="https://gallery30south.com/chuckd/">galleries across the country</a>.</p>
      <p>All of this adds up to the fact that Chuck D should design a baseball stadium, or, if not, every baseball stadium. What does he think of the Marlins removing their giant, weird <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfnZV9KPJ4g">home run sculpture</a> in center field? Does he like domes? And most pressingly, does he have a design he can show the A's in their <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Oakland-A-s-get-help-from-Newsom-for-work-on-14517212.php">years-long search</a> for a new ballpark?</p>
      <p>We're all ears, Chuck.</p>
