      <p>“I was crying. When I arose, I was bouncing with excitement. I had faith that everything was going to be alright.”</p>
      <p>Fury spoke of the importance of his religious beliefs and admitted to a possible psychosis diagnosis by his psychiatrist, who claimed in the book that “without faith, he would have killed himself”.</p>
      <p>Fury added: “At one point I believed I was being tortured by demons. When you’re really mentally unwell, you do see and hear things.”</p>

      <p>Fury also opened up about some of the abuse and mistreatment he has faced as a member of the travelling community.</p>
      <p>He said: “I used to get called disgusting names. I was bullied quite a bit as a kid until I got big and started fighting back.</p>
      <p>“I have been refused entry to pubs and restaurants because I’m a traveller.”</p>
