      <h1>Disney+ has garnered over 10 million sign-ups in one day</h1>
      <h2>I wonder what it will be at tomorrow?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:23:21+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>In only <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/ADDDR">24-hours Disney+</a>, which launched on November 12th, has accumulated more than <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/ADDDR">10 million sign-ups in Canada, the U.S. and the Netherlands.</a></p>
      <p>The fledgling service costs<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-canada-now-available-everything-you-need-to-know/"> $8.99 per month in Canada</a>, <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/ADDDR">but it comes with a free trial</a>, so some of these users could abandon the service after a week. In the U.S, some Verizon subscribers are also eligible to get the service for free for a year.</p>
      <p>That said, it will likely pick up steam as the weeks roll on and it launches in more markets.</p>
      <p>While these are huge numbers, it’s still way behind Netflix’s reported 97 million paying subscribers as of its third-quarter in 2019, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/13/disney-surpasses-10-million-sign-ups-since-launch.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain"><i>CNBC</i></a>.</p>
