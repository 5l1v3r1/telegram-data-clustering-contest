      <h1>Thai cuisine restaurants get two Michelin stars for first time at home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:06:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:06</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>Two restaurants in Bangkok have each earned a pair of coveted Michelin stars, the first time the leading guide has awarded the accolade to local establishments offering Thai cuisine.</p>
      <p>Located in Bangkok, the restaurants Sorn and R-Haan were upgraded from their previous one-star rating in the third edition of the "Michelin guide in Thailand", unveiled Tuesday in the capital. </p>
      <p>Sorn celebrates traditional techniques and recipes from southern Thailand, where it sources from a network of small producers. </p>
      <p>At the helm of R-Haan, Chef Chumpol offers food inspired by products from all regions of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>No establishment won three stars in this 2020 edition, but three others retain two -- the French restaurants Le Normandie and Mezzaluna, as well as that of German twin brothers Suhring. </p>
      <p>This year some 29 establishments in Thailand received stars.</p>
      <p>Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin Guides, said the ratings showcased "Thailand's rich diversity and high quality of local produce".  </p>
      <p>Thailand is already famed for its street food and Bangkok's curbside crab omelette standout Jay Fai retained its one star.</p>

      <p>Despite criticism over its alleged Eurocentrism and focus on pricey restaurants, the red guide, created in 1900, remains a key reference in the world of the gastronomy. </p>
      <p>Out of some 20,000 restaurants listed worldwide, only about one hundred have achieved the highest distinction of the "three stars". </p>
      <p>Michelin covers Asia in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Macau, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Taiwan and Bangkok. </p>
