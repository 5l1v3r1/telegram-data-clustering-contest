      <p>“I’m too busy to watch it,” he said. “It’s a witch hunt, it’s a hoax, I’m too busy to watch it.”</p>
      <p>Trump said that he would get briefed on the day’s testimony later in the day.</p>
      <p>He commented that he had heard that Democrats were using “television lawyers” to question the witnesses at the hearing.</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised to see it, because Schiff can’t do his own questions,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump was <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/daniel-goldman-impeachment-lawyer-russia-hoaxster-former-msnbc-pundit/">referring</a> to former MSNBC legal analyst Daniel Goldman, who Schiff recruited to conduct the examination of the witnesses Ambassador Bill Taylor and Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent.</p>
      <p>White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham called the hearing “boring.”</p>
      <p>“This sham hearing is not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time and money,” she wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>House Democrats <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/first-hour-fail-democrats-blockbuster-opening-hour-fizzles/">spent</a> the first 93 minutes on opening statements before members of Congress could question the witnesses.</p>
      <p>The White House also released a video at noon with the president declaring the investigation as the “single greatest scam in the history of American politics.”</p>
      <p>He reminded supporters that Democrats wanted to take away their guns, health care, vote, freedom, and judges with the impeachment process.</p>
      <p>“It’s all very simple, they’re trying to stop me because I am fighting for you and I will never let that happen,” Trump said.</p>
