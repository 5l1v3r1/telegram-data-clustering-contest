      <p>Portugal coach Fernando Santos insisted on Wednesday that Cristiano Ronaldo "is fine and will play".</p>
      <p>In a press conference he gave on Thursday before the game against Lithuania, a Euro 2020 qualifier, Santos reluctantly spoke about Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>"He's a fantastic professional," he said, before saying he would not go any further.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was taken off early by Maurizio Sarri, his Juventus coach, at the weekend, with the Italian citing Ronaldo's knee problem.</p>
