      <h1>Athleisure styles you can flaunt confidently</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:32:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author">Antara Bose</a></address>
      <p>Athleisure is not going out of fashion. It is utilitarian, downright comfortable, and looks effortlessly stylish. So if you haven’t eased into the look yet, here are 7 fashion ideas you can try.<br/><br/><b>1 Sweatshirt dress</b><br/><br/>Isn’t it amazing when that oversized sweatshirt can double as a dress. And it’s so easy to slip into after a run. But to avoid making this look too sloppy, you’ll have to ditch your running shoes and pair it with a pair of knee-high boots. See the difference it makes.<br/><br/><b>2 Formalwear</b></p>
      <p>If you thought formalwear and athleisure don’t go together, we’d like to take this opportunity to tell you exactly how chic a well-fitted blazer and trousers with the sporty stripes down the side look. Pair it with black open-toed heels, and you’re all good to go for that meeting.<br/><br/><b>3 Single-tone</b><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you don’t want to experiment initially, we totally get it. Stick to a set in the same colour – a plain T-shirt, sweatpants, and kicks. Go for light colours like white, grey, and even cream.<br/><br/><b>4 Jacket and sweatpants</b><br/><br/>Throw on a loose hooded jacket over a crop top and match this with sweatpants in the same colour as the top. To make this style look more than just a trendy gym outfit, slip into ankle boots and accessorise well.<br/><br/><b>5 Floral summer dress</b><br/><br/>If you thought summer dresses always demanded dainty shoes, think again. They look just as trendy and feel a lot more casual if you pair it with a sporty slip-on. Want to go the extra mile? Find a pair that has a colour or print similar to your dress.<br/><br/><b>6 Fancy top and shorts</b><br/><br/>This might be a little bold for most, but there’s nothing more comfortably glamorous than a minimalistic sequined top with a pair of sweat-shorts.<br/><br/><b>7 Sporty mid-length skirts</b><br/><br/>Pick one in a neutral tone and pair it with a fitted, full-sleeved top and white sneakers. The mid-length skirt is the key piece here, so make sure you find one that feels just right for you.<br/><br/><i><b>Antara Bose is a model turned fashion and beauty consultant.
