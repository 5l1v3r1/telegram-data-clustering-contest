      <h1>'Throwback' - This is what away fans really think of a visit to Wolves and Molineux</h1>
      <h2>Visiting fans have been sharing their thoughts on the Wolverhampton Wanderers ground, Molineux. Are the opinions good? Or Bad? We take a look to see what they really think</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:55:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wollaston, https://www.facebook.com/stevewollastonjournalist/, Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of fans head to Molineux every season to see their side in action against Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>For the hardcore fans, away days are what make the season and as such they are quick to formulate their opinions on the ground they are visiting.</p>
      <p>Most fans will always compare the ground to their own home grounds, and the stadiums they have recently visited.</p>
      <p>They will also look at what might have changed at the ground since the last time they were there.</p>
      <p>We have had a look to see what visiting fans think of Molineux.</p>
      <p>These views are written by away fans and cover everything from parking to the quality of the pies.</p>
      <p>Here's a few excerpts from the Molineux reviews...</p>

      <h4>John Hague  is a Torino fan in England, here's what he made of it:</h4>
      <p>"As an English based fan of Torino once we saw the draw for the Europa League we had to get tickets. I have been to Molineux a few times and I've always enjoyed the ground. It's a proper football stadium and the crowd are intimidating but fair.</p>
      <p>"Result aside? A brilliant night and a great atmosphere. I hope Wolves do well in Europe as I have a lot of love for them as a club.</p>
      <p>"Molineux has certainly grown in size since I was last there but it's a proper football ground with a proud history of European nights under the lights."</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>"The ground seemed to be the same size as the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>"The attendance was 31,000. Molineux is an impressive stadium but slightly strange as the away section runs the full length of the touchline. There were Wolves fans were in corporate boxes right behind us and there was another tier of home fans above us."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Pattinson a Newcastle United fan, added:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I like Molineux, its a unique ground with character. A dying art in the English game with all these new modern bowl-like stadiums. However, I am not a fan of where they house the away supporters. They put away supporters in the lower tier of the Steve Bull Stand where we are spread from one side of the pitch to the other so its hard to all chant and sing in unison. This stand is also located quite a distance away from the pitch so it can be hard to see what's happening on the other side - especially with us being at ground level.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Liverpool fan Stefan reviewed Molineux in December:</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Went in the Bluebrick Bar by the Premier Inn for one then headed into town for a few beers. I'd read how difficult it was to get into the pubs but I've never had any trouble before and we didn't have any trouble this time either.</p>
      <p>"As long as you aren't wearing colours and behaving you are fine. The Wolves fans we spoke to were okay. Neither friendly nor abusive.</p>
      <p>"I didn't like the fake atmosphere created with fireworks and music booming out right until kick off. Felt more like a New Years Eve party!</p>
      <p>"I enjoyed the night and the game. Wolverhampton is a good away trip. As long as you don't attract attention to yourself you are fine."</p>

      <p>"One to forget frankly. When your chips and curry are the highlight of the afternoon you know it's not been a good away day.</p>
      <p>"Nice enough ground but the weather was so poor it was one of those few occasions when I was absolutely relieved to get back in my car and away."</p>

      <p>"The place isn't particularly welcoming and the whole city is a bit of a 1970's throwback. All the pubs are festooned with 'HOME FANS ONLY' signs, and I mean ALL of them.</p>
      <p>"The only designated place for away fans is the bar in the Premier Inn by the station. Even the Wetherspoons is home only, however, we were there early with no colours so managed to get in (if you can pass for not football fans I imagine you'd be okay most of the time).</p>
      <p>"At the stadium there isn't a single card machine in the away end, so if you want any food or drink make sure you have cash (something you aren't pre-warned about).</p>
      <p>"The away end is the lower section by the side of the pitch meaning you have home fans on either side and above you, you are also spread very thinly meaning it's difficult to chant in unison and the shallow incline means it's easy to have your view blocked by those in front. All in all, an interesting experience but I won't rush back."</p>

      <p>"Molineux is an exceptionally easy ground to find. I caught the bus outside my Birmingham hotel to Wolverhampton Bus Station and walked the ten minute journey to the ground from there.</p>
      <p>"I ate a dodgy kebab in the town centre but then discovered a huge choice of food stands outside the Molineux ground.</p>
      <p>"This is a magnificent ground, redolent of a long history of (mostly past) success. Molineux as a city centre ground, this is right up there with the best Championship stadia. "</p>

      <p>"I looked around the outside of Molineux, had tea and chatted to a few Rovers fans. I visited the nearby Asda but there was no cafe inside. The home fans were okay but seemed to keep to themselves.</p>
      <p>"Our fans outsang them for the whole match creating a great atmosphere. Too big a queue at the one food stand each time I looked, so I did not try. Lots of stewards out front who stood up if the fans stood up when there was any action."</p>

      <p>"Molineux is in an ideal location to get to from City Centre. I didn't think that the ground was was anything special but it is well designed and I had a great view from where I was sitting in the Stan Cullis Stand.</p>
      <p>"Most of the Newcastle fans were housed in the lower tier of the Steve Bull Stand to the left of us, where I believe the view wasn't as good.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't recommend Molineux for visiting fans, the complete lack of pubs available to away fans is a disgrace."</p>

        <b>Leeds United fan Shaun Tully wrote on 22/10/16...</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I was pretty impressed with Molineux. Although it is an old ground it has been done up so to speak so the stands all look impressive on each side (unlike Ewood Park and indeed for that matter our own Elland Road where an old stand remains down one length of the pitch).</p>
      <p>"The stewards seemed friendly enough and the end I was at was near the Jack Haywood Stand where the more 'vocal' home fans base themselves, meaning there was plenty of 'banter' The atmosphere wasn't bad compared to some other away games I've been to."</p>

      <p>"Arriving in Wolverhampton around 10am. I had a look around the central shopping area and got some breakfast. I put on a couple of football bets, then decided to have a few pints. I went to the 'Billy Wright', The Still and to McGhees (Irish bar). Chatted to a few of the locals, who were friendly enough.</p>
      <p>"Some of the older guys reckoned a player that came from Dundee United (my team) to Wolves was one of their greats - Andy Gray - who helped them win a League Cup.</p>
      <p>"The Wolves fans in the 20,600 crowd were in fine singing voice throughout. Stewards helpful with directions, toilets fine, standard pies and drinks."</p>

      </p>
      <p>"I have visited over 54 grounds now on my travels and I would certainly rate Molineux high up on the list. Not quite making the top ten but this is certainly a nice modern, well built stadium.</p>
      <p>"Molineux looks quite impressive and is a modern bright stadium. Great views of the game as we were situated in the lower section of the Steve Bull Stand which runs along the length of the pitch. The only problem with this away section is that you are spread out along the ground so that it is difficult for the away end to sing in unison as you would if you were all located together in one section.</p>
      <p>"As a group of us travelled down we met up and stayed at the Novotel for the night. Had a couple of drinks at the hotel then walked down to the ground. No animosity or signs of any hostility in and around the ground that I saw."</p>

      <p>"The Wolves fans behind the goal to the left hand side of the away section were very loud on occasion, some of the loudest home support I've heard in a while.</p>
      <p>"Stewards were some of the best I've ever come across, very relaxed and friendly and allowed us to move around/stand when suitable."</p>

      <p>"The ground certainly looks impressive as you exit the subway as it is situated at the bottom of a hill.</p>
      <p>"Once inside, I was surprised that the ground felt smaller than the impression given off by TV, nevertheless the new Stand Cullis stand looks impressive with two large tiers despite the fact it somewhat comically stops abruptly as it rounds the corner.</p>
      <p>"We were housed in the entire lower tier of the Steve Bull Stand which gave a very low angled view of the pitch even at the back row. "</p>
