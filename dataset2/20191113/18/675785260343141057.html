      <h1>What is your carbon footprint? Exclusive calculator shows how green you really are</h1>
      <h2>As part of the Daily Mirror's climate edition we are publishing a carbon footprint calculator - an easy way to find out how much of the global warming gas you are pumping into the atmosphere each year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T18:44:30+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Innes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/richard-innes/</a></address>
      <p>The world is heating up at an alarming rate and the amount of carbon dioxide humans are releasing into the atmosphere is a key reason why.</p>
      <p>Every time we hop into the car, eat beef that was farmed from deforested land or buy an item of clothing shipped from across the globe, we are adding to the billions of tonnes of Co2 dumped into the atmosphere each year.</p>
      <p>For decades now the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/">scientific community unanimously agreed</a> that the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere - which currently far exceeds any previously recorded level - is trapping heat inside the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The results is an increasingly hot planet on which ice caps melt, sea levels rise and extreme <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> events become more and more common.</p>

      <p>To find out how much of a contribution you are making to the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/790626/2018-provisional-emissions-statistics-report.pdf">364.1 million tonnes</a> of Co2 the UK chugged into the atmosphere last year, you can have a go on our carbon footprint calculator.</p>
      <p>It is being released today as part of The Daily Mirror's climate edition, which aims to highlight the huge environmental changes that are happening to our planet right now.</p>
      <p>To read the full manifesto <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/daily-mirrors-climate-crisis-issue-20861834">click here.</a></p>
      <p>The calculator asks you a series of question which determine how much of the gas you're responsible for pumping into the atmosphere each year.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>These include transport issues, such as how many short, medium and long haul flights you take a year, how often you hop on the train, and whether you own a car.</p>
      <p>Other, less obvious ways in which people contribute to climate change are delved into, such as the white goods and furniture you buy.</p>
      <p>Even clothes shopping, newspaper buying and thermostat usage habits are called into question.</p>

      <p>At the end of the thorough exam the calculator tells you exactly how much carbon you're dumping into the atmosphere each year - with the chance to share with your friends exactly how big an eco-champion or carbon culprit you really are.</p>
