      <h1>Fed Chairman Powell says unemployment, already at 50-year low, could go lower</h1>

      <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the unemployment rate, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/economy-added-136-000-jobs-in-september">already at a 50-year low</a>, could drop further without necessarily causing inflation to rise.</p>
      <p>"The data is not sending any signal that the labor market is so hot or that inflation is moving up," Powell said during a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings-calendar?ID=E1F7F9B1-57F9-41E1-A5B9-ACAB77784B48">hearing</a> at the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "What we have learned ... is that the U.S. economy can operate at a much lower level of unemployment than many thought."</p>
      <p>The chairman also said that wages were rising.</p>
      <p>"If you go back five years, wages and compensation were going up to about 2%, that has gradually moved up to 3% — so that’s really the trend has been upward ... We’ve seen wages moving up,” Powell said.</p>
      <p>“That’s true across all major measures of wages over the last, let's say, 5 to 6 years,” he said.</p>
