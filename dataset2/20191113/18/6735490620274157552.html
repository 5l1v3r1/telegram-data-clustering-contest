      <h1>Kelsey Grammer Slams ‘Pathetic’ Ex-Wife Camille, Reveals She Threatened Divorce On Day Of His Mother’s Funeral</h1>

      <p>There’s no love lost between former spouses Kelsey and Camille Grammer, and in a new British television interview he blasts his <a href="https://www.slice.ca/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills/">“Real Housewives of Beverly Hills”</a> ex as “pathetic.”</p>
      <p>As the <i><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7682273/Kelsey-Grammer-slams-ex-wife-Camille-pathetic.html">Daily Mail</a> </i>reports, the former “Frasier” star, 64, recently sat down for an interview with “In Depth with Graham Bensinger”, and when it came to discussing his ex-wife he did not hold back.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I don’t really talk about her very much, because so much of her life is spent talking about me and I just think it’s sort of pathetic,” he said of Camille, 51.</p>

      <p>Looking back, he recalled one particularly nasty moment in their 13-year-marriage that served to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
      <p>“A month after I had a heart attack my mother died — 12 years ago now — the day of my mother’s funeral, my third wife basically had an explosion about something,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And she started telling me, ‘I’m out of this, I’m out of here. I want a divorce,’ blah, blah blah, which we’d had the same conversation for eight years, and it was tiresome” Grammer continued.</p>
      <p>“I realized at that moment that I was done with her, that I was not going to end up in this relationship for much longer,” he added. “And somewhere under a year I was done.”</p>
      <p>ET Canada has reached out to Camille Grammer’s rep for comment.</p>

      <p>Of course, there was plenty for Grammer to talk about beside his ex, including the long-rumoured “Frasier” revival — which he says is definitely moving forward.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got it hatched. We’ve hatched the plan, what we think is the right way to go,” Grammer told Bensinger, explaining that they’re in the midst of exploring some network deals.</p>
      <p>“A revisit to ‘Frasier’ and Frasier’s world is, I think, definitely gonna come,” he said. “We’ll see how people are gonna respond to it, because it’s not going to be the same place. It’s not going to be Seattle, it’s not going to be the same Frasier, it’s going to be the man in his next iteration. And hopefully that’ll be something people like watching.”</p>
