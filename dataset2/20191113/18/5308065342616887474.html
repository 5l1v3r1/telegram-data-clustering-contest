      <p>On Friday (Nov 15), GrabFood delivery riders may start to apply for the e-scooter trade-in grant.</p>
      <p>GrabFood is the first firm to release details about its trade-in grant.</p>
      <p>Terms for the grant scheme include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Riders must have completed at least one trip between Oct 9 and Nov 7 to qualify for the grant.</li>
        <li>E-scooters must initially be registered with the Land Transport Authority (LTA).</li>
        <li>Riders who completed fewer than 20 rides will receive 80 percent of the grant.</li>
        <li>Riders can receive the remaining amount upon completing 20 rides within 30 days after submitting the claims.</li>
        <li>Riders will be informed about their application status two working days after submission to the LTA.</li>
        <li>Reimbursements after trading the e-scooters will be received within one to three working days.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More than a third of GrabFood riders use e-scooters to deliver orders while only five percent of Deliveroo riders and 12 percent of Foodpanda riders rely on e-scooters and other PMDs.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/grab-unveils-details-trade-grant-scheme-e-scooter-delivery-riders">Today</a> reported that Grab is also reaching out to bicycle organisations and retailers such as SG Bike, WarehouseSG, My Bike Shop, Hello Bicycle, and Cannasia to help their riders rent or purchase bikes at a reasonable discount.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/grabs-food-delivery-riders-can-apply-for-escooter-tradein-grant-from-friday-000417240.html">YahooSG</a> reported that GrabFood shall also provide leasing rates for motorcycles for its riders through partners Pyro Leasing and GP Motoring.</p>
      <p>Foodpanda and Deliveroo are yet to announce their terms for the government’s proposed S$7 million trade-in grant for e-scooters and other PMDs.</p>
      <p>Under the grant, riders will be encouraged to trade-in their e-scooters and they will be reimbursed with between S$600 and S$1,000 to buy either a bicycle or its electric counterpart./TISG</p>
