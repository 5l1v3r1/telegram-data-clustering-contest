      <p>Ferrari is debuting its newest grand tourer, the Ferrari Roma, in—you guessed it—Rome. We’re on the ground and will see the V-8 two seat-plus Coupe in the metal tomorrow, but we’ve got some details ahead of that.</p>

      <p>The Ferrari Roma was shown to a select group of customers this evening. Meant to evoke “La Nuova Dolce Vita,” or the new sweet life, Ferrari says Roma embodies a thoroughly modern design language, but its sleek lines allude to the sportiness inherent in its current cars. From the images we can see a striking profile, with a front end and grille that look more modern than on any Ferrari we’ve seen yet. Sharp LED headlights anchor the front graphic, and ultra-thin, sleek taillights give off a strong impression in the rear. There’s also two sets of dual exhaust pipes that hint at the performance prowess of the Roma.</p>

      <p>The Roma is powered by Ferrari’s award-winning turbocharged V-8, good for 611 horsepower, reaching that peak at 7,500 rpm. Channeling that power is an eight-speed DCT gearbox that was recently debuted on the SF90 Stradale, which means it should be about 13 pounds lighter than the one it replaces. We’ll have more details of Ferrari’s newest tomorrow.</p>
