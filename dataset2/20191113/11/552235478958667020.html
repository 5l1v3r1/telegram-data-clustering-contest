      <h2>Creetown Building Preservation Trust has landed the cash from Historic Environment Scotland to turn the church into a performance arts venue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:52:23+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>A project to turn an old church into a performance arts venue has been handed a cash boost of more than £40,000.</p>
      <p>Creetown Building Preservation Trust has been working on their plans for St Joseph’s Church for nearly a decade.</p>
      <p>And they’ve now been given £43,197 by Historic Environment Scotland to go towards the £324,697 total cost.</p>
      <p>The trust’s senior project manager, Andrew Ward, said: “Creetown Building Preservation Trust are delighted that HES are contributing to the restoration of St Joseph’s Church. The new performance centre will bring benefits to people of all ages from Creetown and the surrounding area.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The former church is an important building which has served and been part of the communities’ lives for generations. It sits in an important position as it looks over the late Hideo Furuta designed village square. In the future, this will enable joint events and activities to take place using both facilities.</p>
      <p>“Saving this historic building is, in itself, important, however, giving it a new life and purpose is perhaps even more important and the benefit it will bring will make a difference to people in Creetown and surrounding area for many years to come.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The church was built in 1865 and has been used by Creetown Silver Band for 130 years. They’ll continue to use the building and there will also be rehearsal and meeting space for local groups in the multi-use performance arts venue.</p>
      <p>The grant has come from HES’ historic environment repair grant.</p>
      <p>Head of grants, Amy Eastwood, said: “We’re pleased to support Creetown Building Preservation Trust with £43,197 for their redevelopment project of St Joseph’s Church.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">"It’s fantastic that this historic building will be brought back into full-time public use for the local community to enjoy.”</a>
