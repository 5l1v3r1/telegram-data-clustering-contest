      <h3>“THE dismissal of a pending action should be based on merit and not on mere empty politicking or puerile sound bytes. Dream on Mr. Macalintal!”  </h3>
      <p>Thus said Atty. Vic Rodriguez, spokesperson  of former Senator Ferdinand “Bongbong” R. Marcos, Jr.  in resoonse to Atty. Romy Macalintal’s statement asking BBM to drop his election protest.</p>
      <p>Vice President Leni Robredo’s lawyer asked former Senator Bongbong Marcos to withdraw his electoral protest so the former could focus on her new appointment as anti-drug czar.</p>
      <p>Last week, Robredo accepted President Rodrigo Duterte’s challenge to help in the government’s anti-drug campaign by being the co-chairperson of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs. The vice president said that she wanted to bring reforms in the drug war.</p>
      <p>Atty. Romulo Macalintal on Tuesday suggested that it would be a “graceful exit” for Marcos to withdraw his protest citing a “cloud of doubt” regarding its merits.</p>
      <p>“Of doubtful merit na rin naman ang kanyang protesta, a graceful exit is to withdraw it and show statesmanship and show patriotism in the light of the new appointment of the vice president. Please help the vice president in making a direct focus now on her new job against illegal drugs,” said Macalintal in a forum.</p>
      <p>Marcos filed in 2016 an electoral protest against Robredo before the Supreme Court sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET), questioning the results of the vice presidential race. Robredo was named as the 14th vice president of the country with a lead of 263,473 votes against Marcos.</p>
      <p>The recount began April 2018 in polling precincts in Iloilo, Camarines Sur, and Negros Oriental, which were handpicked by Marcos’ camp. However, PET revealed last month that Robredo’s lead widened by around 15,000 after a recount from the 5,415 clustered precincts in the pilot provinces.</p>
      <p>“Alam naman niyang there is already a cloud of doubt regarding the legitimacy or merits of his petition, considering that the PET [is] unanimous in their findings,” said Macalintal.</p>
      <p>There are less than three years left in the vice president’s six-year term.</p>
      <p>For his part, Robredo’s spokesperson Barry Gutierrez said that the vice president has been busy lately with her new post.</p>
