      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/pete-townshend">Pete Townshend</a> has said his “increasingly affectionate relationship” with Roger Daltrey is a major reason for The Who’s impressive longevity.</p>
      <p>The rock legends have been going strong since 1964, and will release their twelfth album ‘Who’ in December.</p>
      <p>“I still perform partly because of my ongoing, developing and increasingly affectionate relationship with Roger,” Pete told <a href="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/people/the-who-s-pete-townshend-on-how-he-and-roger-daltrey-have-made-their-peace-1-10092267">the Yorkshire Post</a>.</p>
      <p>“When you look back at where we started, I wouldn’t say we despised each other but we had very little in common. Now, we have very little in common but we really care about each other deeply.”</p>
      <p>The singer says their appreciation has played a huge part in the band’s ongoing success.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a surprise and a delight to us both that we found this because we didn’t expect it,’ he said.</p>
      <p>“We are really comfortable with each other.  He says, ‘You’ve got your guitar and your pen, I’ve got my voice’.</p>
      <p>“We meet in the middle and it just happens to be performing.”</p>
      <p>This comes after he previously<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/whos-pete-townshend-rock-n-roll-past-waste-of-time-2564422"> expressed regret over his past “rock and roll” antics.</a></p>
      <p>“I was always pretty snobby about rock and roll,” he said. He addressed an infamous incident in which the band’s late drummer, Keith Moon, chucked a TV through a hotel window.</p>
      <p>“As the television went through the window, I would look at Keith Moon and go, ‘what a fucking prat. What a waste of time’.</p>
