      <h3>THE talented 12 finalists of “The Clash Season 2” were presented to the press and they all certainly have  such impressive vocal pipes. They are Big Voice ng Dasma Cavite Al Fritz, Pambatong Mangyan ng Mindoro Aljon Gutierrez, Viral Princess ng Paranaque Antoniette Tismo, Bokalistang Bistak ng Cebu Clark Serafin, Soulful Songstress ng Paranaque Janina Gonzales, Birit Beauty ng Malabon Jennifer Maravilla, Pop Heartthrob ng Imus Jeremiah Tiangco, Bebop Babe ng La Union Lorraine Galvez, Comeback Kid ng Cavite Nef Medina, Sassy Girl ng Pampanga Sassa Dagdag, R&amp;B Sweetheart ng Qatar Thea Astley, and Pride of Kawit Tombi Romulo.</h3>
      <p>As you can see, four of them are from Cavite: Al, Jeremiah, Nef and Tombi, while two are from Parañaque: Antonette and Janina. Jeremiah is the one most of the other contestants think would be the most likely to win in the contest as he has a distinct vocal styling. And not only that, he’s also the best looking so it’s a case of total package. But knowing the taste of GMA, they wouldn’t choose him to win. You can follow the journey of the remaining 12 finalists every Saturday after “Daddy’s Gurl” and on Sundays after “Daig Kayo ng Lola Ko”.</p>
