      <h2>Sarah Barrass and her half-brother Brandon Machin - the father of her six children - had a secret sexual relationship and feared their kids would be taken into care if the truth was exposed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:56:01+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, Amy Murphy, Henry Clare</a></address>
      <p>Incest killer mum Sarah Barrass lied to her kids and told them their father died in World War II - about 60 years before her first child was born.</p>
      <p>The birth father was her half-brother, Brandon Machin, but they hid their dark secret from the children, social services and everyone else.</p>
      <p>Barrass, 35, and Machin, 39, feared their sexual relationship would be discovered and her six children would be taken into care when they <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> their sons Tristan, 13, and Blake, 14.</p>
      <p>The evil pair were plotting to kill all six children at her Sheffield home in May, believing the kids would be "better off dead" than in care like they were when they were younger.</p>

      <p>Barrass and Machin were sentenced to life in prison with minimum terms of 35 years on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sheffield Crown Court heard that after police arrived at Barrass' semi-detached house on the morning of May 24 the surviving children - all aged under 13 - were asked about the family dynamic.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting the case, Kama Melly QC said that, to the outside world, it appeared that Barrass and her children lived relatively ordinary lives.</p>
      <p>She said: "The picture of the Sarah Barrass household prior to the events in 2019 was, to the outside world, a household of a loving single mum with six children, heavily supported by her brother Brandon Machin.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"In fact, unbeknown to everyone but the defendants, Brandon Machin was in a sexual relationship with his half-sister, Sarah Barrass, and he was the father of all six children.</p>
      <p>"The children believed and even told officers at the scene that their father was dead, he having died in the Second World War."</p>
      <p>World War II ended in 1945, about 60 years before Blake, the couple's oldest child, was born.</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin, who had the same mum, had been having sex together since the mid-teens after Machin came out of care, a judge was told.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>On May 23, the day before the double murder and after social workers asked Barrass to reveal who fathered the children, she told Machin: “They need to die now, they need to die today.”</p>
      <p>Miss Melly said it was "clear that the relationship between the two defendants was of a consensual sexual relationship", adding that friends and relatives described Machin as a "pushover" and said that Barrass "definitely wore the trousers".</p>
      <p>The judge said that the pregnancies of the six children had all been planned.</p>
      <p>After failing to poison four of the children, Barrass strangled Tristan - who shouted "stop" at one point and struggled - with her dressing gown cord in front of his brother Blake, 14, who yelled "Mum is killing Tristan", the court heard.</p>

      <p>Machin then strangled Blake with his bare hands.</p>
      <p>The pair swapped victims and placed bin bags over the heads of the boys to "make sure" they were dead. They died of asphyxiation but it was unclear whether the strangling or bin bags caused their deaths.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Barrass and Machin tried to drown one of the younger children, but that child survived after they struggled and “hysterically” screamed and pleaded: “Why are you trying to kill us?”</p>
      <p>Machin told police he had "that feeling when you just want to strangle the life out of someone" and went downstairs and had an energy drink after the murders.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Before the murders, Barrass had sent a chilling message to a friend, writing: "I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. Mass murder, putting them all in care, checking in to the local nut house.</p>
      <p>"I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."</p>
      <p>Social services had been in regular contact with the family since 1990 and concerns were raised about the half-siblings developing a sexual relationship.</p>
      <p>The murders happened after social workers escalated their involvement with the family because the youngsters were behaving badly at home and at school, the court heard.</p>

        <figcaption>Barrass also posted this quote from a Stephen King novel</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Barrass had requested help from the local authority and sent frantic messages to friends saying she was struggling to cope.</p>
      <p>She had threatened her children in the past, telling them: “I gave you life, I can take it away.”</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin had worked together to strangle their two eldest children before ensuring their certain deaths by placing bin bags over their heads.</p>
      <p>Heartbreaking statements from the "emotionally broken" surviving children were read to the court, with one saying they wanted their parents to go to prison for "300 years" and another fearing they might "become a murderer".</p>
      <p>A packed public galley also heard how two of the children are "emotionally broken" by what happened and "repeatedly ask why and how".</p>
      <p>A day before murdering Tristan and Blake on the morning of May 24, the sick pair had also forced the two teenagers, as well as two more of their children, to take tablets gathered from around the family home in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin both expected the mixture, which included prescribed ADHD medication, to end the lives of all four of them.</p>
      <p>Barrass even sent messages to friends and wrote a "light-hearted" post on social media that her children had caught a "sickness bug".</p>
      <p>The day Tristan and Blake were killed, a message was sent to a friend on Nintendo Switch saying they weren't going to school that Friday because they were "feeling sick", according to neighbours.</p>
      <p>But when poisoning failed, Barrass researched murder methods online and summoned Machin to her home, where they strangled Tristan and Blake before attempting to drown another child in the bath.</p>

      <p>Barrass had planned to kill her youngest children and then take her own life.</p>
      <p>But after Tristan and Blake were killed she took the surviving children to an upstairs bedroom and phoned the police, who found her in the room, where she gave them a notebook open on a page entitled "Funeral Arrangements".</p>
      <p>Tristan and Blake were found dead in their beds with bin bags over their heads.</p>
      <p>Sentencing the two to life jail-terms with a minimum term of 35 years, Mr Justice James Goss told Barrass: "You considered your love for them and fear of being parted from them entitled you to take their lives as well as your own."</p>
      <p>In September, the pair had both admitted murdering Tristan and Blake - who were laid to rest in a shared coffin in August - plotting to murder all six of the children and five counts of attempted murder, two of which were against the teenagers who died.</p>

      <p>Bryan Cox QC, mitigating for Barrass, admitted her crimes were “nothing but evil”, but said she was “profoundly damaged by her childhood” in which she suffered neglect and emotional, physical and sexual abuse, and was taken into care.</p>
      <p>He told the court: He continued: "The defendant was desperate to prevent her children being taken into care.</p>
      <p>"She couldn't cope with the prospect of them being removed."</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, boys' grief-stricken uncle, Martyn Barrass, told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/evil-mum-tried-kill-kids-20808557">Sunday People</a> that the siblings' killers "have been evil since birth", describing them as "psychopaths" and claiming Machin had been abusive towards the children.</p>
      <p>He said Barrass and Machin had killed pet mice for fun when they were younger and were fascinated with horror films featuring vampires, blood and gore.</p>

      <p>A Nightmare on Elm Street was one of their favourites, he added.</p>
      <p>Months before the murders, Sarah Barrass quoted the Stephen King novel Under the Dome, writing on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook:</a> "Murder is like potato chips; you can't stop with just one."</p>
      <p>She once posted a disturbing cartoon image of the Grim Reaper holding a bloody scythe with the caption: "Coming for you."</p>
      <p>After the killers were jailed, John Macilwraith, Executive Director of People Services at Sheffield City Council, said: "Our focus continues to be the well-being of the children from this family now in our care.</p>
      <p>They are safe and receiving good support through this traumatic time.</p>
      <p>"The Sheffield Children Safeguarding Partnership has initiated a Serious Case Review (SCR) to investigate what happened.</p>

        <figcaption>Barrass had been in a sexual relationship with her half-brother since her teens (Image: Facebook)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"The national SCR panel have endorsed this and agreed that the review should go ahead locally.</p>
      <p>"The council will be cooperating fully with the review and are already working to provide the relevant information.</p>
      <p>"This is such a tragic and, we hope, isolated case that it is vital to examine every aspect in order to establish what can be learned to inform the development of future professional practice.</p>
      <p>"We anticipate that the SCR will take up to six months, but this is subject to many factors and timescales may change.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is taking the necessary time to get the review right.</p>
      <p>"We have many hundreds of families in Sheffield who are cared for by our children's services but there are always new lessons to learn, so we need to understand, alongside all partners in the city, as much as we can about why and how these tragic events happened, as much as it is ever possible to understand such a terrible act."</p>

      <p>Family friend Matt Saunders described the heartache over the boys' deaths, telling reporters: "Blake and Tristan were two beautiful, confident and outgoing boys who both had a bright future ahead of them.</p>
      <p>"They had so many friends and they lit up any room they were in, especially Tristan, who loved to dye his hair bright colours.</p>
      <p>"Daily life will never be the same again now. The boys have left behind younger siblings, whose lives have been turned upside down.</p>
      <p>"They adored their older brothers and they looked up to them."</p>
      <p>He added: "A piece of all our hearts died on the 24th of May 2019, which we will never get back. Blake and Tristan leave a huge empty void in our lives and we did not get the chance to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>"We are relieved justice has been served but it should never have come to this."</p>
      <p>Tristan and Blake were laid to rest together in one coffin during their funeral in August.</p>
      <p>The boys' names were on each side of the shared coffin.</p>
      <p>An honour guard of more than 300 motorcycles and two Lamborghini cars attended the service following an appeal after it emerged the teenagers both loved bikes and cars.</p>
