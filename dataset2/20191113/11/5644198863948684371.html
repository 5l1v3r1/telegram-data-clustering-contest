      <p>REUTERS: England coach Eddie Jones says he got his team selection wrong for the Rugby World Cup final and should have brought in fresh legs to face South Africa.</p>
      <p>Jones fielded the same starting 15 against South Africa that had stunned defending champions New Zealand in the semi-final but England were unable to cope with the Springboks' physicality and lost 32-12 in Yokohama.</p>

      <p>"If there's one thing I could have done differently it was probably to have changed the selection a little bit," Jones told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I continued to change selection from game to game (during the tournament) and probably in hindsight I should have refreshed the squad a little bit.</p>
      <p>"I'm not going to talk about individuals but maybe I should have changed the order of 23. But it works when you win - that's the great thing and when you win you have all the answers but when you lose you don't."</p>
      <p>Jones has a contract with England until 2021 but Rugby Football Union Chief Executive Bill Sweeney has said the Australian would be offered the chance to continue for the full four-year cycle into the 2023 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Jones, who will be in charge of the Barbarians for the invitational side's match against Fiji at Twickenham on Saturday, was reluctant to discuss where his future might lie.</p>
      <p>"There's all sorts of stories at the moment - about going to France, Fiji but it's not really my decision, coaches have to perform and that's the only thing I am worried about," Jones added.</p>
