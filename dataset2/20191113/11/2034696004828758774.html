      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/star-wars"><i>Star Wars</i></a> fans have been reacting after a notorious scene from <i>A New Hope</i> was changed again upon the launch of Disney+.</p>
      <p>The streaming service launched yesterday (November 12) and fans have pointed out that one particular scene, which has changed multiple times since the 1977 original and become legendary as a result, has shifted once again.</p>

      <p>The scene in question has prompted plenty of debate over whether Han or Greedo shoot first in their battle during <i>A New Hope</i>.</p>
      <p>The 1977 original saw Han shoot Greedo before the latter could reach the trigger, but this was altered in a new edition of the film released in the late 1990s, with Greedo shooting first in the new version.</p>

      <p>Now, a tweaked version of the scene has made it into the Disney+ version of <i>A New Hope</i>, which sees neither of the pair shooting first – they fire at about the same time. Watch the scene below.</p>

      <p>There is another line added into the film too. According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>, a new line by Greedo, that he says before his death, was added in by Lucas before Disney acquired LucasFilm.</p>
      <p>The line simply sees him say “Maclunkey,” a word that is now confusing and exciting Star Wars fans across the internet, who are reacting to the new tweak in <i>A New Hope,</i> with some believing that they’ve worked out what the elusive word means<i>.</i></p>
      <p>“If you paid attention to the extended Star Wars canon you would know that Maclunkey is Greedo’s partner, who was one week from retirement when Han killed him. the line is a devastating rebuke,” one tweeted.</p>
      <p>Another believes they’ve found a translation for the word, meaning “This’ll be the end of you.”</p>
