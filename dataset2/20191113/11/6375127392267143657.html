      <h1>PNP, AFP for ‘selective’ martial law extension in southern region</h1>

      <h3>AMID Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte’s call on her father, President Rodrigo Duterte, to already lift martial law in her city, both Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa and Armed Forces chief of staff Gen. Noel Clement yesterday said they are in favor of the extension of martial law in select areas in Mindanao.</h3>
      <p>Mayor Duterte said she is seeking the help of the House of Representatives and the Department of National Defense to exempt Davao City from the martial law in Mindanao and officially sent her request to the Office of the President last August 7.</p>
      <p>Last June, the President’s daughter announced they will request the Office of the President to reconsider and review the declaration of martial law in Mindanao and make it localized. She was backed by the City Council as well as the Police Regional Office 11 which cited the decrease in the city’s crime volume and crime rate.</p>
      <p>“Generally yes, but there is still ongoing assessment on the part of the PNP  baka pwedeng maging selective,” said Gen. Gamboa. The PNP-OIC said the “selected areas” are those with high terrorist threats specifically those posed by the Abu Sayyaf and other ISIS-inspired terror groups in the region including Sulu, Basilan and the Lanao provinces including Marawi City.</p>
      <p>He did not identify those areas since he said that they should be properly evaluated by the police and the military. Gen. Gamboa said that the PNP Directorate for Operations headed by Major Gen. Emmanuel Luis D. Licup and the PNP Directorate for Intelligence headed by Maj. Gen. Mariel M. Magaway are set to submit to him a report about the security situation in Mindanao before the weekend.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said that the PNP-DO and PNP-DI will come up with a concrete and definite stand on the martial law imposition in Mindanao including which areas should remain under martial rule.</p>
      <p>“There is still an ongoing assessment on the part of the PNP, baka puwede maging selective. Depende sa assessment. But, in almost all possibilities, we are for discontinuance except on other areas na merong assessment na malakas pa rin ang terrorism,” the PNP-OIC added.</p>
      <p>Gamboa refused to identify the areas where there is still strong terror threats. “We will not preempt it. Gusto ko may proper evaluation, may proper supporting information and intelligence dito,” he said.</p>
      <p>For his part, Gen. Clement said that the AFP would most likely recommend the martial law extension in certain areas in Southern Philippines which he added are still undergoing security assessment.</p>
      <p>“But as we see it right now, the current security situation in Mindanao has improved a lot. If we will be asked, it might probably only in certain areas in Mindanao,” he said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, PNP spokesman, Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac said that the PNP most likely would no longer recommend another extension of martial law in Mindanao citing the much-improved peace and order situation in the region.</p>
      <p>“Peace and order in Mindanao is under control and continues to show marked stability, a condition that may eventually pave the way for lifting of martial law. By December, the PNP will submit its recommendation to the security cluster of National Security Council,” Banac said.</p>
      <p>According to Banac, all PNP units in Mindanao however remained on increased alert and are maintaining their vigilance  to prevent the occurrence of crimes even as they continue conducting rescue-and-relief operations in all areas in the region affected by the recent series of earthquakes.</p>
      <p>The PNP spokesperson agreed with the remark of Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana that martial law in Mindanao needs to be lifted already.</p>
      <p>He confirmed that the crime rate in Mindanao is already improving with the PNP and the Armed Forces already controlling the proliferation of loose firearms in the region.</p>
      <p>However, he said that security troops are still watching the situation in Sulu due to the presence of local terror groups believed to be responsible for past bombings and kidnappings.</p>
      <p>“Mananatili lamang mataas ang alert level doon sa bahagi ng Sulu na kung saan mayroon pa ring pinaghihinalaang presensya ng terrorist group na Abu Sayyaf,” he said said.</p>
      <p>Banac also said that the possibility of having martial law in selected parts of the region is also possible since the security cluster is still discussing the matter.</p>
      <p>Sec. Lorenzana had said he is not inclined to recommend extending martial law in Mindanao, and added it would be better if Congress will pass a tougher Human Security Act for law enforcement.</p>
