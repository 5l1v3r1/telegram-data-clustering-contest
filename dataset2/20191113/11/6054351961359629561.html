      <h1>Snoop Dogg's Weed Grinder &amp; 2Pac's Personal Polaroids Go Up For Sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:07:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/">The Gotta Have Rock and Roll Auctions</a> has kicked off the nine-day online auction sale of its Hip Hop Collection. Bidding opened at 9 a.m. EST on Wednesday (November 13) and closes on Friday (November 22).</p>
      <p>The Hip Hop portion of the auction consists of over 100 pieces of memorabilia — ranging from handwritten lyrics and autographed items to <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53439/title.snoop-dogg-affiliate-bad-azz-dies-in-jail">Snoop Dogg’s</a> personal weed grinder.</p>
      <p>Highlights from the collection include the D-O-Double-G’s weed grinder, which was acquired from a good friend of his. According to Dylan Kosinski of <a href="https://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/">Gotta Have Rock and Roll Auctions</a>, “Snoop smoked so much weed and had so much weed that he sometimes used a coffee grinder. Snoop would take handfuls of weed and grind it with this grinder.”</p>

      <p>The West Coast legend allegedly gave this grinder to his friend and it’s now available for sale. Estimated cost is between $1,500 and $2,500.</p>
      <p>Up for grabs is also Biggie’s last known autographed copy of “<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.49961/title.songwriter-claims-biggies-hypnotize-lyrics-were-aimed-at-faith-evans-over-tupac-creeping">Hypnotize,</a>” signed at the California radio station KYLD WILD 107.7 FM on March 5, 1997, four days before his death. It’s expected to fetch between $40,000-$50,000.</p>

      <p>Finally, there are a couple of <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51253/title.throwbackthursdays-2pacs-mother-afeni-shakur-passes-away-at-69">2Pac</a> items. One is a personal polaroid with annotations, while the other is a never-been-seen personal polaroid of ‘Pac and his entourage holding several guns, including handguns, submachine guns and what looks like an assault rifle.</p>
