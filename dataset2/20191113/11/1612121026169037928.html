      <p>Taiwanese (mid-range) chip maker <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/mediatek/">MediaTek</a> has been on a roll lately, announcing their G90 series of gaming chips back in July with a new 5G chip about to drop at the MediaTek Summit on November 26. The company’s upcoming 5G chips will cover both high-end and mid-range devices with prices starting at around $300. That’s quite a feat for the burgeoning 5G tech with devices typically pushing $1,000 or more.</p>

      <p>These initial 5G chips are based on the Helio M70 modem and will launch in early 2020. Promotional materials show a designation of MT6885Z, which is the higher-end chip built on the 7nm FinFET manufacturing process for affordable flagship partners like <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a>, <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/oppo/">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/vivo/">Vivo</a>. Specs should include ARM Cortex-A77 cores and Mali-G77 GPU cores (high quality streaming and gaming), sub-6 GHz frequency support (download speeds of 4.7Gbps) and third-generation AI processing engine. Support for both non-standalone (NSA) and standalone (SA) 5G architectures will be standard. As for cameras, we’re looking at support for up to 80MP stills and 4K 60fps video. It’s rumored that the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/redmi/">Redmi</a> K30 series will be the first affordable 5G device with the new chip.</p>

      <p>The rumored MT6873 is designed for the mid-range market with devices in the $300 range, featuring the same 7nm FinFET process and Cortex-A76 cores. It’s also expected to be 25% smaller than the aforementioned MT6885. However, while the MT6885 is already in mass production, the MT6873 isn’t expected to hit that stage until the second quarter of 2020, with a release by the end of next year.</p>
      <p>MediaTek’s future plans may include a shift to TSMC’s 6nm process with four different designs supporting millimeter wave. But that’s still a ways off.</p>
