      <p>Thousands of JNU students have been staging protests against the administration’s decision to hike fees for hostel facilities.</p>
      <p>The one-time mess security fee, which is refundable, was hike from Rs 5,500 to Rs 12,000. The rent for single-bed room was hiked from Rs 20 per month to a whopping Rs 600 per month. The rent for a double-seater room was hiked from Rs 10 per month to Rs 300 per month.</p>
      <p>According to news agency PTI, the draft hostel manual also has provisions for dress code and curfew timings, the students’ union alleged, even as the administration denied these two claims.</p>
