      <p><a href="https://news.slashdot.org/~slack_justyb">slack_justyb</a> writes: <i>Mozilla has been heavily invested in WebAssembly with Firefox, and today, the organization teamed up with a few others to form the new Bytecode Alliance, which <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/mozilla-intel-and-more-form-the-bytecode-alliance-to-take-webassembly-beyond-browsers/">aims to create "new software foundations, building on standards such as WebAssembly and WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a>." Mozilla has teamed up with Intel, Red Hat, and Fastly to found the alliance, but more members are likely to join over time. The goal of the Bytecode Alliance is to create a new runtime environment and language toolchains which are secure, efficient, and modular, while also being available on as many platforms and devices as possible. The technologies being developed by the Bytecode Alliance are based on WebAssembly and WASI, which have been seen as a potential replacement for JavaScript due to more efficient code compiling, and the expanded capabilities of being able to port C and C++ code to the web. To kick things off, the founding members have already contributed a number of open-source technologies to the Bytecode Alliance, including Wasmtime, a lightweight WebAssembly runtime; Lucet, an ahead-of-time compiler; WebAssembly Micro Runtime; and Cranelift.</i></p>
