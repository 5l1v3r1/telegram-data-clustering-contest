      <p><b>Tool</b> are <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tool-announce-2020-tour-dates/">on tour now</a> with Killing Joke in support of their very good first album in 13 years, <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/review-tools-fear-inoculum-is-an-atmospheric-new-chapter-of-their-career/"><i>Fear Inoculum</i></a>, and they just revealed that the album will get a new physical release on December 13, which comes with a book.</p>
      <p>It includes “5 x 3D lenticular cards with exclusive graphics, an expanded 56 page booklet with additional never-before-seen art, a download of the groundbreaking immersive visual experience (video), ‘Recusant Ad Infinitum,’ and a CD.” Pre-orders are available <a href="https://smarturl.it/TOOLFIEXB">here</a>. You can see a photo of the bundle below.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this tour has recently seen Tool starting to revisit part of their instrumental “Merkaba,” which began as an extended intro to “Sober” during their late ’90s tours and then became known as “Merkaba” and got released on the 2000 box set <i>Salival</i>. They played it for their first time since 2002 in Pittsburgh on 11/8, and according to various reports, they just did a small portion of the song and then led into a jam. Since Tool are <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tool-says-watch-and-listen-to-the-show-not-your-phone-or-risk-being-ejected/">cracking down on cell phones at shows</a>, we haven’t seen any video of it, but one sneaky fan uploaded audio of it from the Detroit show (11/9). It’s (unsurprisingly) not the best recording, but you can hear it below.</p>
      <p>The tour treks on, hitting Boston’s TD Garden on Thursday (11/14), followed by stops at Newark’s Prudential Center on Saturday (11/16), Philly’s Wells Fargo center on Monday (11/18), Brooklyn’s Barclays Center on Tuesday (11/19), Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun Casino Arena on 11/21, Aatlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall on 11/22, and more (<a href="https://toolband.com/events">tickets</a>). Updated dates are listed below.</p>
