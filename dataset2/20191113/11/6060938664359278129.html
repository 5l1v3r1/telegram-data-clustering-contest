      <p>BENGALURU: Defence PSU <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hindustan-Aeronautics-Limited">Hindustan Aeronautics Limited</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/HAL">HAL</a>), on Wednesday said it has has posted a strong financial performance registering a growth of 32% on revenue from operations of Rs 3,451 crore for the quarter ending September 2019 as compared to Rs 2,610 crore during the same quarter in the previous year.</p>
      <p>“The company’s performance is a result of streamlining the production uniformly so as to even out seasonality of business leading to bunching of revenue during the third and fourth quarters of financial year. This has resulted in uniform revenue in the first two quarters of the current financial year 2019-20 as compared to the corresponding previous period of 2018-19,” a statement issued here read.</p>
      <p>The profit after tax also registered a growth of 116% of Rs 624 crore for compared to Rs 289 crore primarily due to reduction in the income tax rates and re-measuring of its deferred tax liabilities.</p>
      <p>“HAL is confident of maintaining the similar growth rate in revenue and profit for the current financial year as in previous year 2018-19,” the statement read.</p>
