      <p>A Delhi court on Wednesday extended the judicial custody of former finance minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/p-chidambaram">P Chidambaram </a>till November 27 in the INX Media money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate.</p>
      <p>Special judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar passed the order after the senior Congress leader was produced before the court through video conference due to lawyers' strike in the district courts.</p>
      <p>The ED moved an application seeking extension of custody which was allowed by the court.</p>
      <p>Chidambaram was arrested by the CBI on August 21 in the INX Media corruption case and is currently in the ED custody in a related money laundering matter.</p>
      <p>The CBI had registered an FIR on May 15, 2017 alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007, during Chidambaram's tenure as finance minister.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, the ED lodged a money-laundering case in this regard in 2017. The ED had taken him into custody on October 16 this year.</p>
