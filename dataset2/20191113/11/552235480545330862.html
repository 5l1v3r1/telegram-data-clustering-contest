      <h2>Scott, 22, is a recent New College Lanarkshire graduate and hopes to make a big impression in his first pantomime.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:46:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor Farquharson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gregor-farquharson/</a></address>
      <p>Cambusnethan lad Scott Fleming is getting prepared for the curtain call in his first ever pantomime.</p>
      <p>Scott, 22, will bring his flying carpet to Hamilton Town Hall and Rutherglen Town Hall as the lead role in Aladdin.</p>
      <p>The former Coltness High pupil told the Wishaw Press: “I have always wanted to do acting, but changed to musical theatre when I went to college.</p>
      <p>“It’s my first ever time in a pantomime and I have the lead role, so I have lot to prove.</p>
      <p>“This is also my first professional contract, so everything has fallen into place nicely.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Scott studied two years at Glasgow Kelvin College, before completing a final year of studies at New College Lanarkshire (NCL) in Motherwell.</p>
      <p>Originally, Scott didn’t audition for the role of Aladdin.</p>
      <p>“I went in and read for the role of Wishy Washy at first, but the director asked me to read for Aladdin after he saw me.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect it. He asked me to sing and I wasn’t prepared, I had to go and find a glass of water before it was my turn.”</p>
      <p>And it’s also not too daunting for Scott’s first show, as the rest of the cast is made up of graduates from NCL.</p>
      <p>“The college get in touch with us every year and ask if we are interested, I’ve always said no but I was really keen this year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The cast is great too, and I can’t wait for rehearsals to start this month.</p>
      <p>“I think it will be an amazing show.”</p>
      <p>Scott will perform along side Steve Russell as Widow Twankey, Dionne Frati as Wishy Washy, Hannah Berry as Jasmine and Mellissa-Jane Deans as Abi-Nazar.</p>
      <p>The Hamilton show will run from Saturday, November 30, to Sunday, December 8. And the show will be at Rutherglen Town Hall from Wednesday, December 11, to Monday, December 23.</p>
