      <h3>HUMINGI na ng apology ang singer na si Morissette Amon sa talent manager-show producer na si Jobert Sucaldito noong Lunes sa pamamagitan ng Facebook.</h3>
      <p>Ipinost ni Jobert ang paghingi ng paumanhin ng mahusay na singer, at narito ang ilang bahagi:</p>
      <p>"Took some time to process things despite the schedules before me, but with much prayer and as I have never done this before, please let me start by saying sorry.</p>
      <p>"To Tito Jobert and Kiel Alo who was celebrating his birthday concert at the Music Museum that night, what I've done was out of character but I still do take full responsibility.</p>
      <p>“I guess I was also triggered by the surprise interview minutes before performing, regarding the issues between me and my family. This private matter is something I purposely did not want to openly share for fear that healing might not prosper between us. The moment got the best of me, and it wasn’t fair to those who expected me to come out on stage as one of the concert’s guests that evening.</p>
      <p>As Christmas is fast approaching, I am also reminded by the coming of our Lord and I am grateful for His love, kindness, forgiveness, and guiding hand in my life. Wishing you all and your families a happy blessed Christmas!”</p>
      <p>Tinanggap naman ni Jobert ang apology:</p>
      <p>"With this Morissette, anak pa rin kita. I am praying that after this, everything will be okay for you healthwise, mentally and emtionally. Hindi ako marunong magtanim ng galit sa mga taong umaamin ng pagkukulang nila-- that doesn't make them less as human beings.Kaya thank you for acknowledging and let's move forward for a better tomorrow. I love you anak."</p>
      <p>Iba-iba pa rin ang opinyon ng netizens tungkol dito. Marami pa ring tagahanga ni Morissette ang nagsasabing mahal pa rin nila ito sa kabila ng ginawa nito. Nauunawaan nila ang pinagdadaanan nito sa pamilya, lalo na sa ama nito na si Amay Amon na sinasabing tutol sa pakikipagrelasyon ni Morissette sa boyfriend (Dave Lamar, isa ring singer) nito dahil sa hinalang nagiging malaking influence ito sa buhay ng dalaga in a negative way.</p>
      <p>In the end, husay pa rin sa pagkanta ang dapat na tingnan at hindi ang attitude. To each his own.</p>
