      <h2>You can see the "fake Ailsa" from your window</h2>

      <p>In days of yore, travellers on foot or horseback thought they were nearing their destination.</p>
      <p>Ailsa Craig was a helpful compass of its era as people headed to the coast.</p>
      <p>And they mistook Knockdolian hill for it, only to realise the volcanic plug of Paddy’s Milestane was about 13  miles distant.</p>
      <p>Knockdolian, at 869 feet high, is the dominant feature of the Stinchar Valley landscape.</p>
      <p>You get amazing views of the “fake Ailsa” from this rural bungalow, pictured below, called Auchenclery.</p>

      <p>It has a splendid elevated position about a mile and a half from the conservation village of Colmonell, so stomping distance for a thirst quencher at the Boars Head.</p>
      <p>Galloway &amp; Ayrshire Properties (GAP) has just put the house to market.</p>
      <p>Auchenclery is an all-on-the-level two-bedder with a wonderful panoramic view west to Knockdolian.</p>
      <p>The house is 1960’s built and enjoys gravel parking to the front and a big lawn at the back.</p>
      <p>The dominant room is the lounge, with a floor to ceiling window, varnished wooden floor and a fireplace with log burner.</p>
      <p>Heating throughout is by oil as there are no gas mains in the countryside.</p>
      <p>You get a spacious kitchen diner - with sliding doors to the raised patio - with a separate neuk for a dining table. This area has faux Tudor beams which are an acquired taste of another era.</p>
      <p>A utiling room leads to the side garden via a handy porch.</p>
      <p>Unusually in a house of this size you get a big bathroom ensuite to one of the bedrooms and a separate shower room.</p>
      <p>The attached garage is 21 foot by 12 foot and also houses the oil boiler, and has light and power. It could easily become an extension to the living accomodation.</p>
      <p>Auchenclery is bounded by a fine old drystane dyke.</p>
      <p>GAP on 01465 713498 is handling the sale, offers over £143,750.</p>
