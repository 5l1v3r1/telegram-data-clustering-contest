      <h2>The horse is around 50 years old and has been fully refurbished by Evelyn McLare.</h2>

      <p>Sick children stuck in hospital over the festive period could be rocking around the Christmas tree thanks to the generosity of the mum of a Wishaw business woman.</p>
      <p>Evelyn McLare spotted a child’s vintage rocking horse at auction and thought she could use it to benefit two worthy causes.</p>
      <p>After submitting a successful bid for the horse she lovingly restored it to its former glory.</p>
      <p>It is now taking pride of place on the premises of a Coltness business.</p>
      <p>Evelyn’s daughter, Ashleigh Hamilton-Thompson and her partner Paul run Studio 1, a tattoo studio and barbers business.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They are encouraging parents to bring their children in and for a minimum £1 donation they can sit on the refurbished rocking horse, and have their photos taken.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all, everyone who donates will be given a raffle ticket with proceeds going to the Les Hoey MBE DreamMaker Foundation.</p>
      <p>Evelyn said: “I sometimes go to auctions and pick up antiques. I saw this amazing rocking horse, it is beautiful and I thought that’s worth a fair bit of money.</p>
      <p>“I was finishing refurbing it and didn’t want to just sell it on again, it’s vintage and must be around 50 years old.</p>
      <p>“My daughter Ashleigh owns Studio 1 and we decided we could raise money for Les’s charity.</p>
      <p>“We thought we could also donate the rocking horse to the children’s hospital for Christmas. The idea is the children can come in to the shop and have their pictures taken on the magic pony.</p>
      <p>“Every time a child rides the pony we’ll give out a free raffle ticket.</p>
      <p>“The prizes include vouchers for tattoos and men’s pampering days, where they can have their hair done and get a massage and things. We’re treating it as a race and calling on everyone to help us get the horse over the line and get it down to the hospital for sick children.</p>
      <p>“It’s all about bringing some joy to children at Christmas.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The raffle winners will be drawn on December 23 and the rocking horse will be donated to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>DreamMaker charity founder Les Hoey MBE said: “We will benefit from the sales of the raffle tickets and the children’s hospital will also benefit.</p>
      <p>“The rocking horse will be donated to the hospital and they are going to auction it off.”</p>
