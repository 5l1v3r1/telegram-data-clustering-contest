      <p><b>The Get Up Kids</b>‘ very good new album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/holly-herndon-jamila-woods-dreadnought-big-brave-get-up-kids-martyrdod-spirit-adrift-reviews/"><i>Problems</i></a> has a song called <b>“Lou Barlow”</b> (as in, Lou Barlow of <b>Sebadoh</b> and <b>Dinosaur Jr</b>), which opens with the line: “I saw Lou Barlow on the street / I don’t think he noticed me / I started humming all his songs, you refused to sing along.” And that’s pretty much what happens in the song’s new video, when the actual Lou Barlow walks right past TGUK co-frontman Matt Pryor outside of NYC’s Bowery Ballroom.</p>
      <p>The video adds a new twist, though: TGUK’s Bowery Ballroom show is sold out, and Lou tries to convince the bouncer he should be allowed in, because, like, that’s <i>his</i> name on the back of their new album! Unfortunately for Lou, no such luck… until the humorous ending.</p>
      <p>“We kept joking how hilarious it would be if we could get Lou Barlow to be in the video for ‘Lou Barlow,'” Matt says. “It was absolute luck that we both happened to be in New York on the same day. When he agreed, we were thrilled. When we saw how much he put into the video, we were floored. He was amazing.” Lou adds: “I acted the shit out of that.” Watch the Kerstin Ebert-directed clip below.</p>
