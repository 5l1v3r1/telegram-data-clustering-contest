      <h1>Manuel Pellegrini and Mario Husillos' West Ham transfer priorities in January</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers manager and director of football should be looking to strengthen the squad in the winter window...if they can</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:06:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>What has become apparently abundant during the recent six-game winless streak in the Premier League is that West Ham could do with some reinforcements in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Manager Manuel Pellegrini is not the biggest fan of the winter window but it wouldn't be one without the Hammers being linked to a host of players. Even if they were sitting in sixth rather than 16th, the rumour mill would be in overdrive.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini only brought in Samir Nasri as a free agent last January and that didn't exactly go to plan. Youngster Mesaque Dju also arrived but he was a recruit for the Hammers U23s with a view to progressing to the first team in the future.</p>
      <p>Despite spending the best part of £180m over the past two summers, there is a distinct lack of depth in Pellegrini's squad as it is currently constructed. There are few players snapping at the heels of the first team regulars to put pressure on their starting berths, while the manager has also seemed to be reluctant to throw the youngsters in so far this season.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He has shown faith in his established stars but there has been no sign of them getting out of the funk which is currently lingering over the squad as they have plummeted from joint-third in September to 16th in the table come mid-November.</p>
      <p>Director of football Mario Husillos has also come in for some stick after the summer recruitment drive has yet to bear fruit. Roberto has been a complete flop in goal deputising for Lukasz Fabianski but he was a free agent, you get what you pay for.</p>
      <p>Sebastien Haller, the club-record signing, has just one goal since August and Pablo Fornals is struggling to establish himself in the Premier League following his £25m switch from Villarreal.</p>
      <p>Whether Pellegrini and Husillos have any money to spend in January remains to be seen - they may well have to deal with the free agent and loan market. To be fair, who even knows if Pellegrini will be there to spend the money in January, though his job is safe for now.</p>
      <h3>Midfield</h3>
      <p>What has become apparent is that West Ham need a box-to-box midfielder as Declan Rice continues to put out fires left, right and centre each weeks which in turn is seeing his own form suffer for the first time in fledgling career.</p>
      <p>Mark Noble's form has dropped off and he has picked up an injury to boot but could be back for the Spurs game. But what is clear is there is a lack of mobility in midfield and that has coincided with Robert Snodgrass's return to the team. Not that its been a bad thing as the Scotsman has played well but the supply line to Haller has dried up.</p>
      <p>The return of Michail Antonio should help but the form of Felipe Anderson and Pablo Fornals so far has been a concern. They are more in an attacking sense of course but someone that can get about the pitch in a direct manner in the middle of the park is something the team is currently crying out for.</p>
      <h3>Striker</h3>
      <p>If Sebastien Haller, god forbid, went down with an injury that would keep him out of action then the Hammers are very limited up front. Albian Ajeti was recruited in the summer for £8m but seemingly isn't fancied by Pellegrini at the moment with only 180 minutes of Carabao Cup and two substitute appearances in the league to show for it - and both of those came in the past fortnight.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio would be an option to replace Haller but he is currently working his way back to fitness from hamstring surgery and could be back for the Spurs game but will take time before he can start games. After a third hamstring injury in recent years, the Hammers are being careful with his recovery.</p>

      <p>Xande Silva is another striker currently on the way back to fitness after he underwent emergency surgery on a bowel obstruction in the summer. He is progressing well but there is no definite timescale on his comeback and even then, he's only played twice for the first team.</p>
      <p>So Pellegrini could be tempted to try and beef up his options upfront. Haller is the clear number one choice but backups are in short supply.</p>
      <h3>Centre back</h3>

      <p>Angelo Ogbonna and Issa Diop were the incumbent defenders at the heart of the backline with Fabian Balbuena since replacing Ogbonna and summer signing Goncalo Cardoso in the background.</p>
      <p>Constant fitness concerns over Winston Reid however could see the Hammers look to bring in another centre half as backup, especially with Cardoso still only 18 and very raw in terms of experience.</p>
      <p>Reid has played 65 minutes for the U23s last week but that's it and considering his recent injury history, is still a way from a first team return.</p>
      <p>Balbuena had declined alarmingly since he was recalled at Ogbonna's expense which was a complete bolt out of the blue. Pellegrini siad Balbuena deserved a chance to play, how Ogbonna didn't only he knows as the Italian was in good nick, but that's by the by now.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini might want a bit more competition to fight for a spot alongside Diop, who is the established centre back now, for the future.</p>
      <h3>Full back</h3>
      <p>West Ham signed their two left backs up to extensions this summer and on the opposite flank, Pablo Zabaleta is out of contract and leaving at the end of this season.</p>
      <p>Neither left back has well and truly nailed down the position, Aaron Cresswell has it at the moment but who knows how long that'll last, so were the club potentially looking at them retaining some transfer market value rather than potentially losing either Cresswell or Arthur Masuaku on the cheap? It's a cynical point of view, but think about it.</p>
      <p>Ben Johnson has been injured for the past two months so will need time to get back to full fitness and push for a place but that said, a potential incumbent on either flank is there already to take the left back place or to push Ryan Fredericks at right back. Johnson has proved he is adept in both positions in his, admittedly limited, first team outings.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>Fredericks looks to be over the injury issues that blighted his debut campaign but then Pellegrini dropped him entirely for the draw with Sheffield United completely out of the blue before belatedly drafting him back in. So is he still unconvinced by the Englishman?</p>
