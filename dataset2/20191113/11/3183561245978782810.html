      <p>Music plays a huge part in all of our lives, from our morning commute to "me" time, but some of us like music a bit more than others. Finding the perfect gifts for your audiophile friends and family can be difficult sometimes, but there's a treasure trove of wonderful tech and gadgets out there for the musically-minded. Here are our picks of the bunch, and ones that are sure to keep those feel-good music vibes flowing.</p>

      <p>Turntables are back in fashion, and not just because retro is cool again. They're a great way to listen to music as god intended, with crisp, clear and booming sound quality. As far as first turntables go, the Pro-Ject Primary E is a great option and while it's fairly simple, it won't break the bank. It also comes <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/best-buys/hi-fi/best-turntables">highly recommended</a>, and in a field dominated by cheap, hollow-sounding knock-offs, that quality means the world.</p>

      <p>It doesn't have to be <i>Twin Peaks</i>. Heck, it can be anything you want it to be, but if you're planning on forking out for a killer vinyl player, then you'd best include some killer vinyl with it, right? Or maybe your gift recipient already has a vinyl player, in which case, your gift can be a thoughtful addition to their vinyl collection. Think about what types of movies, TV or music that they like, and get something nice for them to fill their earholes with.</p>

      <p>A Nintendo Switch on a list of music items? You betcha. It probably wouldn't be the first thing that you think of, but the Nintendo Switch is home to some killer music apps, including a cardboard <a href="https://amzn.to/33fCO6u">Nintendo Labo piano</a>, which you can use to create and control your own tunes. There's even a strange little <a href="https://www.korg.com/au/news/2018/0628/">KORG gadget</a> for Nintendo Switch, which you can purchase separately online. Who knew the Switch was a secret music making machine?</p>

      <p>A Spotify gift card is the gift that keeps on giving for the music lover. Nobody wants to deal with an influx of ads, and this simple (and stress free) gift is a win-win for you and your giftee. There's nothing worse than travelling in a mates car and having your jams interrupted every half hour by a chirpy sing-song advertising voice. A Spotify gift card will help you both jam on, and on (or at least until the 3 months is up).</p>

      <p>When Gizmodo Editor Tegan Jones reviewed these earbuds <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/07/sony-wf-1000xm3-truly-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-first-impressions-hands-on/">earlier in the year</a>, she claimed that Sony must have sacrificed souls to Satan to make these buds as good as they are. That should give you an idea of their sound quality, sturdiness and versatility. For the discerning audiophile, you can't go past a solid and well-made headset as the perfect gift, and the Sony WF-1000XM3s are a great option if you've got more of a budget for gifts.</p>

      <p>Alternatively, if your pal is more of an overear person, the Son's 1000XM3's are still the best in class for sound quality and noise cancellation of a year after their release. <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/02/sony-mh-1000xm3-review-wireless-noise-cancelling-headphones-six-months-later/">You can read our review here</a>. <a href="https://amzn.to/37939p8">They're also down to $369 now</a>!</p>

      <p>Yes, we're suggesting you buy your music lover mate some socks. But not just any socks — silly music socks! Novelty socks make for a great and practical gift, and while a kid might look at you funny for gifting socks, adults will love you for it, trust us. The amount of socks adults wear through a year is phenomenal, band getting a funky sock boost at Christmas is sure to lift their spirits. Having the socks be music-themed is just an added bonus.</p>
