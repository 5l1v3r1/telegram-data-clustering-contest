      <h1>Ed Sheeran look-alike fools fans at KSI vs Logan Paul with ringside seat and entry to VIP party</h1>
      <h2>There were a number of big names at ringside as KSI beat Logan Paul - but Ed Sheeran was not one of them, despite appearances</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:09:09+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Justin Bieber, Rick Ross and Wiz Khalifa were all ringside for KSI's triumphant rematch with Logan Paul in Los Angeles last weekend.</p>
      <p>And so, apparently, was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> .</p>
      <p>The singer seemingly took his seat in the most expensive area of the Staples Center and posted for selfies with unsuspecting fans.</p>
      <p>But the man they thought was superstar Sheeran was really a 25-year-old look-alike from Manchester called Ty.</p>
      <p>The stunt was arranged by YouTube star Josh Pieters who documented the adventure in a video which has been viewed more than two million times.</p>

      <p>Pieters booked Ty and flew him to Los Angeles and purchased tickets for the fight between the social media influencers.</p>
      <p>And as soon as 'Ed' landed at LAX, he was mobbed by unsuspected fans but amid fears they would be found out, Pieters made sure their look-alike did not give any interviews.</p>
      <p>Once at the fight, fans were still none the wiser as they asked for pictures with Ty - as did YouTubers who had millions of subscribers.</p>

      <p>Ty couldn't even go to the bathroom without being mobbed and was eventually taken to the VVIP area to avoid the crowds.</p>
      <p>He was then given a seat next to promoter Eddie Hearn who was also taken in but Ty and Pieters returned to their original seats when Bieber arrived and spoiled the scam.</p>
      <p>But the stunt wasn't over there - 'Ed' was whisked away to KSI's VIP after party at exclusive nightclub 1 OAK in West Hollywood.</p>

      <p>Ty - or 'Ed' - spent his remaining hours in LA in a mansion before returning to the UK following a whirlwind 24 hours.</p>
      <p>KSI beat Paul by split decision in the sequel to their first fight in Manchester last year which ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>One judge at the Staples Center gave Paul the nod but the other two - correctly - awarded the decision to KSI.</p>
      <p>The victor said: "I’m a dog. I don’t stop, I keep going," said the winner. "I was scared to fight last time, I was scared to get close to him; this time I just kept going. I've done it, I’m victorious.”</p>
