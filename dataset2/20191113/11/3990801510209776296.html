      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Satoshi Nakamoto used to say: Peel off the skin of this mystery and eat the tasty fruit inside!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, November 12 2019, at a price of $8,815. That’s a minor 0.63 percent increase in 24 hours, or $55. It was the highest closing price in one day.</p>

      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $20,309,769,107 was the highest in one day, 26 percent above the year’s average, and 54 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 431 tons of gold.</p>

      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 93.4 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $134,774 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
