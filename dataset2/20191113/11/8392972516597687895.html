      <p>Michelle tells Carla her suspicions over Robert after he lied about his whereabouts, mumbled about babies, and she found his 'big daddy' necklace.</p>
      <p>Robert is able to give her a plausible explanation to her questions, but things are about to get more complicated for him...</p>
      <p>Vicky is at the hospital for a check up and one of the midwives recognises Robert, so feeds back to Vicky he's been in an accident.</p>
      <p>Vicky rushes to his side, and Robert begings to panic.</p>

      <p>A care worker lets Roy and Carla in when they go back to see Richard, who is suffering from pulmonary fibrosis.</p>
      <p>Nina isn't impressed to see them, but Roy simply says he's Richard's online Scrabble partner.</p>
      <p>However, when he goes back later, Roy comes clean about who he really is, but how will Richard react?</p>
      <p>And what will Nina say when Carla tells her she'd be lucky to have Roy in her life?</p>

      <p>Emma is fed up of Steve and Amy's constant sniping so suggests they take it in turns to pick something fun they can all do together.</p>
      <p>Steve chooses first and it's a football match at Weatherfield County. Amy's less than impressed, but ends up enjoying the game more than she expected.</p>
      <p>Steve's not so happy though when Amy chooses a Little Mix gig as her activity!</p>

      <p>When Bernie suggests they splash the cash on a holiday, Gemma puts her foot down and insists her babies have to come first and that money is for them.</p>
