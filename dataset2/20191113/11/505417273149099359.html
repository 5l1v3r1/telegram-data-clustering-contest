        <b>Irish manager Mick McCarthy confirmed on Wednesday that Shamrock Rovers midfielder Jack Byrne will make his first start for the Boys in Green in their friendly against New Zealand.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Byrne has been in brilliant form for his club over the season, which has seen him <a href="https://twitter.com/PFAIOfficial/status/1193305497895669762?s=20">win the 2019 PFAI Player of the Year award,</a> the FAI Cup as well as his first cap for his country in their victory over Bulgaria last month.<br/><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/mick-mccarthy-troy-parrott-lee-oconnor-jack-byrne-ireland/">The 23-year-old is one of three youngsters in the squad, along with U21 standouts Troy Parrott and Lee O’Connor</a>, who the Irish boss confirmed will start Thursday’s game.</p>

      <p>Byrne impressed in his one and only cap for Ireland when he came off the bench and made a significant impact, having a hand in two goals, but it wasn’t enough to see him included in the squad for the following game against Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media on Wednesday as he confirmed the young trio’s inclusion, McCarthy highlighted what he wanted to see from Byrne in his first senior international start.</p>
      <p>“It depends on what he thinks his own game is I guess,” he began.</p>

      <blockquote>“I want him to do what he does for Shamrock Rovers which is, he gets a hold of the ball, passes it, he creates chances, gets the ball moving, he recycles it for others and doesn’t give it away.</blockquote>
      <p>“His deliveries are good. His penalties are excellent I seen that in the cup final that was a great penalty. I want him to show that. It’s not Denmark it’s New Zealand, a big international game and New Zealand are treating it like a big international game and for Jack it will be a chance for him to showcase what he’s got, because he’s got lots.”</p>
      <p>McCarthy also outlined that Byrne would be playing in a midfield three against New Zealand and pinpointed his development over the last year since his first involvement in the Irish setup.</p>

      <p>“He’s done so so much better in the twelve months. Maybe I’ve influenced that a bit or Terry Connor has, in his all-round game. He’s got no problems with the ball and off the ball he’s done far better.”</p>
