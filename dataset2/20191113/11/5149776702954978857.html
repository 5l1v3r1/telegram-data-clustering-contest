      <h1>'My players are excited about Notts County' - Barrow boss Ian Evatt relishing Meadow Lane showdown</h1>
      <h2>Two of the National League's in-form teams go head to head this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:55:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Ian Evatt feels his Barrow side are not getting the credit they deserve for their recent form, but admits they face one of their toughest tests at Notts County this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds have won nine out of their last 10 games to catapult them into the National League promotion race, a record they will be looking to maintain at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>They are the form team in the division having enjoyed some excellent results, but despite that, they are not receiving much recognition for what has been an outstanding run</p>
      <p>Evatt feels that fellow teams and managers respect the quality Barrow have, but says the media is yet to sit up and take notice of their achievements.</p>
      <p>“I still think we are going under the radar and that doesn’t bother me at all,” he said. “I think people in the game - by that I mean other managers and other football clubs, people that know the level - know the quality of our team and expect us to be where we are.</p>
      <p>“They’re very complimentary about how we play, how good we are, but I think the media, certainly press outlets, commentators and pundits, especially in our division, because it’s Barrow they don’t give us the credit we deserve.</p>
      <p>“I’m not bothered about that. They can say what they want about me, about us as a team and as a club, and as a town, but I know we’re very good.</p>

      <p>“We have to go out there and prove it and the longer we can fly under the radar the better.”</p>
      <p>A win at Notts on Saturday would only heighten expectation surrounding Barrow’s promotion prospects in what is their first game at Meadow Lane since August 1970.</p>
      <p>It looks an excellent clash on paper with Neal Ardley’s side having lost just three of their last 19 games which has taken them to eighth in the table.</p>
      <p>A win for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> would take them level on points with the visitors, and Evatt says it will be a considerable test of their qualities.</p>
      <p>“We’re just taking each game as it comes,” he said. “It’s an old cliché, but it’s so true.</p>
      <p>“Notts County is going to be a tough game, no doubt about it, they’re a big club, but I’m very much looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big stadium, with a big pitch, which should make it a proper football game. My players are excited too and I think we’ll go there and try and win, as we always do and see what happens.”</p>
