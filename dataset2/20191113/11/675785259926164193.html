      <h1>Man Utd's buy-back transfer clause details to re-sign Memphis Depay explained</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United sold Memphis Depay to Lyon for £16million back in January 2017, with then boss Jose Mourinho insisting on the clause being included</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:36:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>A buy-back clause is in place for Manchester United to re-sign Memphis Depay, Lyon chief Juninho has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils sold the Holland international for £16million in January 2017, with then boss Jose Mourinho insisting on the clause being included.</p>
      <p>The clause doesn't mean United have a define right over the player, but it does mean that should Lyon receive an offer for Depay then they are contractually obliged to inform the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>This is because United have a first option on whether to sign Depay, but would likely have to match the transfer fee received by Lyon.</p>
      <p>"It's true that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> have a priority to buy back Memphis," Juninho told OLTV. "These things exist in football. But until now, we've not received anything on Memphis."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> are among the clubs reportedly interested in signing Depay, and are looking to part with £50million to make the transfer happen.</p>
      <p>Should Spurs' bid be officially made then Lyon will contact United, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and co. will have a decision to make.</p>
      <p>Depay is in the final year of his contract, which would see the clause void. But it also means that the player would be available to sign on a free.</p>
      <p>Juninho added: "Each time there's only a year left on a contract, the conversation over a renewal becomes rather difficult. But I think that he's really happy in Lyon at the moment.</p>

      <p>"It's also the same with Moussa Dembele, but the president and those that know football are conscious that, if you want to start winning titles again, to fight in the Champions League and in Ligue 1, it's important to keep players like that in the squad for a long time.</p>
      <p>"For the moment, nothing is being done concerning Memphis. We'll start discussing a contract extension by the end of the year."</p>
