      <h1>Sonic's Creator Still Isn't Completely Happy with the Movie's Design</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:58:26+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, Paramount released a new trailer for its upcoming <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie, showing off the blue blur’s much-needed new look. The <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/12/the-new-sonic-the-hedgehog-trailer-is-here-and-oh-my-god-its-so-much-better">new version is so much better</a> that I can barely believe it’s part of the same movie, but some people still aren’t 100 per cent satisfied.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/nakayuji/status/1194242281508753408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194242281508753408&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dualshockers.com%2Fyuji-naka-comments-new-sonic-movie-redesign%2F">tweet</a> last night (translated by <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/yuji-naka-comments-new-sonic-movie-redesign/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Dualshockers</a>) Sonic’s original creator, Yuji Naka, said that “the design is much more Sonic-like now that he’s wearing gloves. However, his eyes still aren’t joined together, as expected. I can’t help but feel weird about that one point.”</p>
      <p>Amusingly, Naka seems to have had some weird fascination with the original design. In an earlier tweet, he said that “it seems they’re making it as if the old design didn’t exist, as the movie official account’s old tweets were deleted. I wanted to see a special DVD version of the movie which used the old design. Too bad.”</p>
      <p>A desire to sit through an entire movie with that old design feels like a weird bit of self-inflicted punishment. Personally, I wouldn’t be too upset if I never had to look at that weird blue rat ever again. Each to their own, I suppose, but given how unimpressed Naka was with the original trailer, I'm surprised he's got any desire to see a whole film of it.</p>
