      <p>Dalbeattie butcher Norman Neilson handed over more than £3,500 to charity recently.</p>
      <p>Norman raised the cash by taking part in the GB Ultras Race Across Scotland in August, which saw him cover the 215-mile route from Portpatrick to Cockburnspath in under four days.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In doing so, he raised £3,551 for services charity Combat Stress. They helped his son Kevin, who now lives in Moffat, when he was suffering with post-traumatic stress after serving in Iraq with the Royal Signals.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">Sixty-year-old Norman secured a top-25 finish in the race, earning him a gold buckle. His time was slightly slower than last year, however the course was three miles longer this time around.</a>
