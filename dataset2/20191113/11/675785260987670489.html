      <h2>Some 6,586 homes across the UK are paying more than £100 less a year for their TV Licence because they have an old-fashioned set at home and refuse to upgrade it</h2>

      <p>Almost exactly 50 years ago colour TV came to BBC 1 - but despite being old enough to join Saga, thousands of Brits still aren't using it.</p>
      <p>And they don't even have the excuse that they don't own - or watch - television, with the latests figures from TV Licensing showing there are 6,586 homes in Britain with black and white licences.</p>
      <p>TV Licensing spokesman Paul Cooper said: “Whilst only accounting for a very small proportion it’s interesting to know that some households still like to watch their favourite shows on a black and white telly.”</p>
      <p>But while it might only be a small number, there is a big saving on offer for people prepared to watch all their live TV in monochrome.</p>
      <p>While a standard TV Licence costs £154.50, it's just £52 for a black and white one.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>London has the highest number of monochrome homes - with 1,311 black and white licences in the capital, followed by Birmingham with 323 and Manchester with 245.</p>
      <p>But in a few years there might be no one left at all.</p>
      <p>The number of black and white licences is 97% down on the year 2000 with 575 disappearing in the past year alone.</p>
      <p>And people with black and while licences are missing out on more than just reds and yellows and greens and blues.</p>
      <p>That's because you monochrome licences don't let you download BBC programmes on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/iplayer">iPlayer</a> or to record any live TV.</p>

      <p>“When BBC One launched its colour TV service in November 1969, there were only three channels available," Cooper said.</p>
      <p>"Fast forward to 2019, and more than half of TV households have in some way an internet connection to their TV and access to hundreds of channels."</p>
      <p>For people looking to go retro, the good news is a working black-and-white TV can be picked up for less than £50 <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=black+and+white+tv&amp;_sop=12">from auction sites like eBay</a> - just make sure you have a set-top box or equivalent if you want to watch it as the old analogue broadcasts were switched off in 2012.</p>
