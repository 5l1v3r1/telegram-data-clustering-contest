      <h1>Charlie Flanagan rejects claims gardaí turning blind eye to border conflict</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:07:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Justice Minister has rejected claims that gardaí have been turning a blind eye to conflict in border areas in recent years.</p>
      <p>Gardaí have increased their presence in the area since the brutal attack on Kevin Lunney in September.</p>
      <p>It follows a five-year campaign of intimidation against Quinn Industrial Holdings directors.</p>
      <p>While the attack on Mr. Lunney prompted an investigation, Minister Charlie Flanagan does not accept that gardaí are not effective:</p>
      <p>"I accept that ultimately there hasn't been a successful conviction but what I can tell you is that there are pretty substantial finds on records available," he said.</p>
      <p>"Evidence has been gathered, arrests were made, files were with and are currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions so I reject any assertion from anybody that the gardaí have been turning a blind eye or the gardaí are doing nothing."</p>
