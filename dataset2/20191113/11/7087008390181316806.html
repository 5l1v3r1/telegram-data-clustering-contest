      <h1>Wednesday Crypto Market Watch: Bitcoin Standing Still As Major Altcoins Surge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:32:57+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin’s price movements have been rather bearish over the last few days. Yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap tried breaking up but got quickly rejected and recorded $8550 as of yesterday’s low.</p>
      <p>Since then, Bitcoin is slowly gaining momentum, and the coin is back at the past week’s consolidation range $8700 – $8800.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-chart-analysis/">reported </a>here yesterday, the $9,150 level that Bitcoin reached on Sunday and got rejected, was where the 4-hour MA-50 and the MA-100 met. Additionally, that’s the 78.6% Fib retracement level, so for the bearish trend to be reversed, the price of Bitcoin has to break that line, which is the critical resistance at the moment.</p>

      <h3>Significant Daily Gainers and Losers</h3>
      <h4>NEO (11%)</h4>
      <p>The Chinese-based cryptocurrency has been on a roll ever since the president of the country’s speech about blockchain endorsement. Today, NEO rises with 11% against the USD to $13.08 and with 15.8% against BTC, and the total market capitalization stands above $920 million. It was recently announced the listing on Binance SG.</p>
      <h4>Binance Coin (5.69%)</h4>
      <p>BNB is seeing a few days of green as the coin is rising with another 5.5% today. The current price is $21.5, and it has been increased against BTC to 0.0024.
