      <p>The agri-futures index, NCDEX Vice Executive President Kapil Dev said, "will act as a robust indicator of the broader market and its strong surveillance will give enough confidence to the traders".<br/><br/>NCDEX said it will launch tradable futures contracts on AGRIDEX on receipt of the regulator Sebi's approval.
