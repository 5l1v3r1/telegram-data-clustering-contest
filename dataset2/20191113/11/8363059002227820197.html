      <h1>Not Even Houmous is Safe From the Pumpkin Scourge This Holiday Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:30:07+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Love it or hate it, pumpkin spice has become synonymous with autumn/ winter and its insidious dissemination has now reached the world of dips.</p>
      <p><a href="https://boarshead.com/">Boar's Head</a>, an American delicatessen brand, has unveiled its Pumpkin Pie Dessert Hummus which - along with being spelled incorrectly to my British eyeballs - takes the classic pumpkin spice flavours of cinnamon and nutmeg and combines it in an unholy union with the chickpea-ness of houmous.</p>
      <p>Before you start retching into your PSL, the company's surprisingly extensive <a href="https://boarshead.com/search?terms=hummus#">houmous range</a> also includes a Chocolate Raspberry Flavored Dessert Hummus, and with vegan dessert recipes swapping in chickpeas for animal derived products on the reg, both variants could be bloody delightful. Who knows.</p>
      <p>The pumpkin houmous "delivers the rich taste of pumpkin pie with all the happy memories of the Fall season," so it's a bit late to the party as we roll into November proper. It's made from "creamy steamed chickpeas, real pumpkin, ground vanilla beans, organic sugar, and savory Fall spices like cinnamon and nutmeg," hitting all the notes of your delicious PSLs.</p>
      <p>It's currently only available stateside, which is where I happen to be right now, so I'm sorely tempted to buy a pot and eat it straight, or whip up one of the suggested recipes on the product page, although I'm sure that's cheating.
