      <h1>Pep Guardiola 'lined up for Bayern Munich return because his family don't like Manchester'</h1>
      <h2>Guardiola is still held in high regard by Bayern chiefs, having enjoyed a successful three-year spell at the Allianz Arena</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:00:16+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola is being lined up for a sensational return to Bayern Munich - and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss may be open to the move back to Germany.</p>
      <p>The German giants are looking for a new boss after sacking Niko Kovac following a miserable run of form.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is still held in high regard by Bayern chiefs, having enjoyed a successful three-year spell at the Allianz Arena in which he won seven trophies including three Bundesliga titles.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/bayern-muenchen/pep-guardiola-trainer-kandidat-manchester-city-rueckkehr-65990416.sport.html?wtmc=twttr.shr">Sport Bild</a> has claimed that Guardiola has remained in contact with his former club's directors, even visiting their training base a few months ago.</p>

      <p>It is also claimed that the Spanish boss still owns a flat in the city centre, having enjoyed his hugely successful stint in Germany.</p>
      <p>His family also felt at home there, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiolas-wife-returns-spain-20138657">the manager's wife recently returning to live in Spain</a> after failing to settle in Manchester.</p>
      <p>It is believed that their unhappiness in Manchester could hand Bayern an advantage in their pursuit of the manager.</p>
      <p>Bayern bosses believe Guardiola may be willing to return despite the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> legend breaking his three-year rule in a bid to secure City's first Champions League crown.</p>

      <p>He has previously spoken of his regret at staying for four years at Barcelona and opted to bring an end to his Bayern spell after three years.</p>
      <p>Guardiola has cut a frustrated figure at City in recent weeks and saw his side fall to a controversial defeat at title rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>Premier League champions Manchester City lost 3-1 at Anfield on Sunday to fall nine points behind leaders Liverpool in the table.</p>
      <p>Guardiola was furious after two VAR decisions went against his side and was caught on camera saying "thank you so much" to referee Michael Oliver after the game.</p>
