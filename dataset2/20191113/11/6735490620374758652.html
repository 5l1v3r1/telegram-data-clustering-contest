      <p>Speaking about the increasing popularity and acclaim for the series over its first five seasons, Levy admitted, “I don’t know how it happened.</p>
      <p>“I think inherently, the structure of the show always lent itself to: the more you watch, the more you’ll care. It was always our intention that you grow along with the family,” he added. “That the first season presents people in a very superficial light—and season after season, if we were given the opportunity, we would peel back the layers on these people.”</p>
      <p>Ending the show after six seasons has meant many emotional farewells, though.</p>
      <p>“We had to say <i>so</i> many goodbyes,” Levy said. “We said goodbye to our sets. We said goodbye to certain characters that didn’t come with us on location. It was just a lot of goodbyes. It did get to a point where I had to tell the team, ‘We can’t be acknowledging all the lasts, because it’s going to ruin me.’ We can’t say, ‘Well, this is the last time Dan picks up a pen,’ because I’ll cry, and I don’t want to cry over having picked up a pen. It’s not worth the tears.</p>

      <p>Recalling the last day of shooting on the series, Levy shared, “It was really, really hard.</p>
      <p>“The last day of shooting was the most emotional day I think I’ve ever had in my life. I cried for, I want to say, five straight hours, to the point where I had a splitting headache and didn’t know what to do with my life. I wept when I took David’s shoes off. I will never wear those shoes again—nor do I want to—but I was very sad to take them off.”</p>
