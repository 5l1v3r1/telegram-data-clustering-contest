      <h1>Age of Empires 4 gameplay reveal is coming tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:19:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/age-of-empires-4-everything-we-know/">Age of Empires 4</a> was announced back in 2017, but since then we've learned very little about the Relic-developed sequel—that will change very soon. We'll be able to see it in action for the very first time during X019 on November 14. </p>
      <p>In August, Xbox Games Marketing GM Aaron Greenberg said we'd be getting our first look during X019, but in case you forgot—I totally did—he's teased again with a gif. </p>

      <p>While the Xbox branding has dominated Microsoft's gaming stuff for years, it's still strange to see this quintessential PC strategy series unveiled at an event that bills itself as a celebration of all things Xbox. As well as the gameplay reveal, I wouldn't be surprised if we got a release date, too, or at least a release window. </p>
      <p>The first footage will appear alongside the launch of Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. It's a remaster that's approaching a remake in many areas, though the fundamentals remain largely the same as they've always been. It's a game designed for people who are already fans, and should keep them all pretty happy. Give my <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/age-of-empires-2-definitive-edition-review/">Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition review</a> a read for more details. </p>
