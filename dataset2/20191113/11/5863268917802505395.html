      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal Minister for Science and Technology Fawad Chaudhry has on Wednesday said that it is not practically possible to allow former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to leave the country without any [formal] process.</p>
      <p>The federal minister took to Twitter and maintained that the Sharif family should not do politics over Nawaz Sharif’s health and arrange the surety amount [recommended by federal cabinet’s subcommittee].</p>
      <p>The incumbent government has taken a big decision [regarding Nawaz Sharif’ health] but a conflict is ongoing between the Sharif family regarding the leadership of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).</p>
