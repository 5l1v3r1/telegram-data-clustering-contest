      <h1>Why Ronnie feels so grateful to Sarah</h1>

      <h3>RONNIE Liang has reason to rejoice as his “Love X Romance” concert at the Music Museum last Friday was a  sold-out affair. He delighted the audience with his very relaxed style of singing starting from the opening number where he did a medley of Michael Buble songs.</h3>
      <p>The concert is in celebration of his 12th anniversary in showbiz since his discovery in Pinoy Dream Academy in 2007. His renditions of “Basta’t Kasama Kita”, “Nandito Ako” and “Ikaw”, done with both Tagalog and Korean versions, are also a big hit with the appreciative audience. Also his production numbers with guest performers Ella Cruz and Janine Tenoso.</p>
      <p>But of course, what brought the house down is his duet with his very special guest, Sarah Geronimo, with whom he sang “Shallow” from “A Star is Born”, and their new collaboration song, “Liwanag”, composed by Marlon Barnuevo and which is now available on Spotify and other digital platforms. Ronnie was flattered to the bones when Sarah praised him profusely on stage, saying: “Kapag magkaka-anak ako, gusto ko kamukha ni Ronnie Liang, ang gwapo na, ang ganda pa ng boses. Walang halong biro po ‘yun.”</p>
      <p>Ronnie says in return: “I’m very grateful kay Sarah G for agreeing to be a guest in my concert. She’s always very kind and humble. Lagi n’ya akong pinupuri. Coming from her di ba, I feel so honored. Sinabi ko talaga noon kay Boss Vic na gusto ko siyang makasama sa concert ko at heto na nga, nangyari na and it’s a dream come true for me.”</p>
      <p>Before Sarah left the stage, she said: “I love you, Ronnie Liang!” And Ronnie quickly replied: “I love you too, Sarah G!”</p>
      <p>In time for the coming holiday season, another new song Ronnie did is “Sa Paskong Darating”, a touching Christmas ditty destined to be a future Yuletide favorite. There’s more to come for Ronnie both in his singing and acting career. But also, he is now a certified pilot and his dream is to fly an airplane with all his family members as his passengers.</p>
