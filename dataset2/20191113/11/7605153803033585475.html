        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 13 – Gor Mahia head coach Steve Polack believes the team’s trip to Benghazi in Libya for the international break will be a welcome breathe of life as they look to keep their early season problems behind their back and focus on defending their league crown.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gor will travel to Benghazi on Thursday evening after a short stay in Cairo ahead of their friendly match against their hosts Al Ahli on Saturday. They arrived in Cairo on Tuesday where they will transit to the neighboring Libya.</p>
      <p>“We are going away which is a good thing. It is a match with no pressure, away from home and an opportunity for us to do some stuff and train. It will also be a chance for us to calm down and focus. It’s like a small vacation for us,” Polack told <i>Capital Sport.</i></p>
      <p>Gor were eliminated from the CAF Confederations Cup after losing to DR Congo’s DC Motema Pembe in the play-offs, that loss coming on the backdrop of a silent player mutiny over unpaid salaries and allowances.</p>
      <p>They went on to lose their first league match 1-0 to Mathare United, but bounced back from that midweek loss to an emphatic 4-1 victory over arch rivals AFC Leopards in the Mashemeji Derby last Sunday at Kasarani.</p>

      <p>Polack believes that victory, and the much needed rest in the away trip to Benghazi will put his side back into focus as they look to clinch a record 19<sup>th</sup> league title.</p>
      <p>“I was over the moon and lost for words over that victory. Our first half was terrible to be honest. Some few words were said at half time and I am glad that they responded with a good performance in the second half. When we went 2-0 up, I knew we had won the game,” the tactician recollected.</p>
      <p>“That victory gives great confidence to the team because we bounced back from a loss with style. We go to the break feeling confident because we are top of the league,” the tactician offered.</p>
      <p>Gor travel to Benghazi for the fully paid friendly match which Polack will use to test most of his fringe players especially with most of the first team stars involved with their national teams.</p>
      <p>The game will be played on Saturday night.</p>
