      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T11:40:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">Real estate </a>developers are currently facing a huge cash crunch, but the situation is likely to improve with the government announcing a Rs 25,000-crore fund to complete stalled housing projects, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jll-india">JLL India </a>CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The government should ensure that this fund is disbursed to the identified stalled <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/housing-projects">housing projects </a>quickly and in a transparent manner, he added.</p>
      <p>"There is absolutely no liquidity in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">real estate </a>market. Developers are not getting funds from the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)," Nair said, while speaking on the sidelines of a hackathon event to select three proptech (property tech) startups.</p>
      <p>He said the NBFCs, which have been the major source of funding for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">real estate </a>developers from last many years are facing liquidity crunch post IL&amp;FS default. However, Nair said the situation is likely to improve with setting up of this alternate investment fund (AIF) with a corpus of Rs 25,000 crore.</p>

      <p>"This Rs 25,000 crore fund will ease the liquidity situation. But one has to see how fast and how transparent it can be done," he added.</p>
      <p>Recently, the central government approved a Rs 25,000 crore fund to help complete over 1,500 stalled <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/housing-projects">housing projects </a>including ones that have been declared NPAs or admitted for insolvency proceedings. The move is likely to help 4.58 lakh housing units across the country. Only RERA-registered projects with positive net-worth will be provided funds.</p>
      <p>On hackathon, he said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jll-india">JLL India </a>has partnered with Invest India to launch an accelerator programme for supporting those startups which are working on developing technology solutions for the real estate sector.</p>
      <p>"We got 2,000 registrations from startups, of which we selected around 700 startups in the first stage and then 60 startups," he said.</p>
      <p>Nair said three startups will be selected finally by jury members.</p>
