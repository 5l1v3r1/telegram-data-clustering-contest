      <h1>Elon Musk: Brexit uncertainty made it ‘too risky’ to put Tesla plant in UK</h1>
      <h2>Billionaire picked Berlin for his first European base.</h2>

      <p>Elon Musk chose Germany ahead of the U.K. for his first European Tesla factory because Brexit made it "too risky."</p>
      <p>The billionaire announced Tuesday that he was opening a Tesla research and development base in Berlin, saying at an awards ceremony: "Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we are locating our gigafactory Europe in Germany."</p>
      <p>After the announcement, Musk told <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/108395/tesla-gigafactory-europe-to-be-built-in-germany-not-uk-as-elon-musk-blames-brexit">Auto Express</a> that “Brexit [uncertainty] made it too risky to put a gigafactory in the UK.”</p>
      <p>In 2014, Musk told the same trade publication that he <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/tesla/model-s/87332/tesla-plans-uk-rd-base-charging-network-and-25k-3-series-rival">wanted to build a plant</a> in the U.K. and in November 2016 said Brexit was not likely to have "a significant impact" on Tesla's plans.</p>
