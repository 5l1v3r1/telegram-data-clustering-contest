      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:26:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:26</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Day</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals">Prince Charles</a>' Instagram page has taken a personal turn.</p>
      <p>For the first time, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-charles-falls-victim-million-dollar-art-scandal">Charles,</a> 70, shared a statement himself rather than a message from his office, according to <a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-charles-shares-his-first-ever-instagram-post-ahead-of-trip-to-india/">People magazine</a>.</p>
      <p>The photo, posted as Charles prepares to visit India, features himself with his wife <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/queen-elizabeth-duchess-camilla-appear-together">Camilla</a> during their 2017 visit to the country.</p>

      <p>"As I depart for India, on my tenth official visit, I did just want to convey my warmest best wishes to all of you in the Sikh Community in the United Kingdom, and across the Commonwealth, on the 550th Birth Anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji," Charles captioned the photo.</p>

      <p>"The principles on which Guru Nanak founded the Sikh religion, and which guide your lives to this day, are ones which can inspire us all – hard work, fairness, respect, and selfless service to others," the lengthy post continued. "In embodying these values, Sikhs have made the most profound contribution to the life of this country, and continue to do so, in every imaginable field, just as you do in so many other places around the world."</p>
