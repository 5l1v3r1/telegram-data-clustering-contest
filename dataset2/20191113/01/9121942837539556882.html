      <p>BERLIN (AP) — The German parliament’s legal affairs committee on Wednesday ousted its chairman, a member of the far-right Alternative for Germany, amid anger over a string of provocative comments.</p>
      <p>The committee voted 37-6 Wednesday to remove chairman Stephan Brandner, center-left lawmaker Florian Post wrote on Twitter. It is the first time in the parliament’s 70-year history that a committee chairman has been voted out.</p>
      <p>Brandner has repeatedly angered lawmakers from other parties over recent months, including with broadsides against opponents and by retweeting a reaction to the killing of two passers-by in a botched attack by a right-wing extremist on a synagogue last month that many considered objectionable.</p>
      <p>That was followed by a tweet railing against singer Udo Lindenberg, who is critical of Alternative for Germany, and a decoration Lindenberg received, in which Brandner used the term “Judaslohn” (“blood money.”)</p>
      <p>Brandner comes from the eastern state of Thuringia, whose regional Alternative for Germany leader, Bjoern Hoecke, is the party’s best-known far-right firebrand.</p>
      <p>The general secretary of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats, Paul Ziemiak, voiced “respect” for the committee’s decision.</p>

      <p>He tweeted that Brandner, “Hoecke’s Berlin outpost,” had been “unworthy” as chairman and added that “his anti-Semitism is intolerable.”</p>
      <p>Brandner has portrayed himself as a victim of absurd accusations.</p>
      <p>Alternative for Germany became the biggest opposition party after the country’s 2017 election.</p>
      <p>It has dire relations with other parties. Lawmakers so far have voted down four candidates the party put forward to be parliament’s deputy speaker.</p>
