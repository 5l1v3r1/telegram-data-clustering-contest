      <p>Telus Spark is looking to alter its orbit.</p>
      <p>The Calgary Science Centre is aiming to inject “a giant dose of creativity” with a facelift to their facility dubbed Roadmap for the 2020s.</p>
      <p>The $21-million project, to be paid for by government grants and local fundraising efforts, will include changes to the dome theatre, galleries and atrium, while still maintaining its existing showcase of educational, science-based activities.</p>
      <p>“We are starting to raise the $21 million we will need as we speak,” said Telus Spark CEO Mary Anne Moser.</p>
      <p>“We have applied for $14 million in support from civic, municipal and provincial infrastructure grant programs. We hope to raise another $7 million from the community through a campaign called the Good Chemistry campaign.”</p>
      <p>Telus Spark plans to upgrade the dome theatre and atrium, renovate all of the galleries, create a “Space Bar and Astronaut Ice Cream” concession, and build a collection of unusual gadgets the floor staff will wear “to enhance the visitor touch point.”</p>
      <p>The new direction was crafted through a consultation process involving 850 community members over a four-month period.</p>
      <p>Telus Spark continues the tradition of the city’s original science centre that opened in the downtown’s west end in 1967.</p>
      <p>It’s operated through private and corporate donations, public funding and financial infusions from its title sponsor, Telus.</p>
