      <p>DERRY'S Nadine Coyle has appealed for prayers and novenas ahead of her journey into the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>The former Girls Aloud singer made the call as it was confirmed she is among 10 stars set to take part in this year's reality television series I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>"Light your candles, say your novenas..... it’s true," she wrote on social media.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old will join Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Kate Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa in the jungle and has described how she hopes that appearing on the show will help her conquer her fears and grow in confidence.</p>
      <p>Coyle yesterday became the ninth celebrity to touch down in Australia ahead of the start of the show on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Dressed in black with her hair tied back and pulling a Louis Vuitton suitcase, the mother-of-one was all smiles when she arrived at Brisbane airport.</p>
      <p>She was whisked away in a chauffeured car for her last few days of luxury before entering the jungle.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the start of the ITV series, Coyle said she knows she will have to face her fears.</p>
      <p>"I really want to try something completely new," she said.</p>
      <p>"I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave.</p>
      <p>"In the past, I've opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these.</p>
      <p>"Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid."</p>
      <p>With the prospect of having to live on food rations and undertake challenges involving creepy crawlies, the singer admitted she was scared of "heights, rats, snakes - everything".</p>

      <p>She also said her loved ones had mixed emotions about her new TV challenge.</p>
      <p>"Some of my friends and family were really shocked," she said.</p>
      <p>"They asked me what I was doing and pointed out I was afraid of my own shadow.</p>
      <p>"But I am just hoping my jungle lady will come out."</p>
      <p>But she said she hoped the experience would have a positive impact on her.</p>
      <p>"I've never boiled water on a fire, chopped firewood, slept outside - I do hope I learn stuff about me and it's the next phase," she said.</p>
      <p>"I really hope that by doing this, it pushes me so far out the comfort zone and that I learn to be comfortable, feel relaxed and do the things that I didn't used to be afraid of."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! starts on Sunday on ITV at 9pm.</p>
