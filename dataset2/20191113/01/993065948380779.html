      <p>
        <b>The Irish News, November 13 2009: Down SFL Division Two final: An Riocht 1-14 Ballyholland 2-8</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Martin Clarke last played for An Riocht at Pairc Esler it was in the Division One SFL final two years ago.</p>
      <p>He was home on holiday then and played a significant part in his club beating Kilcoo to win its first ever adult title in Down football.</p>
      <p>Then the young Clarke returned to Australia to take up a two-year contract in the AFL.</p>
      <p>An Riocht, meanwhile, tumbled out of the top flight.</p>
      <p>Clarke has now returned to his home soil and last night he was back in the An Riocht colours, a triumphant return it was too as he contributed five points to An Riocht’s total.</p>
      <p>An Riocht were the better side in the first half with James Colgan and Paul Murney on top at midfield.</p>
      <p>Leading 1-7 to 0-2 they were rocked by a Kieran Murphy goal after 28 minutes which left the half-time score An Riocht 1-7 Ballyholland 1-2.</p>
      <p>Brendan McVeigh in the An Riocht goal was eventually beaten five minutes from time when Shane Mulholland punched a McAteer free to the net to reduce the margin to two points, but An Riocht held on.</p>
      <p>An Riocht: B McVeigh; M Trainor; A Cunningham; M Rodgers; J McVeigh; L McVeigh; D O’Reilly; P Murnay; J Colgan; J Cunningham; M Clarke (0-5); P Gartland (0-2); R Annett (0-1); J Clarke (0-1); C Killen (1-5).</p>
      <p>Subs: P Cole (0-1) for R Annett (40 mins); D White for J Cunningham (50 mins); N McArdle for P Gartland (55 mins)</p>
      <p>Ballyholland: S Maguire; D Campbell; A Haughey; R Mulvaney; P McAuley; D McCrink; R White; P Murphy; P McAteer (0-4); K Dunne; S Mulholland (1-1); J Patterson (0-1); K Murphy (1-0); R Murtagh (0-2); P Quinn</p>
      <p>Subs: J Barry for P McAnulty (half-time); C Barry for K Dunne (half-time); T Kane for P Quinn (40 mins); S Fitzpatrick for A Haughey (45 mins); A Haughey for D Campbell (55 mins).</p>
