      <p>After slight relief, Delhi and its suburbs have again been engulfed in thick blanket of smog as fall in the temperature and wind speed pushed the city's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>in the "severe" zone.</p>
      <p>Delhi's overall <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>index (AQI) fell to 467 at 6:30 am from 425 on Tuesday evening, according to System of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">Air Quality </a>and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).</p>
      <p>The PM 2.5 stood at 317 while the PM10 was recorded at 451.</p>
      <p>The air quality monitor also predicted the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR are expected to enter the "severe plus" or "emergency" category today.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists said the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital recorded on Tuesday morning a minimum temperature of 11.7 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest so far. It is two notches below normal for this time of the year.</p>
      <p>Most of the 37 air quality monitoring stations across Delhi recorded air quality in the severe category on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Faridabad (413), Gurgaon (511), Ghaziabad (461), and Noida (572) also choked on extremely polluted air.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category.</p>
      <p>According to SAFAR, the share of stubble-burning accounted for 25 per cent of Delhi's pollution on Tuesday, up from 18 per cent on Monday.</p>
