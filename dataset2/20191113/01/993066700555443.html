        <b>1. When did you think about a career in music and what were your first steps into it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I started pursuing music at the age of nine and began playing guitar and writing songs. I got the chance to go to a music workshop held by Glasgowbury Music Festival in Draperstown and I fell in love immediately. I started to think of music as a career around 14 as I gigged quite frequently and thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I nearly didn’t pursue it at university level as there was always a stigma attached that it wasn’t seen as a 'real job'. But I took the plunge and went on to study Commercial Modern Music at BIMM in Dublin and I am still performing and writing songs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Best gigs you’ve been to?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Malojian at Bennigans Bar, Derry. It was the first time I had ever seen this artist live and it was magical. The intimate setting of Bennigans and the three-part harmony blended perfectly. Secondly, Glasgowbury 2013 as the atmosphere, setting and the opportunity to perform at it made it magical. Finally, Beyoncé, Sasha Fierce tour at Belfast's SSE Arena. I was 14 years old and a huge Beyoncé fan. Her presence on stage was phenomenal and it really inspired me to see such a strong woman performing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Fantasy wedding/birthday party band?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would love to have Samm Henshaw play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. The record you’d take to a desert island?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Intoxicated by Martin Solveig because it puts me in a good mood whenever I hear it and I never get sick of it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. And the book?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Doctor Sleep by Stephen King. Why? Because I am currently reading it and want to know how it ends. The writing is also superb.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Top three films?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joker, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Get Out. I like these movies as they all bring different elements to the table – mental health, escapism and racism.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Worst film you’ve seen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slender Man – it was just really badly written and didn’t have much of a storyline throughout.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Favourite authors?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stephen King, JK Rowling and Kate Cann.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Sports you most enjoy and top teams?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two sports I most enjoy and played growing up was camogie and Gaelic football. My top team has to be my hometown team, Ballinascreen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Ideal holiday destination?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paris. I have been before and it was a dream.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. Pet hate?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have quite a few pet hates but the worst is people who are in front of you stopping suddenly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. What’s your favourite:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dinner?</b> Pizza.</p>
      <p><b>Dessert? </b>Either hot chocolate fudge cake or sticky toffee pudding.</p>
      <p><b>Drink?</b> Any fruit juice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>13. Who is your best friend and how do you know each other?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My best friend is my mum, which probably isn’t very 'cool' to say but it’s true. We are very close and she’s very supportive.</p>
