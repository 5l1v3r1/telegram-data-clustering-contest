      <p>A 20-year-old burglar who witnessed his father being stabbed to death as a youngster, was told yesterday to "grow-up" and stop living the life of a "second victim" or he faces the prospect of "longer and longer" prison sentences.</p>
      <p>Fionbar McMahon, who as a six-year-old saw his father Gerard Devlin being killed, was given the warning by Judge Neil Rafferty QC who jailed him for 13 months for the "particularly nasty burglary" of a vulnerable pensioner.</p>
      <p>The Belfast Crown Court judge told McMahon, with 55 previous convictions, including 12 for burglary, he had to choose between what he saw and happened to him as a child - something he will carry for the rest of his life - "or choose to become the second victim of what happened that day".</p>
      <p>Judge Rafferty then warned McMahon, whose address as given as c/o Maghaberry Prison, that, if he kept going down that road, "the sentences you will get will be longer and longer and longer and longer".</p>
      <p>Telling McMahon, who agreed with him, to "grow-up .... you either take life with both hands or just flitter it away".</p>
      <p>Earlier prosecution counsel Philip Henry told the court that when McMahon committed the burglary at the home of the 67-year-old man with mobility problems on February 28 this year, he was on bail and in breach of two suspended sentences.</p>
      <p>He added that McMahon, whose fingerprints were found at the scene, fled the house with cash, a watch and other items after being confronted and shouted at by his vulnerable victim who was left very shaken. However, as he fled the scene he inadvertently damaged the pensioner's stair lift.</p>
      <p>Mr Henry said that when arrested two months later, McMahon made mainly a no comment interview with police, but at the end of it said: "I can't remember doing any of this, but if it was me, I sincerely apologise".</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Martin Morgan said that McMahon had an unenviable, and unimaginable horrific and tragic start in life, and although it was no excuse for his subsequent behaviour, it had made life for him, more difficult.</p>
      <p>He said however McMahon was trying to make positive changes to his life, particularly since becoming a father himself.</p>
      <p>Mr Morgan said that McMahon had neither preplanned or targeted his elderly and vulnerable victim, and once challenged had quickly extricated himself from the scene, and had expressed and shown a "sense of remorse for the distress he has caused".</p>
