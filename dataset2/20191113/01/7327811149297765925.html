      <p>DARIEN, Connecticut (WABC) -- An arrest warrant has been issued in Anguilla for <a href="https://abc7ny.com/man-who-killed-anguilla-hotel-worker-appears-in-court/5485335/">a Connecticut man </a>charged in the death of a hotel worker in the British Caribbean territory.</p>
      <p>Scott Hapgood refused to return there for the latest pretrial hearing in the case, saying he feared for his life.</p>
      <p>Hapgood's attorney says officials in Anguilla have not assured his client he will be allowed to return to the US while on bond.</p>
      <p>Hapgood claims handyman Kenny Mitchel came to the family's hotel room saying he need to fix a sink before pulling out a knife and trying to rob him.</p>
      <p>Hapgood says Mitchel was killed in self-defense, but officials in Anguilla are now calling him a fugitive.</p>
      <p>A statement by the Attorney General said his claim of concerns about his personal safety and about judicial fairness in Anguilla are "totally groundless."</p>
      <p>"Hapgood's decision to abscond will not allow him to evade justice," the statement said.</p>
