      <p>The GAA in Co Antrim has agreed to pay compensation to a man disabled in the Kegworth air disaster after he was refused entry to last month’s senior football final.</p>
      <p>Toome man Stephen McCoy uses a wheelchair after being seriously injured in the 1989 air accident, when aged 16.</p>
      <p>The undisclosed figure will now be divided between a homeless charity, helping to pay for someone to travel to Lourdes and Cargin GAA club in Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>A former boxing champion, Mr McCoy’s injuries were so bad he did not regain consciousness for 18 months and spent three years in hospital.</p>

      <p>There was controversy after it emerged that the 47-year-old was denied access to the Antrim senior football final between Cargin and Lamh Dhearg at Corrigan Park in west Belfast last month.</p>
      <p>Mr McCoy had attended the Antrim showpiece with his brother when the pair were denied entry to the ground.</p>

      <p>Antrim County Board chairman Ciarán McCavana <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/10/14/news/antrim-gaa-apologise-to-disabled-fan-after-he-is-denied-access-to-replay-match-1737705/">later apologised</a> and said that “new volunteers were manning the gate and were told to adhere to Belfast city council rule of no car access after 2pm”.</p>
      <p>The Toome man was present at Corrigan Park when the two sides met in a drawn game the previous week.</p>

      </p>
      <p>There was an outpouring of sympathy for Mr McCoy, whose family is well known and respected in Co Antrim, after details of the incident emerged.</p>
      <p>His solicitor Joe Rice, of John J Rice and Co, wrote to Mr McCavana threatening legal action last week.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that Antrim County Board has agreed to pay compensation to Mr McCoy and last night reiterated its apology.</p>
      <p>Mr McCavana said: “We take this opportunity to again apologise to Stephen and are pleased to make a compensatory gesture to charities of Stephen’s choice.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased that this matter has resolved to Stephen’s satisfaction.”</p>
      <p>Mr McCoy’s sister Yvonne, who cares for her brother, said her family is still upset by the incident.</p>
      <p>“We are still very cross about the way Stephen was treated,” she said.</p>
      <p>“No person, never mind a disabled person, should be treated like that again.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we are doing this, that no disabled person will go through that again.”</p>
      <p>Ms McCoy added that “it was never about the money” and said the cash will be given to good causes.</p>
      <p>“It is going to be split between a homeless charity, Cargin club and Down and Conor Diocese to take someone who can’t afford to go to Lourdes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Cargin and Lourdes are the two loves of his life,” she added.</p>
      <p>Mr Rice said: “I welcome the change of heart on behalf of Antrim County Board and the deal that follows from it.</p>
      <p>“This was never about money from Stephen’s point of view and now the county board has realised that no disabled person should be put in that position again.”</p>
