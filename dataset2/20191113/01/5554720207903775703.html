      <p>Big Bollywood names descended to the posh south Mumbai residence of India’s richest family, Mukesh and Nita Ambani, over the weekend to attend the pre-wedding celebrations of the couple’s nephew Arjun Kothari. Prominent among them were Shah Rukh Khan, Anil Kapoor, Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput and Abhishek Bachchan and wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan among others. However, the two women who clearly overshadowed Mira and Aishwarya in their fashion game were Nita Ambani’s daughter-in-law Shloka Mehta and daughter Isha Ambani.</p>

      <p>Isha was seen greeting and conversing with her guests in a sleeveless <i>sharara</i>-saree designed by Anamika Khanna at the event. Just like her sister-in-law Shloka, Isha looked stunning in her classy outfit with brown smoky eyes and soft pink lips.</p>

      <p>Isha looked relaxed as she held conversations with her guests. Her relaxed mood at the pre-wedding party of her cousin was in sharp contrast with the serious role of a dutiful daughter-in-law that she was seen discharging at the Diwali function organised by her parents for the family-owned IPL team Mumbai Indians.</p>

      <p>Not content with one designer, Isha once again relied on her favourite fashion designer duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla for another saree during the event. Photos shared by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla from their official Instagram account showed Isha posing in a powder lilac and gold, French Chantilly lace saree. The creation, according to the designers, was lavishly embroidered in gold and silver <i>zardozi</i>, crystals, sequins and bugle beads to exceptional effect. “She (Isha) wore it with a tulle strappy, cold-shoulder blouse, encrusted with beads and crystals. The ensemble combines both exceptional craftsmanship and modern draping to create an impossibly romantic and elegant silhouette,” Sandeep and Abu were quoted by the fashion website <i>The Vogue.</i></p>

      <p>As for Shloka, she had chosen lace lavender separates with a similar colour long-line lace jacket. To complement her look, the Ambani <i>bahu </i>opted for an emerald and diamond choker. But what appeared to nail the look was her hair in soft curls with statement pink lips. Shloka’s dress was also designed by Anamika Khanna.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Aishwarya <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/stunning-shloka-mehta-outsmarts-aishwarya-rai-bachchan-mira-rajput-at-party-hosted-by-in-laws-mukesh-and-nita-ambani/272194/">had arrived</a> at the party with husband Abhishek Bachchan in a red <i>anarkali</i>, which she wore with bare minimum accessories. Mira Rajput wore a pastel shade <i>saree</i> with a ruffled neckline blouse accessorised with a diamond and emerald choker. Her Bollywood actor-husband Shahid had opted for an ivory white <i>achkan. </i></p>
