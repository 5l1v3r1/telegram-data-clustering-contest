      <h1>‘Jeopardy!’ champs James Holzhauer, Emma Boettcher set to face off again</h1>

      <p>It’s the “Jeopardy!” rematch fans have been begging for.</p>
      <p>After his victory in the Tournament of Champions semifinal Tuesday night, James Holzhauer — who won 32 games in a row this summer — will face Emma Boettcher on Thursday and Friday in a two-part final.</p>
      <p>Boettcher bested the seemingly unstoppable Holzhauer — a 35-year-old professional gambler from Las Vegas — in his 33rd appearance on the beloved game show on June 3.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old librarian from Chicago went on to win two more games and jut shy of $100,000 on the program, while Holzhauer raked in a staggering $2.4 million during his run.</p>
      <p>“Jeopardy!” lovers who closely tracked Holzhauer’s exciting chase of legend Ken Jenning’s regular-season consecutive win record (74 games) and regular-season earnings record ($2.5 million) are eager to see Holzhauer once again take on the contestant who brought him down.</p>
      <p>Upon returning to the small screen last week in the first round of the Tournament of Champions — which Jeopardy!” hosts about every two years or so, inviting back 15 of the most successful contestants since the last tournament — Holzhauer <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/jeopardy-whiz-james-holzhauer-dominates-in-tournament-of-champions/">dominated his competition</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, Holzhauer returned for the semifinal against Rachel Lindgren of Bend. Ore., and Steven Grade of Atlanta, Ga. Going into the final round, he had racked up $30,466 — which, at more than double the score of Grade in second place, meant he locked in a win.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Boettcher emerged victorious in her preliminary round handily — then <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/emma-boettcher-who-beat-james-holzhauer-on-jeopardy-may-face-him-again/">returned to win Monday night’s semifinal</a>.</p>
      <p>Monday’s game also made headlines because one of Boettcher’s competitors — Dhruv Gaur of Brown University, who won the student tournament — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/alex-trebek-chokes-up-at-jeopardy-contestants-final-answer/">penned a heartfelt note to host Alex Trebek on his podium screen</a> during the Final Jeopardy round.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The 79-year-old game show icon was visibly moved he read Gaur’s answer (in the form of a question): “What is ‘We [love] you, Alex!,’” with a heart standing in for the word “love.”</p>
      <p>“That’s very kind, thank you,” Trebek said after reading the question (which was not correct, given that the clue was “In the title of a groundbreaking 1890 exposé of poverty in New York City slums, these three words follow ‘How the'”).</p>
      <p>The beloved host — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/alex-trebeks-emotional-pancreatic-cancer-psa-i-wish-i-had-known-sooner/">who is battling stage 4 pancreatic cancer</a> — appeared choked up, seeming to hold back tears. He paused for a few beats before continuing the round.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, Trebek referenced the touching tribute. Monday’s game, he joked, “had laughs, it had tears and it had mistakes, and I’m just talking about myself.”</p>
      <p>In the Tournament of Champions final, Holzhauer and Boettcher will play whoever wins Wednesday night’s semifinal — Francois Barcomb of New Paltz, NY, Gilbert Collins of Princeton, NJ, and Lindsey Shultz of Pittsburgh, Pa. — for the $250,000 grand prize.</p>
