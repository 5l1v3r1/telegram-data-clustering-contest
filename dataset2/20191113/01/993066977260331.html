      <p>TALENTED footballers won’t spend their summers hanging around to play in Tier Two, Down minor coach Steven Poacher has warned.</p>
      <p>Former Carlow assistant-manager Poacher predicts an exodus of players from Division Three and Four squads caught in the Tier Two net to the USA next summer.</p>
      <p>Only reaching their provincial finals will save counties in the bottom two divisions from second tier football and Antrim (Division Four), Down and Derry (Division Three) and Armagh, Fermanagh and Cavan (Division Two) are all potentially at risk.</p>
      <p>“If Down don’t get out of Division Three and end up in Tier Two I’d say some of their players will go to America, go travelling or on holidays,” said Poacher.</p>
      <p>“How can you expect a team to commit to this system? It’s ok for people to say the media coverage doesn’t matter but the media is the most powerful tool we have.</p>
      <p>“Take Paul Broderick as an example. He told me that Carlow’s run in the Championship and the Allstar nomination he got was huge for him even on a professional level. We are going to take those opportunities away from players in the smaller counties and the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.</p>
      <p>“I just think it’s wrong, we’re going down the wrong path now and bringing in rule changes like the ‘mark’ means what we have now is a hybrid version of the game. Every President wants to leave their mark and John Horan wanted to leave his but I don’t think they’ve really thought this out.</p>
      <p>“The financial irregularities are what they need to sort out - the fact that Dublin has a backroom team bigger than the Carlow panel! That’s the problem in the game, there needs to be more financial help for the smaller counties.”</p>
      <p>Carlow’s rise from alsorans to a series of David versus Goliath Championship showdowns has been used as evidence against a tiered competition. However, the voices of opposition fell on deaf ears and the new two-tier system was voted through at a Special GAA Congress in Cork last month.</p>
      <p>“It’s a massive blow,” said Poacher.</p>
      <p>“We were one of the biggest voices against a tiered Championship and the reason we were is very straightforward: We saw the impact that big Championship days will give you.</p>
      <p>“We had Monaghan, we had Dublin, we had Tyrone and that had a massive impact further on down the food chain with younger people in Carlow.”</p>
      <p>During his three years as assistant to Turlough O’Brien in Carlow the Barrowsiders reached a Leinster semi-final and had neutrals everywhere cheering for them when they took on Dublin, Monaghan and Tyrone in the Championship.</p>
      <p>“The GAA are taking away the opportunity for counties like Carlow to have a go at the big boys,” said Ballyholland native Poacher, a teacher at St Joseph’s High School in Newry.</p>
      <p>“We’ll never forget the day we had against Kildare in Tullamore (Carlow won a Leinster quarter-final by seven points). Yes, those days might be few and far between but they are 20 times better than winning a tier two.</p>
      <p>“Last year I went to watch Down play Mayo in the Qualifiers. There was 15,000 people packed into Pairc Esler and Down gave Mayo all they wanted.</p>
      <p>“Look at Carlow against Tyrone in 2018. Dr Cullen Park was packed! Those days are special days and they are taking them away.”</p>
