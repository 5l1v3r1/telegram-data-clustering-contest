      <p>CHENNAI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Car-companies">Car companies</a> may be battling the slowdown with job cuts. But new opportunities are opening up for auto engineers and diploma holders in organised used car retail — a segment that is expanding rapidly. Demand for used cars have seen an increase of 12-15% for over a year now. This has created such roles as ‘technical evaluators’. Head hunters say the demand is growing in double digits, albeit on a small base, and will continue for the next two-three quarters.</p>
      <p>Mahindra First Choice Wheels CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashutosh-Pandey">Ashutosh Pandey</a> said, “While there is a sharp increase in recruitment of vehicle inspectors and others in formal channels like used car dealers in big cities, the real employment impact is much bigger.”</p>
      <p>Mahindra, he added, has a vehicle-inspection business that is partially related to retail and partially caters to insurance &amp; finance companies. “We have 45% marketshare in that business and did 2 million inspections this year. Most of this is done by freelancers,” said Pandey.</p>

      <p>“Last year, we had 100 people on our rolls and 2,400 freelancers. Now, the freelancer count is up to 4,000 and most of this growth is coming from smaller cities,” he added.</p>
      <p>Currently, the organised used retail industry directly employees around 10,000 people, according to HR firm TeamLease. But the opportunities are more in the smaller cities.</p>
      <p>“The present staffing demand has been 12-15% for the past 12 months and is expected to increase by another 7-8% in the coming two-three quarters,” said TeamLease business head (manufacturing &amp; engineering) <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sudeep-Sen">Sudeep Sen</a>.</p>
      <p>Used retail is looking to tap diploma holders in automobile or mechanical engineering for this profile with six months to one year of experience of working in an authorised service station. Given that organised retail comprises only 15% of the 4-million-unit used <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/car-market">car market</a>, the job potential for this sector is substantial.</p>
      <p>Shubh Bansal, co-founder &amp; marketing head of online used car marketplace Truebil, said, “Growth of organised used car players is creating additional employment options for people who have been working in new car retail. There is a huge requirement of auto inspection engineers and sales executives in this industry, profiles that have traditionally existed only in new car retail. There are other profile requirements too, mostly in technology and product innovation. For example, inspecting a car requires a mix of a hands-on test drive by inspection engineers as well as ‘on-board diagnostic tools’, which connects with car computers to give data analysis.”</p>
