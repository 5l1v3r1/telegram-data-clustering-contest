      <p>An anonymous reader writes: <i>A team of academics has disclosed today two vulnerabilities <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/tpm-fail-vulnerabilities-impact-tpm-chips-in-desktops-laptops-servers/">known collectively as TPM-FAIL</a> that could allow an attacker to retrieve cryptographic keys stored inside TPMs. The first vulnerability is CVE-2019-11090 and impacts Intel's Platform Trust Technology (PTT). Intel PTT is Intel's fTPM software-based TPM solution and is widely used on servers, desktops, and laptops, being supported on all Intel CPUs released since 2013, starting with the Haswell generation. The second is CVE-2019-16863 and impacts the ST33 TPM chip made by STMicroelectronics. This chip is incredibly popular and is used on a wide array of devices ranging from networking equipment to cloud servers, being one of the few chips that received a CommonCriteria (CC) EAL 4+ classification â€” which implies it comes with built-in protection against side-channel attacks like the ones discovered by the research team. Unlike most TPM attacks, these ones were deemed practical. A local adversary can recover the ECDSA key from Intel fTPM in 4-20 minutes depending on the access level. We even show that these attacks can be performed remotely on fast networks, by recovering the authentication key of a virtual private network (VPN) server in 5 hours.</i></p>
