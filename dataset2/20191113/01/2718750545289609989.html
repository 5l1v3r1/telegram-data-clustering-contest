      <h1>All the <i>Friends</i> Are Reportedly in Talks for an HBO Max Reunion Special</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:19:45+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:19</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>Nothing is official yet, but <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-reunion-special-works-at-hbo-max-1254331"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a><i> </i>broke some big TV news on Tuesday evening. All six stars of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/09/1994-friends-seinfeld-er-warren-littlefield-transcript.html"><i>Friends</i></a><i> </i>and the show’s creators are reportedly in talks for a possible reunion special that would happen at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/friends-leaving-netflix-for-hbo-max-streaming-service.html">HBO Max</a>. Right now the proposed event is being described as “an unscripted reunion special” with the cast and creators, which means we’re not talking about a one-off episode or movie where all the characters come back together and catch up. Neither <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/friends-the-office-leaving-netflix.html">HBO Max</a> nor Warner Bros. TV commented on the story, and <i>THR </i>does emphasize that nothing is guaranteed at this stage. “Sources caution that a deal is far from done and agreements with cast and creatives still need to be hammered out. When and <i>if</i> deals are completed, the challenge then becomes sorting out everyone’s schedules. Of course, the talks could fizzle and the whole concept could fall apart.” So, the idea of a reboot is still <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/friends-showrunners-discuss-reunion-and-reboot-status.html">just as dead</a> as everyone involved has always says it is, but maybe — <i>maybe</i> — there will be some unscripted <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/friends-behind-the-scenes-gossip-casting.html"><i>Friends</i></a><i> </i>content coming your way.</p>
