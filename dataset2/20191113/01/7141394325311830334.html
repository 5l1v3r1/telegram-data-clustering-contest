      <h1>Derivatives Giant Sets Launch Date for Bitcoin Options As Clients Show Growing Interest in BTC Hedge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:40:05+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group, one of the world’s largest derivatives marketplaces, has set a launch date for options on its Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts following an initial <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/09/20/derivatives-giant-cme-group-to-launch-bitcoin-options-in-q1-2020/">announcement</a> in September.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2019/11/12/cme_group_announcesjan132020launchforbitcoinoptions.html">release</a>, the BTC options are scheduled to be tradable beginning January 13, 2020, pending regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>Options on a futures contract allow the holder to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option’s expiration date – without any expressed obligation to do so. The move marks the further financialization of Bitcoin in the form of traditional investment vehicles.</p>
      <p>Tim McCourt, CME Group global head of Equity Index and Alternative Investment Products, says,</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Since the launch of our Bitcoin futures nearly two years ago, clients have expressed a growing interest in options as another way to hedge and trade in these markets. <br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>We have worked closely with clients and the industry to establish a robust and increasingly liquid underlying futures market here at CME Group, and we believe Bitcoin options will now offer our customers greater precision and flexibility to manage their risk.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Since their introduction in December 2017, traders have increasingly been acquiring Bitcoin futures contracts, the CME Group reports. An average of 6,500+ BTC futures contracts per day, worth around 32,500 BTC, have been traded this year. </p>
      <p><a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/10/25/crypto-platform-bakkt-smashes-record-as-bitcoin-rallies-eyes-regulated-options-for-btc-futures/">Bakkt</a>, the Wall Street-based Bitcoin trading platform, is also planning to roll out options. CEO Kelly Loeffler announced that Bakkt, which has been gaining steam after a slow start, will launch the first regulated options on its Bitcoin futures on December 9th.</p>
