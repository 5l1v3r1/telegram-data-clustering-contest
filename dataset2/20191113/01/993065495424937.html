      <p>KEVIN Lunney was "tortured" in a "cold, calculated attack" which had echoes of paramilitary assaults, the taoiseach has said.</p>
      <p>Leo Varadkar told last night's BBC Spotlight programme that he was "horrified" by the kidnapping and torture of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director Mr Lunney in September.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old was abducted from his home near Derrylin in Co Fermanagh by a gang of four masked men.</p>
      <p>During the sadistic attack, the father-of-six had his leg broken in two places, his skin was sliced with a Stanley knife and he was doused in bleach. The letters QIH were also carved on his chest before he was dumped across the border in Co Cavan.</p>

      <p>Speaking for the first time about his ordeal, Mr Lunney told last week's Spotlight programme that he feared he was going to die by the roadside.</p>
      <p>"I thought are they going to shoot me. I thought that I wouldn't see the children," he said.</p>

      <p>In the second part of the programme, broadcast last night, the taoiseach said the attack was reminiscent of paramilitary beatings.</p>
      <p>"I was horrified by it quite frankly," he said.</p>
      <p>"I obviously heard some media reports but I think it's only when somebody recounts their own story that you can really get a full insight and understanding of what they went through.</p>
      <p>"This was a planned, cold, calculated attack.</p>
      <p>"He was essentially tortured and for me it brought back memories of the kind of attacks that paramilitaries used to carry out and maybe, on some occasions, still do."</p>

      <p>Police on both sides of the border are still investigating the attack on Mr Lunney. However, a fresh threat was issued against the QIH directors earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The attack was part of a campaign of intimidation directed at QIH, its management and employees.</p>
      <p>The man believed to be responsible for putting together the gang who kidnapped and tortured Mr Lunney died suddenly last week when police raided a house in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Cyril McGuinness (54), also known as 'Dublin Jimmy', <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/08/news/kevin-lunney-kidnapping-suspect-dies-during-police-raid-1760633/">collapsed and died on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>A career criminal from Derrylin in Co Fermanagh, McGuinness is believed to be the "boss" rung by Kevin Lunney's attackers during his abduction.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney revealed last week that during his ordeal one of his abductors made a phone call and said "Boss, this man is resisting".</p>
