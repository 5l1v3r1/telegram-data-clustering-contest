      <h1>Verizon’s new set-top box is possibly the worst option out there for streaming</h1>
      <h2>It doesn’t even support Netflix</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:03:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>In case you didn’t already have a Roku device, an Amazon Fire TV, a Chromecast, or an Apple TV, Verizon is launching a new set-top box called the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fproducts%2Fverizon-stream-tv%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com">Verizon Stream TV</a>. It’s free for new subscribers to Verizon’s 5G Home Internet plan through a promotion that runs <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsupport%2F5g-home-faqs%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com">until the end of the year</a><i>,</i> costs $69.99 otherwise, and it’s possibly the worst option for streaming on the market right now.</p>
      <p>First, and probably most importantly, it doesn’t support Netflix. I’m guessing that’s all you need to know to never want to use the Stream TV, and I would understand if you’ve now decided to click away to read any of the other wonderful articles on <i>The Verge</i>. (Verizon confirms it doesn’t support Netflix at the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizonwireless.com%2Fsupport%2Fstream-tv-faqs%2F&amp;referrer=theverge.com">end of this FAQ</a>.)</p>
      <p>But if you’re still with me, here’s what else the Stream TV offers. The box runs on Android TV, supports 4K HDR, and has the Google Assistant and a Chromecast built-in, which could theoretically be a decent combination for $70 if not for, you know, missing a key streaming service. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/12/verizon-stream-tv-box-android-tv/"><i>9to5Google </i>says</a> it<i> </i>will also come with a free month of YouTube TV, if that’s any consolation, and we know it supports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961089/disney-plus-free-year-verizon-unlimited-how-to-get">Disney+</a> because it’ll come pre-loaded.</p>
      <aside>It has the Google Assistant and a Chromecast built-in</aside>
      <p>Given that the Stream TV runs on Android TV and has a Chromecast built in, we’re not quite sure why you can’t just download the Android TV Netflix app or cast Netflix from your phone — perhaps the box doesn’t have some kind of hardware requirement for Netflix? Maybe it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20960441/netflix-ditching-old-roku-devices-because-of-drm">doesn’t support the PlayReady DRM</a>? Or maybe Verizon is just being petty. When asked why Netflix doesn’t run on the Stream TV, Verizon replied with this meaningless statement: “We’re always evolving the features and functionality of the product. We’ll share more updates as we have them.”</p>
      <p>There’s also a chance this actually <i>isn’t</i> the worst option out there for streaming. You could have been paying a $13 monthly fee for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20879610/comcast-flex-free-streaming-box-subscription-fee-price">Comcast’s “free” Flex streaming box</a>, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18276040/comcast-flex-streaming-announced-features-pricing">initially going to cost $5 a month</a> until Comcast decided it’d be sneakier to insist you pay monthly for a Comcast modem / router combo, and then finally changed its tune yet again last week to make the Flex free with just an Xfinity internet subscription.</p>
      <p>There are way better options out there. Verizon’s promotion for a free Stream TV with a 5G Home Internet subscription also lets you pick from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16341876/new-apple-tv-4k-review-2017">Apple TV</a> (unless you live in Chicago), an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review">Amazon Fire Stick</a>, or an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907056/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2nd-gen-2019-review">Amazon Fire Cube</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/11/30/18118550/best-streaming-video-player-4k-tv-roku-apple-amazon"><i>The Verge</i> recommends</a> the Roku Premiere because it’s pretty cheap at $39.99, still supports both 4K and HDR at that lower price, and can run just about any streaming app you want. And none of those are made by a telecom company.</p>
