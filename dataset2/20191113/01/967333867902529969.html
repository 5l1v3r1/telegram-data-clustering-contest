      <p>Musk also responded to one of the users' questions about the expected cut in price for the base models due to no import duties saying that he hopes they will be 10 percent cheaper.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, it was reported that Tesla was going to start its production in China.</p>
      <p>The company also reported that it had produced a record-breaking number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2019, despite the critics who question Tesla's prospects as a competitive electric vehicle producer.</p>
