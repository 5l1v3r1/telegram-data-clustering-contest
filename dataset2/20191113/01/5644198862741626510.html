      <p>Thyssenkrupp has received bids from at least three major bidding groups for a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's elevator business, four people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF: Thyssenkrupp has received bids from at least three major bidding groups for a majority stake in Thyssenkrupp's elevator business, four people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>Thyssenkrupp Elevator Technology (ET), which sources said could fetch as much as 17 billion euros (US$18.73 billion), is the German group's most profitable asset and has been put on the block as the conglomerate needs cash for pensions, to cut debt and invest in its other divisions.</p>

      <p>Bidders are pitching to buy a majority of ET, which would command a higher price because it includes a so-called control premium, the people said.</p>
      <p>The bidders are also prepared to take a minority stake if it helps to win over key Thyssenkrupp stakeholders. Activist fund Cevian, which is Thyssenkrupp's second biggest shareholder, favors an outright sale, while labor representatives oppose this.</p>
      <p>Finland's Kone , which has been interested in ET for some time, has submitted a bid and teamed up with private equity firm CVC to address potential antitrust concerns, the people said.</p>
      <p>Private equity firms Blackstone , Carlyle and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have also submitted a joint bid, these people said.</p>
      <p>A third bid came from Advent, Cinven and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Suitors are also prepared to make concessions on jobs and sites to convince labor representatives at Thyssenkrupp, which control half of the group's 20-member supervisory board.</p>
      <p>Top representatives at IG Metall, Germany's biggest union last month said they would not approve a sale of ET unless potential buyers give far-reaching concessions to staff.</p>
      <p>Japan's Hitachi , which had been the only other strategic suitor apart from Kone, has dropped out of the race, the people said.</p>
      <p>All parties were not immediately available for comment or declined to comment.</p>
