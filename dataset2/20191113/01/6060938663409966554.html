      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>'The Eleventh Indian' by Gautam Marwaha is a story that makes you feel proud to be an Indian.</p>
      <p>The book is inspired the story of Rohan Ruparelia, who was held hostage after the ship he was on was hijacked by pirates. The book follows Rohan, an Indian merchant as he departs on his first journey to Africa. Simultaneously we see the perspectives of members of the terrorist organisation Boko Haram, who are trying to establish themselves in Africa. Rohan's boat is hijacked and we see him and his companions suffer under their brutal captors and their attempt to escape.</p>
      <p>Though the book sounds like an action thriller, it has a lot of depth in the plot and writing. The story is riveting and the insight it provides into the lives and methods of modern pirates is eye-opening. The author, Marwaha is a serving officer in the Indian Navy whose tenure in Nigeria makes all the details of the story more realistic. The book can be enjoyed by those who enjoy fiction as well as those who like non-fiction.</p>
