      <h1>FNC’s Napolitano Dismisses GOP Defense of Trump -- ‘It’s Clearly Impeachable’ | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>On Tuesday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Your World,” network senior judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano dismissed the Republican argument that if President Donald Trump did attempt a quid pro quo with Ukraine, it would not rise to level of impeachment.</p>
      <p>Cavuto said, “Republicans will probably counter judge, ‘Well yeah, but the aid wasn’t—they did eventually get it, all be it delayed. I guess why I’m raising that is some go so far as saying even if there was such an arrangement, a quid pro quo it’s not impeachable.”</p>
      <p>Napolitano said, “It is clearly impeachable. Because the president requested something that’s criminal to ask for. ‘Can you help my campaign?'”</p>
      <p>Cavuto said, “But he didn’t say it.”</p>
      <p>Napolitano said, “Of course he didn’t say it that way. But he basically said I need a favor.”</p>
