      <h1>New £500,000 Novosco security operations centre creates 12 jobs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary McDonald Business Editor</a></address>
      <p>GERMAN-owned managed services firm Novosco has invested £500,000 in a dedicated security operations centre in Belfast which has added 12 jobs to its current 300-strong workforce.</p>
      <p>The facility at its Catalyst headquarters, which will operate on a 365-day round-the-clock basis, will enable Novosco to provide specialist high security services to organisations across the UK and Ireland.</p>
      <p>And the investment is the first since its acquisition last month by the Cancom Group in Munich in a £70 million deal.</p>
      <p>The 12 new recruits are all fresh graduates from a specialist cyber security academy run by Belfast Metropolitan College in conjunction with Novosco.</p>
      <p>They will provide services including monitoring and analysis of clients' IT systems to pre-empt and prevent security risks and attacks for clients including Cambridge University Hospitals Trust, a contract worth £107m which Novosco won last year.</p>
      <p>Managing director John Lennon said: “Cyber security is at the forefront of the minds of businesses and organisations across the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>
      <p>“It's business-critical that these organisations secure, protect and monitor their IT systems to prevent breaches that could have significant repercussions.”</p>
      <p>He added: “We have invested significantly in capital infrastructure, technology and people to make sure we have an offering that meets the requirements of organisations with complex and sophisticated cyber security needs.</p>
      <p>“Part of this was setting up a cyber security academy with Belfast Met to train dedicated security analysts to run the new centre, and as a result we have some of the best-trained analysts in the UK and Ireland.”</p>
      <p>Public sector reseller Novosco was set up more than a decade ago by Patrick McAliskey and John Lennon.</p>
      <p>It specialises in NHS, housing association and charity clients, and is on the NHS Shared Business Services list of pre-approved cloud suppliers.</p>
      <p>Cancom has 3,500 staff and offices in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Slovakia, as well as the UK and US.</p>
