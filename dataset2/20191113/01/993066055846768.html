      <p>A 40-year-old north Belfast man has been jailed for 10 months for possessing 32,000 Xanax tablets.</p>
      <p>Several tubs filled with the Class C drug were found during a police search of a house in the Newington Street area of Belfast in November 2017.</p>
      <p>Sean Rooney was linked to the find via fingerprints, and when his flat at Oceanic Avenue was subsequently searched, 28 grams of herbal cannabis was found in the property.</p>
      <p>Despite initial denials, Rooney admitted to possessing the cannabis and to possessing the Xanax with intent to supply.</p>
      <p>Belfast Crown Court heard Rooney turned to drugs and began to self-medicate following a family tragedy, and has since regretted his involvement with possessing the Xanax as he has seen the destructive affect these drugs have on people.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Philip Henry told Judge Stephen Fowler QC that the 32,000 Xanax tablets were located under the stairs of a house which was unoccupied and undergoing renovation and which was searched on November 17, 2017.</p>
      <p>When officers searched Rooney's apartment five months later, on April 5 2018, small amounts of cannabis were found at various locations.</p>
      <p>Rooney was arrested the day his flat was searched, and while he admitted possessing the Xanax tablets, he made the case he had been storing the tablets in exchange for Â£100 to clear his drugs debt.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Joel Lindsay said Rooney suffered a family tragedy in 2013 which resulted in him self-medicating.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Xanax, Mr Lindsay said it was his client's case that he was handed a couple of bin bags which he stored but that he had "no idea" there were so many tablets and "sheer panic set in" when he realised the number involved.</p>
      <p>Judge Fowler said: "It's clear the reason for him becoming involved in this is to fund his own drug habit - a significant addiction to cannabis."</p>
      <p>The judge also spoke of "the scourge of these drugs in society and the misery it heaps on others" and ordered the tablets and cannabis seized be destroyed.</p>
