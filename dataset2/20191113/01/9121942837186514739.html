      <p>LONDON (AP) — Women’s Super League leader Chelsea has signed Australian striker Sam Kerr, one of the most prolific scorers in the game.</p>
      <p>Kerr has played for Perth Glory in Australia’s W-League and the Chicago Red Stars in the National Women’s Soccer League this year.</p>
      <p>She scored 19 goals in 23 games to secure a third consecutive Golden Boot in the American league.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old Kerr is joining Chelsea on a 2 1/2-year contract and is set to start playing in the second half of the WSL season from January.</p>
      <p>Kerr says “the WSL is the best league in Europe.”</p>
      <p>With Kerr completing her transfer, the English Football Association secured a deal to sell WSL rights to Australian broadcaster Optus Sport.</p>
