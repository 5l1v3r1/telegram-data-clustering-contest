      <h1>The Oppo Reno 2Z is my favourite mid-range phone of the year</h1>
      <h2>A full screen, five-camera phone with a headphone jack and two day battery life? Yes please</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T01:22:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 01:22</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>There are too many phones. That’s just a fact. I’ve reviewed an awful lot of them and am privileged enough to be able to try out some of the latest and most expensive smartphones on the market.</p>
      <p>I was one of the first people in the UK to gets hands-on with the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-fold-3695308/">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a> back in April, for instance, and I’ve had my time with the iPhone 11 Pro.</p>
      <p>But the phone that has ended up surprising me more than any other this year isn’t a £2,000 foldable or one of Apple’s latest. It’s a <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2264&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3777720-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carphonewarehouse.com%2Foppo%2Freno-2z.html%23%21colour%3Dblack%26capacity%3D128GB%26dealType%3Dsf">£329 mid-ranger</a> that proves you really, really do not have to spend around £1,000 to get an outstanding smartphone.</p>
      <p>That phone is the Oppo Reno 2Z. Oppo has recently moved into the UK market with a steady stream of phone releases including the expensive Find X and Reno 10x Zoom. But the 2Z, which <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oppo-reno-2-z-3776090/">launched in October</a>, is a cheaper take on Oppo’s core design principles that still delivers multiple cameras, no notch, sleek design and great battery life.</p>
      <p>My only quibble is Oppo’s heavy Android skin that isn’t as slick and quick as OnePlus’ or Google’s, but I found in using the phone I could easily let that slide given the quality of the hardware. And yes, it's also on Android 9 Pie with no promise of an update to Android 10, but you can't have it all at this price. </p>

      <p>OnePlus’ phones used to take the ‘flagship killer’ label because they cost much less than the competition but still performed amazingly well. Now that the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oneplus-7t-3702822/">OnePlus 7T</a> costs £549 (still a great price), the Reno 2Z can step into the price bracket OnePlus has left behind.</p>
      <p>The 2Z has a splendid 6.5in 1080p display with an in-screen fingerprint sensor that’s better than the one on Samsung’s S10 and Note 10, and a pop-up mechanism hiding the front-facing camera. The camera pop-up is one thing about the phone I find gimmicky, particularly with the coloured LEDs either side of it, but when the trade off is a screen without a notch, I’ll take it.</p>
      <p>Performance is zippy thanks to the Mediatek MT6779 Helio P90 processor. I’m not a mobile gamer, so I was never stressing the phone out enough to notice the difference something like a Snapdragon 855 will give you.  </p>
      <p>The phone has one of 2019’s favourite smartphone trends in the 48Mp-led quad camera set up on the back. Only this main sensor and the ultra-wide lenses are that useful – the four in total is a bit misleading. The other two are 2Mp apiece and are only there for portrait mode and black and white duties. No matter – the two useful lenses produce excellent, punchy shots in most well-lit scenarios. I was confident to carry the 2Z around on day trips and be sure I’d be happy with the photos I brought home.</p>

      <p>I didn’t need to take a charger on those day trips either thanks to the 4,000mAh battery. It just goes and goes – this is a phone where I never had to worry about running out of juice, which is more than can be said for the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/google-pixel-4-3776096/">Google Pixel 4</a> which costs twice as much.</p>
      <p>When I did need to charge it, the bundled 20W fast charger was my best friend. Apple still ships a 5W charger with the £729 iPhone 11 by the way, even though that iPhone is capable of 18W speeds – so the 2Z is still faster to fill up.</p>
      <p>Let’s remember – the Reno 2Z is £329 with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM, twice the storage of the base Pixel 4 and the same as the Samsung Galaxy S10. OK, there’s no waterproofing or wireless charging despite the 2Z’s premium glass finish, but you don’t get wireless charging from the £850 <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/sony-xperia-1-3692627/">Sony Xperia 1</a> or Oppo’s own £699 <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-3695628/">Reno 10x Zoom</a> either. </p>
      <p>Overall, it’s not any one thing that makes the Oppo Reno 2Z stand out, but on mid-range phones this is usually the case. It’s the overwhelming feeling I had when using the phone that it is truly excellent value for money and feels like a flagship. It packs in slick design, a great display, solid cameras and outstanding battery life into a smartphone that made me question why I think I need one that costs two or three times as much.</p>
