      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Olbrich Botanical Gardens is preparing to show off its new learning center and greenhouses. </p>
      <p>The $12 million project will allow the gardens to have a dedicated education space for the first time. </p>
      <p>The space has several sustainable features, including a cistern to capture and reuse rainwater and solar panels that reduce energy use by about 35%. </p>
      <p>Officials said the old greenhouse was outdated and on the metric system but the new one supports outdoor gardens, the conservatory and education programs. </p>
      <p>They said the planning and fundraising for the new center have been in the works since 2010. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/416464042620785/">public is invited to tour</a> the space as construction continues, starting Fridays and Saturdays through Dec. 20. </p>
