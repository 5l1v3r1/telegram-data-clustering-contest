      <h1>Labour pledge to close pay gap between men and women by 2030</h1>
      <h2>The average gender pay gap for full-time work stands at 13.1% in the UK.</h2>

      <p>Labour has vowed to close the pay gap between men and women within a decade – 50 years earlier than the Government is reportedly currently on course for.</p>
      <p>The party would roll out a host of wage-related measures – including fining companies with gender pay gaps – to ensure women are on an equal footing with men in the workplace by 2030, senior shadow ministers have pledged.</p>
      <p>Dawn Butler, shadow women and equalities secretary, said it was “not good enough” that the gender pay gap would take until almost 2080 – according to equality campaign charity the Fawcett Society – to be closed under the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>“Labour’s real living wage, robust gender pay auditing – including fining organisations that fail to take action – will help us deliver real change and meet this ambitious target,” said the deputy party leader candidate.</p>

      <p>According to the Fawcett Society, it would take 60 years for that gulf to be bridged if the current improvement rate overseen by the Tory-led Government continues.</p>
      <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) estimates it would take closer to 35 years – until 2054 – to close the gap.</p>
      <p>It was Conservative prime minister Theresa May who introduced gender pay gap reporting for companies with 250 employees or more in 2017.</p>
      <p>Labour’s 2030 election campaign promise has been made to coincide with what is dubbed “equal pay day” – the day when women effectively stop getting paid for the rest of the year compared to their male counterparts due to the disparity in wages – on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The party’s pledges include:</p>
      <p>– Introducing a £10 an hour minimum wage.</p>
      <p>– Creating a workers’ protection agency with powers to fine organisations that fail to report and act on their gender pay gap.</p>
      <p>– To require all employers with more than 250 employees to obtain government certification on gender equality – or face further auditing and fines. The threshold would be lowered to businesses with 50-plus staff by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>– The details of the gender pay gap fine would be “open to consultation” but the party highlighted a similar scheme in Iceland where companies, depending on size and revenue, can face penalties of up to £355 per day.</p>
      <p>– Making gender equality certificates a necessity for companies bidding for public sector contracts.</p>
      <blockquote>These proposals would help bring about real change for working women<cite>Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary</cite></blockquote>
      <p>– Strengthening protections against unfair dismissal and redundancies, with extra rights for pregnant women.</p>
      <p>– Rolling out collective bargaining to raise the floor on pay across entire sectors.</p>
      <p>– Introducing national minimum-level pay scales in low-paid sectors with overwhelmingly female workforces, such as childcare and school support staff.</p>
      <p>– Applying pay ratios to private companies and enforce maximum pay ratios of 20:1 in the public sector.</p>
      <p>– Requiring large employers to introduce a menopause workplace policy to break the “associated stigma”.</p>
      <p>Shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock said: “For far too long the interests of working women have been at the bottom of the list of priorities for government.</p>
      <p>“Labour in government will be uncompromising in tackling the structural barriers that is holding so many women back.</p>

      <p>“Instead, they will be expected to take proactive steps to close it.</p>
      <p>“Labour will deliver the real change that women need in the workplace.”</p>
      <p>Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, voiced support for the “bold” policy plans put forward by the Jeremy Corbyn-led party.</p>
      <p>She said: “These proposals would help bring about real change for working women.</p>
      <p>“Too many employers are getting away with treating women like second-class citizens, especially when they have children.”</p>
      <p>Liz Truss, Women and Equalities Minister, said: “Yet again Corbyn’s Labour are overpromising something they cannot deliver.</p>
      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn will subject the British people to the chaos of two more referendums, meaning he won’t be able to focus on priorities like opportunities for women.”</p>
      <p>Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “The gender pay gap is caused by a wide range of factors.</p>
      <p>“Some of those – such as the availability of childcare, career progression and improved careers advice – require business and government to work in partnership to deliver lasting change.</p>
      <p>“93% of firms are already taking action – Labour should engage with businesses to get behind and accelerate their efforts, rather than adding bureaucracy with government certification.”</p>
