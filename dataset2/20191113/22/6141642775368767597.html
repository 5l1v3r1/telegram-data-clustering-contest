      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of “completely ignoring” Scotland’s vote to remain in the EU.</p>
      <p>Speaking as the Labour leader visits Scotland on a two-day tour, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said it would be “unforgivable” if “dithering” by Mr Corbyn means the country is dragged out of the EU against its will.</p>
      <p>He claimed Labour’s position on Brexit is as “clear as mud”.</p>
      <p>Mr Blackford said: “The SNP are campaigning hard to give voters in Scotland the chance to escape Brexit and take our future into our own hands.</p>
      <p>“By contrast, Labour’s flimsy Brexit position is clear as mud, and Jeremy Corbyn is every bit as guilty as Tories of completely ignoring Scotland’s Remain vote over the last few years.</p>
      <p>“However Mr Corbyn chooses to dress it up, there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Scotland, or for the UK – it will damage our economy, Scottish jobs and public services such as our NHS.</p>

      <p>“It would be unforgivable if Jeremy Corbyn’s dithering resulted in Scotland being dragged out of the EU against our will.</p>
      <p>“So while he is in Scotland he needs to tell voters – Will you respect their overwhelming vote to remain in the EU, or will you ignore the people of Scotland and side with Boris Johnson’s Tory party?”</p>
      <p>The call by Mr Blackford follows a vow by Mr Corbyn to deliver “massive investment” in Scotland if his party wins the General Election.</p>
      <p>He said voters have a “once-in-a-generation chance” to transform the country, as he outlined his promise to deliver a second Brexit referendum and provide more funding for public services.</p>
      <p>Scottish Labour Brexit and constitution spokesman Alex Rowley said: “Ian Blackford says Scottish Labour have a ‘flimsy’ stance on Brexit. Is he being deliberately misleading or is he really that ignorant?</p>
      <p>“Richard Leonard and Scottish Labour have been unequivocal on this: we support a public vote on Britain’s membership of the EU with Remain on the ballot paper, and Scottish Labour will support a Remain vote in that referendum. Was this position ‘flimsy’ when it was SNP policy?</p>
      <p>“The fact of the matter is that Blackford and his crew want nothing more than another Tory government to help bolster their weak and compromised calls for another divisive Scottish independence referendum.</p>
      <p>“A radical, redistributive Labour government supported by a cohort of Scottish Labour MPs that can govern this country in the interests of the many, not the few, would be fatal to the SNP.</p>
      <p>“But it would be transformative for our country. The people of Scotland know that. That is why they will not look fondly on Blackford and the SNP lining up behind the Tories to attack the Labour movement and its leadership north and south of the border, the only force capable of stopping Boris Johnson.”</p>
