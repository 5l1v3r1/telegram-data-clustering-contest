      <h1>Home Capital shares up as Q3 earnings rise, mortgage originations up</h1>

      <p>TORONTO -- Home Capital Group Inc. shares surged Wednesday after the company announced better-than-expected earnings and a share buyback program.</p>
      <p>The alternative lender's shares ended up $4.15, or 14.3 per cent at $33.15 on the Toronto Stock Exchange to mark a significant rebound from a share plunge two years ago when the company's future was in doubt.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Home Capital fired its CEO after the Ontario Securities Commission said the company failed to properly disclose fraudulent activity by some associated brokers, which led to a wave of deposit withdrawals and pushed the share price down to a low of $5.85.</p>
      <p>The company later reached a settlement with the Ontario Securities Commission, secured a bridge loan from Warren Buffett, and installed Yousry Bissada as CEO as part of a turnaround.</p>
      <p>Bissada said Wednesday that the company, whose share price has climbed steadily this year, has benefited from a rebounding mortgage market and a new path forward.</p>
      <p>"We had the benefit of a healthy housing market this quarter," he said on a conference call.</p>
      <p>"The pickup in the activity that began in Q2 in our major markets has continued into Q3. Economic conditions, including low interest rates, and strong employment data are supportive of a balanced market. We expect these conditions to remain in place for the rest of the year."</p>
      <p>Total mortgage originations came in at nearly $1.55 billion in the quarter, up 7.6 per cent from last year, while single-family residential mortgage originations were up by 16.8 per cent. The company's total loan portfolio grew 6.4 per cent year over year to $16.99 billion.</p>
      <p>Bissada said the company's focus on digital investments to help streamline services, along with marketing and customer service are helping Home Capital reap gains in the market.</p>
      <p>"While we're enjoying the benefits of a rebound in our key housing markets, the growth and profitability that we are reporting today is not only the result of helpful tail winds in the industry."</p>
      <p>The company said it earned $39 million or 67 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from a profit of $32.6 million or 41 cents per diluted share in the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Home Capital says it earned 72 cents per diluted share for its most recent quarter, up from an adjusted profit of 41 cents per diluted share a year ago, and well ahead of the 56 cents per share analysts had expected according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The rise in earnings was largely due to increased net interest income, which came in at $103.1 million, up from $89.9 million for the same quarter last year, while total provisions for credit losses amounted to $3.7 million in the most recent quarter compared with $6.1 million in its second quarter and $4.0 million in the third quarter last year.</p>
      <p>Along with earnings, the company announced it planned to launch a $150 million share buyback program, to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>The positive news pushed the company's share price to its highest level in almost three years, but Home Capital's shares are still well off the more than $50 a share it was trading at in 2014 before news of the fraudulent brokers initially broke.</p>
