      <h1>How to use Disney+ with the Apple TV app and Up Next</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:05:15+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Whether you’re just getting started with Disney+ or are already familiar with it, follow along for how to use Disney+ with the Apple TV app and Up Next features for a synced viewing experience.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/disney-app-now-available-to-download-on-iphone-ipad-and-apple-tv/">Disney+ app is available for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV</a>, among many other devices outside Apple’s ecosystem. But one advantage of using Disney+ with the Apple TV app is that you get a synced viewing experience across your <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">Apple devices</a> with the Up Next feature.</p>
      <p>While it would have been great to see full integration of Disney+ into Apple TV Channels, we’ve at least got some integration. However, keep in mind that this means choosing to play Disney+ content from the Apple TV app will open the show or movie in the Disney+ app. Here’s how it works…</p>
      <h3>How to use Disney+ with the Apple TV app and Up Next</h3>
      <p>
        <b>On iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>After signing up for Disney+ (rundown on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/how-to-get-best-disney-plus-deal/">best deals</a>) and getting <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disney/id1446075923">set up with the app</a> on at least one device, open the Apple TV app</li>
        <li>Pick a Disney+ show or swipe down on the <i><b>Watch Now</b></i><b> </b>tab to view all Disney+ content</li>
        <li>Press play on a Disney+ show or movie, then tap <b><i>Connect</i></b> to enable it in the TV app</li>
        <li>Now you can start watching content right from the Apple TV app (opens in the Disney+ app)</li>
        <li>For any show or movie, tap the <i><b>+Add</b></i> icon in the top right to add it to your Up Next list in the TV app</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>On Mac</b>
      </p>
      <p>Content added to Up Next from Disney+ will show up in the Apple TV app on the Mac app. But because there isn’t a Disney+ app on Mac, Apple just gives an option to watch/purchase it elsewhere, like the iTunes Store.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the process looks on iPhone:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Up Next is handy, as you’ll see both content you’ve started and paused across your iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV as well as shows you’ve manually added.</p>
