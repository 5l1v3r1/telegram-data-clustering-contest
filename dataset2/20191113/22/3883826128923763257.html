        <b>The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030 if it wins the election.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said.</p>
      <p>But the Conservative Party said that Labour was "over-promising".</p>
      <p>The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been "huge progress since 2010" in terms of the number of women in work.</p>
      <p>The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.</p>
      <p>The Fawcett Society said it would take until almost 2080 for the gender pay gap to close at the current rate.</p>
      <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC) puts that at about 35 years.</p>

      <p>As well as the new 2030 pay gap target, Labour also restated some policies that will become manifesto commitments.</p>
      <p>These included introducing a "real living wage" of Â£10 per hour and creating a Worker's Protection Agency with HMRC with powers to fine organisations that fail to report gender pay.</p>
      <p>Labour said the new agency would check firms with more than 250 employees were meeting gender equality criteria on recruitment, career progression, pay and work-life balance.</p>
      <p>Those that did would become certified. Labour would then lower that threshold by the end of 2020 to workplaces with 50 employees.</p>
      <p>It will also extend maternity pay from nine to 12 months and introduce free childcare for two to four-year-olds.</p>
      <p>Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, said: "Labour's real living wage, robust gender pay auditing - including fining organisations that fail to take action - will help us deliver real change and meet this ambitious target."</p>
      <p>But Liz Truss, who was the Conservative Women and Equalities Minister, said: "Yet again (Jeremy) Corbyn's Labour are overpromising something they cannot deliver.</p>
      <p>She said Mr Corbyn's focus would not be on opportunities for women.</p>
      <p>The Tories said the pay gap was "at a record low" having fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 17.3% in 2019 for all employees.</p>
      <p>The party added that female employment was at 71.8% according to the latest figures, close to a record high, and that it had launched a "roadmap for gender equality".</p>
      <p>Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said firms shared the Labour Party's goal but: "Creating inclusive workplaces where everyone can thrive is the only way to tackle gender inequality at work."</p>
      <p>He said the gender pay gap was caused by a wide range of factors - such as the availability of childcare, career progression and improved careers advice - which required business and government to work in partnership to bring change.</p>
      <p>But he said that Labour's gender equality certification plan would add "bureaucracy" for businesses.</p>

      <p>The causes of the gap aren't simple. Women are far more likely than men to take substantial parental leave, which can hamper career progression.</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that the more kids you have, the less likely you are as a woman to enjoy the same pay as men of the same age; and affordability of childcare is crucial to woman returning to work.</p>
      <p>But closing the gender pay gap is a knotty problem.</p>
      <p>The CBI, for example, says it shares the Labour Party's ambition to close the gender pay gap as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>But it doubts whether a system of fines and government certification will do the job.</p>
      <p>All of the measures Labour laid out to achieve it have already been announced; no new money is being promised.</p>
