      <h1>ABC News political analyst hits Elise Stefanik in controversial tweet sparking 'sexism' backlash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:21:55+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>ABC News political analyst <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-matthew-dowd-katie-hill">Matthew Dowd</a> faced heavy backlash for what critics described as a "sexist" attack aimed at Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.</p>
      <p>Stefanik one of several Republicans who spoke out against the Democrats' impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> during its first public hearing Wednesday, but Dowd singled her out on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Elise Stefanik is a perfect example why just electing someone because they are a woman or a millennial doesn't necessarily get you the leaders we need," the self-proclaimed "proud independent" commentator wrote in the now-deleted tweet.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-matthew-dowd-katie-hill">
          <b>ABC'S MATTHEW DOWD DEFENDS REP. KATIE HILL, COMPARES HER ALLEGATIONS TO TRUMP, SUPREME  COURT JUSTICES</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Dowd later doubled down on his assertion, telling one Twitter user the "first order of business should be electing people with integrity" and claiming a critic was "missing the point."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, that didn't stop the avalanche of criticism that Dowd received -- including from Stefanik's colleague, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.</p>
      <p>"Elise did a great job laying out the facts. And, not least of all, this comment is reprehensible," Meadows <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarkMeadows/status/1194715074084167682">wrote.</a></p>
      <p>Other critics piled on Dowd for the tweet, many of them labeling the tweet "sexist."</p>

      <p>Stefanik responded to Dowd by knocking him and MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who also attacked her on Twitter, while thanking Meadows for defending her honor.</p>
      <p>"It's a good thing I wasn't raised to measure my self-worth or professional work based on tweets from self-important <a href="https://twitter.com/MSNBC">@MSNBC</a> commentators like Dowd (who is he again?)!" Stefanik <a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1194718605662982144">wrote.</a> "I earn support from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NY21?src=hashtag_click">#NY21</a> voters bc of my focus on keeping my promises &amp; delivering #Results."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Dowd later claimed people were "misunderstanding" his tweet and stressed the country needs "more leaders with integrity."</p>
      <p>He eventually offered an apology to the congresswoman.</p>
      <p>"Hey @EliseStefanik, I just want to apologize for a tweet that is being misinterpreted," Dowd <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd/status/1194733225249083392">wrote.</a> "I didn’t mean to suggest you were elected only because you were a woman or a millennial. I deleted the tweet."</p>
      <p>He added, "I deleted the tweet and apologize. I in no way meant to suggest that we don’t need women or millennial leaders. In fact [the] opposite is true and I have advocated for that. I will be more careful in how I phrase my thoughts. Lesson learned."</p>

      <p>Stefanik then <a href="https://twitter.com/EliseStefanik/status/1194742195544305664">responded:</a> "Apology accepted <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd">@matthewjdowd</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics">@ABCPolitics</a> should be ashamed of your comment. This is one of the reasons young women don’t run for office."</p>

      <p>When asked for comment, ABC News directed Fox News to Dowd's follow-up tweets.</p>
      <p>This came after the "proud independent" <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-matthew-dowd-katie-hill">rushed in defense</a> of former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., who announced her resignation from Congress late last month after she was accused of having multiple inappropriate relationships with subordinates.</p>
      <p>"Katie hill resigning while we have a president and 2 Supreme Court justices all credibly accused of sexual harassment/assault is a bit like a jaywalker going to jail while al Capone roams free," Dowd <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd/status/1188895618883899393">tweeted,</a> in a reference to the notorious Chicago mob boss.</p>

      <p>He previously attacked President Trump and Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, who he said had "credible accusations of sexual harassment/assault."</p>
      <p>"There are two Supreme Court Justice and a President in DC today with credible accusations of sexual harassment/assault, and Katie Hill resigns. Ridiculous," Dowd <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewjdowd/status/1188619974727876612">tweeted.</a></p>
