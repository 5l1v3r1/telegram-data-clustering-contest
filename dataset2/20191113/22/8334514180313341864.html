      <p>The 16-year-old, who rejects air travel because of the high levels of greenhouse gas emissions involved, hitched a ride aboard the 48-foot vessel belonging to an Australian couple that sailed from the port of Hampton. She hoped to arrive in Madrid in time for the next U.N.-sponsored round of climate talks in December.</p>
      <p>“So happy to say I’ll hopefully make it to COP25 in Madrid,” Thunberg said in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, using an acronym for the U.N.’s December conference.</p>
      <p>Inspired by Thunberg’s solitary weekly protest outside the Swedish parliament over a year ago, millions of young people around the world have since heeded her call to demand that governments take emergency action to combat global warming.</p>
      <p>In late August, Thunberg arrived in New York in a zero-carbon emissions vessel after a 14-day journey from England to deliver a speech at the U.N. climate summit in September.</p>
      <p>Since then, she has traveled across North America, with stops in Canada’s Alberta and Iowa in the United States where she joined climate protesters.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, an artist unveiled a mural of Thunberg in San Francisco to remind residents of the dangers posed by climate change.</p>
