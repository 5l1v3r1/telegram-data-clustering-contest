      <p>Convenience store owners have been protesting the possible inclusion of a ban on menthol for weeks, while public health advocates called menthol's inclusion necessary to discourage youth smoking.</p>

      <p>The bill, dubbed An Act Modernizing Tobacco Control, includes an excise tax on electronic nicotine delivery systems at a rate of 75% of the wholesale price. It also calls for increased access to cessation services.</p>
      <p>The American Cancer Society Action Network (ACS CAN) on Tuesday gave the bill a favorable review, calling it "historic" and "comprehensive."</p>
      <p>"The Commonwealth has long been a leader in fighting Big Tobacco, and if passed in its current form, this bill would set Massachusetts apart from the rest of the nation in the steps it has taken to protect its kids from the risk of deadly tobacco addiction," Marc Hymovitz, state director of ACS CAN, said in a statement.</p>
