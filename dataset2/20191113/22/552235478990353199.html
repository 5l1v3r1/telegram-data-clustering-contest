      <h1>Celtic name John Kennedy Hibs price if Easter Road club pursue Hoops coach</h1>
      <h2>Hibs have Kennedy high up in their list of managerial targets but have yet to make an approach.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Christopher  Jullien is convinced <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> will become a top boss – but he’s hoping it’s not at Hibs.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b></i> can reveal Easter Road chiefs would need to break the bank to land the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> assistant gaffer as boss with Parkhead chiefs set to demand around £300,000 in compensation.</p>
      <p>The total bill would smash through the £1m barrier with wages and stumping up for sacked gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a>’s exit package.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> have Kennedy high up in their list of managerial targets but have yet to make an approach and Jullien is convinced the coach’s heart remains at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>He said: “I just know he is really important for us. He’s really good for me but every other player too.</p>
      <p>“Who would leave Celtic?</p>
      <p>“I am sure he loves the place and he has been so good for us.</p>

      <p>“Will be be a manager one day? Yes, for sure. He has all the things to become a great manager.”</p>
      <p>Jullien can understand the huge interest in Kennedy – as he insisted the coach has played a major part in helping him overcome a rocky start at Celts to become a Hoops fans favourite.</p>
      <p>The French ace said: “Since I arrived he’s been there for me. When you arrive somewhere new it’s sometimes difficult.</p>
      <p>“You can have some tough times to settle and things like that. He was always there and showed me the good stuff I was doing as well as the bad stuff.</p>
      <p>“I’m so happy to have this guy close to me. He made me learn some things about the club and how to play. I’m really happy to have him on my side.</p>
      <p>“I talked about how his career went but not with him. But I just see he’s in a really good place right now.</p>
      <p>“What he’s teaching and doing for us on the field is really good.</p>
      <p>“For his age I think it’s really good what he’s doing.”</p>
      <p>Jullien revealed it was Kennedy who gave him the crucial one-to-one coaching to help him to adapt to Scottish football.</p>

      <p>He said: “He showed me some videos of what they were doing last year or the year before and what the game here is like.</p>
      <p>“We spent one or two hours together before I was playing regularly. We looked at things that I could do and what I could bring to the team.</p>
      <p>“He showed me the perfect things I needed and right now I’m in a good moment because of that.</p>
      <p>“He’s always giving so much advice. At half-time he’s really calm. He’s a really calm guy.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see any of the games he played so I don’t know if he was different when he was a player.</p>
      <p>“You can compare him to a player with us though. You can see he was out on the field not a long time ago.</p>
      <p>“You can see he wants to give and that’s the really great thing for us.</p>
      <p>“He’s not a confidante. He just understands some stuff, like the trainer does. The fact he wasn’t on the field too long ago makes the link more natural.</p>
      <p>“I came here recently and it’s really good to see a staff behind us. The chemistry they have together is just perfect.”</p>
