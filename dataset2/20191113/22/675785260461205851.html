      <h1>Gareth Southgate vows to help Jadon Sancho through England star's Borussia Dortmund issues</h1>
      <h2>The 19-year-old forward has not had his most successful few months in Germany having not scored since September and he got in trouble for returning late from international duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate will throw a protective arm around Jadon Sancho to support the forward through his problems with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Sancho was left out of his club's squad for their 1-0 win over Borussia Monchengladbach last month after returning late from international duty with England.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old - set to take Raheem Sterling’s place against Montenegro - had featured in both England's Euro 2020 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he’d spoken to Sancho about the situation, Southgate said: “I know everything, yeah!</p>
      <p>“He came to me at the beginning of the week and we had 25 minutes chatting about everything, really.</p>

      <p>“We have a duty of care to him, almost, to help him to progress and to develop and as much as we can.”</p>
      <p>Sancho has scored six goals this season, four for Dortmund and twice for England against Kosovo in September. But he has not found the target since netting at Eintracht Frankfurt for his club on September 22.</p>
      <p>Southgate added: “We have a good link with Dortmund, I have to say, with the coaching staff there and the physical preparation department there.</p>
      <p>“So, we’re in constant communication with them and we have a very good picture of everything.</p>

      <p>“It’s an enormous challenge that he’s taken on to go to another country. There’s the football but he’s [also] adapting to life and the language and everything else.</p>
      <p>“So, he’s done incredibly well and it’s inevitable that, at some stages, there are going to be games where he’s maybe not as effective but he still has a high level of assists, a high level of goals. He’s a great talent and part of our job is to help him to succeed.”</p>
