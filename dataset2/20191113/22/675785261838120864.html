      <h1>Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi determined to force way into England's Euro 2020 attack</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea winger has impressed under the guidance of Frank Lampard this season and is hoping to convince Gareth Southgate he is worthy of a place in the first eleven</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>Callum Hudson-Odoi is determined to gatecrash Gareth Southgate’s attacking party.</p>
      <p>Southgate has generally permed three from four when it comes to settling on his offensive options and his selection policy has paid dividends.</p>
      <p>England are averaging 4.33 goals per game in qualifying for Euro 2020 - easily the highest rate amongst the 55 nations taking part. At 3.75 per game, only Belgium come close.</p>
      <p>And Southgate normally relies on a combination of Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane along with either Jadon Sancho or Marcus Rashford.</p>
      <p>Whatever trio he fields, Southgate believes he has one of the finest attacks in international football.</p>

      <p>But with Sterling dropped and doubts emerging over Sancho’s form and fitness, Hudson-Odoi is sensing a chance to break up Southgate’s forward cabal.</p>
      <p>He said: “That is a motivation for me, definitely. Jadon is still young but they have done exceptionally well for a number of years.</p>
      <p>“So when people say they are the best front three, for me it's a motivation because I want to be one of them as well.</p>
      <p>“I want to be around it and have people say… okay, there's five of them now. I always try and push myself.”</p>
      <p>After his 2018/19 campaign was marked by a contract stand-off, persistent links with a move to Bayern Munich and an injury that ended his season prematurely, Hudson-Odoi is certainly in a happier place right now.</p>
      <p>And for that, a lot of the credit goes to Frank Lampard, who convinced the 19-year-old his future was with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a>.</p>

      <p>So how many conversations with his new club manager did it take for Hudson-Odoi to be persuaded to sign a new contract?</p>
      <p>“One! He believes in me, he wants me to play for him and he wants me to work hard,” explained Hudson-Odoi.</p>
      <p>“They were the things you want to hear from a manager, that he believes in you and he has faith in you, that you can achieve a lot of stuff at the club.”</p>
      <p>Not that Lampard indulges the prodigiously talented youngster. Far from it.</p>
      <p>“He is hard on me,” said Hudson-Odoi. “But it is in a good way because he wants me to keep getting better. When the manager is telling me stuff, I always want to listen and improve my game because I'm not there yet.”</p>

      <p>And Hudson-Odoi is clearly relishing his time with both Lampard and Southgate, explaining: “I think they are quite similar. The way they both play, they wanted to do the same methods.</p>
      <p>“As a winger or an attacking midfielder, they want you to be in certain positions to receive the ball, they want you to get at the defenders one-on-one and contribute as much to the team as possible.</p>
      <p>“They have the same mentality.”</p>
      <p>And clearly, both have a disciplinarian streak, judging by Southgate’s punishment of Sterling and Lampard’s bad behaviour tariff.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty strict,” said Hudson-Odoi, referring to Frank’s fines. “But even if there weren't fines, we would still be on point. We're very positive about everything we do.”</p>
      <p>With that, Hudson-Odoi’s mobile phone rings.</p>
      <p>That’s a grand, Callum. He laughs. in fact, right now, you can’t keep the grin off his face.</p>
