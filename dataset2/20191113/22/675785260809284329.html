      <h1>Harry Wilson hopes helping Wales to Euro 2020 can make up for missing Liverpool success</h1>
      <h2>Wales may need to beat both Azerbaijan and Hungary to secure qualification for next season's tournament but Wilson is determined to repeat the spirit of 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:30:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Wilson reckons firing Wales to Euro 2020 will compensate for missing out on a potential title party at his beloved <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p>Wilson has been loaned out again by the Reds this term after joining Premier League <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> following his success at Derby.</p>
      <p>He has already scored four top-flight goals including a free-kick in the Cherries' 3-1 home loss to champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>But Wilson continues to watch his Anfield club closely as Jurgen Klopp's side steam towards a historic first Premier League title after beating City 3-1.</p>
      <p>Liverpool now top the table by eight points after only 12 games and Wilson knows his parent club, where he came up the ranks, are well-placed for glory.</p>

      <p>He said: “I am always in touch with Liverpool and get the odd message off the manager. He says he has been watching and after I scored against Man City he messaged and said: 'great free-kick'.</p>
      <p>"He congratulated me on the goal and it is great he is keeping an eye on me. It is good to know when you go out on loan you are not forgotten about.</p>
      <p>“I am still in touch with a few of the lads as well and to see them have the massive win on Sunday is great. If I can get to a game I always will. To see Liverpool win the Premier League would be fantastic being a Liverpool fan.</p>
      <p>“But to get to the Euros with Wales would be just as special.”</p>
      <p>Wilson has Azerbaijan in his sights on Saturday before Wales host Hungary on Tuesday as they attempt to clinch automatic qualification for next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs' squad are in confident mood after drawing in Slovakia last month and at home to World Cup runners-up Croatia.</p>
      <p>Wilson watched the previous finals in Euro 2016 as a fan when Wales reached the last four but now wants a starring role.</p>

      <p>Wilson, who has two goals in 15 games for Wales, added: “It would mean everything to get there.</p>
      <p>“Going out to watch Euro 2016 was fantastic. When I was there stood in the crowd, I wanted to be a part of that as a player. Now I have an opportunity to do that and I am desperate to make sure we get over the line.”</p>
      <p>Wales only squeezed past Azerbaijan 2-1 in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> in September with a late winner from Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>Wilson expects a tough game in Baku this weekend where the hosts drew with Croatia previously.</p>
      <p>He reflected: “They made it a lot tougher than we thought so definitely we are going to show them respect. We know what they are good at and where we can hurt them. But they will be wary of us the way we have played the last two games. If we execute our game-plan we can get the three points.”</p>
