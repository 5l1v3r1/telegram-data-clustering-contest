      <p>Former Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cotterill has emerged as a potential candidate for the vacant manager’s job at Hearts.</p>
      <p>The ex <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Reds </a>manager has been interviewed for the role, according to the <a href="https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/latest-hearts-news/hearts-hold-talks-ex-birmingham-manager-steve-cotterill-plus-latest-felix-magath-and-stephen-robinson-996260"><u>Edinburgh Evening News</u></a><u>.</u></p>
      <p>It has been claimed that Cotterill's CV has impressed the Scottish club's hierarchy after he applied for the position.</p>
      <p>Hearts are searching for their new manager after Craig Levein departed Tynecastle at the end of last month.</p>
      <p>Motherwell boss Stephen Robinson and former Fulham and Bayern Munich manager Felix Magath have also been linked with the job.</p>
      <p>Cotterill replaced Steve McClaren as Forest manager in October 2011, and had 37 games in charge of the club before his departure the following summer.</p>
