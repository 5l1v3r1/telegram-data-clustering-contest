      <h1>Charles Barkley highlights congratulatory wishes for Evansville</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:09:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Myron Medcalf</a></address>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/339">Evansville</a>'s <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4279134/kj-riley">K.J. Riley</a> and his teammates rode the bus back to campus following <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=401169817">Tuesday night's 67-64 upset</a> of No. 1 <a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/team/_/id/96/kentucky-wildcats">Kentucky</a> in Lexington, coach Walter McCarty told his energized team to quiet down because Charles Barkley wanted to congratulate it.</p>
      <p>He put the TNT analyst and Hall of Famer on speakerphone.</p>
      <p>"I didn't even know he knew Charles Barkley," said Riley, who led all scorers with 18 points. "He congratulated us and he told us that the hard work is paying off."</p>
      <p>Overall, McCarty said he had 400 congratulatory text messages waiting for him after Tuesday's win, which was tied for the third-largest upset in college basketball over the last 15 seasons (Evansville was a 25-point underdog), per ESPN Stats &amp; Information.</p>
      <p>Rick Pitino, McCarty's coach when Kentucky won the national title in 1996, reached out. Georgetown's Patrick Ewing, McCarty's teammate when he played for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks">New York Knicks</a> during the 1996-97 season, texted him to praise his team, too. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> coach Billy Donovan, an assistant when McCarty was at Kentucky, also contacted him after the victory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4066340/sam-cunliffe">Sam Cunliffe</a>'s two free throws with 6.8 seconds to play sealed the win for Evansville as Kentucky's <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/player/_/id/4431678/tyrese-maxey">Tyrese Maxey</a> missed a deep 3-pointer at the buzzer to tie the game. Kentucky made just 37 percent of its field goal attempts and committed 11 turnovers in the first half.</p>
      <p>Kentucky had previously won 52 consecutive home games against unranked opponents. Evansville, picked to finish eighth in the Missouri Valley Conference preseason poll, finished 11-21 overall and 5-13 during the 2018-19 campaign, McCarty's first as the team's head coach.</p>

      <aside>Largest D-I upsets (last 15 seasons)Evansville's stunning win versus No. 1 Kentucky was the third-biggest upset in Division I over the past 15 seasons.</aside>
      <p>It was the program's first victory over a No. 1 team.</p>
      <p>ESPN's BPI gave Evansville a 4 percent chance to win.</p>
      <p>McCarty said his team's experience fueled the win. He said he told his team that it could win at Kentucky, where he won a multitude of games as a player, if it stood strong in the opening minutes and refused to allow the crowd to become a factor.</p>
      <p>"They were not going to get rattled," he said. "They weren't afraid. Nothing against Kentucky, but they're young. It feels good that people are paying attention to us."</p>
      <p>When they returned to campus, the Purple Aces were greeted by hundreds of students. Riley said he didn't get to bed until 2 a.m. He was also inundated with texts. One in particular surprised him.</p>
      <p>"It was from a Kentucky fan," Riley said. "He said, 'I'm a Kentucky fan but you're my favorite player now.'"</p>
