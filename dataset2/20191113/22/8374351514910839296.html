      <p>Filipino-led firm OrionGroup International recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US firm Burns &amp; McDonnell for US$1.2 billion worth of projects in the Philippine energy and construction sectors.</p>
      <p>The Missouri-based American company is globally known in the engineering, architecture and construction industries with sales of US$4.0 billion while Orion Group specializes in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) undertakings primarily in the real estate and energy industries.</p>
      <p>OrionGroup Chief Executive Officer Rynor Jamandre said “we have explored the idea of partnership with Burns &amp; McDonnell for the last three years,” noting the quality engineering service that the US company had been touted for.</p>
      <p>“We believe that they can bring so much value to the Philippines in our desire to develop our countryside particularly our energy and infrastructure,” Jamandre added.</p>
      <p>The newly minted partners indicated that they are eyeing various projects starting next year that will likely be advancing to construction phases.</p>
      <p>“The parties mutually agreed to partner in the design, development and construction of projects worth US$1.2 billion throughout the country beginning in 2020,” OrionGroup has emphasized in a press statement.</p>
      <p>Michael Brown, president of Burns &amp; McDonnell International stated: The values and vision of both companies match and that is a key component to a successful partnership.”</p>
      <p>It added that the ventures in the pipeline include those on renewable energy, energy storage, hotel development, liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities as well as commercial developments and aviation projects.</p>
      <p>“Majority of the projects are located in the province and countryside – providing more economic opportunities and sources of livelihood for people who live outside Metro Manila,” the Filipino firm said.</p>
      <p>He noted that they view the Philippines as “a growing region”, hence, they have been seeing prospects for further ventures and expansion in infrastructure developments.</p>
      <p>For OrionGroup, its tandem with sister firm Quantity Solutions, had enabled them to further diversify their services to include those on renewable energy, ice production, apparel, real estate and hotel development.</p>
