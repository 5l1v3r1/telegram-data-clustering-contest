      <p>The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government says it expects damage to homes and infrastructure to run into the millions following Tuesday's tornado which ripped through New Hanover, Pietermaritzburg.</p>
      <p>The province is still bracing itself for more inclement weather - which will bring with it severe thunderstorms over the next few days - as some families continue to pick up the pieces.</p>
      <p>The broad strokes of the statement released by the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs on Wednesday were aimed at how the province has been grappling with bad weather over the past few months.</p>
      <p>"Since October 2019, KwaZulu-Natal has been experiencing extreme weather conditions, triggering severe thunderstorms, lightning strikes, gale-force winds and heavy downpours that have wreaked havoc across the province. </p>
      <p>"They have caused fatalities, injuries and inflicted major damage to households and public infrastructure," the statement said.</p>
