      <p>The Philippine government has strengthened its international commitments to improve programs in reproductive health in the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the government, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia presented the milestones and policies already in place leading to real outcomes in an international conference being held in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>

      <p>“We are one with the world in renewing with rigor our commitments to the International Conference on Population and Development Program of Action and the Sustainable Development Agenda,” Pernia, who leads the Filipino delegation, said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“This is in line with our efforts to realize the aspirations of the Filipino people of a stable, peaceful, secure, and comfortable life,” he added, stressing the connection of the commitments with the AmBisyon Natin 2040, the Philippines’ long-term vision for all Filipinos.</p>
      <p> He proceeded to enumerate the milestones on commitments the Philippines has already reached in recent years.</p>
      <p>“The Philippine economy is closer to achieving upper middle-income country status. There are fewer Filipinos living in poverty, fewer mothers dying while giving life, and more couples and individuals are able to achieve their desired number of children. As well, we are seriously coming to grips with the issue of teenage pregnancies,” Pernia said.</p>
