      <h1>Mark Wahlberg In Talks To Join Tom Holland In Uncharted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:35:53+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Mark Wahlberg will take part in the big-screen legacy of Nathan Drake after all. It just won’t be for the role he first planned for. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-uncharted-movie-sony-1203394336/">Variety</a> is reporting that Wahlberg is in negotiations to star in Sony’s movie adaptation of the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/uncharted"><b>Uncharted</b></a> video game series. If the deal goes through, Wahlberg will portray Victor “Sully” Sullivan, the older treasure-hunting mentor to Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake.</p>
      <p>During the various <b>Uncharted</b> games, Sully stayed by Drake’s side as they solved puzzles and fended off enemies. Even though Wahlberg’s Sully is younger than his video game counterpart, he should be about right when paired with Holland’s youthful Drake.</p>
      <p>This isn’t Wahlberg’s first go-around with the <b>Uncharted</b> movie. Years ago, he was originally up for the role of Nathan Drake when David O. Russell was attached as the director. </p>

      <p>Since that time, several directors have come and gone, including Shawn Levy and Dan Trachtenberg. However, Sony eventually settled on <b>Bumblebee </b>helmer <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/467677-bumblebee-director-travis-knight-may-helm-sonys-uncharted-movie">Travis Knight</a>.</p>
      <p>While Wahlberg should be a good choice for Sully, Holland spoke a while back about who he <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/398197-tom-holland-talks-uncharted-movie-reveals-his-picks-for-sully">would have liked to see in the role</a>.  </p>
      <p>“I think Jake Gyllenhaal could be really cool, said Holland. “But I actually went to the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/jurassic-world"><b>Jurassic World</b></a> film set the other day to visit my friend who is directing it and Chris Pratt is on that film, who I have become very good friends with over the last few months, and I think he would be a great Sully.”</p>
      <p><b>Uncharted </b>doesn’t currently have a production start date, but it may begin filming within the next year.</p>
