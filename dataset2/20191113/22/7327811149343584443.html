      <p>SUFFOLK COUNTY, Long Island (WABC) -- Suffolk County residents are on high alert after multiple reports of break-ins in the Middle Island and Coram area, police say.</p>
      <p>A man apparently entered eight residences through unlocked doors or windows during overnight hours between May and November.</p>
      <p>In all occasions, the homeowners were present at the time and encountered the suspect.</p>
      <p>Police say that in two of the reported incidents, the man supposedly made non-sexual physical contact with female residents before fleeing, possibly on a bicycle.</p>
      <p>In the six other instances, the man reportedly fled after being confronted by the homeowners.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, no one was injured and nothing was stolen during any of the incidents.</p>
      <p>The suspect was described as being approximately 5-foot-9 to 6 feet tall with a thin build.</p>
      <p>Police remind residents the importance of locking doors and windows, and detectives are asking anyone with information on these incidents to call the Sixth Squad at 631-854-8652 or anonymously to Crime Stoppers at 1-800-220-TIPS.</p>
