      <h1>Phil Schiller says Chromebooks are a ‘cheap testing tool’ that don’t help kids succeed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:07:32+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Yoni Heisler</a></address>
      <p>Apple today introduced a brand new 16-inch MacBook Pro that, at long last, fixes the horrid butterfly keyboard design that plagued previous models. The new notebook, which starts at $2,399, also boasts slimmer bezels, a higher resolution display, improved speakers, and the re-introduction of a physical Escape key. All in all, it’s an intriguing and solid update that has long been overdue.</p>
      <p>In conjunction with today’s MacBook Pro unveiling, Apple executive Phil Schiller sat down <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">with <i>CNET</i></a> for a far-reaching interview where he naturally extolled the virtues of Apple’s new notebook. The interview was predictably full of the boilerplate verbiage you’d expect from a marketing executive, but things got a little bit more interesting when the topic of Chromebooks was brought up.</p>
      <p>While Apple notebooks remain immensely popular with college students, it’s no secret that the K-12 market has been gravitating towards Chromebooks in recent years, all at the expense of MacBooks and iPads. According to some estimates, more than 60% of computing devices used in K-12 classrooms in the US are Chromebooks. What’s more, the popularity of Chromebooks in schools abroad is growing as well.</p>
      <p>So what does Schiller make of the Chromebook’s increasing popularity? Well, not surprisingly, he’s not too impressed.</p>
      <p>Schiller made a point of noting that kids intent on learning need cutting edge technologies to really reach their full potential. And Chromebooks, Schiller says, simply don’t fit the bill.</p>
      <p>“You need to have these cutting-edge learning tools to help kids really achieve their best results,” Schiller said. “Yet Chromebooks don’t do that.</p>
      <p>“Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom because, frankly, they’re cheap testing tools for required testing,” Schiller added. “If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they’re not going to succeed.”</p>
      <p>Apple, meanwhile, has been busy trying to position the iPad as a superior alternative to Chromebooks, but many school districts who are already strapped for cash aren’t exactly in a position to make purchasing decisions irrespective of budgetary concerns.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> With Schiller’s remarks naturally stirring up a bit of controversy, Schiller took to Twitter this afternoon to clarify his remarks:</p>
