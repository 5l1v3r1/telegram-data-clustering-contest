      <p>On Tuesday, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Will Roper told reporters the service wanted to turn its present bomber fleet into “something else” capable of packing a long-range punch.</p>
      <blockquote>US bombers carrying cruise missiles is nothing new, but the primary role of strategic bombers like the B-52 Stratofortress and B-1B Lancer has been what bombers were always expected to do: fly over targets and let gravity deliver munitions from their bomb bays to their intended targets.</blockquote>
      <p>However, with air defenses being more <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911011077202906-pentagon-hopes-to-use-anti-ballistic-lasers-to-strike-down-cruise-missiles/">sophisticated</a> than ever, is it really worth it to risk a $415 million B-1B in order to strike a target? The Air Force has judged not, preferring its upcoming <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201907251076362017-first-flight-of-us-air-forces-b-21-stealth-bomber-scheduled-for-december-2021/">B-21 Raider</a> stealth bomber for deep strikes.</p>
      <blockquote>“Can we think more broadly about how an airplane carrying a lot of weapons can be looked at?" Roper said, according to <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/12/plans-pentagons-future-flying-bomb-truck-begin-take-shape.html">Military.com</a>. "[For example], how does this standoff bomber work in the contested environment in a way that's complementary with the B-21?"</blockquote>
      <p>The challenge is how to turn a B-52, designed in an era when gravity bombs were a bomber’s only weapons, into a “missileer,” Roper said. It’s a problem the Strategic Capabilities Office has been working on since 2016, although the “mobile arsenal” idea was first floated in 1995, when the US Navy <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2015/may/breaking-anti-access-wall">suggested</a> building a massive ship with 160 to 200 launch tubes for intense coastal bombardment.</p>
      <p>In a 2018 <a href="http://www.rfpdb.com/view/document/name/B_52-Heavy-Weapon-Release-Capability-%28HRC%29-Pylon_FA8107%7CB_52H%7CHRC%7CPylon">solicitation</a>, the Air Force sought help with “the integration of replace external heavy weapons delivery system onto the B-52H aircraft ... capable of carrying multiple weapons in the 5,000 lb to 20,000 lb weight class.” The pylons would be located under the bomber’s wings.</p>
      <blockquote>Some of the missiles the B-52 can now deploy include the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and its variants, the Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), and the hypersonic Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW), the latter of which was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201906181075924202-us-air-force-successfully-flies-its-hypersonic-missile-for-the-1st-time/">tested</a> for the first time this past June.</blockquote>
      <p>Further down the line, the Long-Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), a nuclear-capable cruise missile, is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201810241069185378-new-us-nuclear-cruise-missile-10-completion/">expected</a> to buttress the US <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201901241071794006-US-Completes-20-Year-Nuclear-Warhead-Overhaul/">nuclear triad</a> as well as keep the B-52, perhaps the only aircraft capable of carrying the huge weapon, relevant.</p>
      <blockquote>Gen. John Hyten, commander of US Strategic Command, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201709231057629969-b-52-useless-long-range-nuke-missile/">observed</a> in 2017 that without the LRSO, "you don’t have the B-52 as a viable platform.”</blockquote>
      <p>China and Russia, nations the Pentagon has identified as its primary “great power” adversaries, have also pushed ahead with both their hypersonic missile arsenals and with developing <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201911041077224389-photos-images-emerge-of-chinas-new-air-launched-ballistic-missile-mounted-under-bomber/">air-launched ballistic missiles</a>. China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) has long sought to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201904251074465771-Chinas-PLARF-Outclasses-US-Missiles-Carriers-Risk/">specialize</a> in mass missile attacks, a tactic it hopes will overwhelm US naval defenses at standoff range.</p>
      <blockquote>Military.com noted that other planes being explored for the “arsenal plane” role include the C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport, which already has a close air support version fitted with various weapons. A similar <a href="https://www.military.com/defensetech/2018/05/17/proposed-cannon-would-turn-b-1-bomber-gunship.html">proposal</a> by Boeing got as far as a patent for a retractable cannon mounted inside the B-1B’s bomb bay, the outlet noted.</blockquote>
