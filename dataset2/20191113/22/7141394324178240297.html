      <h1>Did Bitcoin Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Just Move 50 BTC? Litecoin’s Charlie Lee Ponders Mysterious Transfer</h1>

      <p>Litecoin creator Charlie Lee is wondering if the legendary, anonymous creator of Bitcoin known as Satoshi Nakamoto just moved 50 Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>The BTC was donated to the team developing Grin, a new cryptocurrency that is focused on confidential transactions, hiding transaction values and making it hard for third parties to track activity.</p>
      <p>It uses a private transaction technology called MimbleWimble which is also being tested on Litecoin.</p>
      <p>Developer David Burkett <a href="https://t.me/GrinCoin/">announced</a> the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1DwVZeatHifRzHXtphcpqJ6j1YuC8kFDqd">receipt</a> of the BTC.</p>
      <p>Lee quickly traced the origin of the coins, saying they were mined back in 2010 and had been dormant for nine years.</p>

      <p>Several crypto influencers, including Charlie Lee and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, have said that the real Satoshi can prove their identity by signing a message with the address from the very first Bitcoin block. Until then, any claims about “the real Satoshi” are likely bogus.</p>
