      <p><b>BLACKPINK</b> has definitely been making a huge impact in the western sphere and this fact is now clearly evident as the group has graced <b>TIME's 100 NEXT 'Phenoms'</b> category for their achievements. </p>
      <p><a href="https://time.com/5725626/how-we-chose-time-100-next/">TIME wrote about their new 100 NEXT list:</a> <i>"With this issue, we launch the TIME 100 Next, a new list—part of an ongoing expansion of our flagship TIME 100 franchise—that spotlights 100 rising stars who are shaping the future of business, entertainment, sports, politics, science, health and more. Although this focus lends itself to a younger group, we intentionally had no age cap—a recognition that ascents can begin at any age."</i></p>
