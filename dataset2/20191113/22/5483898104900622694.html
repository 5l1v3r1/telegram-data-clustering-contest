      <h3>The Fulham North home that was the scene of a five-hour siege on Wednesday is a known “drug den”, say locals.</h3>
      <p>FIVEaa Breakfast’s David Penberthy said during Thursday’s Breaking @ 8 segment:</p>
      <blockquote>“We want to say a bit about the house where this siege unfolded yesterday… we’ve been talking to residents of this part of Henley Beach, which is right next to the Fulham North school.<br/><br/>“We understand the house itself where the siege unfolded has been the subject of concern within the community for some time. We’ve been provided by locals with close up photographs of the house and it’s fair to say it's in no real danger of being featured on Better Homes and Gardens any time soon.<br/><br/>“Let’s cut to the chase. Locals tell us this is a drug den. It’s a crack house and it’s a matter of open discussion among the law abiding members of the community… we don’t know if it’s known to police, if it’s been the subject of police attention before… the bleak assessment that you would make is it makes it like so many others houses around Adelaide now.”</blockquote>
      <p>Three people are now in custody following the siege and an earlier home invasion in Cowandilla.</p>
