      <p>(CNN) - Brad Pitt and Adam Sandler both arrived in Hollywood in the late 1980s, but their careers quickly took different paths, with Pitt becoming an A-list heartthrob and Sandler turning into a comedy legend.</p>
      <p>The two spoke with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/brad-pitt-adam-sandler-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-uncut-gems-1203400765/">Variety</a> about becoming actors, what their process is, and yes, who's better looking.</p>
      <p>According to the piece, when the actors discovered they've both worked with cinematographer Darius Khondji, Sandler told Pitt: "He couldn't help himself. He kept saying, 'Something about your face is better than Brad's.' I have better eyes or something!"</p>
      <p>Speaking of his face, Pitt revealed to Sandler that most attempts to disguise himself have failed.</p>
      <p>"I put on a dinosaur mask, and I got recognized in New York City. I don't know what it is, especially when people grow up with you," he said.</p>
      <p>Sandler told his own story about fans approaching him.</p>
      <p>"I was skiing one time, had the helmet on, the dickey was up, the goggles," Sandler recalled. "I was like: 'This is going to be a fun day. No one's going to ...' Literally, it was 7 in the morning. 'Hey, Adam Sandler!' I go, 'How did you know?' He goes, 'That big nose of yours.'"</p>
      <p>Pitt mentioned a story he had heard about Sandler from his days as a student at NYU, calling it his "favorite Adam Sandler story."</p>
      <p>"It was that you were at NYU, and it was an acting coach, I believe," Pitt said, with Sandler replying, "Acting professor."</p>
      <p>Pitt continued: "And he said to you, 'I want to take you out for a beer.' This is what I'm told. You guys went to a bar, and he kindly said to you: 'Think about something else. You have to choose another path.' Truth?"</p>
      <p>"Exactly," Sandler said.</p>
      <p>"There's a second part to this story," Pitt continued. "This is why it's my favorite Adam Sandler story, and I think it says a lot about you. That you ran into him at your height, when you're getting the ultimate payday, and you're with a bunch of friends, out at a bar. Anyone would think that's the opportunity where you rub it in his face. And reportedly, what you did was you introduced him to your friends, and you said: 'This is the only teacher to ever buy me a beer.' True?"</p>
      <p>"Yeah," Sandler replied.</p>
      <p>The two discussed how they reach a point of honesty on camera, with Pitt saying he knows when he's pulling it off for the camera and Sandler discussing acting in a serious role, like in his upcoming "Uncut Gems."</p>
      <p>"This was probably the most free I could ever be in a movie," Sandler said.</p>
      <p>The comedian told Pitt he watched "Ad Astra" at home in his screening room, because he wanted to be alone for the experience.</p>
      <p>"I love being alone with it, because I was digging the sound design. I was digging the shots, and the quiet stuff on the moon. It rocked me hard," he said, to which Pitt replied, "Got you â€”"</p>
      <p>"Not hard! Not hard! Rocked me," Sandler laughed.</p>
      <p>Pitt replied, "OK. I just want to be clear."</p>
