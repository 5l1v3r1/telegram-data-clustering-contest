      <h1>Scott McKenna in Aberdeen transfer reversal but admits a January exit isn't off the table</h1>
      <h2>The defender slapped in an official transfer request in an attempt to force a move away from Pittodrie in the summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:29:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mckenna">Scott McKenna</a> has revealed his transfer request is OFF the table – but he could still quit Aberdeen in January.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was left frustrated in the summer after the Dons kiboshed £3.5million bids from QPR and Nottingham Forest – having knocked back bigger cheques from Celtic and Aston Villa in the previous window.</p>
      <p>The defender slapped in an official transfer request in an attempt to force a move but Pittodrie boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes</a> insisted the defender won’t be sold until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>McKenna’s full focus is on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> but won’t rule out a move when the window reopens in the New Year.</p>
      <p>When asked if the request still stood, he said: “No. That was something that was in a few months ago, but as soon as the window closed, my attention was back on Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>“I just need to keep my head down and see what happens come January.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big couple of months.</p>

      <p>“As soon as every window closes, the next six months is always big. It’s a big six months and the closer you get to the window, all you hear is people saying ‘you need to play well the next five or six games, your future could depend on it’.</p>
      <p>“You become used to it. I’ve heard it so many times now. I just want to do as well as I can in every single game I play in, whether that’s for Scotland or Aberdeen.”</p>
      <p>McKenna admitted it was a wretch to ask for a move but he felt Aberdeen had forced his hand after a summer of uncertainty.</p>
      <p>There’s no hard feelings though as he’s prepared to knuckle down and keep performing for the Pittodrie side.</p>
      <p>McKenna said: “It was a very hard decision. Aberdeen gave me my chance and have been absolutely brilliant with me but I had been building up for that for a year in the hope of a move and it just didn’t seem to be happening in the way I thought.</p>
      <p>“The summer was probably the worst for me. There was maybe a bit of expectancy for it to happen whereas before it just kind of happened – whatever the decision was, you just put your head down and got on with it.</p>
      <p>“When you have been working for the full year, building up to that point that you thought was going to be the time, there was that wee bit of disappointment.</p>

      <p>“But it can’t linger for too long. The window closed. We were in Croatia and we had a game an hour or two later. There was no time for me to dwell on things. As frustrating as it can be, there is absolutely nothing I can do about it, apart from trying to play well.”</p>
      <p>McKenna has not stropped over the transfer disappointment and has battled back from injury to return to form with the Dons.</p>
      <p>The towering centre back is also set to slot back in to the Scotland side for this week’s double header with Cyprus and Kazakhstan and he’s determined to impress for club and country.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McKenna said: “Hopefully Aberdeen will win games. We are out of the League Cup, but we want to finish as high up the table as we can.</p>
      <p>“For Scotland, it’s all about trying to qualify.</p>
      <p>“I know we can’t do it through these two games, but hopefully I can stay in the squad and the team for March. That’s what it is all about for me – trying to do as well as I can in any game I play in.</p>
      <p>"International football is a step up from the SPFL. Teams will look at that and see if I can handle it. That’s always what I’m trying to prove to them.”</p>
