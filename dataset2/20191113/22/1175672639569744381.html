      <p>A "dream home" built on the "tightest of budgets" by architects <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/architecture-and-design-by-mcgonigle-mcgrath/">McGonigle McGrath</a> has been named by the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/riba/">Royal Institute of British Architects</a> as the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/uk/">UK</a>'s best house of 2019.</p>

      <p>House Lessans, which stands on the site of an old farmstead in County Down, was chosen over six other architect-designed homes vying for the annual Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) House of the Year prize.</p>
      <p>It was named as this year's winner during the final episode of the Channel 4 television series Grand Designs: House of the Year.</p>

      <p>Belfast studio <a href="https://www.mcgoniglemcgrath.com/">McGonigle McGrath</a> designed House Lessans to meet the needs of a semi-retired couple and their children, who have left home but occasionally visit and stay.</p>
      <p>It is formed of two pared-back volumes with walls made from white-rendered concrete with pitched zinc roofs, designed to complement the neighbouring agricultural outbuildings.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>McGonigle McGrath used deliberately simple details and construction methods that included cheap concrete blocks for the walls and huge openable windows, instead of bifold doors.</p>
      <p>As a result, House Lessans cost just £335,000, equivalent to £1,425 per square metre.</p>

      <p>RIBA president Alan Jones said the home was "executed with incredible clarity and restraint".</p>
      <p>"House Lessans demonstrates that life enhancing architecture does not have to cost the earth" he said.</p>
      <p>"McGonigle McGrath have used simple and cheap materials to create a truly bespoke home that resonates with its owners and its context. Even with the tightest of budgets, House Lessans shows that a dream home, designed by a talented architect, can be a reality."</p>

      <p>One wing of the house contains a suite of three bedrooms, while the second hosts the communal living spaces that includes a double-height living room.</p>
      <p>Like the exterior, all the rooms have simple finishes. The focus is on views out over the landscape that are framed through expanses of glass.</p>

      <p>The house was chosen for RIBA House of the Year by a panel including Tom Miller of Haysom Ward Miller Architects, last year's winner of the award, and John Pardey as chair.</p>

      <p>Pardey said the house "represents a paradigm in creating relevant contemporary architecture that truly reflects its local context, vernacular and culture".</p>

      <p>"It has an elegant simplicity achieved within a remarkably low budget without excesses, creating delight in the subtly changing volumes as well as its relationship between the inside and outside," Pardey added.</p>
      <p>"The house takes the daily business of life and with the architects' skills in making a house from simple materials, carefully detailed and with precise alignments, succeeds in becoming not just a house, but more importantly, a home."</p>

      <p>House Lessans was one of 20 houses on the RIBA House of the Year 2019 longlist, which featured in the Grand Designs: House of the Year series.</p>
      <p>Over the four-week run of the TV series, the list was cut down to a shortlist of seven projects.

      <p>House Lessans was the second project by McGonigle McGrath to have been shortlisted for the prize, following <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/11/26/mcgonigle-mcgrath-house-maghera-barn-like-housepale-walls-asymmetric-gables-newcastle-county-down-northern-ireland/">House Maghera</a>'s nomination in 2015, which lost out to <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/11/26/skene-catling-de-la-pena-flint-house-named-uk-riba-house-of-the-year-2015-shortlist/">Flint House by Skene Catling de la Pena</a>.</p>
