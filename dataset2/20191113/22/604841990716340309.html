      <p>Parkvilla advanced the semi-final of the NEFL Challenge Cup tonight with a 2-0 victory over Enfield Celtic.</p>
      <p>The reward is a palce in the semi-final against Trim Celtic with Kentstown Rovers already in the decider making it an all-Meath showpiece.</p>
      <p>The weather conditions made it difficult for both teams, but the players adapted well and produced a competitive encounter.</p>
      <p>Parkvilla always looked the more likely team to win, but a hard-working Enfield side created some good chances although they struggled to get shots on target.</p>
      <p>Jamie Blake went close for the Navan men in the 18th minute, but his effort was blocked by Enfield's Sean Tate.</p>
      <p>For the remainder of the opening half it was a fairly tight contest until Blake made the breakthrough in the 35th minute after a flick from Ciaran Rogers made the opening - see video clip of goal.</p>

      <p>Enfield upped the tempo in the second-half and a number of substitutions added a little bit of an edge to their attack, but they fouond it difficult to create any clear chances.</p>
      <p>As Parkvilla continued to absorb pressure and counter attack it eventually got them a second goal with Lee Fahy capitalising on a hesitant Enfield defence to burst through virtually unchallenged and finish to the net.</p>
      <p>Next up for Parkvilla in this competition is Trim Celitc in the semi-final, but before that they have Bellurgan in the Kilmessan Shield this weekend.</p>
      <p>"We will benefit from a competitive game tonight and another one at the weekend, that will help our preparations for the game with Trim Celtic," stated Parkvilla manager Derek Coogan.</p>
