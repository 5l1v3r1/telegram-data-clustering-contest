      <p>YONKERS, Westchester County (WABC) -- Flavored cigarettes are back on sale in Yonkers after an appellate court issued a temporary restraining order against the city.</p>
      <p>Yonkers was the first municipality in New York to enact the ban, which took effect October 1.</p>
      <p>Mike Bowers, the owner of Vape Cave YO, says the ban has devastated his business, with sales down 84%.</p>
      <p>He disputes the argument that flavored additives to e-liquids are meant to entice teens to start vaping.</p>
      <p>Bowers says the additives help adult smokers transition away from traditional cigarettes.</p>
      <p>"You want fruity flavors, you want to get off tobacco," he said. "The products are not intended for kids. They're not intended for youth."</p>
      <p>Yonkers Mayor Mike Spano says the court issued the restraining order based on a technicality, which he says will be corrected.</p>
      <p>"We've been successful as a generation in convincing kids that smoking is bad, and all of a sudden big tobacco has found an end-run," he said. "We want to make sure we keep the pressure on and to continue to tell young people that this is not a safe alternative."</p>
