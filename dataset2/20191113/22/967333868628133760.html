        <b>A US Defense Department Inspector General report released Tuesday reveals that the vacuum filtration system used to protect the engines of the US military’s V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft has once again failed to keep them free of dirt and debris, particularly in desert conditions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Nov/12/2002209085/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2020-006_REDACTED%20V2.PDF">redacted report</a>, the vacuum filtration system - known as the Engine Air Particle Separators (EAPS) - did not meet previous redesign guidelines set by the manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, and will require yet another redesign effort. The EAPS was previously redesigned twice: once in 2010 and again in 2011.</p>
      <p>The Marine Corps’ MV-22 and the Air Force’s CV-22s both have Rolls-Royce T406 engines.</p>
      <blockquote>"When the [V-22 program manager] developed the specification for the original EAPS design, it did not require the EAPS to meet the Rolls‑Royce specification in all desert environments," the report reads.</blockquote>
      <p>"The third EAPS redesign is intended to remove more soil from the air flowing into the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201703101051431120-usa-navy-awards-ospreys/">V‑22</a> engine than the original EAPS; however, the soil ingested into the engine would be four times greater than the engine manufacturer’s specification allows," the report’s executive summary reads.</p>
      <p>However, the report does not appear optimistic about a successful redesign. </p>
      <blockquote>“<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201704141052627523-v-22-repairs-navy/">V‑22</a> remains at risk despite more than nine years of EAPS redesign attempts. Additionally, the PMA‑275 cannot be certain that the third EAPS redesign will correct long‑standing problems with the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201711051058837649-us-aircraft-accidents-information/">V‑22</a>,” the report notes.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Military.com, debris building up in Osprey engines has already been associated with a deadly aviation incident. </p>
      <p>An MV-22B Osprey crashed in Hawaii back in 2015, killing two people and injuring more than 20 others. A Marine Corps investigation at the time found that the pilots tried to land the aircraft despite being exposed to high amounts of debris, which can severely decrease visibility.</p>
      <blockquote>"Repeated, sustained flight time in brownout conditions ... while attempting to land caused the left engine to stall, resulting in a loss of power that placed the aircraft in an unavoidable freefall to the ground," a Marine Corps news release regarding the <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/13/v-22-osprey-engines-still-risk-sand-and-silt-watchdog-report-finds.html">incident</a> at the time reads.</blockquote>
      <p>The incident resulted in a guideline change: the maximum time that Ospreys can remain inside dust clouds was reduced from 60 to 35 seconds, The Drive reported.</p>
