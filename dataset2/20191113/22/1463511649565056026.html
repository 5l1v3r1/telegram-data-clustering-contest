      <p>The House of Representatives Committee on Public Petition has expressed concern about the refusal of the Nigerian Customs Service to appear and respond to a petition on extra judicial killings by its men.</p>
      <p>The acting Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Lawan Kenken at the hearing on Wednesday in Abuja, said that the NCS was given seven days notice.</p>
      <p>He said that the committee received a petition by Assemblywoman Sikirat Ajibola, a member of the Ogun House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>Kenken explained that the petitioner accused the NCS of extra judicial killings and other unlawful acts of men of the service against the people of Idiroko/Ipokia State Constituency.</p>
      <p>“The petitioner are here, as you can see apparently, customs is not here; the petitioner came on time, coming form Ogun, it is a pathetic situation.</p>
      <p>“From the stamp of the Comptroller-General office, they were served this hearing notice and the notice of petition was received by the NCS on the November 6.</p>
      <p>“Today is November 13, which means they revived it seven days ago and they are not here.</p>
      <p>“To be honest with you, we do not hear a case when one side is not present because of the fundamental role of natural justice,” he said.</p>
      <p>The chairman, however, said that the hearing would be rescheduled for a later date for the NSC to appear.</p>
