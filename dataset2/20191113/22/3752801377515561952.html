      <p>President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he skipped the first televised hearings in his impeachment investigation because he was "too busy".</p>
      <p>"I'm too busy to watch it. It's a witch hunt, it's a hoax, I'm too busy to watch it. So, I'm sure I'll get a report," Trump told reporters.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Trump spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said that Trump spent the morning in the Oval Office "working."</p>
      <p>Trump later greeted Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, at the White House.</p>
      <p>But despite his claim to be ignoring the impeachment drama, his Twitter account featured a barrage of retweeted statements from opponents of the congressional investigation.</p>
