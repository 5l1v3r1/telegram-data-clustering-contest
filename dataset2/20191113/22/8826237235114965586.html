      <p>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. — Grand Rapids will pay a $190,000 settlement to a Latino American war veteran who was wrongfully detained by federal immigration officials.</p>
      <p>The City Commission unanimously approved the payment to Jilmar Ramos-Gomez on Tuesday to resolve a Michigan Department of Civil Rights complaint.</p>
      <p>Customs Enforcement held Ramos-Gomez for three days last December before releasing the Michigan-born U.S. citizen. Police Capt. Curtis VanderKooi served <a href="https://apnews.com/5a0a449ed78f46bea0fb53f7735967be">a 20-hour, unpaid suspension</a> for violating department policy after he alerted the federal agency about Ramos-Gomez’ arrest at a hospital.</p>
      <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Michigan Immigrant Rights Center filed <a href="https://apnews.com/1ff1461ed16a4fb5918f80e06be98c5c">the complaint</a> on Ramos-Gomez’s behalf in April, saying VanderKooi discriminated against him based on his race, violating the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act.</p>
