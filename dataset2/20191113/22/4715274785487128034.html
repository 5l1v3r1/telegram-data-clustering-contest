      <h1>Consumers urged: Beware of power deals</h1>

      <p>The left-leaning party-list group on Wednesday urged the public to be more vigilant on the conduct of bidding for power contracts may result in higher electricity rates.</p>
      <p>Bayan Muna chairman Neri Colmenares also called on the Energy department to intervene and set aside the difficult and one sided bidding terms imposed by power distributors to ensure that more bidders with lower price offers could come in.</p>

      <p>He said the Energy department's call for Meralco to open the competitive selection process was a welcome development, as this will give more flexibility for power suppliers bidding for its energy needs.</p>
      <p>"Despite the difficult conditions imposed, some power suppliers were forced to bid on the two power supply contracts for 1,700 megawatts. Had the power distributors not imposed difficult conditions in the two bidding, the resulting bid prices would have been lower for after all, the price of electricity at the retail supply market is lower” Colmenares said in a statement sent to the House media.</p>
      <p>Colmenares also said the bidding terms imposed on CSP should ensure a fair chance for all suppliers to make a bid at the lowest possible price. </p>
