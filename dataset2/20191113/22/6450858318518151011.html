      <h1>Honor V30 confirmed for Chinese launch on 26 November</h1>

      <p>Honor has confirmed its next flagship smartphone the V30 will launch in China on 26 November. The company, which is the sub-brand of Huawei, teased the phone in videos and posters (via <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777813-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fhonor-v30-confirmed-launch-26-november-3777813%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsmarena.com%2Fhonor_v30_triple_camera_video_teaser-news-40076.php">GSMArena</a>), showing that it has triple rear cameras and dual selfie cameras in a cut out that looks like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.</p>
      <p>The teasers confirm the phone will also be 5G compatible, though it’s unclear if this will be in all models or not – there is also a V30 Pro rumoured that might be the 5G upgrade on a regular 4G model.</p>
      <p>The cut out selfie cameras may look like those on the S10 Plus but it’s actually Honor that was first to market with its <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/honor-view-20-3690231/">View 20</a> in January 2019. That phone was the first in the West to have a single punch hole rather than a notch in the display.</p>

      <p>A problem however is the fact Honor is affected by the US Huawei ban given it is the same company, so these likely-excellent phones probably won’t ship with Google apps and services. That will be fine for China, but makes them a non-starter in the West.</p>
