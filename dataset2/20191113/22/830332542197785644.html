      <p>She was born on May 13, 1937 to Alden and Caryl (Carpenter) Pratt. She graduated from Mineral Point High School in the Class of 1955, whom she remained close friends with many of her classmates.  She attended UW-Stout and later transferred to UW-Madison and graduated in 1959 in the field of Bio Chemistry. </p>

Barb was employed with the University of Madison as project specialist with McCardle Labs, doing cancer research. She later worked at Lands' End (Cross Plains) in the Specialty Shoppers Dept. She and Ron were both active in the community as Girl Scout Leaders for many years and made many friends through their activities.</p>
      <p>After Ron's death, she moved back to her home town of Mineral Point and rekindled many of her childhood friendships and made many new friends. She became a member of Faith Lutheran Church and was always at the Pointer Café, where she made wonderful memories. Her best accomplishment in life was her two daughters, Judy and Diana. She enjoyed spending time with them both and they brought her great joy.</p>
