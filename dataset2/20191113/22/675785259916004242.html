      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Lions have lost each of their three games on tour so far - but Bennett has hit back at critics ahead of Saturday's clash against Papua New Guinea</h2>

      <p>Wayne Bennett has taken a pop at the knockers who claim he has ruined the Great Britain badge and should be sacked.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old Lions coach has caused uproar with some of his selections on the current losing tour Down Under.</p>
      <p>But he has come back fighting, saying: “They don’t build monuments to critics. Criticism is like water off a duck’s back - I don’t listen to it.</p>
      <p>“I am at the coal face and I know what is going on. I know what we have got to fix up and believe we can do that.</p>
      <p>“I have never disrespected anyone in my life, it is not in my nature. There is no disrespect from me towards Great Britain.”</p>

      <p>The Lions have lost all three tour games, to Tonga and twice to New Zealand, and need to beat Papua New Guinea on Saturday to avoid a total disaster.</p>
      <p>But his team selection will once again send his critics into overdrive - with half back Blake Austin again on the wing and emergency call-up Ash Handley not playing.</p>
      <p>Bennett, however, says the doubters can moan all they want but nothing will stop him from controversially planning towards England’s World Cup campaign in two years.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are working on a plan to get our game right because next year against Australia is vital and then hopefully we can be a real contender at the World Cup.”</p>
      <p>And that’s partly why he’s likely to start Gareth Widdop and Jackson Hastings in the halves for the fourth game running, even though they have failed to inspire so far.</p>

      <p>He said: “One of the things we have to get our heads around is we have to stabilise our halves and we cannot just keep swapping and changing.</p>
      <p>“We are not getting it right at the moment, the decision making or the pressure that comes in games.</p>
      <p>“I have got to give Jackson time. If I react and take him out we are not going to get him to the place we need him to go or for us to realise he cannot get there.</p>
      <p>“That’s the dilemma we are in and the same with Gareth Widdop. That is what is going on right now.”</p>
      <p>Half back George Williams will make his tour bow off the bench but Jake Trueman will not be given a debut.</p>
      <p>Bennett said: “I don’t like going back on my word when I said everyone would play but I cannot give Jake an opportunity because we need to fix things up with the right players in.</p>

      <p>“It is not the time to be trialling anyone. We need to get a victory and I need to have the best players on the field.”</p>
      <p>Leeds winger Handley was expected to play after being called up but Bennett insists he was only ever intended as cover.</p>
      <p>Instead Austin, who had a horror start against the Kiwis last week before recovering well, will again play on the wing.</p>
      <p>The Kumuls lost narrowly to Fiji last Saturday and expected to give the Lions a battle on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But Bennett insists he’s confident, saying: “We are not a basket case, that is the bottom line. If we had taken our opportunities we would have scored more tries.</p>
      <p>“If we were miles behind I would be talking in a different vein but that is not where we are.”</p>
