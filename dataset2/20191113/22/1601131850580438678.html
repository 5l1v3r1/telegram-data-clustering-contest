      <h1>Samsung promotes digital learning among students in India with AESL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T22:06:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Adnan F.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has long focused on catering to the education market with tailor-made solutions. Its latest partnership in India will help promote digital learning among students in the country. It’s for this reason that a new partnership has been reached between Samsung and Aakash Educational Services.</p>
      <p>Aakash Educational Services or AESL is one of the largest competitive exam prep firms in the country. It has a network of more than 200 centers spread across 130 cities attended by over 250,000 students.</p>
      <h3>The partnership will help promote digital learning in India</h3>
      <p>Students will benefit from having access to academic devices in the form of tablets and mobiles as they prepare for examinations that will be conducted in an online environment. Samsung will make such devices available exclusively for AESL students.</p>
      <p>The students would be able to obtain these Samsung devices at special prices. They would be helpful for them in preparing for competitive examinations like JEE Main and JEE Advanced which are computer-based. “We have tied up with Samsung to make its products available easily to students so to enable them to have easy access to online testing,” said Aakash Chaudhry, the CEO of AESL.</p>
      <p>Students are set to benefit from this partnership as they will be able to obtain Samsung’s devices at a special price. This tie-up will thus lower the barrier of entry for students who lack the resources to adequately prepare themselves for computed-based competitive examinations. It will certainly go a long way in promoting digital learning in the country.</p>
