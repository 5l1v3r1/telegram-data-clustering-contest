      <p>The grieving family of a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tragedy-mum-who-went-missing-20869148">mum</a> found dead in her Wishaw home have launched a Just Giving page for her four children in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Emma Watson had <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-confirm-missing-teenager-david-20871170">disappeared</a> from the Gowkthrapple area of Wishaw at around 3.30pm on Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p>Later that night, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-probe-launched-after-body-20873824">police</a> confirmed that the mum had been 'traced safe and well'.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old was dead at her home just two days later on Sunday, November 10.</p>
      <p>There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.</p>
      <p>Heartbroken friends and family have launched a Just Giving page to help raise money for Emma's funeral.</p>
      <p>Sister-in-law Lauren Watson who created the fundraiser said money will also go towards making sure her four grieving children 'get what they deserve' this Christmas.</p>
