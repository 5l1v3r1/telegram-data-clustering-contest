      <p>Did you know that November 12th was “World Champ Champ” day? Well unofficially, that’s what Conor McGregor declared.</p>

      <p>That tweet on Tuesday was in obvious reference to the three-year anniversary of his memorable knockout win over Eddie Alvarez to become the UFC’s first ever simultaneous two-division champion. To date, this is McGregor’s last win inside the Octagon.</p>

      <p>Others have gone on to claim “champ-champ” status following McGregor’s accomplishment, including Bellator’s Patricio “Pitbull” Freire, whose KO of Michael Chandler confirmed his status as the promotion’s king of lightweight and featherweight. In response to Conor’s tweet, Patricio didn’t hold back on what he thinks of McGregor’s short stint as “champ champ.”</p>

      <p>“Says the sh-tty champ champ who didn’t have the balls to defend either title after years of criticizing fighters for not doing so, then made an embarrassment of himself and the sport every day since,” Pitbull wrote.</p>
      <p>McGregor obviously has no belts at the moment, having relinquished the featherweight title shortly after beating Alvarez, then getting stripped of the lightweight belt for prolonged inactivity last year. Khabib Nurmagomedov then choked McGregor out last October to keep him from getting a belt back. Outside the cage, McGregor has notably had the <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/3/30/18287808/conor-mcgregor-officially-cleared-from-ufc-223-bus-attack-case-mma-news">dolly-throwing incident that marred UFC 223 fight week</a>, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/19/20922382/report-conor-mcgregor-investigation-second-sexual-assault-allegation-ufc-news">multiple reported sexual assault investigations</a>, and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/1/20943387/conor-mcgregor-pleads-guilty-to-dublin-pub-assault-fined">a guilty plea for punching a man at a bar</a>.</p>
      <p>While McGregor’s next fight isn’t lined up, Freire will defend his featherweight title in the quarterfinals of Bellator’s 145 lbs tournament against Pedro Carvalho, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/5/20899492/patricio-freire-isnt-allowed-to-beat-up-conor-mcgregor-so-he-settled-for-his-teammate-instead">a teammate of McGregor’s</a>, in March 2020. Patricio, the most prolific featherweight champion in Bellator history, won his opening round matchup by decision against Juan Archuleta back in September.</p>
