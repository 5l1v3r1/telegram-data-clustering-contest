      <p>Ministry of Construction has set a goal of upgrading the rural roads into all-weather roads for 80 per cent of all villages and 90 per cent of the country’s rural population by 2030.</p>
      <p>Rural Road Development Department has laid down the policy for the socio-economic development of rural people through the sustainability development of rural roads and bridges.</p>
      <p>Deputy Minister for Construction Kyaw Lin said according to the Core Rural Road Network (CRRN), the ministry is implementing the rural road and bridge projects on a priority basis, using the budgets allotted for the relevant fiscal years.</p>
      <p>The rural roads are classified into Class-A, Class-B and Class-C. Forty-six per cent of all Class-A road sections are managed by the region and state government while 54 per cent of Class-B and Class-C road sections are under the management of the Union Government.</p>
      <p>In 2030, the ministry has set a plan to implement the systematic urban planning for more than 330 towns across the country.</p>
      <p>“In 2030, over 25,600 (Class-A road) out of 55,500 miles of rural road will be upgraded into 12-ft-wide tar or concrete road. Over 17,300 miles of Class-B road will be upgraded into the 12-ft-wide tar/concrete  and gravel road. Over 12,500 miles of Class-C road will be upgraded into the 12-ft-wide gravel or earthern roads,” Union Construction Minister Han Zaw said.</p>
