      <p>Kazunari Ninomiya, a member of male idol group Arashi, has married a former announcer, his office said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old singer and actor married a 38-year-old woman, Johnny &amp; Associates Inc. said, although it declined to disclose her name. Ninomiya is the first of the five-member group to tie the knot.</p>
      <p>“I’ve married a woman I have been seeing,” he said in a release.</p>
      <p>In a message to his fans, Ninomiya said he had “made the decision to demonstrate his commitment.”</p>
      <p>Arashi — one of the most successful idol groups created by the entertainment agency — said in January that it would suspend its activities at the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The group will hold two concerts at the new National Stadium in May ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. They will also have a concert in Beijing next spring.</p>
      <p>Arashi also performed a song at a national festival at the Imperial Palace Plaza in Tokyo on Saturday to celebrate the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito.</p>
      <p>The group wrote on its Twitter account, set up earlier this month, that they had traveled to Jakarta, Singapore, Bangkok and Taipei over the weekend to meet with fans in Asia.</p>
