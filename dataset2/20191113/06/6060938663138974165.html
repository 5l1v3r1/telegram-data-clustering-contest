      <h1>Will be a shame if Sourav Ganguly has to leave: Gautam Gambhir</h1>

      <p>NEW DELHI: Former Indian opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gambhir">Gautam Gambhir</a> is all for having ex-cricketers serving as administrators in the Indian cricket board adding that it will be unfortunate if <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> and his team will have to vacate office as per the Supreme Court guidelines.</p>
      <p>In his column for the Times of India, Gambhir wrote, "There is a lot of talk about ways and means being discussed to extend the tenure of newly-elected BCCI office-bearers. The agenda circulated for the December 1 AGM of the board clearly suggests that we haven't heard the last on this matter. The voice from the Lodha camp is that this will be "ridiculing Supreme Court". This is understandable considering the efforts that the RM Lodha Committee had put in to suggest reforms for the BCCI constitution. I hope we are not heading for another episode of courtroom deliberations."</p>
      <p>Gambhir added that Indian cricket will only benefit by having Ganguly at the helm of the Indian board.</p>
      <p>"Personally speaking, I am not a big fan of cooling-off period for office-bearers. I have said this before and I will say it again that Indian cricket needs individuals like Sourav Ganguly. They not only have minds of their own but they also have vision and ability to lead inclusive growth. Besides, he knows his weaknesses better than his strengths and knows how to work on them. It will be a shame if Dada has to leave after 10 months. At the same time, I am not suggesting to undo the fantastic work done by Lodha Committee," Gambhir added.</p>
      <p>Gambhir was all praise for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> who starred with the ball for India in the final T20I against Bangladesh at Nagpur on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Talking about knowing one's weaknesses, Deepak Chahar is not too far from that trait. In the last T20 game in Nagpur, he was quick to assess conditions and changed his game plan. Instead of bowling full to get swing, he bowled back of the length or short. He used the largeness of the VCA ground to good effect. Bangladesh let themselves and their fans down yet again. Being 1-0 up in the series and then losing the next two will not and should not go down well with them and their fans. With slow bowlers and a few hustling batsmen in their ranks, this format should have worked well for them. I am afraid that Test series will be no different. Although I hope that the matches will be a bit more closely-fought," Gambhir opined.</p>
      <p>Gambhir opined that the player Bangladesh would miss the most will be <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shakib-Al-Hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a> as he will be handy both with the bat as well as with the ball.</p>
      <p>"They will miss Shakib Al Hasan even more. A quality left-arm spinner is like gold in the second innings with the rough playing a part. Besides, Shakib's batting ability when the second new ball is due and carrying the lower-order with him, are other aspects Bangladesh will miss," Gambhir concluded.</p>
