      <h1>One dead, six injured in suspected suicide bombing at Indonesia police station</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:19:39+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>MEDAN, INDONESIA: </b>A suspected suicide bombing outside a police station in Indonesia has left at least one attacker dead and six other people wounded, authorities said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The explosion happened around 8:45 am local time (0145 GMT) at the compound in Medan on Sumatra island during morning roll call.</p>
      <p>“We suspect this is a suicide bombing with one attacker killed,” national police spokesperson Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>He said at least six people were wounded, including four officers and two civilians, but that their injuries were not severe.</p>
      <p>An <i>AFP</i> reporter at the scene saw a body lying on the ground outside the station.</p>

      <p>The motive for the attack was not immediately known.</p>
      <p>In August, authorities shot and arrested a militant who attacked officers at a station in Indonesia’s second-biggest city Surabaya, while in June another was seriously wounded when he tried to blow himself up outside a police building on Java island.</p>
      <p>Last month, the country’s leader Joko Widodo ordered beefed-up security measures after two militants from an Islamic State-linked terror group stabbed his chief security minister. He survived the attack.</p>
      <p>The pair were later identified as members of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an extremist network loyal to IS and responsible for several previous attacks – including deadly suicide bombings at churches in Surabaya last year.</p>
