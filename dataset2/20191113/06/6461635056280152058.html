      <h1>Pep Guardiola plans a massive raid on Barcelona in 2020</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona could be asked for assistance by Pep Guardiola whose Manchester City has a steep mountain to climb in the Premier League.</h3>
      <p>Ousmane Dembele arrived at Barcelona for a transfer figure exceeding 100 million euros and is one of the world’s most expensive signings. However, the Catalans have not gotten the worth of their money and failed to get the best out of Dembele who has been inconsistent on-field and undisciplined of it.</p>
      <p>Given that Neymar was on the radar of the Blaugrana during the summer and Paris Saint-Germain had set an exorbitant price on him, Barca were willing to offer Dembele to the French champions in return of the Brazil international, however, nothing fell through and Dembele did not even start life properly at the Camp Nou in 2019/20.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/barcelona-ousmane-dembele-manchester-city-interest-report"><b>Caught Offside</b></a> has now claimed that Manchester City are interested in making a move for the World Cup winner. Pep Guardiola’s side is nine points behind Liverpool in its defence of the Premier League and most of it is down to injuries. One of the chief players facing a lengthy layoff is Leroy Sane who is potent with goals and assists throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>Sane will be on the recovery table until 2020 and even after recovering, he could be heading to Bayern Munich who have shown interest in signing him. The Germany international was seemingly unhappy with the playing time he had at the Etihad Stadium during the second half of last season following Bernardo Silva’s surge in form.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola feels that Ousmane Dembele has the potential to succeed with Manchester City and that the former Borussia Dortmund winger can live up to the hype created around should he sign with the Citizens. Raheem Sterling was also seen with a similar eye by the former Barca boss so it is believable that he has a plan for Dembele.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dembele on his part should consider moving to the Premier League where he will be playing under a much better manager than Ernesto Valverde. Plus, the winger reportedly has had quarrels internally at the club and is not in the good books of Lionel Messi, somethings which will be very difficult for him to mend unless he moves out.</p>
      <p>Do you think Ousmane Dembele would sign for Manchester City in the next year?</p>
