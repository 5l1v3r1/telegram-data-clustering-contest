      <h1>John Legend named "2019 Sexiest Man Alive" by People Magazine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:40:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:40</time> by <a rel="author">CBS/AP</a></address>
      <p>John Legend has been named the Sexiest Man Alive by People Magazine this year. The Grammy-winning singer known for his silky-smooth vocals was revealed as this year's winner Tuesday night on NBC's "The Voice." He serves as a coach on the singing competition series with Gwen Stefani, Kelly Clarkson and Blake Shelton.</p>
      <p>Shelton, who was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blake-shelton-brags-about-sexiest-man-alive-title-on-twitter/">named Sexiest Man Alive in 2017</a>, announced Legend's honor on "The Voice." Legend told the magazine in an issue out Friday that receiving the title comes with some pressure to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/idris-elba-named-this-years-sexiest-man-alive-by-people-magazine/">follow Idris Elba</a>, who was last year's winner. He joked it was, "not fair and is not nice to me!"</p>
      <p>Legend is a 10-time Grammy winner. The 40-year-old scored an Oscar in 2015 for co-writing the song "Glory" from the film "Selma." He won a Tony Award for his co-producer work on "Jitney" and took home an Emmy as a producer on NBC's live version of "Jesus Christ Superstar," a project in which he also played the role of Jesus.</p>
      <p>Other recent winners include <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dwayne-johnson-named-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-contemplating-a-presidential-run/">Dwayne Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-hunk-is-sexiest-man-alive-for-2014/">Chris Hemsworth</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/david-beckham-is-peoples-sexiest-man-alive/">David Beckham</a>.  </p>
      <p>Legend has two children with model-television host-cookbook author Chrissy Teigen, who tweeted her excitement at the news Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Legend said his wife is proud of him. The couple's children? Not so much. Teigen <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1194427221965852672">posted a video</a> of the reveal of their daughter asking to turn off "The Voice" and go back to a movie. Teigen titled the post "The kids ... do not care."</p>
