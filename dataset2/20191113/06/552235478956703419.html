      <h1>Glen Kamara explains Steven Gerrard's Rangers midfield masterclasses and three key elements that make Steven Davis special</h1>
      <h2>The Finnish international has revealed two major Ibrox midfield influences.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> reckons daily midfield masterclasses with Steven Gerrard have helped him up his game.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was signed from Dundee back in January and has quickly established himself as a first pick under the guidance of the Liverpool and England legend.</p>
      <p>Kamara has started every Europa League group game and in recent weeks has also made the holding midfield position his own in domestic competition.</p>
      <p>Things could scarcely be any better at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> and that’s the case with his country too as he prepares to make history with Finland by blazing a trail to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a>, Kamara said: “The manager has been massive for me and the whole team.</p>
      <p>“He has helped us all collectively and he has also really helped me individually as well.</p>
      <p>“He has me working on a few things in training and just wants me to express myself more.</p>
      <p>“The boss wants me to get on the ball, influence the games and have more belief in myself.</p>

      <p>“He has given me the confidence to go out and play.</p>
      <p>“We have a lot of competition in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> midfield but that has been good. You need that competitive side in the squad.</p>
      <p>“We have had a lot of games and we have a lot more coming up, domestically and in Europe.</p>
      <p>“So you always need strength in depth in your squad.</p>
      <p>“I feel I have been doing OK and in every game I have just been trying to improve myself.</p>
      <p>“I now have better players around me and that is without being disrespectful to any of the teams or players I’ve played with in the past.</p>
      <p>“When you play with top players, like I am at Rangers, then you respond to them.”</p>
      <p>Steven Davis is now getting back to the sort of form he showed in his first Ibrox spell and Kamara admits the Northern Ireland star has also been a big influence.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His fellow midfielder said: “Steven has been great for me.</p>
      <p>“You learn a lot from just watching him in training or games.</p>
      <p>“His experience, movement and intelligence are all there for all to see. He has been great since he came into the club and the good thing is he is so experienced having played at the top level.”</p>
      <p>Rangers are matching champions Celtic step for step at the top of the table and in the Europa League they have really come to the fore, sitting second in Group G above Feyenoord and Porto.</p>
      <p>Kamara said: “That has been a massive experience. It has been good for us playing against some top teams and players.</p>
      <p>“We have really been able to test ourselves and it has been great. We are doing well in our group and had a great result against Porto last week. We are in a good position.”</p>
