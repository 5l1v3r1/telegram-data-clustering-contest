      <p>The bushfire at Pechey, north of Toowoomba, was sparked on Tuesday and is “getting worse”, according to the fire service.</p>
      <p>Firefighters on the ground have been battling the blaze with support from aerial waterbombers.</p>
      <p>Queensland is on high alert amid severe fire conditions, with a forecast wind change expected to worsen several large blazes in difficult-to-access areas of the state.</p>
      <p>About 70 fires are burning in the state, with Pechey residents told the safest option is to leave the area as conditions are currently too dangerous.</p>
      <p>Dozens of fires are also ablaze in neighbouring New South Wales state, where cooler southerly winds have eased conditions and brought relief to firefighters and residents.</p>
      <p>Difficult conditions were expected to flare again at the weekend as the temperature rises and winds pick up.</p>
