      <p>The SAG-AFTRA awards are voted on by the 160,000-strong actor union. The lifetime achievement award is presented to an actor who fosters “the finest ideals of the acting profession.”</p>
      <p>De Niro, a co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York, is already the recipient of some of the highest cultural honours in the United States, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Kennedy Center honour.</p>
      <p>“From the smoldering inferno of young Vito Corleone to the raging bull Jake LaMotta and everybody’s grandpa Ben Whittaker, (De Niro) continues to touch our hearts and open our minds to new and exciting worlds of understanding and emotion,” SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement, referring to his roles in The Godfather II, Raging Bull, and The Intern.</p>
