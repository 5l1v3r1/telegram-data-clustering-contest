      <h1>Sterling is my idol and England leader: Hudson-Odoi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:31:50+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>BURTON ON TRENT: </b>Raheem Sterling may have been dropped for England’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday, after a clash with team mate Joe Gomez, but for winger Callum Hudson-Odoi he remains a leader for the Three Lions.</p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate axed Sterling for Thursday’s game at Wembley after an incident in the canteen at their St. George’s Park training facility on Monday.</p>
      <p>The pair had squared off at Anfield in the Premier League on Sunday where Sterling’s Manchester City were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool, with Gomez coming on as a late substitute in the top-of-the-table battle. Southgate and several players have sought to put the incident behind them.</p>

      <p>Sterling remains with the squad and could feature in Sunday’s qualifier away to Kosovo. Yet the man who could replace him in attack on Thursday, Chelsea winger Hudson-Odoi, does not doubt Sterling’s importance to him and the rest of the squad.</p>
      <p>“Someone like Raheem is like an idol to me. The position he plays, and what he’s doing for club and country, is an amazing thing, which I will try to replicate myself.</p>
      <p>“It is an amazing feeling to have someone like him doing what he’s doing and being around you every time. I want to keep learning off what he does. He is a nice person to be around, very positive,” said the 19-year-old.</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi broke into the Chelsea first team last season and quickly earned an England debut against the Czech Republic at Wembley in March —  coming on as a substitute for Sterling after the City forward had scored a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Yet Sterling had already made an impression on Hudson-Odoi with the way he welcomed him into the England camp.</p>
      <p>“Raheem’s a very nice guy, he’s very encouraging, very positive about everything he does. When I first came in, I didn’t expect him to be so nice. Of course he is a nice person but when you see somebody always welcoming you, just talking to you, giving you advice on how he plays and just being around you a lot it makes you feel so welcome in the team,” he said.</p>

      <p>Those qualities mean that Sterling, who captained England against the Netherlands in the Nations League semi-final in June, is considered a leader by the Chelsea winger.</p>
      <p>“Definitely. He’s very positive about what he does. Whenever he says something, he wants to take a stance and make sure everything is OK with it,” Hudson-Odoi said.</p>
      <p>“For someone like him, he’s a big leader in the team because he’s a very top player, he’s in club and country playing every game, working really hard, scoring a lot of goals.”</p>
      <p>Hudson-Odoi says he also appreciates the public stance Sterling has taken about racism in the game.</p>
      <p>“For someone like that to have a say on racism, it is a big feeling for all of us. He is sticking up for everyone who is involved in the game. It is a great feeling to know he’s going to do that,” he said.</p>
