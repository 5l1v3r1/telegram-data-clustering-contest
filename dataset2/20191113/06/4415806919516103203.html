      <p>Idris Elba and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson have congratulated John Legend after the US singer succeeded them in being named sexiest man alive by People magazine.</p>
      <p>Legend, a 40-year-old multiple Grammy Award winner, graces the magazine’s cover alongside the caption “how a good guy got it all”.</p>
      <p>He admitted to being “perplexed” at being honoured with the title of sexiest man alive.</p>

      <p>Legend shared a throwback picture of himself wearing a shirt and tie and oversized glasses, along side a snap of a smouldering Elba – who was named sexiest man in 2018 – pulling away his jumper to reveal his toned chest.</p>
      <p>Legend captioned the post: “1995 John would be very perplexed to be following 2018 @IdrisElba as #SexiestManAlive.</p>
      <p>“Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed but thank you @People<br/>for finding me sexy. I’ll take it.”</p>

      <p>Luther star Elba, 47,  congratulated Legend, tweeting to say “you deserve it”.</p>
      <p>He also poked fun at The Rock, who held the title in 2016.</p>
      <p>“DO NOT TELL @TheRock,” he said. “He still thinks he’s got the title, I didn’t have the heart to tell him when I took it.”</p>

      <p>The Rock replied, telling Legend “Welcome to the club. You earned this one. Just like I did.”</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old Hollywood star then joked: “And unlike @idriselba<br/>who paid @people 50% of his future earnings for his sexy title.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The three of us will raise a tequila glass soon. Congrats again you sexy SOB.”</p>

      <p>Legend’s wife, the TV presenter and model Chrissy Teigen, had a typically humorous response to her husband’s new title.</p>
      <p>“I cannot WAIT for people to get mad about John being the sexiest man alive,” she said. “It’s my new Starbucks holiday cup.”</p>
      <p>Teigen, who has two children with Legend, tweeted: “I have fulfilled my dream of having boned @people’s sexiest man alive!! an honour!!!!!”</p>
      <p>She also changed her Twitter bio to “currently sleeping with people’s sexiest man alive”.</p>
