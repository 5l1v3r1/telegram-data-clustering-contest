      <p>Lebanese popular anchor Darine El Helwe was on live broadcast from Riad Soloh Square in the capital Beirut when a male protester kissed her on her cheek, according to <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/harassment-debate-erupts-after-lebanese-reporter-kissed-on-live-broadcast-1.67775700"><i>Gulf News</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Lebanese have been protesting since October 17 demanding an overhaul of the country’s ruling elite widely considered as corrupt.</p>
      <p>While the protesters have somber and serious demands, it hasn’t stopped many from enjoying their time whilst demonstrating.</p>
      <p>Many protesters have taken selfies and videos with television reporters widely considered to be heroes of the uprising.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Gulf News</i>, El Helwi called the kiss “unacceptable”.</p>
      <p>“I was live when I felt the kiss, without seeing him. I tried to continue reporting professionally although my voice was shaky. Despite the unacceptable act, I remained emotionally stable and maintained eye contact with the camera,” she said.</p>
      <p>However, after the kisser publicly apologised on Facebook, El Hewli said she felt less angry about the incident.</p>
