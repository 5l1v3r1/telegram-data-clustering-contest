      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 13): Dialog Group Bhd is actively looking to acquire Malaysian brownfield oil and gas (O&amp;G) assets to grow the company's upstream business to account for at least one-third of the O&amp;G support services provider's net profit from 20% currently.</p>
      <p>Dialog executive chairman Tan Sri Dr Ngau Boon Keat told reporters after the group's annual general meeting here today that now is a good time for asset acquisitions given lower crude oil prices.</p>
      <p>Also, a balanced contribution from all three segments — upstream, midstream, and downstream — allows the group to better hedge against the volatile O&amp;G market, Ngau said.</p>
      <p>He said Dialog's midstream and downstream businesses currently contribute about 40% each to the group's bottom line.</p>
      <p>"There will be quite a lot [of assets] up for sale as oil majors move back to the US. Here, [although] the old fields are not so interesting [to them], they appear very interesting to us.</p>
      <p>"We are actively looking, but nothing is definite yet. We will announce when we are sure," Ngau said.</p>
      <p>On Exxon Mobil Corp's proposed sale of its upstream offshore O&amp;G assets in Malaysia, Ngau said Dialog has looked into it but no decision has been made so far.</p>
      <p>"We are just looking at it. But they are big, we are not sure whether we are qualified to buy by ourselves.</p>
      <p>"If anything, we may join (partner) with others. But at the moment, we have not decided," he said.</p>
      <p>Last month, <i>Bloomberg</i>, quoting people with knowledge on Exxon Mobil's proposed O&amp;G asset sale, reported that Exxon Mobil is considering a sale of its Malaysian upstream offshore assets as the US energy giant continues with its divestiture programme.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the company is working with an adviser on the potential sale of the Malaysian assets, which could raise about US$2 billion (about RM8.31 billion) to US$3 billion.</p>
      <p>At Bursa Malaysia's afternoon break today, Dialog's share price settled one sen or 0.29% lower at RM3.46 at 12:30pm for a market capitalisation of RM19.57 billion.</p>
      <p>In crude oil markets, <i>Reuters </i>reported that Brent crude futures edged down 18 cents or 0.3% to US$61.88 a barrel by 0411 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude was at US$56.67, down 13 cents or 0.2%.</p>
