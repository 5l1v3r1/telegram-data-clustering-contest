      <h1>YouTube's New Kids' Content System Has Creators Scrambling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">BeauHD</a></address>
      <p>As of Tuesday afternoon, YouTube is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963459/youtube-google-coppa-ftc-fine-settlement-youtubers-new-rules">requiring creators to label any videos of theirs that may appeal to children</a>. If they say a video is directed at kids, data collection will be blocked for all viewers, resulting in lower ad revenue and the loss of some of the platform's most popular features, including comments and end screens. It's a major change in how YouTube works, and has left some creators clueless as to whether they're subject to the new rules. The Verge reports: <i>Reached by The Verge, Google confirmed that this new system was the result of <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/09/04/148252/google-to-pay-170-million-to-settle-ftc-claims-that-youtube-collected-kids-data-illegally">a landmark $170 million settlement</a> YouTube reached with the Federal Trade Commission in September for allegedly violating children's privacy. It's the largest fine ever collected under the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children's-privacy">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</a> (COPPA), which forbids collecting data from children under the age of 13 without explicit consent from their parents. In this case, the ruling means YouTube can't employ its powerful ad-targeting system on anyone who might be under the age of 13 -- a dire problem for a platform with so many young users. <br/><br/>The new system is already sending creators reeling over what exactly is considered kids' content and what could happen if they unintentionally mislabel videos. Some of YouTube's most popular categories falls into a gray area for the policy, including gaming videos, family vlogging, and toy reviews. [...] In theory, YouTube has always been subject to COPPA, but those restrictions have taken on new urgency in the wake of the recent settlement with the FTC. Under the terms of the settlement, YouTube is required to "develop, implement, and maintain a system for Channel Owners to designate whether their Content on the YouTube Service is directed to Children." Under the system that YouTube rolled out on Tuesday, creators who strictly make children's content can also have their entire channel designated as directed at children. Once a video is labeled as kids' content, all personalized ads will be shut off, replaced with "contextualized" advertising based on the video itself. </i>In addition to the removal of targeted ads, child-directed YouTube videos will also no longer include a comments section, click-through info cards, end screens, notification functions, and the community tab. <br/><br/>"The consequences for not labeling a video as 'child-directed' could be even more severe," reports The Verge. "In its September order, the FTC made it clear that it could sue individual channel owners who abuse this new labeling system. Crucially, those lawsuits will fall entirely on channel owners, rather than on YouTube itself. Under the settlement, YouTube's responsibility is simply to maintain the system and provide ongoing data updates."</p>
