      <p>Russell Books is attempting to set the first-ever record for the tallest stack of Guinness World Records books.</p>
      <p>The event happens Thursday — Guinness World Record Day — at 4:30 p.m. at the bookstore’s new location at 747 Fort St.</p>
      <p>An official adjudicator from Guinness World Records is expected to attend.</p>
      <p>The best-selling Guinness World Records has been publishing its yearly lists of extremes and achievements since 1955.</p>
      <p>Russell Books has collected many copies since opening a store for used and new books in Victoria in 1991. The Times Colonist Book Sale has been a major source.</p>
      <p>The event was planned to celebrate the move across Fort Street to the new location, which is nearly complete.</p>
