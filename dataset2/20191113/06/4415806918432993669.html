      <h1>DCC shares fall 6% on profit decline</h1>

      <p>Shares in diversified support services group DCC fell by more than 6% on the back of a significant fall in profits and revenue in the first half of its financial year.</p>
      <p>The Dublin-based group - whose interests range from retail fuels to healthcare and technology — said it generated a pre-tax profit of £57.6m (€67m) for the six months to the end of September, down from a profit of £85.9m for the same period last year. First half group revenues fell by 1.4%, year-on-year, to just over £7.3bn.</p>
      <p>However, DCC said on an adjusted basis operating profits jumped by 14.5% to £162.6m, with each of its divisions showing progress.</p>
      <p>“Notwithstanding the continuing uncertain macroeconomic outlook impacting the UK economy and the Technology business in particular, the group believes that the year [up to the end of March] will be another year of good operating profit growth and further development and will be broadly in line with current market consensus expectations,” said group chief executive Donal Murphy.</p>
      <p>DCC’s London-based shares are up by over 14% over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>DCC has also increased its footprint in the US, with its Healthy and Beauty Solutions division aquiring Ion Laboratories — a Florida-based contract manufacturer of health supplements and nutritional products.</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy suggested DCC would look for further acquisition opportunities in this area, saying: “The US is the world’s largest health supplements and nutritional products market. It is also an innovative, high-growth market, with a fragmented contract manufacturing base. We continue to be excited by significant opportunities for growth,” he said.</p>
