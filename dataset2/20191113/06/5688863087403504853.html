        <b>Indian Captain Virat Kohli and pace sensation Jasprit Bumrah have retained their top spots in the latest ICC ODI rankings. Kohli had a fantastic ODI series against the Windies and has 895 points, while nobody managed to dethrone injury-sidelined Bumrah as he tops the bowlers' charts with 797 points.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Arguably the best batsman and the bowler in the country, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/virat_kohli">Virat Kohli</a> and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jasprit_bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a> have respectively maintained their status as the best in the world in the latest ODI ranking charts released by the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a>.Â </p>
      <p>While Kohli is at rank one with 895 points, his deputy <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> grabs the second spot with 834 points. Rohit has had a dream 2019, having scored five centuries in the 2019 Cricket World Cup and currently, is arguably, the best white-ball opener in the world at the moment.</p>
      <p>Bumrah has been sidelined with a lower back stress fracture but the impact that he's had is so high that he still sits pretty on top spot with 797 points. He is followed by New Zealand speedster <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/trent_boult">Trent Boult</a>, who, too, had a pretty impressive World Cup and has 740 points to his name.</p>
      <p>As far as all-rounders are concerned, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/hardik_pandya">Hardik Pandya</a> is the only Indian in the top 10 rankings with a rating of 246 points after a not-so-impressive World Cup. Unsurprisingly, England's World Cup star <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ben_stokes">Ben Stokes</a> sits on rank one with a rating of 319 points and is followed by Afghanistan all-rounder <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mohammad_nabi">Mohammad Nabi</a>.</p>
