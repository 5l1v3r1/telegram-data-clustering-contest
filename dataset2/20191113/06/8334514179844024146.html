      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Display reported on Wednesday an 11th consecutive quarterly net loss on sluggish display sales and restructuring costs as the cash-strapped company scrambles to clinch a bailout deal with Apple Inc and other investors.</p>
      <p>The liquid crystal display (LCD) maker for smartphones, which gets more than half of its revenue from Apple, posted a net loss of 25.4 billion yen ($233 million) in the July-September quarter, wider than the 7.8 billion loss a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Japan Display, money-losing for the past five years due to slowing Apple iPhone sales and the delayed adoption of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, did not give a full-year earnings outlook.</p>
      <p>But CEO Minoru Kikuoka, who took the helm in September, told an earnings briefing the company turned profitable in October.</p>
      <p>Japan Display is seeking to raise at least 50 billion yen ($470 million), having had to scramble after Chinese investment firm Harvest suddenly pulled out of a bailout plan.</p>
      <p>Of the planned bailout funds, Apple intends to invest $200 million, sources with direct knowledge of the talks have said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong-based Oasis Management is likely to contribute $150-180 million, Japan Display has said.</p>
      <p>Concerns about an immediate cash shortfall have been allayed as Apple has agreed to shorten payment periods, a source familiar with the matter said.</p>
