      <p>A mission to space proved no more than a teddy bear’s picnic for one little school mascot.</p>
      <p>On Friday, pupils at St Brigid’s Primary in Newmains welcomed back “Space Teddy” who had completed a full month on board the international space station as part of a NASA project.</p>
      <p>The cuddly toy, complete with school tie, left Newmains with the astronauts last year as part of a scheme organised by the Scottish Space School program at University of Strathclyde.</p>
      <p>Marianne Ballantyne, department manager of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the university, said: “As part of the space school programme, NASA visit schools within a one-hour drive of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“Joel Montalbano, who is the deputy ISS program manager, asked the school to provide a small memento to go to space and the school gave him Teddy.</p>
      <p>“Nothing goes to space without him saying so and he stuck to his word and got it taken up.”</p>
      <p>Space Teddy travelled 12.7 million miles between May 4 and June 3 before being returned to the school last week.</p>
      <p>Pupil Erin McLaughin, 11, said: “I wasn’t here to see the teddy go but it is cool to see it come back to Earth.”</p>
      <p>Emil Filipczak, 10, said: “It is good entertainment for people, it gives us a story to tell everyone.”</p>
      <p>Maya Robertson, 12, was in primary seven when the teddy went away. She went back to visit when he returned.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is good to see Teddy back after that journey.”</p>
