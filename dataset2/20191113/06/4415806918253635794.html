      <p>Police have increased security around Hong Kong and its university campuses as they braced for more violence after sharp clashes overnight with anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>Many subway and rail stations were closed after the protesters blocked commutes and vandalised trains overnight into Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police and protesters battled on multiple fronts overnight at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, with petrol bombs and fires lighting up the night time scene.</p>
      <p>A police official warned protesters were carrying out “insane acts” and Hong Kong was on the brink of a total breakdown after more than five months of protests.</p>

      <p>“Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown,” Senior Police Superintendent Kong Wing-heung said late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He said Hong Kong’s mass transit system and subway, known as MRT, was under stress from acts of violence and vandalism.</p>
      <p>“Masked rioters have lost control and committed insane acts like throwing trash, bicycles and large objects onto MTR tracks, hanging trash on overhead power lines,” he added.</p>
      <p>Groups of riot police were deployed around central Hong Kong and its outlying territories to try and contain new violence, even as students at the Chinese University — located in the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis — prepared for new clashes with police.</p>
      <p>Many were armed with petrol bombs while some carried bows and arrows.</p>

      <p>The university’s student union president, Jacky So, appealed for an injunction with the High Court to ban police from entering the campus without a warrant or the school’s approval.</p>
      <p>Police had entered the campus and fired tear gas and used a water cannon late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The injunction would also block police from using crowd control weapons, such as tear gas and rubber bullets at the university, and a decision is expected late on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The city’s religious leaders have appealed for an end to the violence and called on both police and protesters to show restraint.</p>
      <p>“At this very critical point, the people of Hong Kong must unite and say no to violence,” said a statement issued by the leaders of Hong Kong’s six major religious groups.</p>

      <p>Recent weeks have been marked by escalating vandalism of shops linked to mainland China and train stations, and assaults by both protesters and pro-Beijing supporters.</p>
      <p>On Monday, a police officer drew his gun during a struggle with protesters, shooting one in the abdomen.</p>
      <p>In another neighbourhood, a 57-year-old man who was defending China was set on fire after an apparent argument.</p>
      <p>Both remained in a critical condition in hospital on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police have arrested more than 3,500 people since the movement began in June.</p>
      <p>The protests began over a proposed law that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China, where they could face opaque and politically sensitive trials.</p>
      <p>Activists saw the bill as another sign of an erosion in Hong Kong’s autonomy and civic freedoms, which China promised would be maintained for 50 years under a “one nation, two systems” principle when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.</p>
