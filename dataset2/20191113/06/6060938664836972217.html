      <h1>PGA Tour dream is still alive: Gaganjeet Bhullar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T06:01:52+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Moushumi-Bora-17023.cms" target="_blank">Moushumi Bora</a></address>
      <p>MEWAT: "Thanks for reminding me that," said <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gaganjeet-Bhullar">Gaganjeet Bhullar</a>, cracking a smile. The gentle recall was that the Indian golf star has won all his nine Asian Tour titles abroad and is still searching for a home win.</p>
      <p>Bhullar did come close ten years ago, the last time he played a tournament here at the Classic Golf &amp; Country Club - he finished tied-2nd on 22-under. But then, it was so far as the Nirat legend of '32-under' was etched in the record books.</p>
      <p>"That feels like yesterday. That was the year when I won my first Asian Tour and PGTI events so 2009 was my breakthough year, a good year to remember."</p>
      <p>Home, of course, could be anywhere you lay your cap. For Gaganjeet, it's Sacramento, California now. "The weather's nice but there's no time to bask in the sunshine or visit places down the coastline. My coach Noah Montgomery makes me work hard, seven days a week, and I wouldn't have it any other way."</p>
      <p>The decision to move to the United States came in 2015 and it immediately paid dividends as he bounced back from a debilitating wrist injury with two Asian Tour wins. "That's the closest I can play to tournament conditions so that was my main agenda while moving because in India, I was not getting the right golf courses and the right kind of practice facility to improve my game," said the 31-year-old who frequents the Dark Horse course at the foothills of Sierra Nevada. "On the personal front, I have more cousins in California than India so that works out fine too."</p>
      <p>It's back to the foothills of the Aravallis now, and Bhullar, after a three-week break feels rejuvenated. "Mentally, I'm at a better place. I had a long, long season; a lot of travelling. I was thinking of playing last week in Thailand but I skipped the tournament because I needed to. Physically also I'm better now. I felt a slight tweak in my hamstring at the Open de France and decided to withdraw from the event, and I missed Portugal too."</p>
      <p>Pizza and pasta on the European journey had taken its toll on the body. "I thought the moment I get back to India, I'll get back in shape and start practising."</p>
      <p>The $400,000 Panasonic Open India is sort of a restart as he prepares himself for the year ahead, with eyes firmly on new targets. "Last year, my aim was to get my status back on the European Tour and I got it with my win in Fiji. In 2020, I just want to improve my rankings. My best is 84 and so I am going to try and get inside the top 100 again. That's how the doors open. If you get close enough to the Top 50, that's when you start getting invites for the WGCs and other biggies. The dream of playing on the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/PGA-Tour">PGA Tour</a> is still alive and the only way there is by improving my world ranking."</p>
      <p>The Tokyo Olympics is also at the back of his mind. "It is the destination but apart from that, unlike other sports, we do have other targets as well."</p>
      <p>And does he feel a tinge of envy when he watches his peers do well? "Every week, every day. That's the story of a sportsperson." Inspiration is the right word, he corrects. "Personally, I feel so motivated when Anirban or Shubhankar play well, and I'm sure it's the other way round too. Golf being an individual sport, this is how you grow as a player. This is what I learnt from Jeev, Jyoti and Arjun, we all have to push each other and that's how a sport picks up."</p>
