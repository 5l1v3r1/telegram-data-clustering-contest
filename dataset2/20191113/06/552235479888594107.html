      <h2>Elisabeth Steel signed petitions demanding an end to animal cruelty and even shared an animal welfare post on facebook insisting 'people like him shouldn't have a dog'.</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> woman who pleaded guilty to duct-taping a muzzle to her dog’s face had previously joined online campaigns against cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p>Elisabeth Steel’s behaviour was branded “sickening” by a sheriff when she appeared in the dock at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the 44-year-old had inflicted horrific cruelty towards her dog, named Rio, and caused him unnecessary suffering.</p>
      <p>Steel, of Methven Avenue, left her collie locked in a kitchen without food or water and duct-taped a muzzle to the animal’s face – then went on holiday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, Steel had previously shared petitions calling for harsher consequences for those who abuse animals.</p>
      <p>A post on her Facebook timeline about an animal welfare case in November 2015, read: “I am sick to death of animals being mistreated and also people like him shouldn’t have a dog.”</p>

      <p>Earlier that year, she shared a petition calling for Facebook to crack down on the glorification of animal cruelty.</p>
      <p>The post read: “I don’t like animal cruelty at all, I have been brought up with dogs and other animals.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Steel pleaded guilty to failing to provide adequate care for her dog, who was left abandoned with sores, hair loss and fleas.</p>
      <p>The court heard how Rio was only saved after a neighbour, aware that Steel had gone on holiday earlier in the day, heard the dog whimpering from the property downstairs on July 18.</p>

      <p>He saw the dog wearing a muzzle “wrapped with black tape” and “noted that there was no food or water” before contacting the Scottish SPCA and police.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Officers who attended saw the black and white collie lying within the kitchen area. After forcing entry into the property, they found the dog was still alive and began to walk around.</p>
      <p>The fiscal depute stated: “The door was bolted shut. There was no food or water within the bowls and the dog was wearing a muzzle wrapped in black tape and was also wearing a collar which was too tight.”</p>
      <p>Steel was interviewed and told police that she was the owner of the dog who was later taken into the care of the SSPCA.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Defending agent Graeme Cunningham said he would say more on her behalf after social work reports had been prepared for the court.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Alastair Watson said: “This is a pretty sickening piece of behaviour towards a helpless animal and I will have to consider how best to deal with you.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Watson added that he would likely disqualify Steel from owning animals when she reappears for sentencing next month.</p>
      <p>Following Steel’s appearance in court, Scottish SPCA chief inspector Laura McIntyre said: “This was an awful case of cruelty causing Rio to suffer unnecessarily. We are pleased Steel has admitted the offence.”</p>
