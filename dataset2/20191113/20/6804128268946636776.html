      <h1>Jose Mourinho to Arsenal: Contender for Spurs job, Man United star's hint, demand from next job</h1>
      <h2>A round-up of all the latest Jose Mourinho speculation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:25:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Tashan Deniran-Alleyne</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho remains out of work, but it is no secret that the former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss is keen on a return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has not found another job since being sacked by Manchester United last season and his prediction of being back on the touchline this season still hasn't yet come to fruition.</p>
      <p>But could he be back in the dugout sooner rather than later? Reports claim the 56-year-old is keen to take charge of another Premier League club because he wants to become the first manager to win major honours with three English sides.</p>
      <p>Is Arsenal his destination? Or will it be Totttenham?</p>
      <p>With that said, here's all the latest stories.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho's one demand</h3>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> revealed he was ready for a return to management - but on one condition.</p>
      <p>And that's to manage a club where the aim is to win.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I know is what I don't want," Mourinho told the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice/status/1169655933028503552">Coaches' Voice</a>. "What I don't want is crystal clear.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"What I want - the general profile of it of course - but I cannot say clubs and country. I am quite pathological in this sense that I have to play to win.</p>
      <p>"Then if I win or don't win it's my problem, the players, the club and the structure. But I need a project where the feeling is that I play to win.</p>
      <p>"If someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing 10-year contract and the objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, If you finish seventh or eighth or ninth is perfect that's not for me. That's my nature."</p>

      <h3>La Liga hint</h3>
      <p>Less than a week after that interview, Mourinho dropped a major hint that he was set for a return to La Liga six years after leaving Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing for me is that my next role is with an elite club that has an ambition which challenges and excites me," <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/former-chelsea-man-united-boss-16919270">he said</a>. "I miss coaching a lot, but I won’t return to working just for the sake of coaching again.</p>
      <p>"I love La Liga and the pride I have to have won this fantastic league is massive.</p>

      <h3>Zidane speaks out</h3>
      <p>Amid links with a return to the Santiago Bernabeu, current Los Blancos boss Zinedine Zidane appeared unbothered.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't annoy me that his name is linked, that's how it is," the Frenchman <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/what-zinedine-zidane-said-ex-16959943">said</a>. "I don't have to say if it annoys me or not, that's the situation.</p>
      <p>"Here, you lose a game and you have to change something. It's difficult, but that's the reality."</p>
      <h3>Wenger dig</h3>
      <p>It's little surprise that Arsenal fans are split on this Mourinho rumour. Those who are against the 'special one' replacing Emery are probably big supporters of Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>And that stance isn't going to change if Mourinho continues to poke fun at his old rival.</p>
      <p>Problem is, he can't resist a dig.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/paddypower/status/1177175984560168960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>After being named ambassador for Paddy Power Games, Mourinho starred in a TV advert and whilst donning a suit poked fun at Wenger.</p>
      <p>"Special is effortless," he says, before the camera focuses on a bookshelf as he walks past, in which is seen a book entitled 'Le Specialiste En Failure.</p>
      <p>Of course this is in reference to Mourinho once labelling Wenger "a specialist in failure".</p>
      <h3>Ozil reunion</h3>
      <p>Despite being named in the squad to face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup tonight, Mesut Ozi's future at Arsenal remains unclear.</p>
      <p>At least while Emery is still in charge.</p>
      <p>Yet, he could enjoy a new lease of life if we was reunited with Mourinho - who he worked under at Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>Ozil enjoyed one of his most productive seasons under Mourinho, and has made no secret of his excellent relationship with him.</p>
      <p>According to Opta, his overall record of assists per game under Mourinho is 0.46 per game</p>

      <h3>Mourinho's 'assurances'</h3>
      <p>A manager of Mourinho's calibre would obviously seek some assurances before accepting a job offer.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/arsenal/story/3976965/sources-jose-mourinho-open-to-replacing-unai-emery-at-arsenal">ESPN</a> claim the Portuguese tactician would want one thing from Josh Kroenke, Raul Sanllehi and Edu...</p>
      <p>...Funds.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Jose Mourinho gives a thumbs up (Image: Alex Livesey/Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The report states that Mourinho would want assurances from the board that funds were available to allow a serious challenge at silverware.</p>
      <h3>Truth about Mourinho's 'dinner' with Raul Sanllehi</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-set-their-sights-on-jose-mourinho-95rwpx0r6">The Times</a>, Arsenal have begun preparing the ground for a change of management, with 'fractures' appearing between Unai Emery and members of the playing squad.</p>
      <p>The report claims Arsenal are looking for a manager with strong knowledge of the Premier League who can bring an identity to a squad who were reassembled at significant expense in the summer window.</p>
      <p>And that they are considering a move for Jose Mourinho who dined with head of football Raul Sanllehi last week.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, <b>football.london</b> understands Sanllehi did not have dinner with Mourinho and has not spoken to the former Chelsea manager in years.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho to Bayern Munich?</h3>
      <p>The big news coming out of Germany is the Bayern Munich have parted company with Niko Kovac following a 5-1 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>One will expect Mourinho to be heavily linked with the vacant position.</p>
      <p>And he's been tipped for the role by former Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I can imagine Mourinho in Germany," the former Manchester United star <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/bastian-schweinsteiger-suggests-its-time-for-thomas-m%C3%BCller-to-leave-bayern-munich/a-51097264">said</a>. "I remember he was always asking me about Bayern and the Bundesliga. During our away games, there was always Bundesliga on TV.</p>
      <p>"He really knew every single player, even from the smaller teams. He was also learning German."</p>
      <h3>'Discussions' with Arsenal</h3>
      <p>French outlet <a href="https://twitter.com/SoccerLink_/status/1192027342614474752">Soccerlink</a> claim Jose Mourinho is in discussions with Arsenal over a potential move.</p>
      <p>With former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger becoming the new favourite to take the Bayern Munich job, Mourinho's options appear to have reduced and the website claims the former Manchester United boss is in talks with the north London side.</p>
      <p><b>football.london</b> understands that this is not the case, however, and Unai Emery's job is safe for now, with the Arsenal hierarchy reluctant to make a managerial change in the middle of the season.</p>
      <h3>Victor Lindelof's admission</h3>
      <p>Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof says he misses working under Jose Mourinho and believes it won't be long before the former Chelsea and United manager returns to football management.</p>
      <p>“He is, after all, one of the world’s best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football,” Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var"><i>Aftonbladet</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything.</p>
      <p>“I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug.</p>
      <p>“Even if I did not agree, at the time… he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him.</p>
      <p>“He’s won everything. When he says something, you listen.”</p>
      <h3>Tottenham rumours</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">The Telegraph</a>, Mauricio Pochettino is heading towards the point of 'no return' in north London, as fears grow that the Argentinian will not be able to turn Spurs' fortunes around.</p>
      <p>Tottenham face fierce rivals West Ham after the international break, a game which could prove decisive for Pochettino's future.</p>
      <p>The report claims Spurs could turn to Massimiliano Allegri or Jose Mourinho if they were to appoint a replacement mid-season, but making a change at the end of the campaign could see Daniel Levy target Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann, or England manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
