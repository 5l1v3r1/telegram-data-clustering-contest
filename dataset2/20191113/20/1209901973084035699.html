      <h1>Ideas for Alberta independence would increase costs, Nenshi says</h1>
      <h2>Province has formed panel to examine how to get what a ‘fairer deal’ from Confederation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:26:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Calgary’s mayor says ideas being floated to give Alberta more independence from the federal government would be costly.</p>
      <p>Naheed Nenshi says wresting control from Ottawa over things like pensions and policing would have to come with a big enough benefit to justify the expense.</p>
      <p>He says his focus in running the city is making sure services are delivered as efficiently as possible.</p>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney’s United Conservative government has <a href="https://www.ponokanews.com/news/kenney-announces-fair-deal-panel-to-advance-albertas-interests-like-pipelines/">formed a panel</a> to examine ways for Alberta to get what he calls a fairer deal from Confederation.</p>
      <p>The panel is to consult with Albertans on ideas like establishing a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan and replacing the RCMP with a provincial police force.</p>
      <p>Resentment and even calls for separation have been roiling in Alberta since last month’s federal election that saw the Liberals re-elected, but with a minority government.</p>
      <p>Kenney, who says he does not support separatism, has lambasted the Liberals for policies he says have hurt the provincial oil and gas industry.</p>
      <p>Calgary Chamber of Commerce CEO Sandip Lalli said the ideas being weighed by the panel don’t offer much to a city that faces a property tax crunch as businesses empty out of the downtown core.</p>
      <p>“It’s not adding greater certainty or clarity to what we’re doing here in Alberta to be more competitive.”</p>
