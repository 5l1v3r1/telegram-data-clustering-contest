      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 13, GNA - Madam Justina Owusu-Banahene, the Sunyani Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) has called on candidates contesting the upcoming District Level Elections (DLEs) to be decorous in their campaigns to build and strengthen a vibrant democratic society.</p>
      <p>She advised them to make tolerance their trademark and watchword, and avoid inflammatory remarks that could potentially trigger violence to disturb national peace and security with the consequence political and economic instability.</p>
      <p>Mad. Owusu-Banahene made the call when she addressed a town hall meeting organised by the Assembly on Tuesday in Sunyani to sensitise the electorate on the DLEs and the Referendum to be held on Tuesday, December 17 this year.</p>
      <p>It was attended by traditional rulers, religious organisations, artisanal workers, Heads of Departments, civil society actors, activists of non-governmental organisations, Person with Disabilities, youth associations, political party representatives, assembly members and students.</p>
      <p>Mad. Owusu-Banahene said the DLEs played integral role in deepening the decentralisation concept, saying that campaigns of insults and infuriated statements would stir up hatred among candidates and their followers to undermine peaceful social cohesion and national unity.</p>
      <p>She said huge task and responsibility had been placed on each of the candidates to ensure peaceful elections to facilitate democratic stability in the country.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Evelyn Ama Kumi-Richardson, the Bono Regional Minister, advised the electorate to vote “yes” in the referendum.</p>
      <p>She said the government would work hard to strengthen and consolidate the gains of the nation’s fledgling democracy but the populace also had the corresponding role to play to enhance freedom of expression.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Kumi-Richardson explained voting “yes” would pave the way for the amendment of Article 55(3) of the 1992 constitution to introduce multi-partisan system into local level elections.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Suallah Abdallah Quandah, the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Executive Secretary of the National Peace Council advised all eligible voters to participate in the referendum and DLEs.</p>
