      <p>Residents have spoken of their "devastation" and shock at the tragedy of two bodies being found at a house in a Nottinghamshire town.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the man and the woman at the property in Porchester Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bingham">Bingham</a>. A neighbour understood that a couple lived there.</p>
      <p>Officers were called to the scene just before 3.40pm on Wednesday, November 13.</p>
      <p>Emergency services remained at the house on Wednesday night, with inquiries said to be at an early stage.</p>
      <p>A crime scene investigation van was also at the address.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>Alex Harris, a 33-year-old mum, who lives in the town, added: “This has really shocked me so much.</p>
      <p>"Seeing it all taped off, you don’t expect it where you live. Then when you see it, it hits home. The air ambulance landed nearby to go and help, I believe. It’s just so sad.”</p>

      <p>Mark Gates, 55, of Bingham, who was walking his dog past the cordon, said: “Incredibly sad news. It's awful seeing the police there and the house taped off. That’s a family’s life changed forever.”</p>
      <p>Tom Anderson, 39, of Bingham, said: “I had to double take when I heard what had happened. It’s truly heartbreaking to hear. I can’t believe it. I'm sure more details will come out as to what happened but it’s so sad.</p>

      <p>“There’s a big police presence and it’ll be a big investigation, no doubt. But I think everyone will be so shocked and upset by this.”</p>
      <p>Francis Purdue-Horan, Conservative <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">councillor</a> for Bingham West, told Nottinghamshire Live: "I passed the scene at around 4pm when on my way into West Bridgford for a meeting. I saw all the police tape and officers and thought it was very serious.</p>
      <p>"It's a shock and is very sad. Whatever tragedy has happened, we are all shocked at seeing those events.</p>
      <p>"To see something like this in Bingham, which is still a small community in the scheme of things, is very shocking. But ultimately it's the family that are going to have to grieve and come to terms with such a tragedy."</p>
      <p>A woman who lives near to the police cordon said the news was “devastating”.</p>
      <p>She told Nottinghamshire Live: “It is very shocking to see so many police here. We don’t have a police station in Bingham, so to see that many police and tape all up was really devastating.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know the family. But it is so sad. It was shocking and haunting to come home to that news."</p>
