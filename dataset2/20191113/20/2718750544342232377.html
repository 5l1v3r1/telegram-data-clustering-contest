      <p>Samantha Bee’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/samantha-bee-full-frontal-vulture-fest.html">TBS late-night show</a> is sticking around on television long enough to cover the 2020 election. TBS announced today that it handed out a season-five renewal to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/samantha-bee-wants-tulsi-gabbard-2020-democrats-drop-out.html"><i>Full Frontal</i></a>, which airs Wednesday nights at 10:30 p.m. In addition to the season renewal, the network has renewed a first-look deal with Bee’s production company, Swimsuit Competition, which is behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/amy-hoggart-full-frontal-tbs-show.html"><i>Full Frontal </i>spinoff series </a>starring correspondent Amy Hoggart.</p>
      <p>“I’m beyond grateful for the opportunity to continue doing this show for another season,” Bee said on the news. “Excited to still be at it when Trump finally gives up the presidency at the end of his fifth term, January 2036. I heard he’ll be leaving to spend more time with his family. JK JK.” </p>
