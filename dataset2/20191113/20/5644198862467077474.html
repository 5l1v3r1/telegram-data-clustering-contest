      <p>Wall Street's main indexes turned slightly higher on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank saw a "sustained expansion" ahead for the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes slipped on Wednesday on fresh uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations, while a jump in Walt Disney shares boosted the Dow.</p>
      <p>Stocks pulled back in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S.-China trade negotiations have hit a snag over farm purchases, the latest development in a dispute between the two countries that has convulsed markets for more than a year.</p>

      <p>The three indexes had all been up earlier in the session, with the Dow hitting a record high, before the Journal report. Stocks drifted higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said U.S. central bankers see a "sustained expansion" ahead for the country's economy.</p>
      <p>Stocks have recently climbed to records, fueled by Fed interest rate cuts, third-quarter earnings exceeding low expectations and signs the economy is bottoming, while the U.S.-China trade dispute remains a key wild card.</p>
      <p>"After a nice run, we are getting a little bit of pullback," said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist with Allianz Global Investors.</p>
      <p>"Part of that run was driven by U.S.-China trade perhaps thawing or starting to see some at least resolution or trade truce, so this headline that just broke is not great for that part of the story."</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 53.81 points, or 0.19per cent, to 27,745.3, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.27 points, or 0.04per cent, to 3,090.57 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.71 points, or 0.2per cent, to 8,469.38.</p>
      <p>Among the S&amp;P 500 sectors, traditionally defensive groups such as utilities , real estate and consumer staples were in positive territory, while cyclical sectors, such as energy and materials which are known for tracking the health of the economy, lagged.</p>
      <p>"The leadership today is defensive," Mahajan said.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney Co shares jumped 5.9per cent after the media company said its new streaming service, Disney+, reached 10 million sign-ups since launching the previous day. Disney shares provided the biggest boost to the Dow.</p>
      <p>Shares of streaming rival Netflix Inc sank 2.9per cent.</p>
      <p>SmileDirectClub Inc shares slumped 18.8per cent after the teeth alignment company reported a bigger quarterly loss.</p>
      <p>About three-fourths of S&amp;P 500 companies have topped earnings estimates in their third-quarter reports, but the companies are still expected to have posted an overall 0.5per cent decline in earnings, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.53-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 103 new lows.</p>
