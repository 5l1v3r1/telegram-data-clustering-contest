      <p>THQ Nordic and Feld Entertainment have revealed that <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_jam_steel_titans">Monster Jam Steel Titans</a></b> is making a monster leap to Nintendo Switch this year.</p>
      <p>The game, which released on PS4 and Xbox One earlier this year, is said to give fans the chance to see what it takes to train and compete like their favourite, real-life Monster Jam athletes. You'll find competitions like Stadium Racing, 2 Wheel Skill Challenges, Freestyle, Waypoint Racing, Circuit Racing and Timed Destruction waiting for you if you choose to get behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>If you hadn't guessed already, the game is based on the popular TV series of the same name. Here's an official description for you:</p>
      <blockquote>Monster Jam is the most action-packed live event on four wheels where world-class drivers compete in front of capacity crowds in both monster truck racing and freestyle competitions. The brand’s ongoing, global expansion now includes events in 56 international cities across 30 countries, as well as multiple lifestyle extensions from Monster Jam toys and apparel to eyeglasses and more! Monster Jam features the most recognizable trucks in the world including Grave Digger, Max-D™, El Toro Loco®, Monster Mutt® and many more.</blockquote>
