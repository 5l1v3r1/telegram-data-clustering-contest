      <h1>'Make us title challengers' - Man United fans respond to Mauricio Pochettino reports</h1>
      <h2>The Spurs boss has been linked with Manchester United in the past</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:32:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United fans took to social media to respond to reports that Mauricio Pochettino is under increasing pressure to save his job at Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has repeatedly been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but signed a new five-year deal at Tottenham in 2018 to seemingly quash any prospect of a move to Manchester.</p>
      <p>However, Spurs have endured a poor start to the season, amid a backdrop of player unrest and frustration from Pochettino at a perceived lack of backing in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>And the negativity has spilled onto the pitch where Tottenham sit 14th after a series of poor performances in the Premier League, the latest of which saw Spurs fortunate to draw against Sheffield United at the weekend.</p>
      <p>After the 1-1 draw, Pochettino said: "We are disappointed because we knew we were going to find a team who would be aggressive and very energetic, well organised.</p>
      <p>"This is the worst opponent you can have when you come to play from Wednesday in the Champions League, a very long way.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed because in the moment we broke them down to go and lead 1-0 in the second half, not keeping that advantage or scoring the second goal in that moment when we dominated the game.</p>
      <p>"We feel so disappointed, I don't know the word to use. Upset or frustrated, but it is not a happy feeling."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">The Telegraph</a>, Pochettino is heading towards the point of 'no return' in north London, as fears grow that the Argentinian will not be able to turn Spurs' fortunes around.</p>
      <p>Tottenham face fierce rivals West Ham after the international break, a game which could prove decisive for Pochettino's future.</p>
      <p>The report claims Spurs could turn to Massimiliano Allegri or Jose Mourinho if they were to appoint a replacement mid-season, but making a change at the end of the campaign could see Daniel Levy target Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann, or England manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>If Pochettino does leave Spurs, the 47-year-old will reportedly have no lack of suitors with Manchester United and Real Madrid still big admirers.</p>
      <p>United fans took to social media to voice their opinion on whether Pochettino would be a good fit at Old Trafford.</p>
