      <p>Aardman Animations have joined forces with <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a> for the video for their new single ‘Daddy’ – view a teaser below.</p>
      <p>The animation company responsible for the <i>Wallace and Gromit</i> and <i>Chicken Run</i> franchises have created a clip that uses live action puppetry, digitally painted sets and 2D animation to symbolise a girl’s memories of her father.</p>

      <p>Directed by Aardman’s Åsa Lucander, the full length, five-minute video follows a girl who is lost at sea, alone in a rowing boat and sailing towards the unknown.</p>

      <p>“It was such an honour to direct this video for Coldplay,” said Lucander. “The first time I listened to the track it spoke to me on a deep level – I immediately started to imagine storylines and images formed in my mind’s eye. When this happens, you know you’re on to something very special! I’m often drawn to emotional stories and I knew very quickly that this was one I wanted to tell.”</p>
      <p>“‘Daddy’ isn’t a single in the traditional sense, but we always wanted to make a video for it as the song feels like a story within itself. Åsa and her team have done an incredible job in bringing the story to life,” said Phil Harvey, Coldplay’s Creative Director.</p>
      <p>The single is the fifth track from Coldplay’s eighth album, ‘Everyday Life’, which is out on November 22. The full music video for ‘Daddy’ will premiere shortly on the same day as the album’s release.</p>
