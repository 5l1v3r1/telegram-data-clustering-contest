      <h1>Mark Wahlberg is poised to join the 'Uncharted' movie</h1>
      <h2>He'll play the grizzled treasure hunter Sully.</h2>

      <p>The cast for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/27/uncharted-movie-director-tom-holland-travis-knight/"><i>Uncharted</i> movie</a> appears to be solidifying, however slowly. <i>Variety</i> <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/mark-wahlberg-tom-holland-sonys-uncharted-adaptation-1203394336/">understands</a> that Mark Wahlberg is in "final talks" to co-star as Victor "Sully" Sullivan, the grizzled treasure hunter that serves as Nathan Drake's mentor. It'll represent a bit of a shock for people who expect a decidedly older and more gregarious character, but the current take on the movie is an origin story -- it's not too much of a shock that Sully would have fewer gray hairs.</p>
      <p>Besides, there appears to be a history behind the move. Wahlberg was originally slated to play Drake himself years ago, when David O. Russell was expected to direct a more straightforward <i>Uncharted</i> adaptation. He reportedly still wanted in on the movie in some form, and this keeps him involved while acknowledging that time has passed.</p>
      <p>There's still a lot of work left before the movie is ready. There's no Elena yet, let alone clear plot details or a release date. With that said, things are shaping up. With Tom Holland as Drake and <i>Bumblebee</i>'s Travis Knight slated to direct, it's evident that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/20/sony-playstation-productions/">PlayStation Productions</a> and Sony Pictures want their first real collaboration to be a big one.</p>
