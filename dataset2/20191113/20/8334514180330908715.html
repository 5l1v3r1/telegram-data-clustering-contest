      <h1>China to announce billion-dollar investment in Brazilian port of Sao Luis: sources</h1>

      <p>BRASILIA (Reuters) - China will make a billion-dollar investment in the Brazilian port of Sao Luis via China Communications Construction Company (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/601800.SS">601800.SS</a>), two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the sources said the announcement will be made at the summit of leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the so-called BRICS group of emerging nations, who are meeting in the Brazilian capital for a two-day summit.</p>
      <p>The deal will be part of the largest foreign direct investment into Brazil this year, one of the sources said, without revealing any figures.</p>
      <p>Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Wednesday that Brazil is seeking closer integration with China, its largest trading partner, involving not only trade but also investments.</p>
      <p>“We had a giant trade agenda, but not so much investment flows. (Now) investment flows are increasing too,” one of the sources said.</p>
      <p>A third source said the deal will be a “greenfield” operation, with the Chinese investment aimed at expanding the port and operations. It will not involve the purchase of a local company, but may involve equity stakes changing hands, the source said, also on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>The cornerstone of the port of Sao Luis was laid in March last year. At the time, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported that CCCC led the project with a 51% equity stake in the venture, alongside Brazil’s WPR, construction group WTorre, and investment firm Lyon Capital.</p>
      <p>Located in the northern state of Maranhao, the port of Sao Luis serves the central, northern and northeastern areas of Brazil, and is connected by the Norte-Sul/Carajas railway. According to one source, CCCC’s investment will include spending on the railway.</p>
