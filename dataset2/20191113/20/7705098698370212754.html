      <p>Earlier this year, directors Anthony and Joe Russo arguably delivered the ultimate comic book movie, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a>. Now, the Russo bros. are set to make a show about a much bigger conflict: Marvel vs. DC. Via <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/russo-brothers-marvel-vs-dc-docuseries-quibi-1203402642/">Variety</a>, the Russos will produce a shortform documentary series inspired by Reed Tucker’s book, <b>Slugfest: Inside the Epic, 50-year Battle between Marvel and DC</b>.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the series “will chronicle the growth of comic books as a new American art form, following the rise of the two companies that went on to become comics-publishing and Hollywood powerhouses.”</p>

      <p>The show will also throw the spotlight on the comic creators from both companies while depicting their shared history. Several surviving creators will also be interviewed for the series. Additionally, Variety notes that the show will feature the rare occasions when Marvel and DC teamed up. That includes their first inter-company crossover from the ’70s, which pit Superman and Spider-Man against each other.</p>
      <p>Quibi will launch on April 6, 2020 as a streaming service. However, the <b>Slugfest</b> inspired show doesn’t have a premiere date yet.</p>
