      <h1>Kodak Black Gets 46-Month Prison Sentence on Federal Weapons Charges</h1>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/this-week-in-rap-kodak-black-nipsey-laura-ingraham-anderson-paak.html">rapper Kodak Black</a> pleaded guilty for lying on two separate background-check forms for gun purchases last January and March, the rapper has been <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237288659.html">sentenced to 46 months</a> in prison by a federal court. In both instances, he did not mention his felony indictment from <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/florida/fl-kodak-black-arrest-warrant-20161130-story.html">a 2016 sexual-misconduct charge</a> in South Carolina, for which he could face up to 30 years in prison. That charge came after he was accused of sexually attacking a woman in a Florida hotel room in February 2016. While awaiting sentencing on his federal weapons charge in a Florida prison, Black attacked a guard, according to prosecutors’ statements during his sentencing hearing. His current sentence is in line with the 46-to-57-month sentence recommended by the state but is above his lawyer’s requested 37-to-44 months. The charges, on which <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/kodak-black-was-arrested-before-his-set-at-rolling-loud.html">Black was arrested before his Rolling Loud set in May</a>, carried a maximum 10-year sentence.</p>
