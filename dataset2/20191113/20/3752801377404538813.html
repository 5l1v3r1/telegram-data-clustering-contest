      <p>The boyfriend of murdered teacher Allison Plaatjies on Wednesday abandoned his bid for bail when he appeared in the Clanwilliam Magistrate's Court.</p>
      <p>Philip April will spend Christmas behind bars after the case against him was postponed to February 5 for further investigation.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was arrested after Plaatjies -Â  a teacher at Sederberg Primary School - was found dead in her Katjiepiering Street residence last month.</p>
      <p>She had been stabbed multiple times and her throat was slit.</p>
      <p>April was charged with murder, car theft and defeating the ends of justice.</p>
      <p>No sign of forced entry had been found at her home. Her car was not parked there but was later found and booked in as evidence.</p>
      <p>It is believed that April, a student, had been driving it at the time.</p>
      <p>Billy Claasen, the executive director of the Rural and Farmworkers Development Organisation, said April had appeared before a packed courtroom and welcomed his decision to not apply for bail.</p>
      <p>"We will monitor this case and will leave no stone un-turned to see that there is justice for Allison Plaatjies and her family," he said.</p>
