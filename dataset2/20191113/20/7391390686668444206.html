      <p>On Wednesday, <i>TIME</i> released its first-ever <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=time+next+100&amp;oq=time+next+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l4j69i61.2235j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">100 NEXT list</a> to recognize up-and-coming activists, actors, athletes, and more, in expansion to its most influential list released earlier this year. Among the list of rising names are a handful of authors, some of whom write by trade, and others who have published books about the very experiences that landed them in <i>TIME</i> to begin with.</p>
      <p>Since 2004, <a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2019/?utm_source=time.com">the <i>TIME</i> 100 list</a> has spotlighted the world's most impactful people, and new in 2019, the <a href="https://time.com/5725626/how-we-chose-time-100-next/"><i>TIME</i> 100 NEXT</a> "spotlights 100 rising stars who are shaping the future of business, entertainment, sports, politics, science, health and more<i>." </i>The honorees range in age from 14 (figure skater Alysa Liu) to 44 (Joint List head Ayman Odeh), and more than half (53) are women and girls.</p>
      <p>Each of the <i>TIME</i> 100 NEXT honorees has been profiled by a related star. Michelle Yeoh sings the praises of her <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i> co-star, Henry Golding, and filmmaker dream hampton talks about working with <i>Wild Seed</i> director Wanuri Kahiu. These profiles, though brief, are eye-opening looks at how the <i>TIME</i> 100 NEXT stars have already begun to shape their respective fields.</p>
