      <p>As affected residents of Tuesday's tornado in New Hanover, Pietermaritzburg pick up the pieces, the eThekwini Municipality has warned residents of a looming downpour on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>In a statement released by municipality spokesperson Mandla Nsele on Wednesday, they warn: "severe thunderstorms accompanied by heavy downpours are expected over most parts of KwaZulu-Natal from Thursday into Friday afternoon".</p>
      <p>"Improvement is expected from Friday evening, however, there will still be some rain in places over KwaZulu-Natal," Nsele said.</p>
      <p>A video of the tornado forming was circulated on social media on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>News24 reported on Wednesday that two people had been confirmed dead while several others were injured.</p>
      <p>Eskom's technicians found that 15 networks in the Mpolweni, Dalton, Wartburg, Albert Falls and Swayimani areas had been affected, leaving around 15 000 people without power.</p>
      <p>The power utility was working on restoring the region's grid.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, KZN premier Sihle Zikalala led a delegation of provincial government staff to assess the extent of damage in New Hanover to provide interim relief for affected parties.</p>

      <p>Nsele advised that the anticipated downpour could result in flooding.</p>
      <p>Flooding of settlements, both formal and informal, as well as the closure of low-lying bridges, is possible.</p>
      <p>The storms which will be accompanied by lightning, hail and strong winds may pose danger to life, vehicles and structural damage.</p>
      <p>As the statement puts it, the current forecast confirmed by the South African Weather Service (SAWS) shows storm activity commencing at 13:00 on Thursday, with the peak centered over the south-central region between uMlazi and Pinetown, moving off by 18:00.</p>
      <p>The northern areas between Durban North and Tongaat are expected to experience thunderstorms tomorrow between 23:00 and 08:00 on Friday morning that will see high-intensity rainfall in excess of average rainfall.</p>
