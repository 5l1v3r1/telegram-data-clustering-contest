      <h1>Chelsea fans will love what Fikayo Tomori did in England training ahead of Montenegro clash</h1>
      <h2>The Chelsea central defender could play against Montenegro or Kosovo</h2>

      <p>Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori is better known for preventing goals but if his exploits in training for England are anything to go by, the youngster could have a future playing further forward.</p>
      <p>The centre-back is part of Gareth Southgate's 27-man squad after establishing himself as one of Frank Lampard's first choice central defenders this season.</p>
      <p>Tomori, who spent last season on loan at Derby and won the club's Player of the Season award, has been an ever present for the Blues in the Premier League since the Sheffield United clash.</p>
      <p>Lampard has praised the 21-year-old for his mature performances and said it was an easy decision to put the defender into the team.</p>
      <p>"He’s definitely got personality. That grew last year at Derby. He became very popular in the dressing room, and popular with the fans for his performances.</p>
      <p>"The progression is huge, but the main thing I saw in him was work ethic. He quietly goes about his business. He trains hard. Everything you ask him to do, he tries to do it and more.</p>
      <p>"Physically he’s great, we know that. He’s one of those when you’re doing sprinting or running, or heavy running early season, you can see every day he’s nailed, he does the job.</p>
      <p>"When you want to do a particular training session, something quite simple but which takes a bit of focus, he’s focused and ready to go.</p>
      <p>"That has shown in his performances since he stepped into the team. I put trust him early in the season, and at the moment he’s really delivered. Long may that continue, because there is more to come from him."</p>
      <p>England posted a video of Tomori on their Instagram account on Tuesday, with the caption: '@fikayotomori = hat-trick hero', after the defender fired a treble in training.</p>

      <p>In response, Leicester midfielder James Maddison replied with: 'No shout for the 2 assists'.</p>
      <p>The Foxes playmaker is expected to be handed his full debut by Gareth Southgate in one of the upcoming qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>However, one player who won't feature on Thursday at Wembley is Raheem Sterling, with the Manchester City winger dropped after a bust-up with Joe Gomez during a training session on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool defender and City forward had to be separated by teammates at St George's Park following a physical confrontation.</p>
      <p>Reports claims the bad blood following the pair's altercation at the end of the game at Anfield on Sunday spilled onto the training pitch, and ended up getting physical.</p>
      <p>England have confirmed that Sterling will not be involved in Thursday's game at Wembley.</p>
      <p>In a statement on the official website, the FA wrote: 'We can confirm Raheem Sterling will not be considered for England's EURO 2020 qualifier against Montenegro as a result of a disturbance in a private team area at St. George’s Park today. He will remain with the squad.'</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate said: “We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we’ve been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday’s game were still raw.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it’s important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night.”</p>
