      <p>Two Namibian ministers resigned on Wednesday following a Wikileaks report exposing alleged corruption in the fishing industry, released as the country readies for a presidential election later this month.</p>
      <p>Iceland-based multinational fishing company Samherji is suspected of bribing senior Namibian officials for continued access to the country's shores, according to documents published by Wikileaks on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Fisheries Minister Bernard Esau and Justice Minister Sakeus Shanghala resigned on Wednesday, presidential spokesman Alfredo Hengari said in a statement.</p>
      <p>They stepped down "following press and media reports in which allegations of corruption have been made against" them, he added.</p>
      <p>Samherji has denied any wrongdoing, saying it had "nothing to hide".</p>
      <p>The scandal surfaced during the last leg of campaigning for presidential elections on November 27, in which incumbent Hage Geingob is vying a second five-year term.</p>
      <p>Wikileaks said Namibian authorities have been investigating the case for almost a year.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower was tipped by Samherji's former country director Johannes Stefansson, who came forward to testify about the company's activities.</p>
      <p>He cooperated with the police and anti-corruption authorities, Wikileaks said.</p>
      <p>"We are deeply shocked that Johannes Stefansson not only admits being involved in illegal activities, he is now also making allegations against colleagues," said Samherji CEO Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"This is not how we do business. This is not Samherji," he said.</p>
      <p>Fishing is one of Namibia's key economic sectors, second to mineral mining.</p>
      <p>The vast southern African country is second in aridity to the Sahara desert, with mobile dunes and sandy plains stretching along its 1 500km coastline.</p>
      <p>That coast is home to a vibrant fishing and fish processing industry that has contributed to around 20% of export earnings since 1990.</p>
