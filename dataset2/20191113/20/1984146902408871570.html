      <h1>Plans for North Shields 'cultural hub' not just a standard bar - developers claim</h1>
      <h2>Plans to transfrom an industrial building near North Shields Fish Quay into an arts and music venue.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>Drinkers looking for a break from "standard bars" could soon have a new destination if plans for an arts venue are given the green light.</p>
      <p>The new venue, called the Engine Room, would see an industrial building near <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields">North Shields</a> Fish Quay transformed into an arts and music venue.</p>
      <p>Applicants Graeme Duff and Mark Elliott have applied to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">North Tyneside Council</a> for a premises license to sell alcohol at the Maltings on Tanners Bank between midday and 10.30pm, seven days a week.</p>
      <p>If successful, it would have a range of local drinks and snacks on the menu as well as performances from poets and musicians.</p>
      <p>Documents submitted to the council said: "The Engine Room aims to be a small licensed arts and music venue open to the public to enjoy locally sourced drinks and snacks as well as to enjoy some local culture and the history of the location and surrounding area.</p>
      <p>"Additionally it will be available to be hired by local and touring artists and organisations for plays, musical performance, dance, spoken word, comedy and films/documentaries."</p>
      <p>The applicants say their venture will offer punters a different experience.</p>
      <p>They added: "This is not a standard 'bar' on the fish-quay but a cultural hub allowing locals and visitors alike to enjoy a variety of arts and entertainment, and which intents to draw a variety of interesting artists to the area."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">council's</a> licensing department have yet to decide whether to grant the premises licence.</p>
