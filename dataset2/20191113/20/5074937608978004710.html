      <h1>TMA to evict illegal transport operators at Site 20</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:45:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Nyarko Yeboah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 13, GNA - Tema Metropolitan Assembly (TMA) has indicated their resolve to evict persons who have taken over land earmarked for the development of a Lorry Station and are collecting illegal tolls from drivers operating from that site.</p>
      <p>The eviction, which is to take place soon will ensure that the land was made ready for proposed development to halt the illegal activities of a group calling itself Concerned Residents Association of Site 20 who took over the place forcefully.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Shehu Awudu Kadiri, the TMA Metropolitan Coordinating Director told the Ghana News Agency in an interview at Tema that the Assembly was aware of the illegal activities of the said residents group and went ahead to ask them to stop their operations, and so wondered why they were still operating.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Kadiri said land was given out in contract for development, but the project stalled because of some challenges on the part of the contractor and pleaded with the Site 20 Cooperative Transport Union to be patient with the TMA while they prepared to re-develop the land for their operations.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Welfare Chairman of the Tema GPRTU, Mr. Benjamin Hansen Dodoo, told the GNA, that “the members of the Concerned Site 20 Residents Association were constantly obstructing their activities and making their work difficult”.</p>
      <p>He therefore called on the TMA to come in and put the activities of the operators under control.</p>
      <p>He explained that the Residents Association of Site 20 was collecting GH¢2.00 from drivers who parked on the grounds and then the same drivers had to pay another GH¢2.00 when they eventually got to their stations.</p>
      <p>“And looking at how violent those guys were, we decided to pay the said amount to them and stop paying to the TMA in order to prevent them from vandalising our vehicles,” Mr. Dodoo explained.</p>
      <p>Mr Richard Asamoah, President of the Site 20 Cooperative Union explained that the TMA asked the Union Members who were original occupants of the station, to move out for the re-development of the site into a modern Lorry Station.</p>
      <p>He said as law abiding citizens we obliged; “we realized that immediately after we left, we saw others operating there”.</p>
      <p>Mr Asamoah said our members were worried that the TMA could allow such a thing to happen and give the Concerned Residents of Site 20 who had no permit the right to operate instead of the Union Members.</p>
      <p>Mr. Joseph Kwabena Mensah, Local Chairman of the Tema Swedru Station Union of GPRTU, asked the TMA to eradicate the numerous loading points scattered across the business districts.</p>
      <p>He said “these points destroy our work and make it difficult to make meaningful sales.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mensah wondered why the task force could not be on the neck of those operating illegal at the loading points and restore sanity to the driving business in the metropolis.</p>
