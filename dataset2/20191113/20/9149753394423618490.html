      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:07:26+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Are you looking for a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">gaming laptop</a>, but you don't have thousands of dollars to spend? If so, you might be interested to hear that one Asus laptop with a GTX 1660 Ti graphics card is just $899.00 right now.</p>
      <p>This laptop has better hardware than most other models in this price range, with an Intel Core i5-9300H processor, an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics card, a 15.6-inch 120Hz IPS display, 8GB of 2666MHz RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD. Windows 10 Home is pre-installed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100167732%204814&amp;LeftPriceRange=850%20950">Most other laptops in this price range</a> have either a GTX 1650 or 1660 graphics card with a 60Hz display, while this Asus ROG Strix laptop has a 1660 Ti and a 120Hz screen. It's worth noting that other laptops around ~$900 may have an Intel Core i7 chip instead of the i5 in this laptop, but the increased graphical horsepower and better display should make up for the loss.</p>
