      <p>I blame my teachers.<br/><br/>They never understood me. They never bothered to try. They didn't even send a postcard after I'd left.<br/><br/><b>Also:</b> <a href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/computers/">More computer coverage</a><br/><br/>Really, I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody.<br/><br/>Today's kids, however, can reach for a different excuse. They can blame technology. Well, a specific form of technology.</p>
      <p>At least that's the view of Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b">In an interview with <i>CNET</i></a>, he offered a bracingly objective view of why some kids succeed and others fall behind.</p>
      <p>He said: "Kids who are really into learning and want to learn will have better success. It's not hard to understand why kids aren't engaged in a classroom without applying technology in a way that inspires them. You need to have these cutting-edge learning tools to help kids really achieve their best results."<br/><br/>"Which cutting-edge learning tools?," I hear you cry. Why, iPads, of course. An iPad is, according to Schiller, "the ultimate tool for a child to learn on."<br/><br/>But what if your child is given some other gadget in the classroom? Failure awaits. Especially if they're given those sleazy old Chromebooks.<br/><br/>Said Schiller: "Chromebooks have gotten to the classroom, because, frankly, they're cheap testing tools for required testing. If all you want to do is test kids, well, maybe a cheap notebook will do that. But they're not going to succeed."<br/><br/>Parents around the world will surely be thrust into a panic on hearing these words. They've hovered their helicopters over their children for years, paying attention to the minutest details. <br/><br/>Now they learn that their kids might have the wrong sort of computer? The sheer guilt these parents will experience.</p>
      <p>Schiller's pronouncement from on high may mean that 40 million children are destined to disappoint themselves and, more importantly, their parents. <br/><br/>For <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/01/22/30m-chromebook-education-users/">estimates suggest</a> there are already 30 million Chromebooks in schools and 40 million <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-up-a-google-classroom-to-train-students-employees-or-anyone-who-wants-to-learn/">Google Classroom</a> users.<br/><br/>Apple's products tend to be rather pricier, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-got-a-new-plan-to-bring-creativity-and-more-ipads-to-schools/">so they are a tougher purchase</a>.<br/><br/>It must be galling for Schiller to witness so much young failure and not be able to do anything about it. Other than drastically lower prices, that is.<br/><br/>I confess when I recently went to a Best Buy, an enthusiastic salesman <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-or-chromebook-a-best-buy-salesman-told-me-it-isnt-even-close/">told me</a> that Chromebooks were of little use and certainly not as good as Windows laptops.<br/><br/>In his words: "It's fine if you want to do homework, surf the web, and watch Netflix. That's about it." (Wait, what else do kids do?)<br/><br/>I, therefore, await an urgent report from Betsy DeVos's Department of Education on America's crisis of education specifically caused by Chromebooks.<br/><br/>Perhaps this could be one more element in the government's <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-is-in-serious-trouble-warns-top-anti-trust-lawyer/">multitude of actions against Google</a>.</p>
