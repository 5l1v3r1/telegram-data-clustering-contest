      <h1>UK weather: Heavy snow falls on Britain as Met Office issues dangerous travel warning</h1>
      <h2>Wales, Devon, Cornwall and the South West are being pelted with snow as the Met Office warns of treacherous driving conditions and a weather warning remains in place for the next 48 hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:12:37+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Chris Kitching, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Police are warning of hazardous driving conditions as heavy snow lands in the UK.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning has just come into effect in the UK and pictures and video has shown roads and field covered in the white stuff.</p>
      <p>Gritters have been deployed in the South West and traffic is being slowed and roads reduced to single lanes after heavy snowfall.</p>
      <p>And it has started snowing in parts of Wales with parts of the Rhondda Valley and Swansea Valley being coated while the rest of the country is battered with heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Initially, the weather warning had been in place for Somerset and Wales but <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/heavy-snow-fall-devon-live-3534924">Devon Live</a> reports the Met office extended that to Devon due to the adverse conditions arriving on the coast.</p>
      <p>Places such as Okehampton in West Devon are expected to see temperatures drop to as low as 2C (35F).</p>
      <p>In Devon, Tavistock Police tweeted: "HAZARDOUS DRIVING CONDITIONS. A30 OKEHAMPTON/SOURTON area due to SNOW. Road down to 1 lane in each direction. Please avoid the area if you can. Gritters are on the way."</p>
      <p>Highways England also released a statement this afternoon, saying: "We have snow falling. Tavistock Police reporting that the road is down to one lane in each direction due to snow.</p>
      <p>"We can confirm that gritters are being arranged."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>One lane of the busy A30 is closed in each direction due to snow falling on the carriageway at the junction with thee A386.</p>
      <p>Police are urging drivers to take care on the roads.</p>
      <p>The Met Office tweeted: "Heavy rain and hail moving eastwards across Devon into Somerset and Dorset is likely to fall as snow over higher routes. This may last for an hour or two with 1 or 2 cm of lying snow possible. Take care on the roads."</p>
      <p>A severe weather warning in place warns of heavy rain and some snowfall and sleet over Dartmoor and Exmoor.</p>
      <p>It warns of spray and flooding on roads, disruption to bus and train services and a danger of homes being flooded.</p>
      <p>ITV's West Country weather presenter, Charlie Powell has predicted that more snow could be in store for the region for the rest of the week.</p>

      <p>"Thursday will probably be the coldest day this week with plenty of cloud and further spells of rain throughout.</p>
      <p>Further south in Devon, heavy rain has sparked flooding and traffic disruption on roads across Plymouth this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A lane is closed heading into the city due to a blown manhole cover. While other roads are closed due to flooding from Higher Compton Road to Mannamead Road.</p>
      <p>Buses are being delayed.</p>

      <p>A Plymouth City Council spokesperson said: "Alma Road is down to one lane due to a manhole cover that has blown (inbound).</p>
      <p>"South West Water are on route, please expect delays and avoid the area if possible."</p>
      <p>In Wales, cars in Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley, have been dusted with snow, while parts of the Rhondda Valley including the Bwlch mountain and Rhigos mountain have also seen snow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile roads in Gilfach Goch, in Rhondda, were covered in the white stuff, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/snow-met-office-weather-forecast-17253178">Wales Online</a>.</p>
      <p>South Wales police tweeted: "We're currently receiving a high number of calls about weather-related incidents. <br/><br/>"With either snow or heavy rain affecting most of south Wales, please take extra caution out on the roads, ensuring you allow extra time for your journey."</p>
      <p>Police in Ystradgynlais, in south west Powys, Wales described roads as “treacherous”.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: "Roads are treacherous around Ystradgynlais this evening- please only go out if absolutely necessary and be careful as reports of vehicles stuck in Coelbren, Neath Road Ystradgynlais and many other locations."</p>
      <p>The Met Office issued a yellow warning for rain for most of south Wales on Wednesday which will remain in place until Thursday.</p>
      <p>But as temperatures drop to single digits overnight, rain may switch to snow in some areas.</p>
      <p>A weather map shared by Derek Brockway shows that snow is falling on ground above 200 metres or 650ft in Wales.</p>
      <p>Images of Banwen in Neath Port Talbot tonight evening show thick snow landing on the ground and on top of cars in the area and it doesn’t show signs of stopping.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile weather warnings are in place across the UK, where  snow, ice and torrential rain threatens to bring further misery to flood-ravaged towns.</p>
      <p>Three separate severe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings have been issued by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">Met Office</a> as Mother Nature brings a mixed bag of conditions and colder-than-usual temperatures over the next 48 hours.</p>
      <p>From tonight, up to 60mm of rain could fall in South West England and as much as 5cm of snow could blanket South Wales, while surfaces in eastern Scotland will become icy as temperatures drop overnight.</p>
      <p>Flood-weary residents in Yorkshire and the Midlands face a dreadful forecast from Thursday as forecasters warn up to 45mm of rain could cause swollen rivers to rise again and inundate more homes.</p>
      <p>Fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible and could pose a danger to life, and some communities could be cut off by flooded roads, the Met Office warned.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday morning, 34 flood warnings were in place, mainly in Yorkshire and the Midlands, and more than 75 alerts had been issued by the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>Residents were bracing for the worst on a day when Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> was accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he visited the worst-hit towns.</p>
      <p>Met Office spokeswoman Nicky Maxey warned that parts in the South West, such as Bristol, Bath and Gloucester, could see as much as 40mm to 60mm of rain.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxey said that within the northern yellow warning between 10mm and 20mm of rain is expected, with some spots potentially seeing as much as 35mm to 45mm.</p>

      <p>Homes and businesses will be at risk of flooding in that region.</p>
      <p>The areas that are likely to see snow and/or sleet include higher routes in South Wales, including the Brecon Beacons, (up to 5cm), and Aberdeenshire and Moray in Scotland (1-2cm).</p>
      <p>Ice could disrupt Thursday morning's commute in Edinburgh and western Scotland as rain freezes overnight.</p>
      <p>Ms Maxey said drier, colder conditions can be expected towards the end of the working week.</p>
