      <p>DODGE COUNTY, Wis. - The Dodge County Sheriff's Office is warning people about a recent scam in which someone makes phone calls claiming to be a ranking official with the office and seeking payments to settle warrants. </p>
      <p>According to a news release, the person on the line provides a fake phone number, which they then answer claiming to be the Sheriff's Office, and they may have an answering machine set up. </p>
      <p>Officials said the individual makes "false allegations that the citizens has a warrant and attempts to scare them into making payments," according to the release. </p>
      <p>Another version of the scam involves threats that the citizen missed a juror assignment or that they have a warrant, police said. </p>
      <p>The office said it would never a call a citizen and ask them to pay for a warrant over the phone. </p>
      <p>If someone does need to a pay a warrant, officials said it can be paid in person at the Clerk of Courts office or at the Dodge County Jail. </p>
