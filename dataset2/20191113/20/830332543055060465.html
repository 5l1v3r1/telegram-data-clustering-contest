      <h1>Viral $75 Costco coupon is fake, Costco says</h1>
      <h2>Company debunks coupon scam</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - That $75 Costco coupon floating around Facebook that seems too good to be true <i>is</i>, in fact, too good to be true.</p>
      <p>The company debunked the coupon scam that promised users $75 off their purchase at the wholesale warehouse.</p>
      <p>"While we love our fans and our members, this offer is a SCAM, and in no way affiliated with Costco," the company said.</p>
      <p>The fraudulent offer cropped up on Facebook earlier this year, prompting users to click on a link unaffiliated with Costco to collect their $75 coupon. To access it, users would need to share the post on Facebook and input some personal information.</p>
      <p>Debunking the fake coupon has become something of an annual tradition: One year ago, on the same day, Costco issued essentially the same statement, though that year, the fraud ran under the guise of the company's 50th anniversary (it was not).</p>
      <p>Costco shares legit deals on its website and doesn't accept any coupons that are not issued by Costco. So if you have to share a suspicious amount of personal information or post the coupon on social media to get the offer, it probably isn't real.</p>
