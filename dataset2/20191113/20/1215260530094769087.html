        <b>The police are probing a major robbery at the Bashco store on Orange Street in Kingston.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The robbery happened sometime between last night and this morning.</p>
      <p>Reports are that the intruders made off with millions in cash and merchandise however Omar Azan, Marketing and Public Relations Manager at Bashco, declined to give a figure saying the matter is still under investigation.</p>
      <p>“We are still evaluating what was taken and what was damaged,” Azan told The Gleaner.</p>
      <p>The police told our news team that the perpetrators entered the building through the roof, adding that investigators are still examining evidence including CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big store, a big building, is a whole heap of stuff and we have to go through it,” said Azan.</p>
      <p>The store has since been reopened to the public.</p>
      <p>The robbery is the latest in what appears to be a series of break-ins as some business operators in the capital say that they are being plagued by burglars who are seemingly outmatching the police.</p>
      <p>Last week, the police high command announced that there would be heightened presence in a number of public spaces including in downtown Kingston with the approach of the Christmas season.</p>
