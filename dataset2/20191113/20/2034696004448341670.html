        <b>“This is fire," Curry told the band when he was asked to rap on the song</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/glass-animals">Glass Animals</a> have shared ‘Tokyo Drifting’, their first new material in three years, with <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/denzel-curry-zuu-review">Denzel Curry</a> on rap duties.</p>
      <p>The collaboration with the US punk rapper is a twisted, hip-hop behemoth that hears singer Dave Bayley toy with his confident, “street fighter” alter ego Wavey Davey while Curry delivers an incendiary closing verse.</p>

      <p>“The first thing Denzel said to me about the track was, ‘This is fire’,” Bayley explained in a press statement. “Then [Denzel] said, ‘Is this you flexin’?’ and I said: ‘Yeah…it is…sort of. It’s an ironic internal flex – me as a narrator describing/taking the piss out of an extreme alter ego version of myself; a version of me that can do things that I’m uncomfortable doing.</p>

      <p>“Wavey Davey is my fucked-up Sasha Fierce; he’s a geezer, a street fighter, he can dance, he parties hard, he’s spontaneous. He can take hits and be told he is shit and not care because he’s confident. He can fight everything the world throws at him.”</p>

      <p>Glass Animals began teasing the song by posting a series of <i>Street Fighter</i>-inspired images to their official Twitter account last week.</p>
      <p>The new track marks the band’s first new music in three years, following on from their Mercury Music Prize-nominated second album ‘How To Be A Human Being’ which spawned the 2016 single ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/glass-animals-return-with-life-itself-we-ve-had-a-mad-couple-of-years-we-got-a-bit-feral-8211">Life Itself</a>‘.</p>
