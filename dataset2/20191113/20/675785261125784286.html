      <h1>Jamie Carragher bidding to transform grassroots football and give kids a chance</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Liverpool legend Carragher is putting his own money to good use in Liverpool, having formed his own 23 Foundation</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:30:56+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Reade, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/brian-reade/</a></address>
      <p>Like most footballers, when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jamie-carragher">Jamie Carragher’s</a> career was drawing to a close his thoughts turned to the next move.</p>
      <p>In his case, though, it wasn’t about how he’d earn a crust once the Anfield pay-slips dried up, but how he’d put some of the riches the game was ­giving him to good use.</p>
      <p>So he formed the 23 Foundation and sunk a million pounds from his testimonial year to kick-start the charity aimed at giving disadvantaged kids from his home city a chance to succeed.</p>
      <p>Since then, many thousands of good causes have been helped and tomorrow night the foundation holds a 10th anniversary dinner.</p>
      <p>But rather than look back at their achievements with young footballers, community groups, sick children etc, Carragher is launching a long-term plan to champion a cause very close to his heart.</p>

      <p>At the black-tie event in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool's</a> Titanic Hotel he will announce that the £250,000 raised from the dinner and allied events will fund a crusade against the tragic neglect of youth football.</p>
      <p>And he’s calling on his fellow ex-players, and current pros, to ­remember where they came from and help him change the entire landscape of grass-roots football.</p>
      <p>He’s in talks with Sefton Council and the Football Foundation to build a 3G pitch in Bootle, which the 23 Foundation will run on a non-profit basis, where kids will be able to play for free and there will be coaching ­sessions for boys and girls, coaches and referees, all with no charge.</p>
      <p>He’ll even do some of the coaching himself.</p>

      <p>He’s also pledging to give every youth team that sets up on Merseyside a starter pack which includes kits, balls, bibs, 3G trainers, pitch-side barriers, and money for trophies.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about finding the next ­Steven Gerrard or Wayne Rooney, it’s about kids getting off the streets, ­playing football, making mates, and keeping fit,” said the Kop legend, who played 737 times for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> before retiring six years ago and moving into TV punditry.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to think that other ex-­players, and current ones, could also take ownership of a 3G pitch and do the same, so the kids who play on them wouldn’t have to pay any fees.</p>

      <p>“There could be an Alan Shearer pitch in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a>, a Steven Gerrard one in Huyton, and a Michael Owen one at Chester. Imagine how inspiring it would be for kids, playing on pitches named after local legends.</p>
      <p>“We are privileged to be in the ­position we are. But most of us are from the same working-class areas as the kids who need help.”</p>
      <p>Football has never been wealthier in this country but for the vast ­majority who play it at the bottom it’s never seemed poorer.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There is a crisis in grass-roots football with cash-starved councils ­forcing up fees which only the best-resourced teams can afford.</p>
      <p>And due to councils being unable to maintain pitches properly, even they struggle to play. In some areas this season seven weekends have already been written off.</p>
      <p>“Whenever England are knocked out of a major tournament it’s always said that the problems go right back to grass roots. But what is grass roots? It’s not so simple,” said Carragher, who was disappointed when the plan to sell Wembley and pour the proceeds into a national 3G pitch-building scheme was scrapped.</p>
      <p>“Most weekends kids don’t know if their game will be called off but with 3G pitches they know that they’re going to play.</p>
      <p>"And they also bring a vast upgrade in changing facilities.”</p>

      <p>The problem is not just about pitches but the prohibitive cost of running teams, which is why ­Carragher’s starter packs (heavily discounted from suppliers but costing £400 each) will be such a bonus. And the over-riding message in these kits will be Respect.</p>
      <p>All shirts will carry a ‘Respect the ref’ logo and Respect barriers will clamp down on parents screaming and encroaching on to the pitch.</p>
      <p>“A few years back, as part of a ­campaign to respect referees, I saw this temporary barrier put up – four poles by every corner flag and a tape going around the pitch – and it worked. So I think this could be massive,” said Carragher.</p>
      <p>Another issue is food poverty, a problem the 23 Foundation addressed during the summer holidays by delivering meals to the homes of kids who rely on free school dinners. At every free coaching ­evening they’re aiming to give them an evening meal.</p>
      <p>These synthetic pitches aren’t cheap. The building project can come in at between £500,000-£750,000 and they need re-laying every 10 years at a cost of £250,000, which is why austerity-battered councils are reluctant to build them. But in a football hotbed like Sefton it is scandalous that there is currently only one 3G pitch.</p>
      <p>Carragher is not alone in this drive to raise standards.</p>
      <p>A petition called Save Grass-Roots Football is calling on the government “to impose a five per cent levy on the Premier League’s existing £8.3billion combined revenue from UK and international TV deals to be reinvested back into grass-roots football.” Almost 50,000 have signed it.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Premier League argues it hands more to lower leagues and charities than any other football ­organisation on earth, which is true. But with their 2018 accounts showing £1.6billion in cash reserves and total assets of £2.57billion, no other football organisation gets close to its earning power.</p>
      <p>As a Sky employee, Carragher has no problem with the idea of more of the money his bosses hand over being used to address the grass-roots crisis.</p>
      <p>But he believes there are other ways of catching up with countries like Germany, which has more than 5,000 3G pitches while England has yet to reach 1,000.</p>
      <p>“Germany didn’t have to sell its ­national stadium to build and maintain them so there must be another way in England, where the football industry is even richer,” he said.</p>
      <p>Carragher, a lifelong Labour ­supporter, has always cared about wider social issues, which is why the 23 Foundation supports homeless charities and food banks.</p>
      <p>“They are the two basics in life: A roof over your head and food to eat. I can’t understand why people are going without either when you think of all the money we’re wasting on the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And when it comes to kids, two of the biggest ­issues affecting them today are knife crime and obesity. Keeping them off the streets, where they might get into bother, and off their couches is very important. So giving them the chance to use 3G pitches for free surely makes sense for everyone.</p>
      <p>“And you can play different sports on them, not just football. They can involve the whole community. Give them something that’s theirs. Something they can be proud of.”</p>
      <p>That’s what he’ll be telling the ­audience at the 23 Foundation dinner tomorrow, hoping to push the people with the power to give him this pitch in Bootle.</p>
      <p>His message is simple: “You build it and I’ll look after the rest.”</p>
      <p>He’s throwing down the grass-roots gauntlet. It’s up to the rest of football to pick it up and run with it.</p>
