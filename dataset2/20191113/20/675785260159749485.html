      <h1>Find out how climate change will impact where you live over the rest of the century</h1>
      <h2>Use our gadget to find out what your area will look like when your child grows up and how big an impact global warming, rising sea levels and more intense weather events will have</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:53:41+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:53</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Innes, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/richard-innes/</a></address>
      <p>Over the next decades the way the UK looks will will change dramatically.</p>
      <p>In the space of a century the mean average temperature of our isles have <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/cetml1659on.dat">increased by more than 1C</a> , primarily due to the billions of tonnes of global warming causing gases pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution.</p>
      <p>While 1C might not sound like a lot, the reality on the ground is stark.</p>
      <p>The top ten warmest years in the UK on record have all occurred since 2002, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has announced, and things are due to get hotter.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>As the temperatures rise crop cycles will be altered, Britain's emerald green parks will be scorched and eco-systems will be damaged.</p>
      <p>All the while, rising sea levels caused by melting ice caps and glaciers, coupled with fewer but more <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/documents/421974/1295957/Info+sheet+%2315.pdf/8b8457b7-7bd2-49fc-888a-9b3f6785a40e">intense periods of rainfall</a> , will make horrific floods like the one affecting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-flooding-crisis-young-mum-20872512">lives in Yorkshire right now</a> far more common.</p>
      <p>As part of the Daily Mirror's climate change edition we have created a new tool that allows you to see exactly what the climate will be like where you live in the future.</p>
      <p>We can expect warmer and drier summers in the UK in the future - but how warm, and how dry depends on where you live, and what action we take on climate change.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Put your postcode and date of birth into the tool and you will be able to see a personalised climate future.</p>
      <p>The widget shows how much wetter or drier your part of the UK can expect to be compared to the end of the 20th century - and the amount that the sea level is expected to rise on the nearest bit of coastline to you.</p>
      <p>The figures have been taken from the Met Office’s official UK climate projections and they correspond to two different climate change scenarios.</p>
      <p>The “best case scenario” - known as RCP2.6 - is a world where there is a major shift in climate policies.</p>
      <p>That would mean all countries - including developing ones - taking action in the next few years to reduce their emissions.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Under that scenario, global CO2 emissions peak by 2020 and decline to around zero by 2080.</p>
      <p>Under the “worst case” scenario - which scientists call RCP 8.5 - emissions continue to increase rapidly throughout the 21st century, with little or no action taken to stop the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rising.</p>
      <p>It is impossible to predict the future, but scientists can calculate what is likely to happen if certain conditions are met.</p>

      <p>That’s why, as well as showing the median average figure, the widget gives a range of values that are likely to happen.</p>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>All data is taken from the Met Office's UKCP18 Dataset.</p>
      <p>All ranges given are for the 10th-90th percentile of any projections, while the animation and colour change follows the median figures.</p>
      <p>The temperature and precipitation figures are taken by region from the UKCP18 probabilistic projections.</p>
      <p>The temperature figure is the mean surface temperature rise relative to the 1981-2000 period.</p>
      <p>The precipitation figure is the percentage change in precipitation rate relative to the 1981-2000 period.</p>
      <p>The sea level figures were taken from the UKCP18 Coastal time-mean sea level projections for the UK.</p>
      <p>They represent the rise in metres compared to the 1981-2000 period.</p>
      <p>Each postcode was assigned to the nearest part of the UK coastline.</p>
