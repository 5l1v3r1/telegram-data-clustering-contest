      <p>Picture this: You show up on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/pringles-friendsgiving-feast-turducken-chips-holidays">Friendsgiving</a>. There’s a beautiful smorgasbord of food, with all the traditional <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/occasions/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> fixin’s like mashed potatoes and turkey and gravy.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Then you arrive, carrying a vat of soup made from pureed fast food taquitos. Your friends stare at you, starry-eyed, mouths agape. A cheer probably starts somewhere off in the distance. You are hailed as a hero, maybe. Birds sing somewhere nearby.</p>
      <p>Or at least, that’s apparently the fantasy <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">Taco Bell</a> wants you to believe with its newest recipe: Rolled Chicken Taco Bisque, a dairy-rich and creamy soup made by literally blending its deep-fried chicken tacos with a series of other, more traditional recipe ingredients like garlic, onions and chicken broth.</p>

      <p>The bisque recipe was created by Taco Bell Executive Chef Rene Pisciotti in anticipation of the holidays, and serves two as an entrée or four as an appetizer or side, according to the fast food <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/blog/friendsgiving-rolled-chicken-tacos-bisque-recipe">chain’s blog</a>. So, if you’re having a gathering of more than two people, you should probably double – or triple – the recipe.</p>
      <p>And if you aren't interested in making a trek to Taco Bell only to then spend roughly 30 more minutes preparing a meal for you and your friends to eat, don't worry, you can actually eat the Rolled Chicken Tacos as is — no pulverizing necessary.</p>
