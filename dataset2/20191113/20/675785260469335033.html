      <h1>Tyson Fury sends message to Dana White urging him to get in the Octagon for UFC fight</h1>
      <h2>Dana White has been called out by John Fury - and Tyson Fury wants to see them settle it in the Octagon in a UFC fight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:20:47+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury has told Dana White to "grow a pair" and fight his dad after their war of words.</p>
      <p>John Fury launched an extraordinary rant directed at UFC chief White after he claimed his son would "get smashed' if he entered the cage.</p>
      <p>He told iFL TV he could "probably smash Dana White with one punch" and told him "keep my son's name out of your mouth".</p>
      <p>And the Gypsy King now wants to see the pair of veterans do battle in what he is already branding the "Battle of the baldies".</p>
      <p>Fury told BT Sport: "Dana, if you're watching... Grow a pair and sign the contract to fight my dad!</p>
      <p>"Battle of the baldies!"</p>

      <p>Fury has been training with Darren Till prompting speculation he could make a switch to UFC.</p>
      <p>A clash with Stipe Miocic could be on the cards - but in the ring rather than the Octagon.</p>
      <p>"I saw <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is coming into the mix now here,” Miocic said. “I like a new challenge.”</p>

      <p>"After I get Wilder out of the way I’ll fight Stipe in a boxing match if he wants it. It would be a big crossover fight like Mayweather and McGregor.”</p>
      <p>"I'm open to that fight so he should come and see me. It would be the same outcome for any of them, they'll all get smashed."</p>
