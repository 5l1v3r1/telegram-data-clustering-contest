      <h1>Front-line defending UK from Zika virus mosquitoes climate change is bringing closer</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE The Mirror goes behind the scenes with scientists as Britain stepped up its defences against the migration of deadly disease carrying mosquitoes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T20:49:34+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bagot, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/Martin_Bagot/</a></address>
      <p>Britain is stepping up its defences against the migration of deadly disease-carrying mosquitoes.</p>
      <p>Rising temperatures due to climate change have triggered the movement of insects that spread the Zika virus, dengue fever and malaria.</p>
      <p>Experts believe an outbreak is inevitable, so the Mirror joined Public Health England to check our defences.</p>
      <p>Its four-man national team works with local pest-control agencies to try to stop invasive species ­establishing a breeding population here.</p>
      <p>Single Asian tiger mosquitoes, carried by lorries crossing the Channel, have been detected across South East England. It carries the Zika virus – which can cause birth defects – ­chikungunya virus and dengue.</p>

      <p>Traps now cover 25 wetlands in Kent, Cambridgeshire, The Humber, Midlands, the North East and North West.  </p>
      <p>We met team leader Dr Jolyon Medlock at a key habitat for the insects on the Somerset Levels, near Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are trying to delay or prevent the establishment of these invasive species. These mosquitoes are wily, they lay eggs that survive the winter, and are difficult to control once established.”</p>

      <p>PHE also monitors for mosquitoes at 38 sea ports and airports, and up to 30 highway locations. Dr Medlock has a monthly call with government officials.</p>
      <p>Another invasive species that has started breeding here can transmit West Nile disease. A single insect was detected in 2010. It has now established populations in Essex, north Kent and the Thames Estuary.</p>
      <p>And the team detected a potential malaria-carrying species in the traps during our visit to Avalon Marshes, Somerset.</p>

      <p>Dr Medlock said: “There has been research published suggesting the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> is warm enough for the malaria parasite to develop in British mosquitoes.”</p>
      <p>Malaria can be transmitted by five of our 36 native mosquito species. But the presence of disease-carrying insects is not enough for tropical diseases to thrive, as viruses and parasites must be able to replicate and survive in their new environment.</p>
      <p>Some experts say this could take 40 years, others says it will happen sooner.</p>
