      <p>Noted vocalist Toad has finally released his long-awaited version of “Shallow,” the Oscar-winning duet from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, and it is truly the height of vocal performance. If you’ve already written a piece about the top songs of the decade, talk about bad timing!</p>

      <p>Toad, of course, is a big Gaga fan himself, having apparently attended a concert of hers last year:</p>

      <p>Toad’s musical range is unparalleled. You may remember his breathtaking rendition of Sia’s “Chandelier” from last year.</p>

      <p>Staggering.</p>
      <p>(In reality, these are all the hilarious creations of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/velveetaah/videos">melancholiaa</a>, who is quite a good singer when she’s not blowing out her vocal cords for laughs.)</p>
