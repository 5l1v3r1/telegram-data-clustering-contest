      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Until recently, New York City police secretly kept fingerprints of children arrested as juveniles on file permanently in a department database. It's an illegal practice that raised alarms about the lengths the nation's largest police force has taken to keep tabs on the city's youth.</p>
      <p>The Legal Aid Society uncovered the years-long practice. The public defender organization pressured the police department to acknowledge it and threatened legal action to make it stop, citing a state law barring local police from stockpiling juveniles' fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Now, after years of wrangling and resistance, the NYPD said Wednesday it has purged all juvenile fingerprints records from the database and will no longer keep them indefinitely.</p>
      <p>The Legal Aid Society said the database contained the fingerprints of tens of thousands of New York City youths.</p>
