      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 14 November 2019</p>
      <p>Sea of Thieves is no stranger to cross-promotional camaraderie; we've already seen the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-04-sea-of-thieves-adds-a-new-figurehead-to-celebrate-banjo-kazooies-20th-anniversary">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-20-you-can-get-sea-of-thieves-joanna-dark-figurehead-by-watching-inside-xbox-tomorrow">Perfect Dark</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-06-11-sea-of-thieves-is-gifting-players-a-sexy-halo-inspired-ship-set-to-celebrate-e3">Halo</a> sneaking into Rare's multiplayer pirate adventure by way of fancy limited-time cosmetics. And now Gears of War is getting in on the nautical action too.</p>
      <p>By logging onto Sea of Thieves any time until 22nd November, players can gain access to the Gears-of-War-inspired Omen Ship Set, consisting of a themed hull, sails, flag, and a totally on-point Chainsaw Bayonet figurehead. All of that can be seen in the announcement trailer below.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, those pirates still waiting to complete their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-19-you-can-get-sea-of-thieves-fancy-new-obsidian-ship-livery-by-watching-twitch-next-week">Obsidian Ship Set</a> - part of a long line of Obsidian cosmetics that Rare has been <i>very</i> slowly rolling out during various promotional opportunities over the last year - will soon have a chance to snag the Obsidian Wheel.</p>

      <p>To add the wheel to their collection, players simply need to watch a bit of Microsoft's special Inside Xbox X019 livestream <a href="https://mixer.com/xbox">via Mixer</a>. Things get underway tomorrow, 14th November, at 8pm GMT, and you'll need to be logged in using the Microsoft account tied to Sea of Thieves.</p>
      <p>Rare has already confirmed it will be revealing Sea of Thieves' November content update in a trailer during the livestream (there's no news yet on what that will entail, but I'm still holding out for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-08-22-fire-has-been-unofficially-announced-for-sea-of-thieves">accidentally previously announced fire</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1194646580919459842?s=20">word from respected industry analyst Daniel Ahmad</a> suggests that we might get a first look at a new Rare IP too.</p>
      <p>Ahmad also reports that tomorrow will bring news of a new Obsidian IP, alongside solid release dates for the likes of Bleeding Edge, Minecraft Dungeons, and Wasteland 3, so it's probably worth a punt even if you're not actively looking to snazz up your ship anytime soon.</p>
