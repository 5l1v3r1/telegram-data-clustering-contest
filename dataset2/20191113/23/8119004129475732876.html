        <b>The Indian High Commission in Dhaka has said that a “completely fake and malicious” letter said to be written by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being circulated in the local media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“It is intended to mislead people in Bangladesh and create social disharmony,” the high commission said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“It has come to the notice of the High Commission that a letter said to have been written by Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi to Hon’ble Chief Justice of India is being circulated in the local media.</p>
      <p>“This letter is completely fake and malicious. It is intended to mislead people in Bangladesh and create social disharmony.</p>
      <p>“It is most egregious and wrong on part of those who are deliberately circulating fake and incorrect information to create misunderstanding about India in the public domain.”</p>

      <p>The statement comes four days after India's Supreme Court ruled in favour of a Hindu group in a long-running battle over a centuries-old religious site also claimed by Muslims.</p>
      <p>The ruling paves the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site in the northern town of Ayodhya, a proposal long supported by Modi's ruling Hindu-nationalist party.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court directed that an alternate land parcel be provided to a Muslim group that had staked claim to the disputed site.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has said the issue will not cause any tension in Bangladesh.</p>
