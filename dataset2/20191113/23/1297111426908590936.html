      <p>Travis M. Patron, leader of the small, far-right Canadian Nationalist Party, has been accused of serious assaults against two women in Regina.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Redvers man appeared in court this week on charges of aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm and probation breach stemming from an incident alleged to have occurred earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Reached by phone Wednesday, Patron said he is in “total disagreement” with the allegations and plans to hire a lawyer.</p>
      <p>According to a news release issued Wednesday, Regina police were called shortly before 2:30 a.m. on Nov. 2 to the 1900 block of Victoria Avenue for a report that two women, aged 33 and 43, had just been assaulted. Police said the women had “visible injuries” and went to hospital for treatment. A police spokesperson declined to provide more information about the injuries, but confirmed a weapon was not alleged to have been used.</p>
      <p>Police said the women and a man had spoken earlier that evening at a bar. It’s alleged the man offered them rides home and that, when his offer was declined, the assaults occurred.</p>
      <p>Shortly after 3 a.m., police found a man matching the suspect’s description walking west on Victoria Avenue. Officers tried to speak with him but he refused to stop, according to police. Officers found the suspect’s name and arranged for an interview.</p>
      <p>Charged Saturday, Patron was held until his court appearance Tuesday, when the Crown agreed to release him on conditions. He’s back in court Nov. 25.</p>
      <p>Patron said he looks forward to challenging the charges in court, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Patron declined to address the specific allegations. “Because that is pertaining to a case in particular, the details of a case, it’s not in my interest to discuss that at this time,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Nationalist Party was eligible for registration with Elections Canada in September, in time for the federal election. Patron ran unsuccessfully in the southeast Saskatchewan riding of Souris—Moose Mountain.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Anti-Hate Network has described the party, which calls for drastic reductions in immigration and supports an ethnic-based nationalism, as neo-Nazi.</p>
