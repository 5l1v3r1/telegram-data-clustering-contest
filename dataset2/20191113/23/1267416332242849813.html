      <h1>Disney+ isn’t airing a ‘The Simpsons’ episode that features Michael Jackson</h1>
      <h2>This is the only episode missing from the show's 30-season run</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:29:08+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/brad-bennett" target="_blank">Brad Bennett</a></address>
      <p>The 1991 episode of <i>The Simpsons</i> that features the now infamous Michael Jackson is nowhere to be found on <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-canada-now-available-everything-you-need-to-know/">Disney+</a>, the House of Mickey’s new streaming service.</p>
      <p>The episode is called ‘Stark Raving Dad’ and it’s from season three.</p>
      <p>The show’s producers originally pulled the episode from streaming services, cable syndications and DVD boxsets in early March after the <i>Leaving Neverland </i>documentary aired on HBO.</p>
      <p>The documentary alleged that the late pop star has relationships with young boys.</p>
      <p>In Canada, the film is available to stream on Crave, as long as you have the HBO add-on.</p>
      <p>Disney+ is also facing <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-aspect-ratio-the-simpsons/">scrutiny for cropping</a> the older episodes of the series in order to fit the widescreen aspect ratio.</p>
