      <p>Jake Quickenden has been forced to pull out of the Dancing On Ice Christmas show after breaking a bone in his neck.</p>
      <p>The Hollyoaks actor won the ITV show in 2018 and was due to return to the ice for the festive special.</p>
      <p>He said on Twitter that he was "gutted" to be missing the programme.</p>
      <p>Quickenden told his 502,000 followers on the site: "Devastated I've had to pull out of @dancingonice Christmas show, I've broken a bone in my neck and I won't have time to heal and the medical team think it's too dangerous and to much of a rush to try and take part!!!</p>
      <p>"Gutted."</p>
