      <p>Nov. 13 (UPI) -- Chad Wolf was sworn in Wednesday as the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, making him the fifth person to head the agency under the Trump administration.</p>
      <p>A department spokesperson confirmed the news to <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/chad-wolf-confirmed-senate-acting-dhs-secretary">Roll Call</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/politics/chad-wolf-acting-dhs-secretary/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>The move comes the same day the Senate <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/11/13/chad-wolf-confirmed-under-secretary-homeland-security-office-strategy-policy-and">voted to confirm</a> him as undersecretary of the department's Office of Strategy, Policy and Plans by a vote of 54-41.</p>
      <p>President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a> indicated earlier this month he planned to name Wolf as acting secretary earlier to replace former acting Secretary <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kevin-McAleenan/?tps=1">Kevin McAleenan</a>, whom was never formally nominated to serve in the position. McAleenan submitted his resignation Oct. 11.</p>
      <p>McAleenan replaced <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kirstjen-Nielsen/?tps=1">Kirstjen Nielsen</a>, who resigned in April. Before her, Elaine Duke served as acting secretary after <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Kelly/?tps=1">John Kelly</a>'s July 2017 departure to serve as chief of staff.</p>
      <p>Wolf has worked at the Department of Homeland Security since the beginning of Trump's administration, both at the Transportation Security Administration and as chief of staff to Nielsen.</p>
