      <h1>Carlos Condit out of UFC on ESPN bout with Mickey Gall due to injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:00:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Burke</a></address>
      <p>Former WEC and UFC interim champ Carlos Condit hasn’t picked up a victory in the Octagon in a very long time, and he was looking to change all that in a UFC on ESPN 7 bout with Mickey Gall. Unfortunately for Condit, and the fans, he will be unable to compete on December 7th.</p>
      <p>Condit is out of the fight due to an undisclosed injury, <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/injury-pulls-carlos-condit-from-ufc-on-espn-7-mickey-gall-needs-new-opponent">according to MMA Junkie</a>. The UFC has not named a replacement opponent for Gall as of yet.</p>
      <p>Condit (30-13, 7-9 UFC) is currently on a five-fight losing streak, with his last win coming over Thiago Alves in 2015. He most recently lost to Michael Chiesa via submission last December.</p>
      <p>Gall (6-2, 5-2 UFC) is coming off a unanimous decision win over Salim Touahri in August. He’s 2-2 in his last four bouts overall.</p>
      <p>UFC on ESPN 7 goes down on December 7th in Washington, DC. The headliner will see Alistair Overeem taking on Jarzinho Rozenstruik in a heavyweight battle.</p>
