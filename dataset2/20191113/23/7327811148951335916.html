      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The mother of Bronx teenager Lesandro "Junior" Guzman-Feliz, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/tag/justice-for-junior/">who was killed in a brutal attack by gang members</a>, is supporting a bill to have panic buttons in all bodegas.</p>
      <p>"My son has already passed," said Leandra Feliz, mother of Lesandro. "They killed my son. We have to protect our future kids and our community."</p>
      <p>His mother's goal is to push for a citywide bill called "Junior's Law," which would reimburse business owners for the cost of the panic buttons to keep the shops safe.</p>
      <p>Once that button is pressed during an emergency, the authorities would be called immediately -- so far 31 council members, including city council member Mark Gjonaj, are backing it.</p>
      <p>"This bill will make sure that safe haven continues to be one and give them the tools they need just in case someone has ill intentions," Gjonaj said.</p>
      <p>In order for a business to be qualified, they must be open 24 hours a day, have less than 10 employees and be in a targeted area determined by crime statistics.</p>
      <p>Officials say the bill is voluntary, costing a business owner between $600 and $1,000 upfront to install one of these panic buttons. That money would be reimbursed through this bill, and they say it will protect more than just customers.</p>
      <p>"It will protect bodega owners, employees," Gjonaj said. "As we know it's a cash business and they are working night shifts. This panic button is going to save lives...a life costs more than $600."</p>
      <p>Leandra said it's a small price compared to what she has already paid.</p>
      <p>"If they thought about using this panic button before the murder, my son, I think, would be alive today," Leandra said.</p>
