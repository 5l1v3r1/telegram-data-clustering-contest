      <p>On November 16 - 17, Santa will take time to hear the Christmas wishes of the furry members of the family with sessions dedicated to pet photography while from November 24 to 28 he'll aside some time to create a sensory-friendly environment, so that families can have their photo with Santa in a relaxed setting.</p>
      <p>Bookings are limited and can be made online at <a href="https://www.westfield.com.au/kotara">www.westfield.com.au/kotara</a></p>
