      <h1>Prosecutors: Philadelphia Father Used Infant Son as Human Shield</h1>
      <h2>Nafes Monroe allegedly used his 11-month-old infant son to shield himself during the Hunting Park shooting on October 19.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:27:43+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:27</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Church</a></address>
      <p>Police say the 25-year-old Philadelphia resident attempted to buy drugs with counterfeit money. When the deal went south, Monroe hid in his car, <a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/prosecutors-father-used-11-month-old-son-as-human-shield-during-hunting-park-shooting">using</a> his own son to block gunfire from a presumably irate dealer.</p>
      <p>Monroe’s son was reportedly “struck once in the back of the head, once in the chest and twice in the buttocks.” Monroe and his partner — the boy’s stepmother — then allegedly drove to another house before delivering his son to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Both the woman and child were eventually <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/authorities-11-month-old-shot-four-times-in-hunting-park-5k-reward-offered">delivered</a> to Albert Einstein Hospital. The latter was transferred to St. Christopher’s Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. The shooter remains at large.</p>
      <p>“I am outraged, disgusted, and heartbroken by the violence this weekend that claimed the life of an innocent 2-year-old and left another infant fighting for his life,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/outraged-disgusted-mayor-kenney-addresses-shootings-involving-2-year-old-11-month-old-children">said</a> in a statement released after the shooting, referencing <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/police-2-year-old-girl-killed-in-kensington-triple-shooting">another</a> one that occurred in nearby Kensington. He continued:</p>
      <blockquote>My prayers are with their families and communities during this tragic time. Philadelphians should not live in fear of violence that could take away a child’s life, but for too many this is a sad reality. With the flow of illegal guns and drugs unabated, we must do whatever we can locally to help address this issue.</blockquote>
      <p>Still, Kenney does not believe that the crimes are a fair representation of Philadelphia. “This is not who we are, this is not what defines our city, and we must work together to create a safer city for us all,” he concluded. The Democrat mayor recently made national headlines for <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/07/16/philadelphia-mayor-kenney-trump-would-go-to-hell-if-he-had-to-go-back-to-where-he-came-from/">claiming</a> Trump would “go to Hell” if he had to go back to where he came from.</p>
