      <h1>Strictly's Oti Mabuse 'feared for her life' when lift with Kelvin went wrong during rehearsals</h1>
      <h2>The professional dancer dangerously flew across the room in rehearsals when her celeb partner attempted a risky lift</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:33:37+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:33</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/otlile-mabuse">Oti Mabuse</a> admitted she "feared for her life" following a failed lift during <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> rehearsals.</p>
      <p>The professional dancer, 29, appeared on BBC Two's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> tonight alongside her celebrity partner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kelvin-fletcher">Kelvin Fletcher</a> , where she opened up about the risky move they attempted.</p>
      <p>The pair showed off the tricky move in their routine on the BBC show at the weekend, but tonight revealed this was the simplified version after Oti suffered a scary fall earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>Host Zoe Ball asked: "Were you in fear of your life?"</p>
      <p>Oti admitted: "I was! With Kelvin, every week he starts really slow and then he progresses incredibly.</p>

      <p>"So when we were doing it, we were doing it really slow and I thought 'let's both have our hands up'."</p>
      <p>The pro dancer then admitted the scary near-accident.</p>

      <p>She added: "On Wednesday, he gets faster and I almost fly across the room. I was like, 'oh my god, don't let me go!'</p>
      <p>"So we had to adjust it. I love he's so passionate and just wants to improve, but that was scary."</p>
      <p>She then admitted that due to the late stage in the competition, "we're all trying to push each other."</p>
      <p>Oti continued: "When you get lifts, you want to make them scary and impossible. But after I thought, 'what was I thinking?'"</p>

      <p>Oti and former Emmerdale star Kelvin, 35, are favourites to walk away with the Glitterball trophy this year.</p>
      <p>The couple's dangerous lift comes after Kelvin's gruelling training regime was revealed.</p>
      <p>Kelvin has been pushing himself to the limit in his bid for victory with 5am work-outs and 12 hour training sessions with partner Oti.</p>
      <p>The actor has also increased his calories intake to 3,000 a day and makes sure he drinks up to four litres of water a day.</p>
      <p>Kelvin is taught his dance moves on Monday and he makes sure he knows the routine by Tuesday lunch time so he and Oti can spend the rest of the week perfecting it.</p>

      <p>It also recently emerged that the dad-of-two has a secret dance past.</p>
      <p>Before his starring role in Emmerdale, Kelvin was a regular at ballet classes from the age of eight.</p>
      <p>Kelvin was a late replacement in the BBC competition after Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing suffered a foot injury.</p>
