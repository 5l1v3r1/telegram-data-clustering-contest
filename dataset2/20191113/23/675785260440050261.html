      <h2>The England boss raised eyebrows by deciding to drop Sterling for the game against Montenegro following his altercation with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez</h2>

      <p>Gareth Southgate has admitted every decision he makes as England boss will divide opinion.</p>
      <p>It has been two years of plain sailing for Southgate who has seemingly made the Impossible Job very doable, leading England to a World Cup semi final and now they are one game away from reaching the Euros.</p>
      <p>But suddenly, Southgate has found himself in the spotlight and every former player, pundit and current player has had a view on how he has handled the fall-out from Raheem Sterling’s row with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>Dropping England’s best player from the squad to face Montenegro was perhaps his biggest and boldest call yet of many big decisions like putting the emphasis on youth and bringing the curtain down on Wayne Rooney’s international career.</p>

      <p>But without doubt, Sterling is his biggest call and the world and his wife has had their say ever since. From Rio Ferdinand to Gary Neville, they have all put in their two pennies’ worth.</p>
      <p>Ex-England defender Ferdinand was perhaps the strongest of all, insisting Sterling has been hung out to dry and that similar bust-ups happen all of the time.</p>
      <p>But Southgate insisted that he cannot afford to listen because he always does what he thinks is best for the team.</p>
      <p>“Well, I think nobody else walks in my shoes and has to deal with all of those things, so whenever I pick a squad, the country’s divided,” said Southgate. “Whenever I pick a team, the country’s divided.</p>
      <p>“And then, the team has to go and play, and if we play well and we excite the fans and the team performs at the level that we believe they can, then everybody comes together a little bit.</p>

      <p>“Then everybody talks in the pub about who should’ve played and who should’ve come into the game, and ‘why did I make that change’ and they’re divided again!</p>
      <p>“So, I have to accept that, I can’t worry about that, I’ve got to make the decisions that I think are right. If you’re a leader and you try to keep everybody happy all the time, then that’s not going to happen.</p>
      <p>“You’re probably going to duck issue that maybe you should deal with, so it’s a lonely place to be, a challenging place to be.</p>
      <p>“But, you have to stand up and make sure that you’re accountable, that you’re there to stand up and speak about the decisions that you make and show a way forward for the team. In the end, the most important thing is that we win the game tomorrow night.”</p>
      <p>The Sterling decision is one of the seismic moments that everyone will harp back to if England mess up in the next few months and forget about if they do well which just underlines what a thankless task Southgate has in front of him.</p>
      <p>Southgate’s former Middlesbrough team mate Danny Mills insisted it should have been kept in house, citing an example from when Joseph Job had a bust-up with George Boateng, Southgate was captain and they never talked about it.</p>

      <p>So, what is the difference? “Well, I was the captain and Steve McClaren was the manager,” said Southgate. “That was the difference. He wasn’t like: ‘Do you want to keep it in-house or not?’ So, It’s a completely different situation.”</p>
      <p>There is an answer for every situation and Southgate’s biggest challenge now is to turn the focus back onto Montenegro and Kosovo, getting the results they need to qualify for what is seen as a “home tournament” when the pressure really will be back on.</p>
      <p>Southgate added: “I think more often what’s going on inside is a lot calmer than the perception of all the stories that inevitably come out. inside, it’s been about training, it’s been about preparing for the game and it’s often the way.</p>
      <p>“From my observations, it’s been business as usual. I think as soon as everybody had got together on Monday night as a team, the focus was on the football. Everybody that was in that meeting knows that’s the end of that, and it was just a case of: ‘Right, let’s get on!’”</p>
      <p><b>England probable XI:</b> Pickford; Alexander-Arnold, Stones, Maguire, Chilwell; Rice, Winks, Mount; Sancho, Rashford, Kane.</p>
