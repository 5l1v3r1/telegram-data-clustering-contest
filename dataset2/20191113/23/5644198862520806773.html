      <p>On the streets, people with differing views are turning on each other, and tear gas cloaked many areas as police tried to disperse protesters who have blocked roads across the city.</p>
      <p>The flare-ups came after police shot a protester at close range on Monday and police said "rioters" doused a man with petrol and set him on fire in some of the worst violence so far.</p>
