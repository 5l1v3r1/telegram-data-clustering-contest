      <h1>Stocks Rise to Record Highs as Impeachment Hearing Sputters | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 closed at record highs on Wednesday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:11:48+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:11</time> by <a rel="author">John Carney</a></address>
      <p>The Dow rose 92.10 points, or three-tenths of a percentage point, to 27783.59. The S&amp;P 500 moved up 2.20 points, less than one-tenth of a percentage point. But since those indexes were already at record highs, even the small gains were enough to set new records.</p>
      <p>The Nasdaq Composite fell 3.99, or less than one-tenth of a percentage point.</p>
      <p>The uptick in stocks came as investors digested two important hearings on Capitol Hill and reports that trade talks with China had hit a snag.</p>
      <p>A House panel <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/live-wire-william-taylor-george-kent-testify-in-first-public-impeachment-hearing/">heard</a> the first public testimony from witnesses in the Democrats’ impeach inquiry. Many of President Donald Trump’s supporters thought the hearing went poorly for the president’s accusers. Privately, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/democrat-dud-first-public-impeachment-hearing-falls-short-as-complicated-unclear-allegations-drive-inquiry-forward/">many Democrats agree</a>. Certainly, nothing occurred that would make investors think the president would be removed from office.</p>
      <p>Fed chair Jerome Powell <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/11/13/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-ending-fracking-would-be-bad-for-the-economy/">testified</a> to the Joint Economic Committee, expressing optimism about the economy and telling lawmakers that interest rates were on hold unless something big changed. The Fed has been trying to communicate a message of certainty and stability to counter uncertainty created by impeachment, trade, and the coming election year.</p>
      <p>The major indexes began the day with declines from the previous day but climbed back as the two hearings proceeded, suggesting investors were not alarmed by either.</p>
      <p>Stocks did retreat from the highs of the day after the Wall Street Journal reported that <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/11/13/report-trade-talks-stall-as-china-renegs-on-farm-purchase-promises/">trade talks hit a snag</a> over Chinese purchases of U.S. farm goods. The S&amp;P briefly turned negative before bouncing back.</p>
