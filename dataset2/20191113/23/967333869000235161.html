      <blockquote>"Operational suitability of the F-35 fleet remains below service expectations", Behler told the US House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Tactical Air and land Forces. "No F-35 variant meets these specified reliability or maintainability metrics".</blockquote>
      <p>Behler explained that the F-35 aircraft breaks down more often and the necessary repairs take more time than expected.</p>

      <p>The fifth-generation jet has three variants: the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant, the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing variant and the F-35C aircraft carrier variant.</p>
