      <h1>Therapy Dogs Sent to Capitol Hill as Impeachment Hearings Begin</h1>
      <h2>Pet Partners worked with the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC) to bring some furry cheer to counteract impeachment stress on Wednesday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:47:42+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:47</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Church</a></address>
      <p>The organizations <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/470179-therapy-dogs-slated-to-visit-capitol-hill-today">said</a> that the goal was to “offer congressional staff a break from the stress of wrapping up an exceptionally busy year,” and to demonstrate the “health and wellness benefits of the human-animal bond,” according to the <i>Hill</i>. Dogs were available this afternoon in both the Hart Senate Office Building and the Rayburn House Office Building.</p>
      <p>“Who better to bring comfort and relief to the hardworking folks on Capitol Hill than a furry group of loving, intuitive, and bipartisan Pet Partners therapy animals?” the organizations asked. PIJAC <a href="https://twitter.com/PIJAC4PETS/status/1194680406659993600">posted</a> pictures of the registered therapy dogs providing smiles free of charge. “Great to have so many staffers stop by our #pettherapy on the Hill event today!” it <a href="https://twitter.com/PIJAC4PETS/status/1194680888153518080">said</a>.</p>
      <p>It sounds like a good idea: According to therapy animal organization PAWS for People, the scientifically-<a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/pac/animal-assisted-therapy">proven</a> benefits of pet therapy <a href="https://www.pawsforpeople.org/who-we-are/benefits-of-pet-therapy/">include</a> decreasing anxiety, providing comfort, and even lowering blood pressure. And while these are all very relevant benefits for the day’s grueling impeachment hearings, it was not planned as such.</p>
      <p>“This is a happy accident,” PIJAC President Mike Bober <a href="https://people.com/pets/therapy-dogs-visit-capitol-hill-during-impeachment-hearings/">told</a> <i>People</i>. “We had this planned for several months, so when they announced the date of the hearings, we thought ‘if there was ever a time for a bipartisan source of comfort and relief, it’s today.’”</p>
