      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kelsey-grammer-frasier-reboot-summer-2020">Kelsey Grammer</a> didn't mince words when it came to discussing his ex-wife <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rhobh-star-camille-grammer-says-she-wasnt-asked-back-to-popular-series">Camille Grammer</a> in a new interview.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I don’t really talk about her very much because so much of her life is spent talking about me and I just think it’s sort of pathetic,” the 64-year-old told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqdJWCc_xao&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Graham Bensinger</a> of the "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star.</p>
      <p>Kelsey, 64, went on to recall when he knew that they were headed for a split. He said the 51-year-old reality star demanded a divorce on the same day he laid his mother to rest.</p>

      <p>“A month after I had a heart attack, my mother died – 12 years ago now – the day of my mother’s funeral, my third wife basically had an explosion about something,” Kelsey explained. “And she started telling me, ‘I’m out of this, I’m out of here. I want a divorce, blah, blah blah – which, we’d had the same conversation for eight years, and it was tiresome.”</p>
      <p>“I realized at that moment that I was done with her, that I was not going to end up in this relationship for much longer. And somewhere under a year [later], I was done,” he added.</p>

      <p>The "Frasier" star and Camille split in July 2010 after tying the knot in 1997.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/13/kelsey-grammer-slams-pathetic-ex-wife-camille-of-rhobh/">Page Six</a>, the Bravo star was awarded half of the 401(k) earnings Kelsey accumulated during the couple’s 13-year marriage, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/camille-grammer-kelsey-grammer-divorce-settlement">totaling $30 million</a>. The ex-pair share two children – daughter Mason, 17, and son Jude, 14.</p>
      <p>Camille would marry attorney David C. Meyer in October 2018. Kelsey tied the knot with fourth wife, Kayte Walsh, in 2011. They share daughters Faith, 7, and Kelsey, 5.</p>
