      <h2>Andrew Whyment is reportedly going to be a late entry into the I'm A Celebrity camp as show bosses look to shake it up just days into the new series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:59:03+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Andrew Whyment is reportedly set to be a late addition to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> camp.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> actor 'will be the 12th campmate', entering the show in an early shake-up alongside another mystery celebrity.</p>
      <p>Last year there were 11 campmates but it has been reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> that Andrew will make it a round dozen this time around.</p>
      <p>It was thought that the Corrie star would be one of the original 10 celebrities announced to be heading for the Australian jungle ahead of Sunday's launch.</p>
      <p>There was despair among fans of the cobbles favourite when he was omitted from the line-up and then spotted shopping in a garden centre when the announced campmates started arriving at Brisbane International Airport.</p>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity producers will be hoping that Andrew proves to be a more popular addition to the camp than Noel Edmonds was last year, when he entered later than the others.</p>
      <p>There was egg on the faces of the show bosses after the veteran TV presenter was the first to be booted out of camp by viewers, just eight days after he had arrived.</p>
      <p>Noel was paid £600,000 for his time in the jungle, the most expensive ever signing to the show.</p>
      <p>This year, the bank has been broken by nearly £1 million being allegedly splashed on getting former Arsenal favourite Ian Wright and US reality star Caitlyn Jenner onto the show.</p>
      <p>Match of the Day regular pundit Ian was was reportedly convinced to head Down Under by his close pal Harry Redknapp, who is the reigning King of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>He is joined by the likes of former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle, Good Morning Britain's Kate Garraway, and former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa.</p>

      <p>Andrew has been a fan favourite in the Weatherfield soap since 2000, where he has played Kirk Sutherland.</p>
      <p>He would become the 11th past or present Coronation Street star to enter the I'm A Celebrity jungle.</p>
      <p>Before pitching up in Coronation Street, Andrew memorably played Darren Sinclair-Jones in award-winning BBC comedy, The Royle Family.</p>
