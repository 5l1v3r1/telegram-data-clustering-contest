      <h1>City of Regina service partners make budget pitches to executive committee</h1>
      <h2>Deliberations begin at a special city council meeting on Dec. 9 scheduled to discuss administration's proposed 2020 General Operating Budget, which will include the RPL mill rate.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:02:20+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>Four of the city’s service partners, including the Regina Public Library (RPL), presented their budget requests for the coming year at an executive committee meeting Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The requests, which also outline each organization’s work plan for 2020, will help inform future budget deliberations by city council. Here’s a brief look at what kind of money each group is asking for:</p>
      <h3>Regina Public Library requests mill rate increase</h3>
      <p>The RPL is requesting a 0.74971 mill rate — a 2.3 per cent increase compared to 2019 — for 2020.</p>
      <p>The money generated from that increase would go primarily towards paying staff as per the latest union contract, as well as for the fulfillment of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/regina-public-library-seeking-consultant-to-explore-options-for-central-branch-renewal">a request for proposals. Released in October, that request seeks a consultant</a> to develop and present a business case to the RPL’s board of directors outlining<a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/from-art-to-audiobooks-a-look-at-the-future-of-regina-public-library"> options for the future of the building, whether it’s an expansion or a rebuild to accommodate a growing user-base.</a></p>
      <p>It will also help with the first year of the RPL’s new service plan, which will affect staffing levels and the ways the library provides service.</p>

      <h3>Provincial Capital Commission (PCC) opts for status quo</h3>
      <p>The PCC provides oversight and stewardship of 2,300 acres of land within the City of Regina. It also oversees programming operations of Government House and the 8.5-acre Edwardian Gardens.</p>
      <p>The commission has presented a total request from the City of Regina of $2,719,000, the same as their 2019 request which was included and approved in the 2019 budget. This includes an operating funding request of $2,119,000 and a capital request of $600,000 in 2020.</p>
      <p>“This will allow the continuation of core services at the appropriate level,” said PCC’s submission. “Any reduction in funding will significantly reduces services and public amenities.”</p>
      <p>The PCC will also request capital funding from the provincial government ($1.1 million) and the University of Regina ($300,000).</p>
      <p>If approved, that money will support three major projects in 2020-21: $1.4 million toward the second phase of the Wascana Centre Irrigation system upgrades, $300,000 to replace the Willow Island parking lot and $300,000 to complete final landscaping at the College Avenue gateway entrance.</p>

      <h3>Regina Exhibition Association Limited (REAL) reduces funding request, but faces financial woes</h3>
      <p>Established in 1884, REAL operates Evraz Place — including the International Trade Centre and Mosaic Stadium — on behalf of the City of Regina.</p>
      <p>In previous years, REAL received a grant of $400,000 from the city on a $41-million annual budget. In 2019, REAL reduced its funding request to $200,000 and is again reducing its request to $100,000 for 2020.</p>
      <p>This is despite the fact the organization is currently at risk of not achieving their 2019 budget, according to president and CEO Tim Reid.</p>
      <p>“This highlights there is a significant risk in future years, should major events not occur, as 2019 was a remarkably successful major event year and considered a key revenue source for the sustainability of REAL,” said REAL’s submission.</p>
      <p>According to the submission, REAL’s board of directors has spent the last year identifying how the new Mosaic Stadium and the International Trade Centre have impacted its operations. What they found was a “sizeable short term capital funding shortfall” and the need to identify other revenue and profitability sources to support the capital needs of the organization moving forward.</p>
      <p>The board is currently finalizing a strategic plan for 2020, which will include a five-year business plan and a strategic 15-year model. REAL has already identified the need for a multi-purpose event space and possible commercialization to help increase revenues in the future.</p>
      <p>“For 2020 REAL will work closely with the Saskatchewan Roughriders to host the 2020 Grey Cup a truly national event, which will mitigate some event risk, however at this point this is the only major event REAL has been able to secure,” said the submission. “REAL is still in the process of sourcing and securing other entertainment opportunities for a major stadium event but if another major event is not secured, this will present some public and financial risk following a successful 2019.”</p>

      <h3>Economic Development Regina (EDR)</h3>
      <p>EDR is the lead agency for economic development and destination marketing for the Greater Regina Area (GRA). It provides leadership to the community for things like supporting industry growth and diversification, marketing the GRA for business and tourism and more.</p>
      <p>For the 2020 fiscal year, EDR is requesting an investment of $1,848,240 to maintain core services and to achieve their 2020 business plan’s strategic priorities.</p>
      <p>The request is an increase of $36,240, or two per cent compared to 2019.</p>
      <p>According to EDR’s submission, priorities for 2020 include developing and executing a growth strategy focused on Ag-Food to establish the GRA as a food hub for Canada, developing a strong competitive identity, the development of an economic growth plan to guide future growth in the city and increased investments from the city, stakeholders, and the provincial and federal governments.</p>
      <p>The 2020 budget allocations for the PCC, REAL, EDR and the RPL mill rate will be determined by city council through future budget deliberations.</p>
      <p>Deliberations begin at a special city council meeting on Dec. 9 scheduled to discuss administration’s proposed 2020 General Operating Budget, which will include the RPL mill rate.</p>
