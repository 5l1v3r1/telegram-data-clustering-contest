      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Bob and Mike Bryan, the greatest doubles pair in the history of tennis, have announced they will end what they describe as a “magical ride” in 2020 after one more crack at the U.S. Open.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old Californian twins, famous for their trademark chest-bump celebration, will bid farewell at Flushing Meadows, scene of their Grand Slam debut in 1995.</p>
      <p>Playing almost exclusively with each other throughout their 25-year careers, the Bryans captured a professional era record 118 titles, including 16 Grand Slam titles, 39 ATP Masters 1000s and the ATP Finals title four times.</p>
      <p>The Bryans also won Olympic gold at London 2012 and were part of the U.S. Davis Cup-winning team in 2007.</p>
      <p>Mike claimed two more Grand Slam titles with Jack Sock in 2018 after Bob was sidelined with a hip injury.</p>
      <p>“Mike and I chose to finish our 2019 season after the U.S. Open, even knowing there was a strong chance we’d qualify for the ATP Finals,” Bob said in an ATP statement on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“After much discussion, we decided that it would be best to rest our minds and strengthen our bodies in preparation for 2020 which will be our final season on the ATP Tour.</p>
      <p>“For the last 21 years, we have been so grateful for the opportunity to live out our dreams of playing professional tennis. It has truly been a magical ride.”</p>
