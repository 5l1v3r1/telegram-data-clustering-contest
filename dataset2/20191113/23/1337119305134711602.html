      <h1>SpongeBob Squarepants spinoff may head to Netflix in new massive deal with Nickelodeon</h1>
      <h2>A music-oriented series based on Squidward</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:09:00+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>A new <i>SpongeBob Squarepants </i>spinoff described as a “music-based project” centered around Spongebob’s iconic neighborhood octopus Squidward is heading to Netflix, <a href="https://nyti.ms/33KBmZZ">according to <i>The New York Times</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>The show is reportedly part of a new multi-year deal between Nickelodeon and Netflix that was confirmed earlier today, one estimated at a reported $200 million. The deal will see Nickelodeon produce a slate of original animated films and series based on both existing and new characters, with the <i>Times</i> reporting that Squidward’s new venture is one of the shows Netflix will receive as part of the nine-figure deal. A representative for Nickelodeon declined to confirm Squidward’s participation to <i>The Verge, </i>however. A separate <i>SpongeBob Squarepants </i>movie is also in the works at Paramount Pictures; both Paramount and Nickelodeon are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/13/20746894/cbs-viacom-merger-acquisition-all-access-mtv-bet-streaming-value">owned by ViacomCBS.</a></p>
      <p>Netflix and Nickelodeon had a relationship prior to the announcement. The streamer acquired Nickelodeon’s recent made-for-TV movies <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/26/8931689/rockos-modern-life-trailer-netflix-release-date"><i>Rocko’s Modern Life: Static Cling</i></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/16/20808600/invader-zim-enter-the-florpus-dib-professor-membrane-review"><i>Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus</i></a><i>, </i>which are based on beloved series from the ‘90s. Just recently, Netflix added a slew of Nickelodeon titles, including <i>Victorious</i>, <i>Sam &amp; Cat, </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/6/16438576/hey-arnold-the-jungle-movie-new-season-episodes-nycc-2017"><i>Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <aside><i>SpongeBob Squarepants</i>, a name recognized around the world, may help draw in and retain Netflix subscribers</aside>
      <p>Although Netflix is set to receive a number of new Nickelodeon shows and films in the deal, older beloved titles may not show up on the platform. <i>Drake and Josh</i>, the live-action sitcom from the early ‘00s that starred Drake Bell and Josh Peck, is currently on Hulu. Other series, including <i>SpongeBob Squarepants </i>original seasons and <i>Dora the Explorer, </i>are available on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon and Viacom <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/business/media/viacom-strikes-deal-with-amazon-to-stream-childrens-shows.html">originally signed a big, multi-year deal in 2013,</a> following Netflix’s decision not to renew an expired contract with Viacom.</p>
      <p>There’s always a chance that all of <i>Spongebob Squarepants’ </i>library, along with other shows, could end up on Netflix. But Nickelodeon shows are available through a number of streaming portals — including a separate streaming video on demand app <a href="http://nickalive.blogspot.com/2019/02/viacom-hints-that-nickelodeon-could-be.html">launched this year called NickHits</a> that runs $7.99 a month.</p>
      <p>Having a <i>SpongeBob Squarepants </i>show on Netflix is a big deal for the streamer, especially in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20958310/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-pixar-national-grographic-simpsons-netflix-hbo-max-peacock">Disney+ launch</a>. Disney’s streaming platform, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963172/disney-plus-subscribers-10-million-star-wars-marvel-pixar-launch">surpassed 10 million subscribers within its first day</a>, is home to some of the most beloved children’s shows and properties. That list includes a ton of Disney Channel originals, Pixar movies, and animated superhero shows throughout the decades. While Netflix has a seemingly endless list of shows and movies for people to stream, the platform is losing much of its recognizable licensed content to competitors. <i>SpongeBob Squarepants</i>, a name recognized around the world, may help draw in and retain Netflix subscribers.</p>
