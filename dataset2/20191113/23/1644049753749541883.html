      <p>Festival Walk, a shopping mall in Hong Kong owned by Singapore-based Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust Ltd, suffered “extensive damage” in another round of protests on Wed (13 Nov).</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg</i> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/hong-kong-protestors-trash-mapletree-mall-torch-christmas-tree">reported</a> Mapletree, a Temasek Holdings-<a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/mapletree-funds-140148/">linked</a> company, as saying that protestors had “smashed” glass panels at the mall’s entrance, and that they had also “damaged the office lobby and balustrades on various levels” of the centre.</p>
      <p>Festival Walk’s Christmas tree was also “torched” during the protests.</p>
      <p>Mapletree North Asia Commercial’s fell 4.9 per cent to S$1.16 in early Singapore trade yesterday, which is the lowest in 10 months, according to <i>Bloomberg</i>.</p>
      <p>Festival Walk is situated near the Kowloon Tong subway station. It houses over 200 retail stores and restaurants, including Apple, Marks &amp; Spencer and Uniqlo.</p>
      <p>Festival Walk was Mapletree’s first commercial property acquisition in Hong Kong, purchased for S$2.9 billion in 2011. As of Mar this year, Mapletree owns and manages S$55.7 billion of office, retail, logistics, industrial, residential and lodging properties, including four Singapore-listed real estate investment trusts (REITs) and six private equity real estate funds.</p>

        <b>Festival Walk incident follows student’s death last Fri during clashes </b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident at Festival Walk follows another violent clash between protesters and the police, which saw a student succumbing to fatal head injuries last Fri (8 Nov).</p>
      <p><i>AFP</i> <a href="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/11/08/hong-kong-students-death-triggers-fresh-outrage/">reported</a> that while the exact chronology leading to 22-year-old Alex Chow’s fall are “unclear and disputed”, his death is “the first student fatality during five months of demonstrations”.</p>
      <p>Vigils were held the same night to mourn Chow’s passing, and to call upon new rounds of protests over last weekend.</p>
      <p>Joshua Wong, a prominent civil rights activist of the Umbrella Movement, tweeted: “Today we mourn the loss of a freedom fighter in Hong Kong”.</p>
      <p>Police have repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing in relation to Chow’s death, <i>AFP</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The lead officer in the case, Superintendent Ewing Wu, told reporters: “As for the allegations that police chased the deceased or that we pushed him and caused him to fall, the police hereby make a solemn statement again that nothing of the kind happened”.</p>
