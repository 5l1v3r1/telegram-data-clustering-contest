      <h1>Billy Ray Cyrus on why he almost turned down 'Old Town Road' collaboration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-13T23:03:19+00:00">13 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Day</a></address>
      <p>It's hard to imagine <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/billy-ray-cyrus-pete-rose-baseball-hall-of-fame">Billy Ray Cyrus</a> never collaborating with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/country-music-lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-keith-urban-cma-fest-2019">Lil Nas X</a> on the titanic hit "Old Town Road" -- but that was almost the case.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://time.com/collection/time-100-next-2019/5718849/lil-nas-x/">Time magazine</a>, Cyrus, 58, wrote about Lil Nas X and the song.</p>
      <p>"I was having coffee and Ron Perry from Columbia Records sent me 'Old Town Road,'" the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/country">country crooner</a> remembered. "He said Lil Nas X wanted me to sing on it. But I told Columbia it was perfect. I couldn't do anything to it."</p>

      <p>Perry eventually convinced Cyrus to collaborate with Lil Nas X, which was a seamless process.</p>
      <p>"We wrote it with R&amp;B songwriter Jozzy, and it was born right there in the studio. It was magical," Cyrus wrote. "I told Nas he was going to be a light in this world and he would shine brighter than anyone else. And he has. He's brought everyone together, from all musical genres and generations. 'Old Town Road' changed my world -- and his -- forever."</p>
      <p>Cyrus' remix of the song hit the charts and the rest is history -- literally.</p>
