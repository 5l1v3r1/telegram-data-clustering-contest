      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Former world number four and Australian Open runner-up Dominika Cibulkova announced her retirement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old Slovakian claimed eight WTA singles titles and entered the top four in 2017.</p>
      <p>Her biggest title came in 2016 when she defeated then world number one Angelique Kerber to win the WTA Finals.</p>
      <p>Cibulkova, who has not played since the French Open, became the first Slovak woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2014 when she lost to China’s Li Na at the Australian Open.</p>
      <p>She said she had made up her mind about retirement at Roland Garros. “It was strange because I knew, and no one around me except my team knew it would be my last tournament,” she said.</p>
      <p>“At that point, I was 100% sure. I wasn’t doubting or thinking ‘maybe yes or no.’ I knew I wanted to do it like this, for this to be my last tournament. I went home and was happy with my decision.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to make it, but once you do, you feel more free.”</p>
