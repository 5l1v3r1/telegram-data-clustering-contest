      <p>If you're looking for an advent calendar that's filled with edibles (not that kind), Selfridges' festive mince pies might be just the ticket.</p>
      <p>Stuffed with 24 mini mince pies, there's an array of fillings waiting to be snaffled up as you chow your way through December, including classic, citrus, almond, and chocolate. Behind the 25th door is a Christmas cake from artisan bakery, Meg Rivers.</p>

      <p>Is a mince pie still a mince pie if it isn't the classic mincemeat? I don't know, but I'm prepared to eat two dozen of them to find out, all for the low, low price of Â£39.99.</p>
