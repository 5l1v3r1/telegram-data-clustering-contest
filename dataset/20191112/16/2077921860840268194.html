      <h1>Thyla Share New Single "Lenox Hill" from Forthcoming Second EP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:10:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Lizzie Manno  </a></address>
      <p>Brighton dream-pop quartet Thyla have shared a new single, “Lenox Hill,” taken from their forthcoming second EP <i>Everything At Once</i>, out on Jan. 24, 2020. The band released their debut EP <i>What’s On Your Mind?</i> earlier this year, and <i>Paste</i> named them one of <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/the-15-new-british-bands-you-need-to-know-in-2019.html">15 new British acts You need to know in 2019</a>. “Lenox Hill” follows their forthcoming EP’s lead single “Two Sense.”</p>
      <p>On “Lenox Hill,” frontwoman Millie Duthie channels her past self in search of answers to present-day feelings of inadequacy. When Duthie’s pure-hearted childhood self fades away and returns to her current state of emptiness, you can hear the ringing guitars start to ramp up, and Duthie’s vocals becoming more and more fervent. It’s an anthemic rekindling of one’s roots and further evidence that Thyla excel at melodic rock ascendence.</p>
      <p>Duthie says of their new single:</p>
      <p>Lenox Hill is the hospital I was born in, with the track inspired by my early years as a kid living in New York City. It’s an honest and emotional coming-of-age tale. Life can take so many turns and you can forget where you came from and what makes you you. The important stuff like family can get set aside in the pursuit of whatever it is that drives you. Lenox Hill is about realising you’re lost and deciding to go back to your roots to find the way again.</p>
