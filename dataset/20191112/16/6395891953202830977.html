      <p>But the teens will now be able to play with their fellow musicians next year after the punishment was reconsidered.</p>
      <p>Members of the Emmaus High School drumline poured baby powder on their drum heads as part of a special effect during a performance. But they didn't get permission from the band's director before the stunt, <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/emmaus-high-school-drumline-reinstated-after-baby-powder-incident/article_29dd330e-04ef-11ea-a42a-035c582c0f4f.html">WFMZ reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The powder covered the drums and eventually the running track.</p>

      <p>The drumline performances were canceled for next year after the stunt, but the students were still allowed to be part of the marching band as a whole, <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/emmaus-high-school-drumline-reinstated-after-baby-powder-incident/article_29dd330e-04ef-11ea-a42a-035c582c0f4f.html">WFMZ reported</a>.  </p>
      <p>The students said they respected the director's decision since they didn't ask permission for the powder but were still disappointed that they wouldn't be able to play as a drumline next year, <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/local/east-penn/mc-nws-emmaus-high-school-drumline-ban-20191111-mndr4nkzbfa75kh5vbj3s5dgkq-story.html">The Morning Call in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, reported</a>.</p>
      <p>That was until Monday, when the school district superintendent said the students and band director met and the drumline will perform again next year, <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/emmaus-high-school-drumline-reinstated-after-baby-powder-incident/article_29dd330e-04ef-11ea-a42a-035c582c0f4f.html">WFMZ reported</a>. </p>
      <p>The superintendent didn't say if the students would face any punishment, <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/lehighvalley/emmaus-high-school-drumline-reinstated-after-baby-powder-incident/article_29dd330e-04ef-11ea-a42a-035c582c0f4f.html">according to WFMZ</a>.</p>
