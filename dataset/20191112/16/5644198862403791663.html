      <p>REUTERS: England's Raheem Sterling has conceded that emotions got the better of him in a bust-up with team mate Joe Gomez at the national training camp but said he was ready to move on after being dropped by the Football Association.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail reported that Manchester City winger Sterling had clashed with Liverpool's Gomez after the England team got together at their Burton on Trent training centre on Monday - less than 24 hours after City lost 3-1 at Liverpool.</p>

      <p>"Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on. We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me.</p>
      <p>"This is why we play this sport because of our love for it - me and @joegomez5 are good we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing ... it's done, we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's get focus on our game on Thursday," Sterling said on his Instagram account.</p>
      <p>The FA has decided to drop Sterling from Thursday's EURO 2020 qualifier against Montenegro as a result of a "disturbance" in a private team area.</p>
      <p>Sterling, who has scored 12 goals in 55 England appearances, has been one of the first-team regulars under manager Gareth Southgate and scored twice in the recent 6-0 win to Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Last season, he was named Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association after scoring 25 goals in all competitions as City won a domestic treble of the Premier League title, League Cup and FA Cup.</p>
