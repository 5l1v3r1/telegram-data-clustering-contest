      <p>A top Scottish butcher renowned for its high quality and diverse product range has been announced as Scotch Lamb Butcher of the Year.</p>
      <p>Bathgate-based Hugh Black and Sons received the coveted title after presenting a range of high-quality products, with the judging panel left impressed at the innovation, interesting diversity of flavours as well as the quality of the Scotch Lamb PGI.</p>
      <p>There was further success as the butcher’s Hoisin Pulled Lamb received the Consumers Choice award, with judges feeling it would encourage people to try Scotch Lamb.</p>

      <p>The competition, run by Quality Meat Scotland’s Scotch Butchers Club as part of the ‘Scotch Lamb, Naturally’ campaign, aimed to recognise butchers with skills and a real passion for their jobs, who take pride in selling Scotch Lamb PGI.</p>
      <p>Butchers from the Scotch Butchers Club and the Scottish Craft Butchers who stock Scotch Lamb PGI were invited to enter their best and most innovative Scotch Lamb products into the competition. The products were judged by a team of chefs from the Scottish Chefs Federation, with those butchers shortlisted for a prize invited to an awards ceremony held at The Scottish Chef conference.</p>
      <p>

      <p>“We are absolutely delighted to have won the Scotch Lamb Butcher of the Year Award as well as the Consumer Choice Award,” said Mr Black.</p>
      <p>“We have been developing a range of new Scotch Lamb products which have received extremely positive feedback from our customers, so to win these awards is really the icing on the cake.”</p>
      <p>Hunters of Kinross received the Innovation of the Year award for their Lamb Bhuna and Mango Chutney sausage, which received high praise for its quality and execution, with the curry-filled sausage proving a hit with the judges. Hunters’ wider selection, which includes Italian Scotch Lamb’s Liver Casserole, Scotch Lamb Hot Pot Pie were also recognised for their originality.</p>

      <p>Lesley Cameron, marketing and communications director from Quality Meat Scotland said: “The Scotch Lamb Butcher of the Year Awards are one of the highlights of the butchery calendar, celebrating the work that goes on in creating high-quality and delicious Scotch Lamb PGI products.</p>
      <p>“A huge congratulations to our winners, who receive some well-deserved recognition for their impressive selection of innovative entries which demonstrated exceptional standards of quality, taste and flavours.”</p>
