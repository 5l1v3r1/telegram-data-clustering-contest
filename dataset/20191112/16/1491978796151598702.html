      <p>Gareth Southgate has spoken to the media about an altercation between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez which resulted in the Liverpool defender having a scratch below his right eye. Despite being removed from the team for England's game with Montenegro later in the week Sterling did train with the rest of the squad, alongside Gomez. Southgate insisted he felt 'love' for all his players and likened the squad and management to a family. 'All families have disagreements,' he said.</p>
