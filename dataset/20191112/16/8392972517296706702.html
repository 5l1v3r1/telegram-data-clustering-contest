      <p>Max wants to prove to Ruby he's serious about them, but what will she say when he pops the question in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>?</p>
      <p>Viewers know Max and Ruby have been dating for the past several months but the age gap has become more and more obvious to the businessman (and the viewers at home!)</p>
      <p>At the E20 on Thursday November 21 Max is left humiliated when a customer mistakes him for Ruby's dad instead of her boyfriend.</p>
