      <h2>Elena Whitham said the photo showed the "real me".</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:44:06+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Kilmarnock Standard, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/kilmarnock-standard/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>A councillor bravely shared a picture of the hair loss she has suffered since her mother died suddenly five years ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">East Ayrshire Council</a> depute leader Elena Whitham, 45, developed alopecia after her mother Irene McLeod died suddenly from lung cancer, aged only 58.</p>
      <p>Recalling the grief, she said: “She got a lung cancer diagnosis and was dead within five weeks. It was such a shock.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Within months I noticed what was happening with my hair.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Whitham has been wearing hairpieces but wants the freedom to go without them occasionally as sometimes they cause an allergic reaction.</p>
      <p>Having to wear a wig all the time has also been holding her back from going swimming and kayaking.</p>
      <p>She decided to fling it off and post a smiling photo on social media, saying: “Having alopecia sucks but this is the real me bald spots and wispy locks.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Councillor Whitham said: “I took the picture to send to my husband. I thought, ‘why not tell folk?’. I just did it on the spur of the moment.”</p>
      <p>The mum said there is too much emphasis on how women look in society.</p>

      <p>She said: “At 45 years old it feels there are so many things I could be worrying about. I feel I should not have to be worrying about this.”</p>
      <p>The Irvine Valley politician said husband Les has told her he finds her attractive and urged her to go without hairpieces at home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But the former Women’s Aid worker said it can be hard to “believe that until we get to the point were we accept it in ourselves”.</p>
      <p>She added: “I lost my hair when my mum died suddenly five years ago and only now am I comfortable enough with myself to show the world after I accepted my husband really does still fancy me.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Whitham has been inundated with good wishes and support online.</p>
