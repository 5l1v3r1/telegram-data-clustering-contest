      <h2>Cats Protection are appealing for financial help to help with this recovery.</h2>

      <p>Cats Protection are appealing for financial help after a stray cat was discovered in Larkhall with serious chemical burns.</p>
      <p>‘Taz’ is believed to have come into contact with chemicals, leaving him with severely burnt skin and fur.</p>
      <p>The charity’s Lanarkshire branch are now taking good care of him as he begins his long road to recovery, and are appealing for donations towards his vet bills.</p>
      <p>The three-year-old had been hanging around a local smallholding, where a kind lady had been feeding him.</p>
      <p>He disappeared for several weeks and when he turned up in a neighbour’s garden he was in a terrible state.</p>
      <p>The animal was rushed to the vets, where he was diagnosed with chemical burns.</p>
      <p>“We believe it is likely that he put his head into some kind of agricultural chemicals as he had been spotted on a local farm,” said branch co-ordinator Alex Thomson.</p>
      <p>“Taz has been taken in by one of our fosterers, who has been offering him plenty of TLC, as well as painstakingly applying anti-biotic cream to affected areas every day. This has been painful and difficult for him but he has learnt to trust her, and we are starting to see slight improvements.”</p>
      <p>Because of the severity of Taz’s injuries he requires ongoing vet treatment.</p>
      <p>Volunteers at the Lanarkshire Branch of Cats Protection are hoping that fellow cat-lovers will dig deep to donate after seeing Taz’s plight.</p>
      <p>Alex added: “We don’t often do public appeals, but this is a long-term and expensive case, but it is worth it as he is the most friendly and affectionate little guy you can imagine, despite his ordeal.” </p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to donate to Taz’s care should visit www.cats.org.uk/lanarkshire and click the donate button.</p>
      <p>Cats Protection’s Lanarkshire Branch is part of a national network of around 250 volunteer-run branches and 36 centres that help around 200,000 cats and kittens each year.</p>
