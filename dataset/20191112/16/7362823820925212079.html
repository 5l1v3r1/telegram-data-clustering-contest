      <p>Two-time World Series champion Johnny Damon said Monday he was happy to see the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> visit the White House and believes all athletes should follow suit.</p>
      <p>Damon told TMZ Sports that visiting the White House is the perfect time for players to voice their frustrations about “issues that you see and try to make things work.”</p>

      <p>“It’s a great time to talk and see what they’re really mad about,” the two-time World Series champion told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/11/johnny-damon-white-house-visit-washington-nationals/">TMZ Sports</a>. “Our economy is doing really well and you have to have tough skin against the world and I think we’re doing a great job, but things aren’t said the right way sometimes or how people want to hear them said."</p>
      <p>He added: "I think it’s a great time to sit down with the president and say ‘I don’t like what’s going on and this is what I do like’ and we can talk about it. Right now, no one is talking about it, they’re just hating on both sides. That’s the wrong way [to handle it].”</p>
