      <p>The brave mother of a Navan toddler who tragically passed away after battling a rare illness was inspired to get involved in a charity campaign to help sick and homeless children to honour her little girl's memory. Lorraine Nelson's daughter Millie was just 16 months old when she lost her fight to a non-spinal muscular atrophy type 1 related infection three years ago.</p>
      <p>The little girl was the only child in Ireland at the time diagnosed with the rare condition which causes wasting of voluntary muscles and impaired breathing. Lorraine says that although Christmas is an extremely difficult time for the mum of five and her family since losing her daughter, the charity toy appeal to ensure all homeless or sick children get a gift this Christmas has given her strength and focus.</p>
      <p>The appeal that now has an online community of 100,000 was started by a group of mums who wanted to make a difference.</p>
      <p>"I saw a post promoting the toy appeal online and I just knew I had to help. We only had one Christmas with Millie and all of our memories are in Crumlin Children's Hospital and The Ronald Mc Donald House where we spent a year living while Millie was intensive care so I know the importance of facilities like this. </p>

        <b>"She was amazing she had such a big personality. She took everything in her stride, she was always smiling." </b>
      </p>
      <p>"On Christmas day she was so ill that we couldn't even hold her. It was horrific. My husband Gary and I with our daughter Sophie and twin sons, Jake and Cody had Christmas dinner in the Ronald McDonald House with 12 other families.</p>
      <p>"Since she passed away I always wanted to buy a toy for a little girl that would be the same age as Millie but my stomach would feel sick as Christmas would get closer and I had great intentions but I just physically couldn't do it.</p>
      <p>"I reserved a doll and I went and collected it. When I finally did it I was so proud of myself but I think the only reason I did it was because of this toy appeal. I felt like I was doing something good and I was doing it in memory of Millie."</p>
      <p>"If I can do it in memory of my little girl who is not here anymore, other people should be able to do it just go out and buy a toy and donate it to a child in need."</p>
      <p>At just a few weeks old Millie was diagnosed with the rare illness and doctors advised her parents, Lorraine and Gary, to secure palliative care for their precious daughter but they refused to give up and, with the help of social media, secured non-invasive treatment from a respiratory specialist and access to a machine to help Millie’s breathing.</p>
      <p>"We were told to bring her home and make memories. I felt like I was standing in a nightmare but I wasn't going to give up on her. If we had listened to them, Millie would have only lasted a few weeks but Crumlin Children’s Hospital gave us the equipment we needed to manage the condition. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Towards the end of 2015, she turned a corner and we were planning to take her home when she suddenly became ill. She had an emergency operation and we were told that her blood clotted and that her organs were failing."</p>
      <p>Millie passed away in June 2016 but Lorraine and her family are determined to keep her memory alive. </p>
      <p>"I was in a dark hole for a long time afterwards. People say time is a healer but time is definitely not a healer to a parent who has lost a child. Not only are you grieving the loss of that child you are grieving their whole future as well. Millie would have been due to start school this year. I know a couple of other little girls who were born a couple of weeks after Millie and it's very hard seeing them.</p>
      <p>"She was amazing she had such a big personality. She took everything in her stride, she was always smiling, she loved Disney films. She loved all the princess things, dresses and bows in her hair.</p>
      <p>"Our youngest child Noah is now 16 months old and we believe that he was handpicked for us by his little sister.  Noah is full of energy and keeps me on my toes. I was only a young mum, but I became a grieving mum at 31. I felt like I had so much more love to give."</p>
      <p>In a heartbreaking turn of events, a treatment became available for Millie's condition a year after she passed away. </p>

      <p>"When it came out it was like reliving it all over again.  There were two little girls in Ireland who were diagnosed with SMA since Millie passed away. A mother of one of the little girls got in touch with me at the time.  I was so happy for those kids because all I ever wanted was for no child or parent to have to go through what we went through.</p>
      <p>"People ask how I get out of bed every morning after losing a child but at the end of the day, I have to. Millie was strong, she fought and fought, she wasn't given a choice, I have to do the same. I do feel that she gives me strength. I hope that she is looking down on me and is proud." </p>
      <p>All toys collected will be donated to about 100 charities across the country including Ronald McDonald House, Aoibheann's Pink Tie, women's refuges and hospices.</p>
      <p>People can donate their toys at Dunnes Stores Car Park in Navan on November 16th between 10 am and 1 pm </p>
      <p>Alternatively, they make a donation by searching for 'Mas on a Mission' GoFundMe.</p>
