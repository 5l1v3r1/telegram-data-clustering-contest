      <h1>Disney+ Experiences Connection Issues on Launch Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:35:40+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ is launching today and the <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/disney-updates-marvel-movies-available-to-stream-at-launch-1810098/">mega kickoff</a> is reportedly causing some connection issues across the U.S.</p>
      <p>The streaming service, which features many <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/11-obscure-movies-you-should-watch-on-disney-1809503/">movies and TV shows</a>, officially went live this morning. However, over the past couple of hours, Disney+ has been showing <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/disney-experiences-connection-issues-on-launch-day-1810197/">“unable to connect” errors</a> for many East Coast customers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20960956/disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error-streaming">The Verge reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Subscribers shared their error notifications on Twitter, which showed Mickey Mouse and Pluto in space or characters from <i>Wreck-It Ralph </i>playing with WiFi symbols and an “unable to connect to Disney+” message.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1194279620264071168?s=20">Disney+ responded to complaints on Twitter</a> and said they are “working quickly to resolve any current issues.” Disney Streaming Services also has teams overseeing the <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/the-mandalorian-series-premiere-recap-the-search-for-more-money-1810155/">Disney+ launch</a>, so hopefully customers can start watching their favorite Disney and Marvel flicks soon without any additional tech issues.</p>
