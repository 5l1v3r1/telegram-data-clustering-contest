      <p>The report by parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has been cleared by the security services but it has not yet been given approval for publication by Johnson's Downing Street office, meaning it is very unlikely to be released before a Dec 12 election.</p>
      <p>"It is absolutely normal that reports like this go through a period of vetting which does take several weeks," deputy finance minister Rishi Sunak told ITV.</p>
      <p>He said all donations to the Conservative party were transparent and fully in accordance with the rules.</p>
