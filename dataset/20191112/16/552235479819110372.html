      <p>A violent thug, who stabbed a friend in the neck during a heated argument, was today jailed for six years.</p>
      <p>Rodney Brannan, 45, of Plains' Bruce Street, admitted assaulting James McAvoy at his home on Aberfeldy Avenue in February, to the danger of his life.</p>
      <p>Brannan was originally charged with attempting to murder Mr McAvoy, but his guilty plea to the reduced charge was accepted.</p>
      <p>Judge Sean Murphy QC also ordered Brannan to be monitored in the community for three years after his release from prison.</p>
      <p>Judge Murphy told him: “Your victim has suffered a loss of confidence, fears strangers and is more or less housebound.</p>
      <p>“This was a form of revenge attack. You now have an opportunity to reform.”</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Jennifer Bain said: “Mr Brannan accepts full responsibility for his actions in attacking a long-standing friend. He is horrified by his behaviour.</p>
      <p>“The near death of a friend who was shot in front of him caused him to turn to alcohol, but this offence has been a wake up call for him.”</p>
      <p>The High Court in Glasgow heard that Brannan, Mr McAvoy and two other friends were having a drink at Mr McAvoy's home when the incident took place.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lindsey Dalziel said: “Another friend James Todd and the accused became involved in conversation which resulted in an argument.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“This escalated to a fight involving all parties during which Mr McAvoy grabbed a vodka bottle and struck the accused on the head.”</p>
      <p>As a result of this Brannan went into the kitchen and grabbed a knife and stuck it in Mr McAvoy's neck, causing him to fall to the ground</p>
      <p>The knife was taken from Brannan and thrown down on the hallway floor.</p>
      <p>Brannan has previous convictions relating to violence and using knives.</p>
      <p>Mr McAvoy managed to leave the house and called the police who arrived shortly after 10.30pm.</p>
      <p>Officers entered the house and arrested Brannan who was still there as Mr McAvoy was taken to Monklands Hospital.</p>
      <p>Mr McAvoy was found to be suffering from a stab wound to the left side of his neck and had bruising to his face.</p>
      <p>He was transferred to the Vascular Unit at Hairmyres Hospital and kept under observation for 24 hours .</p>
      <p>He did not require surgery because the wounds to his neck were sutured and he was discharged early the following month.</p>
      <p>When Brannan was originally charged with assaulting Mr McAvoy he told them “Not guilty.”</p>
