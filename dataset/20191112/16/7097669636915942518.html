        <li>The U.S. Air Force <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a28543381/x-37b/">wants the X-37B</a> space plane <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/11/08/air-force-wants-connect-stealth-fighters-secret-x-37-space-plane.html">to be able to connect to fighter jets</a>.</li>
        <li>It’s not clear what the Air Force has in mind.</li>
        <li>The space plane’s high vantage point could allow it to detect adversaries or pass data between jets at long ranges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The head of the U.S. Air Force wants to explore the idea of having the X-37B connect with fighter jets. It’s not clear what Chief of Staff General David Goldfein has in mind, but it could involve the space plane acting as a sensor platform, tracking targets below it. Alternately, it could act as a secure communications node between F-22 and F-35 fighters operating at a distance from one another.</p>
      <p>According to Military.com, Goldfein teased that he was interested in seeing how the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter could “connect” to the X-37B space plane. The F-22 and F-35 jets are two of the world’s first operational fifth-generation fighters, with built-in stealth, radars and advanced electro-optical sensors, and advanced communications capabilities.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://swfound.org/media/205879/swf_x-37b_otv_fact_sheet.pdf"><u>X-37B</u></a> is the world’s first unmanned, reusable spacecraft. The Air Force operates two X-37Bs and the latest mission <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a29609801/air-force-x37b-spaceplane-lands/"><u>spent 780 days in orbit</u></a>, a record for a reusable spacecraft. The Air Force will not discuss the spaceplane’s capabilities and missions and considering them secret.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear what the secret spaceplane can do for the two fighter jets. The X-37B typically operates at an altitude of 200 miles, while the fighters operate at an altitude of two to seven miles. One possibility is that the space plane could deploy a radar system that can look down and ahead of friendly fighters, spotting enemy targets and relaying their location to fighters below.</p>
      <p>There’s a problem with that idea. The X-37B generates power through a pair of solar panels that unfold after launch. The panels do not provide enough electricity to power long range radars, which typically require a power source in the kilowatt range. The X-37B would have to carry both the radar and a power supply, and its tiny cargo bay is about the size of the bed of a pickup truck. <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/radioisotope-thermoelectric-generator/"><u>Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators</u></a> (RTGs), a plutonium-based power source for satellites, don’t produce enough power, and compact nuclear power plants are still too big to fit.</p>
      <p>Another, more likely option is that the X-37B acts as a link between distant groups of fighters in the event the military’s existing satellite communications network is unavailable. The X-37B could relay key mission data among aircraft hundreds of miles apart, owing to its commanding position above the battlefield. However, an X-37B would only be available for a limited amount of time, as the spaceplane’s orbit takes it briefly over the aerial battlefield below and then over the horizon.</p>
      <p>The idea of space planes connecting to fighter jets is a neat one but it’s not clear what the Air Force has in mind. The service may just be interested in the ability of the three platforms: F-35, F-22, and X-37B, to simply talk to one other—or it could be something else entirely.</p>
