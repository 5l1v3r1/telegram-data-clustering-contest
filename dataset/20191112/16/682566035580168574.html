      <h1>Anger at late notice, price hike for Two Oceans 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:51:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Garrin Lambley - Sport24 Editor</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Two Oceans Marathon</b> appears to once again find itself in a state of chaos some 150 days out from its Easter Saturday running on April 11, 2020.</p>
      <p>Organisers on Tuesday finally <a href="https://www.twooceansmarathon.org.za/entry-info/entry-status/?fbclid=IwAR3oP_oKlqfgSGT_PIOiwJEEe4KFBj_VbU9U8QzptVfoEJG6F7z_gFdf0is">released information</a> regarding entries for the 56km ultra-marathon (still no news on Half-Marathon or Trail run entries) - giving potential runners fewer than 48 hours' notice until they open.</p>
      <p>Oh, and there was a nasty price hike shock to boot.</p>
      <p>According to the official website, entries for Blue numbers (runners who have completed 10 or more ultras) and Yellow numbers (runners running their 10th ultra) will open at 10:00 on Thursday, November 14.</p>
      <p>Entries will cost R600 - up 20% on last year's R500 fee.</p>
      <p>Also opening on Thursday at 10:00 will be Africa (rest of the continent) entries (at R750) and International entries - at a staggering R2 100.</p>
      <p>Everyone else (South Africans with eight or fewer finishers) will have to wait until 10:00 on Monday, November 18 to enter and those entries will go into a <b>ballot</b>. Entries will close on Monday, November 25 at 17:00.</p>
      <p>Ballot entries essentially make securing one's spot in the 13 000-strong field, a lottery.</p>
      <p>The Two Oceans has been fraught with disaster in recent years.</p>
      <p>Old Mutual didn't renew its headline sponsorship deal following this year's race, nor did technical sponsors from 2019, Adidas.</p>
      <p>With less than five months until race day, the country's second biggest ultra-marathon remains without a title sponsor.</p>
      <p>Not lost on the running community is the fact that Comrades 2020 entries have already opened - and sold out - for a race scheduled for two months <b>after</b> the Two Oceans!</p>
      <p>The 2019 edition of the Two Oceans was plagued by organisational issues with complaints prior to the race regarding the shortage of pre-ordered T-shirts and long queues at the Expo, and post-race due to the <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/two-oceans-organisers-sorry-for-running-out-of-water-20190425">lack of water</a> on offer.</p>
      <p>In addition to reports of unpaid bills for services rendered which ended up in the hands of the CCMA, race organisers were forced into an 11th-hour change of route due to the "real and credible" threat of <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/threat-of-protest-action-sees-late-change-to-two-oceans-route-20190419">protest action</a> in the Hout Bay Imizamo Yethu informal settlement area just short of the marathon mark.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/two-oceans-organisers-sorry-for-running-out-of-water-20190425">Relay Race</a> - which was a late inclusion into this year's programme to generate additional funds - was also cancelled.</p>
      <p>It's unclear whether organisers have seen fit to approach the Imizamo Yethu community to discuss the possibility of a repeat threat - or if a change in route is being contemplated.</p>
      <p>Organisers were also forced to apologise for <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/two-oceans-organisers-apologise-for-running-out-of-medals-20190425">running out of certain medals</a> after numerous complaints.</p>
      <p>There was also outrage among those wishing to watch what as the 50th edition of the iconic race on TV after SABC <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/OtherSport/Athletics/outrage-as-two-oceans-wont-be-screened-on-tv-20190417">bailed on screening the race</a> for the first time in decades. The lack of TV exposure is understandably another reason potential sponsors are reluctant to put pen to paper.</p>
      <p>The running community predictably reacted with anger at Tuesday's entry announcement with the lack of correspondence via social media - and general haphazard handling of affairs - being the major gripe.</p>
      <p>One hopes newly appointed race director Debra Barnes is able, in a limited time frame, to pull a rabbit out the hat and appease a host of disgruntled athletes.</p>
