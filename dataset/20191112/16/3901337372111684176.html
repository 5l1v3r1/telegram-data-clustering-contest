      <h1>Pitso Throws Gauntlet – Warns Chiefs, Pirates</h1>

      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane disputes suggestions that only Kaizer Chiefs are their direct rivals in the Absa Premiership title race. </p>
      <p>Amakhosi shot up 10 points clear of the reigning champions at the weekend following their victory in the Soweto Derby, while Sundowns suffered only their second defeat of the season away to Golden Arrows. </p>

      <p>But Mosimane argued it isn’t just Chiefs they are competing with – making the point that in six years, the Brazilians have won the title four times while in the race with Bidvest Wits and Orlando Pirates. </p>
      <p><b>“</b>Yes, Chiefs have the edge and it’s true because they are winning. If you say how, then that is your issue. But they are winning and taking their chances,” the coach told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We have 15 teams as our rivals, not just Chiefs. Wits are our rivals, Pirates are our rivals, so is SuperSport United and all the other teams. And those you don’t mention have shown they are our rivals. So Chiefs is not our direct arrivals.”</p>
      <p>Mosimane also called for calm as Downs have gone through a slump, having lost two of their previous three league games. </p>
      <p>“I don’t want to focus on Chiefs. We ran a race for six years and have won the league four times. With Chiefs, Wits and Pirates for the last two years. We are running races my friend and we are happy to run races and lose them sometimes and sometimes we win them. It’s ok. We have a bigger programme than any other team in the PSL, so we can’t be emotional about this game,” said Mosimane.</p>
