      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/milwaukee-bucks">Milwaukee Bucks</a> star Giannis Antetokounmpo appeared to be extremely unhappy with his performance Sunday night against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> despite scoring 36 points in a win.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo, who was named league MVP last season, tore his jersey after airballing a free throw in the second quarter and then kicked a hole through a sign that featured the Thunder logo.</p>

      <p>The “Greek Freak” airballed the free throw with about seven seconds left in the first half. He was then seen on the sideline biting into the top of his jersey and then ripping it.</p>

      <p>A picture that came across social media during the game also showed a hole in a sign with the Thunder’s logo. Apparently, Antetokounmpo put his size 16 shoe through it.</p>

      <p>He later apologized for taking his frustrations out on the sign.</p>
      <p>“There’s no excuse for that,” he said. “Obviously, I’ll try to pay for the sign or I can trade you guys with a Bucks sign when you guys come to Milwaukee, but there’s no excuse for that.”</p>
