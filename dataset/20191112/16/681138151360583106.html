      <p>Mr Millar, who is a member of both Suffolk County Council and West Suffolk Council, will be defending a seat that was held by the Conservatives with a majority of 635 over Labour in 2017.</p>
      <p>However Conservative MP Guto Bebb left the party earlier this year and has been sitting as an Independent.</p>
      <p>Mr Millar won the nomination to fight the seat after telling Conservative members in the constituency that he was the "local candidate."</p>
      <p>He was born and educated in Bangor which is only just outside the constituency although he has lived in Newmarket for many years.</p>

      <p>However he has kept his links with his home area - and his new profile page reveals that he is renovating his house in Snowdonia.</p>
      <p>He has released a Youtube video introducing himself to the voters of Aberconwy - which includes the towns of Llandudno, Conwy, Llanwyst and Betws-Y-Coed which all have important tourist industries.</p>
      <p>A former deputy leader of Forest Heath Council, he was also a member of Suffolk County Council's cabinet until early in 2018.</p>

      <p>If Mr Millar is successful in the <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/news/2019-general-election-timeline-1-6359692"><b>election on December 12</b></a>, he would be expected to stand down from his council seats in Suffolk - it is highly unusual for MPs to remain a councillor after election to parliament, especially if they have moved to another part of the country.</p>
      <p>Another candidate with Suffolk connections who has a realistic hope of winning a seat in Parliament is Daisy Cooper, who came second to Dr Therese Coffey in Suffolk Coastal in 2010.</p>
      <p>She is now Liberal Democrat candidate in St Albans in Hertfordshire, one of their key targets in the south east of England.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives had a majority of more than 6,000 in 2017, but it is a strong remain seat - 63% of voters in the borough voted to stay in the EU in 2016 and pollsters suggest the Liberal Democrats are favourites to take the seat.</p>

      <p>However one high-profile politician with local links who seems unlikely to return to Westminster after the general election is former Justice Secretary David Gauke.</p>
      <p>The Ipswich-born former Northgate student had the Conservative whip removed from him after voting against the government for parliament to seize control of the Brexit process in September.</p>
      <p>He was not one of those who had the whip restored at the end of the parliament, so was unable to stand as the Conservative candidate in South West Hertfordshire - a seat he had held since 2005.</p>
      <p>Mr Gauke has still not said whether he will stand as an Independent in the election - but if he has any ambitions to return to the Conservative fold in the future that looks unlikely.</p>
