      <p>Familiar faces are popping up left, right and centre across Soapland at the moment and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> newcomer Tara is another one.</p>
      <p>Tara is the marketing manager of Freshco supermarket.</p>
      <p>She appeared in Monday night's episodes of the soap (November 11) to visit Gemma and Chesney.</p>

      <p>Gemma<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-overjoyed-as-gemma-safely-delivers-quads/"> has just given birth to quads</a> and the supermarket want the four babies to be the face of their new marketing campaign: The Freshco Four!</p>
      <p>Tara visited Gemma and Chesney at their hotel in Wales to set out the company's offer.</p>
      <p>But fans who thought Tara looked familiar would probably have seen her most recently in BBC drama Keeping Faith.</p>

      <p>The show's second series premiered earlier this year and actress Catherine Ayers, who plays Tara, starred as lead character Faith Howells' (Eve Myles) best mate, Lisa Connors.</p>
      <p>Lisa was in the first series and the second series and was a regular fixture and source of support and comfort to Faith as she searched for her missing husband.</p>
      <p>The Welsh actress is also known for an episode of Ordinary Lies, as well as Welsh language soap Pobol y Cwm.</p>

      <p>Although Gemma initially turned down Tara's offer, it looks like the family will be forced to reconsider - meaning Tara will most likely pop up again.</p>
      <p>After the quads were transferred to Weatherfield General, Gemma and Chesney checked out of their Llandudno hotel, only to later be hit by a bill for £500 for 'extras'.</p>

      <p>It turned out Gemma's mum Bernie had raided the mini bar in the room more than once and when confronted claimed she thought the booze she'd stolen was free.</p>
      <p>Left needing to find the cash, Gemma and Chesney will meet with Tara again on Wednesday (November 13) and sign on the dotted line when they are offered a whopping £60k.</p>
      <p>Despite Bernie wanting to splash out on a holiday, Gemma puts her foot down, determined to use the funds to provide for her children's future.</p>
