      <p>PORTSMOUTH, Va. – An Uber driver did more than just get riders to their destination Saturday night. <a href="https://wtkr.com/2019/11/12/uber-driver-helps-teenage-boy-shot-in-portsmouth/">She helped a teenage boy who was shot.</a></p>
      <p>Cheryl Jagow had pulled into a Royal Farms store in Chesapeake, Virginia, around 9 p.m. Saturday. She had just dropped off a rider and went into the business to stretch her legs and get something to eat.</p>
      <p>In the parking lot, she noticed two teen boys acting strange but she didn’t think anything of it until she was getting ready to leave.</p>
      <p>“I rolled down my window and I was like ‘Baby, whats going on?' ” Jagow explained. “He was like, 'I just got shot.' I went into full-fledged mommy mode, full force, right there. I put him down on the ground, took his belt off, tied it around his ankle, and took his shoe off. He was shot in the foot.”</p>
      <p>As she was helping the teen that was shot, she instructed the other teen to go into her car and find her cellphone. He called 9-1-1.</p>
      <p>“By the time the officers and paramedics came, I was covered in blood, it was all over my clothes. I was sitting in a pile of grease,” she said.</p>
      <p>Although the Royal Farms is located in Chesapeake, Portsmouth Police say the shooting happened in their city. They were unable to provide a specific location to WTKR.</p>
      <p>Police say the 15-year-old was taken to the hospital for non-life threatening injuries. Jagow fears his injuries could have been worse had she not stopped to help.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad that I was there to be able to help him because a lot of people would look the other way,” she said.</p>
      <p>Portsmouth Police are still investigating the shooting.</p>
