      <p>Have you wondered why those who sought Africa’s well-being and refused to take different kinds of inducements for their countries to be raped died early?</p>
      <p>Now flip the coin. Ironically, the African leaders doing the bidding of their pay masters and undermine the interest of the masses live relatively long?</p>
      <p>Take Burkina Faso’s patriotic leader, <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/thomas-sankara-was-killed-32-years-ago-but-africa-continues-to-betray-the-beautyful-ones12">Thomas Sankara</a> for instance, he was dead by 37 years, assassinated by former colleagues led by Blaise Compaoré who is a known African agent of France or rather bluntly a puppet of the French. Compaoré himself years later will be ousted from power by the masses.</p>

      <p>There is <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/celebrating-patrice-lumumbas-birthday-with-10-of-his-greatest-quotes">Patrice Émery Lumumba</a>, Congolese politician and independence leader, who served as the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until September 1960. He was assassinated on January 17, 1961 by Belgian forces aided by local secessionist politicians with cover by the United Nations and support from the U.S. He was just 35 years. His crime being he wouldn’t be part neither will he look on for the continuous plunder of Congo’s wealth to develop Belgium, especially and other European nations.</p>
      <p>For those who managed to escape the various attempts on their lives to relatively get old, the long arm of the neocolonialist eventually catches up and snuffs the life out of these national leaders.</p>

      <p>Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah survived bomb attacks as well as poisoning efforts, but in the end injuries from the Kulungugu – bomb attack from opposition elements with foreign pay masters behind – and prostate cancer killed Africa’s leading light of the millennium in a lonely Bucharest hospital aged 63.</p>

      <p>Then there is <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-gaddafi-gaddafi-rejects-it">Muammar Gadhafi </a>who died at 69 at the hands of NATO forces and their local rebel fighters opposed to Gadhafi’s rule.</p>
      <p>In contrast, however, <b>Face2face Africa</b> looks at three dictators imposed on African states till their western backers found them not fit for purpose grew to ripe ages before dying.</p>
