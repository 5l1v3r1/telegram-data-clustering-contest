      <p><b>COFFEE CHIC:</b> A.P.C. is branching out into coffee.</p>
      <p>Following the footsteps of <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/exclusive-maison-kitsune-debuts-first-restaurant-1203295213/">Maison Kitsuné</a> and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/jacquemus/">Jacquemus</a> — who have both <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/jacquemus-opens-new-restaurant-oursin-galeries-lafayette-champs-elysees-1203312287/">opened restaurants in Paris this year</a> — the ready-to-wear brand is the latest label to add hospitality to its range.</p>
      <p>From Nov. 20 to Jan. 31, A.P.C. will take over the Galerie Joyce near the Palais-Royal garden in the 1st arrondissement of <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/paris-2/">Paris</a> where it will install a pop-up coffee shop.</p>
      <p>All the drinks on the menu will be made with the brand’s own blend of beans, the Moka, which will also be available to purchase on site.</p>
      <p>“There won’t be a choice. Having a choice makes you worry,” A.P.C. founder and creative director Jean Touitou said in a statement. “Not having one creates a kind of peace of mind. I like to trust others and I would like others to trust us for the choice of this coffee origin.”</p>
      <p>The designer also came up with a capsule collection sold at the pop-up coffee shop, featuring a T-shirt, a tote bag and a thermos bearing the Café A.P.C. logo, made up of the word “CAFE” with its “A” turned upside down.</p>
      <p>The space will also host events: From Jan. 8, visitors of the Café A.P.C. will be able to take in an exhibition of the brand’s archives by Jessica Ogden.</p>
