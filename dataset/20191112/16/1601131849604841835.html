      <h1>Samsung TV True Fit uses AR to let you see which TV model fits your wall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:55:57+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>If you’re in the market for a new <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/tv/">Samsung TV</a> and you reside in Canada then you’re in for an <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/augmented-reality/">augmented reality</a> treat. A new AR-based mobile app called Samsung TV True Fit allows you to see which one of Samsung’s TVs would be the perfect fit for your room.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, Samsung TV True Fit is neither a first-party app (which explains the use of an iPhone in the video below) nor is it a third-party app. It’s technically a second-party app developed by Gravity Jack at Samsung’s request, even though it could have probably been a part of <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/bixby-vision/">Bixby Vision</a> along with existing AR features like <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-reminds-us-of-the-best-galaxy-note-10-bixby-vision-features/">Home décor</a>. In any case, Samsung TV True Fit is published on the Play Store (and Apple Store) by Gravity Jack but the app is approved by Samsung.</p>
      <h3>Samsung TV True Fit lets you search for nearby retailers</h3>
      <p>The AR aspect of Samsung TV True Fit is quite self-explanatory. Users can select the desired Samsung TV model and point the phone’s camera at the wall or stand to see how the device would fit. Augmented reality TV models can be placed automatically by the app, or manually by the user who can then move the AR object around the room.</p>

      <p>‘<i>Through the app, consumers will have an opportunity to truly discover our lineup of big-screen TVs and expand their viewing experience</i>‘ said the VP of Sales and Marketing of Home Entertainment at Samsung Canada, Pat Bugos. And indeed, the app not only has an AR element but can also guide users to the nearest Samsung TV retailer in their area.</p>
      <p>Samsung TV True Fit is currently available only in Canada via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.samsungartv&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a> and readers can grab it by hitting the link. At the moment, it’s unclear if the app will launch in other markets or through the Galaxy Store, but we’ll keep you posted if we find out more.</p>
