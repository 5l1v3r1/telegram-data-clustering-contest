      <h1>Newcastle striker Andy Carroll loses battle to build double gazebo at £4.1m Essex mansion</h1>
      <h2>The former England international's plans were rejected by Epping Forest Council as they dubbed the structure 'alien' and said it would be 'considered harmful'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:27:19+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Andy Carroll has been dealt a blow off the pitch with the news that his proposal to build a double gazebo in his Essex mansion has been rejected.</p>
      <p>The structure would have been around 25ft-long and divided into three sections, including a bar, BBQ and TV area.</p>
      <p>However, the council have not allowed the construction to go ahead, and a decision notice by Epping Forest District Council read: "The proposed structures are considered harmful to the special character of the listed house and its setting by reasons of their location, size and general appearance.</p>
      <p>"The proposed structures would look alien at this location."</p>

      <p>Carroll bought the mansion from legendary singer Sir Rod Stewart in May, and the stunning six-bedroom house has a full-size football pitch, swimming pool, tennis courts and boating lake.</p>
      <p>Planning documents submitted about Carroll's plans had stated: "The owner Mr Andy Carroll would like to put a solid oak gazebo in his rear garden and also a solid oak gazebo/porch.</p>
      <p>"The gazebo will be located in the garden at the rear of the property which is a solid oak free standing structure which is not connected to the house.</p>
      <p>"The oak gazebo and oak gazebo/porch are free standing structures and are not fixed to the house in any way.</p>

      <p>"Mr Andy Carroll would like to use oak to keep in character of the grounds being woodlands and fields."</p>
      <p>Carroll moved back to his boyhood club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> United over the summer following seven years at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , but has so far failed to score on his return to the Magpies after six Premier League appearances, and has yet to play a full 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>He is a cult hero at the club, however, after scoring 33 goals in 91 games in his first spell at the club between 2006-2011, before signing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> for £35m.</p>
