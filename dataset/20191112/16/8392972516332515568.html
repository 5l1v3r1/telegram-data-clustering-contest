      <p>Royal experts have claimed that the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-harry/">Duke</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/">Duchess of Sussex</a> may "skip Christmas with the Queen" and spend the holidays in America instead.</p>
      <p>The royal family – including <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a>, wife Kate and their three children – traditionally spend the festive period with the monarch at her Sandringham home.</p>
      <p>The couple and their young son Archie are heading Stateside soon for a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/meghan-markle/meghan-and-prince-harry-plan-to-take-six-weeks-off-before-christmas/">six-week break</a> from both the limelight and royal duties.</p>
