      <h1>Irish Water admits breaking environmental laws after 2018 Malahide incident</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:10:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/tom-tuite/" target="_blank">By Tom Tuite</a></address>
      <p>Irish Water has admitted breaking environmental laws over an incident Malahide marina in Dublin.</p>
      <p>The company was accused of offences under the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 at Strand Road, Malahide, Co. Dublin on April 28, 2018 and on the following day.</p>
      <p>The case has been brought at by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and was before Dublin District Court today.</p>
      <p>Irish Water pleaded guilty to two charges: for not taking corrective actions, and not notifying the EPA about the incident as soon as practicable</p>
      <p>The EPA withdrew a third charge for not having emergency response procedures in place that addressed any emergency situation on site.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting solicitor Jason Teahan told Judge Anthony Halpin the case related to an incident at Malahide marina.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Eoghan Cole confirmed Irish Water was pleading guilty to the first two charges.</p>
      <p>Judge Halpin adjourned the case until December 18 for the prosecution facts and the defence mitigation plea to be heard.</p>
      <p>Last month the national water company pleaded guilty in another EPA prosecution over drinking water problems in Co. Cork. Judge Halpin has adjourned that case for facts, and a mitigation plea, to be given at a sentence hearing on January 8 next.</p>
      <p>In that prosecution, it faces charges following a direction given on June 5, 2015 by the EPA in respect of supply of drinking water at Drimoleague and Kealkill.</p>
      <p>It was alleged Irish Water failed to submit final reports to the EPA before the end of 2018, verifying that trihalomethanes (THMs) levels were not excessive.</p>
      <p>THMs, which can have a can have possible carcinogenic effects if consumed over long periods, are bi-product of chlorination to disinfect ground water which makes its way into the supply.</p>
