      <p>Big update, Rick and Morty fans!</p>
      <p>The beloved animated sci-fi comedy is returning earlier than previously thought, with the Adult Swim series having its release date brought forward by UK home Channel 4.</p>
      <p>The Adult Swim series returned on US television on November 10, 2019, but UK fans have had to wait a little long, but thankfully, much less than we previously thought.</p>
      <p>The five new episodes will air as the first half of the fourth season, but the second half is due in 2020.</p>
      <p>So, when can we watch the new episodes of Rick and Morty on E4?</p>
