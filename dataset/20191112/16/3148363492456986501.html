      <h1>Bernie Sanders: Mandatory AR-15 Buybacks are 'Unconstitutional'</h1>
      <h2>During a campaign stop in Charles City, Iowa, Democrat presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders denounced mandatory gun buybacks as “unconstitutional.”</h2>

      <p>Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/bernie-sanders-gun-buyback-confiscation-iowa-rally">reports</a> Sanders was asked about “mandatory buybacks of AR15s and AK47s,” and he responded:</p>
      <blockquote>I don’t support — a mandatory buyback is essentially confiscation, which I think is unconstitutional. It means that I am going to walk into your house and take something whether you like it or not. I don’t think that stands up to constitutional scrutiny.</blockquote>
      <p>Sanders still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salT-_Db-Ro&amp;feature=emb_logo">voiced support</a> for an “assault weapons” ban at the federal level and observed “we need to greatly expand background checks.”</p>
      <p>He  also called for an expansion of the list of prohibited firearm purchasers, closure of the so-called “gun show loophole,” and more regulations on straw purchasing.</p>
