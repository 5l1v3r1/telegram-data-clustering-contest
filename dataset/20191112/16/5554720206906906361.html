      <p>The question for Rs 1 crore was to name the first British satellite to be launched by a British rocket. After exercising his last remaining lifeline 50:50, Kumar was left with two options namely Prospero and Miranda. He immediately answered ‘Prospero,’ but Bachchan warned him about the consequences if his answer was wrong.</p>
      <p>This made him nervous and as Kumar paused for a long time to reconsider his answer. His wife, who was sitting in the audience, was about to have a nervous breakdown. But Kumar, who impressed everyone by confidently answering all his questions remained steadfast and asked Bachchan to lock ‘Prospero.’</p>
      <p>Bachchan told Jha that he was blown away by his intelligence and confidence. He jokingly asked, “Please tell me how much I will get as my share from your prize money?”</p>
      <p>He added, “I’ve run out of words to congratulate you. All words are less in comparison to your intelligence.”</p>
      <p>Bachchan announced that he had just won Rs 1 crore.</p>
      <p>Kumar has become the third contestant from Bihar to win Rs 1 crore this season.
