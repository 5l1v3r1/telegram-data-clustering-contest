      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:08:05+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Ayrshire Post, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ayrshire-post/</a></address>
      <p>The Ayrshire Bulls made their bow in front of almost 1400 fans at Millbrae on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And although the new semi-pro side suffered defeat in their first FOSROC Super6 league match, it was a thumbs up from all in attendance.</p>
      <p>The fabulous family day was enjoyed by all - and now the Bulls are ready to do it all again this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Peter Murchie's side are back in action against the Boroughmuir Bears, with a 3pm kick off.</p>
      <p>And you could be there to see them live, courtesy of this Ayrshire Post competition.</p>
      <p>We have TWO family passes to give away (two adults and up to four children) for the big match.</p>
      <p>To be in with a chance of winning, simply tell us who is the coach of the Ayrshire Bulls?</p>
      <p>Email your answer along with your name, postcode and email address to sport@ayrshirepost.co.uk using the subject "Bulls Competition".</p>
      <p>Entries close at 5pm on Thursday.</p>
