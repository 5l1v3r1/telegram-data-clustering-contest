      <p>(Reuters) - CBS Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/CBS.N">CBS.N</a>) fell short of Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as a 19-day carriage dispute with AT&amp;T Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/T.N">T.N</a>) pressured advertising sales during the period.</p>
      <p>Shares of CBS and sister company Viacom Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/VIAB.O">VIAB.O</a>) were down more than 3% in morning trading.</p>
      <p>CBS stations went dark for more than 6.5 million DirecTV, DirecTV Now and AT&amp;T U-verse customers in at least 14 U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, before CBS and AT&amp;T signed a new content carriage agreement on Aug. 8.</p>
      <p>Sales from advertising, which was also hurt by the timing of the broadcast of certain sporting events, fell 6.8% to $1.18 billion in the quarter from a year earlier. The year-ago period was boosted by the 2018 U.S. midterm elections related ads.</p>
      <p>The distributor of renowned shows such as “The Twilight Zone” and “NCIS” reported an 11.5% increase in its affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from cable, satellite and online distributors, to $1.12 billion.</p>
      <p>CBS is in the process of re-uniting with Viacom to create a larger multi-platform content company and re-make media mogul Sumner Redstone’s U.S. entertainment empire at a time of intensifying streaming wars. The merger would bring in an expansive slate of over 3,600 movies and 140,000 television episodes for ViacomCBS Inc.</p>
      <p>Net earnings fell to $319 million, or 85 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $488 million, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Adjusted earnings came in at 95 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 92 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>CBS posted a 1% rise in revenue to $3.30 billion, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $3.36 billion.</p>
