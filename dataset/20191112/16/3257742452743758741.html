      <p>The Jamf management suite now has a new enrollment experience for more easily adding new members of staff and their Apple devices. It also improved accessibility support, and provides single sign-on support with Jamf Connect.<br/><br/>Similarly, a mobile system called Jamf Connect was announced, extending the idea of a single identity per staff member, to mobile devices. On stage, Jamf demoed being able to log in to a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Windows">Windows</a> PC by using <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Face+ID">Face ID</a> on an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPhone">iPhone</a>. An iPhone is now able to replicate both a FIDO Security Key and smart card for authentication without passwords.</p>
      <h3>Specific user cases</h3>
      <p>For schools, Jamf has announced new teacher-facing features such as the ability to create an ad-hoc classroom, create better lesson plans, and filter content.<br/><br/>Jamf Pro for administrators in education saw the release of a new app workflow that allows teachers to streamline a way to request new <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iOS">iOS</a> apps for their classrooms. This easily allows educators to request an app, for IT to immediately receive the request, and then be able to act on that request.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Using the new Jamf Connect for mobile, large <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iPad">iPad</a> deployments for schools is also now easier than ever and simplifies the provisioning process.<br/><br/>Last year at JNUC 2018 <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/10/24/jamf-launches-setup-and-reset-apps-to-assist-in-iphone-ipad-deployments">Jamf debuted Setup and Reset</a> to assist in iPhone and iPad deployments.</p>
      <h3>Jamf Protect</h3>
      <p>Available now to United States-based customers, the newly announced Jamf Protect is built on Apple's native security tools such as <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/XProtect">XProtect</a> and <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Gatekeeper">Gatekeeper</a> and extends them to organization administrators. Admins are now able to receive real-time alerts from their deployed Macs regarding any important security alerts.<br/><br/>"As Mac continues to grow in the enterprise, a security solution focused on increasing an organization's Mac security posture is needed more than ever," said Dean Hager, CEO, Jamf. "We're excited to bring the same Apple expertise to security that we've brought to device management, and continue to fulfill our mission of helping organizations succeed with Apple." <br/><br/>When an alert comes in they can proactively block, isolate, and take further action on a potential threat. There is secure, granular control over what data is collected and where it is sent which can include an existing SIEM.<br/><br/>Jamf Protect utilizes minimal device resources which reduces the machine's load and yields happy end-users.</p>

"By certifying its product with CIS, Jamf has demonstrated its commitment to actively solve the foundational problem of ensuring standard configurations are used throughout a given enterprise."</p>
