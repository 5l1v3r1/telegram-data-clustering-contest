      <p>The latest trailer for the <i>Harley Quinn</i> animated series has a clear focus on an important issue facing many women today: Supervillain workplace empowerment.</p>
      <p>Harley isn’t just pissed that the Joker doesn’t love her, she’s tired of playing second fiddle in schemes as well. She’s gonna form her own gang of other supervillains nobody believes can do the job, like King Shark and Doctor Psycho.</p>
