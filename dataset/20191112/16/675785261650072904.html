      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:01:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:01</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>It's the most wonderful time of the year - for retailers to push their products on us.</p>
      <p>But, as we get in the festive spirit, we do love to see a good <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> advert and many shops have been releasing their campaigns for the 2019 yuletide season.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/marks-spencer">M&amp;S</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boots">Boots</a> , there is bound to be an advert that tickles your fancy.</p>
      <p>Whether it's dancing vegetables, a Dickensian adventure, or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mariah-carey">Mariah Carey</a> singing with crisps, there's something for everyone.</p>
      <p>Failing that, we do have old faithfuls like the "Holidays Are Coming" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coca-cola">Coca-Cola</a> advert to get you in the mood.</p>
      <p>So, here are the best Christmas adverts of 2019 so far.</p>
      <h3>Best Christmas adverts 2019</h3>
      <h3>Sainsbury's</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>One of the country's leading supermarkets goes old-school with a Dickensian-themed ad entitled "Nicholas the Sweep" which tells a "totally true story."</p>
      <p>With snow, a tongue-in-cheek tone, and some cute kids delivering the true meaning of Christmas, more what could you want from a Christmas ad?</p>
      <h3>M&amp;S</h3>
      <p>Of course, the chicest of all the ads has to be the Christmas advert for M&amp;S which is all about the Jumpers, with some nice knitwear in some joyful dance sequences - set to House of Pain's "Jump Around", appropriate to most households this season.</p>
      <h3>Asda</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, supermarket Asda also goes down the child actor route with their "Let's Make Christmas Extra Special" ad, which sees one girl and her brother deliver some festive magic to their neighbourhood - with fantastical results and some beloved Yuletide cliches.</p>
      <h3>Aldi</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, everyone's favourite price-friendly supermarket has the most family-friendly advert which shows a carrot facing mob-attack from a gang of sprouts before managing to break out into song, delivering "Let Me Entertain You" by Robbie Williams, as it is surrounded by all the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas-dinner">Christmas dinner</a> trimmings.</p>
      <p>We're hungry already.</p>
      <h3>Boots</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>High street regular Boots have also launched a chatty new campaign with Bootiques by Boots with the hashtag #GiftLikeYouGetThem, which highlights some very modern issues that are faced when buying gifts at Christmas, with one person in the funny video saying "Why is gifting so problematic?"</p>
      <p>Boots make clear they offer diverse shopping this Christmas.</p>
      <h3>TK Maxx</h3>
      <p>The off-price retailer’s energetic campaign is fronted by a retro daredevil gifter, appropriately named "TK", who is on a mission to switch off his standard shopping habits and do something a little different this year.</p>
      <p>TK Maxx's Christmas message features the festive voice of Love, Actually star Bill Nighy while Kerry Shale narrates the journey and delivers the daredevil's tongue in cheek monologue.</p>
      <h3>John Lewis</h3>
      <p>We don't have the John Lewis Christmas ad yet, but we just know it'll be an instant classic and the most-talked about ad of the year. They always are!</p>
      <h3>Walkers</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>Can you get more Christmassy than Mariah Carey? Probably not. Besides, seeing Mariah deliver her classic All I Want For Christmas Is You whilst taking the tiniest nibble of Walkers crisps is instantly flawless. We just wish Gary Lineker made it in the ad.</p>
      <h3>Coca-Cola</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>The classic. The icon. The symbol of capitalist Christmas.  We wouldn't take the sheer wonder of this ad any other way.</p>
