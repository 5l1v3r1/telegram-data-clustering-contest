      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:29:26+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>An appeal has been launched after a veteran was set upon by thugs in a "sickening" attack on Remembrance Day.</p>
      <p>The senseless beating happened near to the Village Inn at approximately 11pm and staff raced to the aid of the injured man after he sought refuge in the pub.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Manager at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> pub, Diane Grant, said she was "sick to the stomach" when she saw the footage captured on the premises' CCTV cameras.</p>
      <p>"I have worked in pubs for a long time and I have never seen anything as vicious as this, I felt physically sick," she told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride News.</a></p>
      <p>"We desperately need to catch the thugs who did this.</p>
      <p>"The victim was crossing the road at the lights outside when he was set upon by two men, who looked as if they were in their 30s.</p>
      <p>"It looked as if it was completely unprovoked  - they just set about him, kicking him and punching him about the face and head, stamping on him even when he was lying on the ground.</p>
      <p>"He had all his medals on and and a beret and was clearly a veteran. I don't know if something was said about the medals, I really don't know what set it off. Apparently he had a few drinks in Legends, there was nothing amiss and he left without any problems."</p>
      <p>She went on: "The attackers are absolute animals and need to be caught and locked up. How anyone could do this I just don't know. It was absolutely horrendous.</p>
      <p>"When the poor man came in to the pub for help he was in an awful state, his face was an absolute mess and the girls and I tried to do what we could to clean him up and see the extent of the cuts.</p>
      <p>"He didn't want an ambulance or to go to the hospital  but eventually one of our customers phoned his wife who came and said she was taking the man to hospital, but I am not sure what happened after that."</p>
      <p>The News contacted Police Scotland for comment but they failed to respond.</p>
