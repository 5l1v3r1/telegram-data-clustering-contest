          <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> senior race engineer Dave Robson has confirmed that reserve driver Nicholas Latifi will be given his last outing in free practice of 2019 at the Brazilian Grand Prix in place of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> in FP1.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Going into the penultimate race of 2019 Robson’s decision to put Latifi in place of Kubica for FP1 is to gather his “help” for setting up the cars at Interlagos, one of the demanding circuits on the Formula 1 calendar.<br/> <br/><i>“Nicholas will drive Robert’s car in FP1 at this event for his final free practice outing of the season,” </i>said Robson.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“We look forward to Nicholas’s help in setting up the car for this demanding circuit. </i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“In addition to the normal qualifying and race preparation, we will also look at several test items as we continue our build-up to the 2020 season.”</i><br/> <br/>The Canadian, who is second in the Formula 2 championship with one race left to go in Abu Dhabi is pleased with the opportunity to take part in another practice session consecutively.<br/> <br/><i>“I am excited to get another opportunity to jump back in the car in Brazil,” </i>said Latifi.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It will be my third FP1 in a row, in such a short period of time, so that’s good for the rhythm.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I drove in FP1 there last year, so I know the track and that will help me get up to speed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is a unique circuit, and an older style compared to the more modern venues. It is smaller, tighter, but the track has a lot of character and has been on the calendar for a while.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m looking forward to getting out there and experiencing it once again.”</i>
