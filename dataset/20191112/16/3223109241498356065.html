      <h1>‘Black Lightning’ Season 3 Episode 5 Recap: Signs of a Spark</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T16:05:20+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/nmangione/" target="_blank">Nick Mangione</a></address>
      <p>Just like a CW show to take a week off after hooking us with a great cliffhanger. That it came at the same time <a href="http://geek.com/television/black-lightning-season-3-episode-4-recap-odell-controls-everyone-1808782/">Agent Odell subliminally hooks Lynn</a> on the highly addictive Green Light is some fun irony. <a href="https://www.geek.com/tag/black-lightning/"><i>Black Lightning</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://www.geek.com/tag/black-lightning/">returned</a> from its week off with Blackbird saving one of Jenn’s classmates, Tavon.</p>
      <p>He shoots a video for his parents assuring them he’s OK. He’s not the only one with Blackbird on the brain, though. Agent Odell runs a computer program that narrows down who Blackbird could be. I mean, it’s not like Anissa’s hasn’t been super obvious about it. Agent Odell’s been smarter than this. But, I guess we needed some superhero action for the episodes where Black Lightning himself was locked up. With a list of suspects, Odell sends Painkiller out to kill <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/black-lightning-season-3-episode-3-recap-a-new-suit-with-a-price-1808108/">Freeland’s new hero</a>.</p>

      <p>Chief Henderson is also forced to declare Blackbird a wanted person. He gets booed at a press conference. The entire town is against him. You can tell he doesn’t want to be doing this either. This is the most the show has made me feel for the guy. Yeah, he’s still a cop, but at least he seems reluctant to participate in the oppression. Of course that feeling disappears quickly once he starts arresting the people who heckled him. Including the priest for helping Blackbird sneak metas out of town. Or so it seems.</p>
      <p>As for Blackbird herself, she’s taking some time to protect her girlfriend. That includes giving her the vaccine for the metahuman disease, a smart home, and bringing Gambi over to watch over her. It looks like Blackbird is the one who could use a lookout, though. Freeland is becoming a more dangerous place for her by the minute.</p>

      <p>The show finally builds a genuinely tense and frightening situation for Blackbird. Tavon’s parents are convinced their son is dead and ask Jefferson to see if he can find out where he is. Feeling for the worried parents, he convinces Blackbird to bring Tavon back into Freeland. Anissa agrees, but under serious protest.</p>
      <p>When Anissa thinks something’s gonna go bad, you should probably listen. I get Jefferson’s her dad, but he should know that by now. The show effectively builds a sense of dread as Blackbird brings Tavon back to Freeland while Painkiller waits for her. The fight between them is well-choreographed, but Tavon’s presence makes it especially harrowing. He tries to help Blackbird out, and Painkiller mortally wounds him. She told you, Jeff.</p>
      <p>The show doesn’t let that tension up, either. While Blackbird is at the town’s perimeter, Agent Odell pays her home a visit. After Blackbird was spotted at the perimeter, he goes to check to see if Anissa’s at home. Good thing her girlfriend can shape shift. Grace disguises herself as Anissa and Gambi guides her through the conversation. She’s nervous as hell, and you get the feeling the entire game could be up at any moment. It’s a fantastic, stressful scene. Meanwhile, back at the perimeter, Black Lightning meets up with Anissa and Tavon, but can’t save him. He dies in Black Lightning’s arms.</p>

      <p>That is certainly a tragic way to end this story, and it looks like it’ll be a tipping point for some kind of uprising. It starts at the school. Upon hearing that the ASA killed a classmate, a group of students confronts the ASA soldiers guarding the school. The guards hit one of the students and Jefferson intervenes. Then, they start beating him in front of all his students. We all know this is going to be the moment the tide turns against the ASA. It’s almost enough to turn Jenn from the ASA. Almost. Odell has a backup plan, of course. He says the guards acted on their own, and allows her to deliver her own superhero-style justice. That’ll keep this particular project on track.</p>
      <p>As for his other project, Lynn is as addicted and obsessive as ever. She has a major breakthrough, but needs a test case she know won’t be killed if something goes wrong. There’s only one metahuman she can run her test on: Tobias Whale. That’s the real draw of this story. Lynn’s research moves forward at the same pace it has all season, but her having to work on (and help) her husband’s greatest enemy is some fantastic drama. She gives him the drug that’s kept him young and strong for decades, which the ASA had been denying him. Tobias taunts her, saying that he’ll kill her husband and spare her and her daughters. Scary as the speech was, I loved watching Lynn get some small revenge by “forgetting” to use anesthesia.</p>

      <p>The week off was clearly good for <i><a href="https://www.geek.com/television/black-lightning-season-3-episode-2-recap-still-trapped-1807325/">Black Lightning</a>, </i>as it comes back with a fantastic episode. Every storyline paid off in some way. We got some good fights, nerve-wracking confrontations, and it even set up an exciting storyline for the next few episodes. That video of Jefferson getting beaten by ASA guards will spark a revolution. And Henderson will lead it. Turns out he arrested the pastor and the guy stealing rations to bring them into the fold. He’s been leading the resistance we’ve seen glimpses of this past season. Aw, Henderson! I knew you hadn’t turned fascist. It’s a cool reveal, and there are all sorts of exciting places the story can go from here. I just hope the show can capitalize on them.</p>
