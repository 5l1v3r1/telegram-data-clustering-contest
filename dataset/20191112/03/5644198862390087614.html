      <p>Google and Ascension did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>
      <p>The data involved in Project Nightingale includes lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, complete with patient names and dates of birth, the Journal reported.</p>
      <p>The news follows an earlier announcement from Google that it would buy Fitbit Inc for US$2.1 billion, aiming to enter wearables segment and invest in digital health.</p>
