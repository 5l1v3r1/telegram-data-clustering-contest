      <h1>PH becomes world’s biggest rice importer, according to USDA data</h1>

      <p>The Philippines is the world’s number one importer of rice, surpassing even China, according to a new report released by the United States’ Department of Agriculture.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://coconuts.co/travel/rice-is-nice-where-to-enjoy-thailands-rustic-travel-fad-maps/">Rice is Nice: Where to enjoy Thailand’s rustic travel fad (Maps)</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>The USDA-Foreign Agricultural Services (USDA-FAS) report, released on Nov. 8, <a href="https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/circulars/grain-rice.pdf">shows</a> that 3.1 million metric tons of rice were imported by the Philippines this year, compared to China’s 2.5 million metric tons.</p>
      <p>The Philippines’ record-setting amount of import is all the more staggering given the fact that the country’s population stands at just 100 million, while China’s is around <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview">1.4 billion.</a></p>
      <p>The USDA study notes that in just a few years, “the Philippines has emerged as one of the top global importers of rice, nearly on a par with China.” It added that the Philippines’s rice imports have quadrupled from 800,000 metric tons in 2016 to an anticipated 3.1 million in 2019, accounting for some 7 percent of total global rice imports.</p>
      <p>The annual study was conducted between October 2018 and October 2019.</p>
      <p>In March this year, the government <a href="https://business.inquirer.net/265314/dof-clarifies-rice-tariffication-law-takes-effect-on-march-5">implemented the Rice Tarrification Law</a>, or <a href="http://www.congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_18/HB00476.pdf">Republic Act 11203</a>. The law removed import restrictions, leading to a greater amount of rice bought from overseas flooding the market. This move, according to experts, prompted <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/10/06/1957698/rice-prices-continue-decline">local rice prices to plunge</a> to PHP38 (US$0.75) per kilogram as of the end of September, 17 percent lower than last year’s price of PHP46 (US$0.90) per kilogram. However, <a href="https://www.rappler.com/business/239354-rice-still-not-hitting-projected-price-under-tariffication-law-september-2019">prices failed to hit</a> the government’s promised low of PHP27 (US$0.5o).</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Philippines is also a major grower of rice, producing some 20 million tons a year, raising questions as to the impact of imports on prices for local growers.</p>
      <p>But Agriculture Department spokesman Noel Reyes dismissed the USDA-FAS study, saying that the increase in importation was just a short-term effect of the Rice Tariffication Law. He also maintained that the increase in imports wouldn’t cause prices of locally grown rice to drop quickly — although they eventually will.</p>
      <p>“We expect that the prices will go down, rice as well as <i>palay </i>[unhusked rice]. But with rice, we don’t expect [prices] to fall that quickly,” Reyes said. “Every time there’s a harvest, the prices go down.”</p>
      <p>In September, farmers complained that they were having a hard time competing with cheap imports, and were <a href="https://www.rappler.com/business/239223-neda-not-keen-setting-floor-price-palay">forced to sell</a> unhusked rice to traders for as low as PHP7 (US$0.13) per kilo, even though production costs were PHP8 (US$0.15) per kilo.</p>
      <p>As of October, the country’s national rice inventory <a href="https://business.inquirer.net/283145/ph-is-worlds-biggest-rice-importer-for-2019">was at 2.28 million metric tons</a>, with some 1.9 million metric tons coming from imports, according to the Bureau of Customs. The share of imports is <a href="https://business.inquirer.net/283145/ph-is-worlds-biggest-rice-importer-for-2019">43.4 percent higher</a> than the previous year’s record of 1.59 million metric tons, according to the <i>Philippine Daily Inquirer.</i></p>
