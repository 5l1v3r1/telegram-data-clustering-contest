      <p>CHENNAI: It was about six months ago that MS Dhoni threw the ball to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> in an <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> game, with Kings XI needing 39 off 12.</p>
      <p>Two back-to-back no balls brought it down to 31 off 12 and Dhoni, in a departure from his cool on-field demeanour, walked up to Chahar and spoke a few strong words. Chahar, struggling with the dew, listened to his captain, won that game for CSK and now has come up with world record figures of six for seven to win India the T20 series against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>"Playing in Chennai (for CSK), I have now realised how to counter dew and sweat, how to keep my hands clean. At times, rub dry soil in your hands and then bowl," Chahar said at the end of the match in Nagpur, where dew was making life difficult for all the other bowlers.</p>

      <p>In such difficult circumstances, Chahar bowled 14 dots off the 20 balls he bowled on Sunday, showing how well he has learnt to deal with the dew factor. When Chahar came to CSK for Rs 80 lakhs, no one expected him to make the impression that he has.</p>
      <p>"But the good thing about Chahar is that he is always keen to learn. When he joined CSK, initially, he used to bowl only in the first 10 overs. But Dhoni was keen to use him at the death and see how well he has learnt," L Balaji, the bowling coach of CSK, told TOI.</p>

      <p>Going back to that game in Chepauk, Balaji recollected how Chahar was struggling with the dew. "Dhoni told him to use slower balls and back of the length to make it tough for the batsmen. It was good to see he has learnt and he negotiated similar conditions so well," Balaji said.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, he hasn't bowled a single no-ball in the T20 format since that Kings XI game at Chepauk. Chahar was always known in the domestic circuit as someone who could swing the ball both ways. But while playing for CSK on pitches which had nothing for pacers, it was imperative for him to work on a few variations.</p>
      <p>"We told him the importance of keeping the seam upright, something that he has done very well of late. He has also developed the knuckle ball and had varied the pace well, that has made captains think of him as a bowler in the death as well," Balaji added.</p>
      <p>Another crucial factor that was troubling Chahar before he became part of CSK was his fitness. "Chahar is a determined lad and has faced difficult times in his career. So he was keen to make the most of the opportunities that he was getting and worked extremely hard on his fitness," Balaji said.</p>
