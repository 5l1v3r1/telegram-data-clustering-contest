      <p>GENEVA, Nov 12 — Iraqi officials expressed “deep regret” yesterday at the death of protesters during weeks of unrest but defended Baghdad's handling of the situation.</p>
      <p>Nearly 300 people have been killed in Iraq since the protests against political corruption, unemployment and poor public services began on October 1.</p>
      <p>At a UN review of member states' human rights records in Geneva, diplomats from several countries accused the Iraqi government of using excessive force.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Farooq Amin Othman acknowledged there had been “individual violations” by members of the law enforcement agencies but said they were being investigated.</p>
      <p>“...We would like to express our deep regret for the number of people killed,” he told international diplomats gathered at what the UN calls the Universal Periodic Review.</p>
      <p>“Our constitution guarantees peaceful assembly and the objective of our authorities is to protect the protesters,” he said.</p>
      <p>Other Iraqi officials said plans were under way to free detained protesters and for electoral reform, both of which were among a package of reforms urged by the United Nations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Unlawful, indiscriminate and excessive' force</b>
      </p>
      <p>But diplomats from several countries including the United States issued stinging criticisms.</p>
      <p>“We recommend that Iraq immediately cease using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators, particularly the unlawful use of tear gas canisters and live ammunition, and hold accountable, in a transparent manner, those responsible for this violence,” Daniel Kronenfeld, Human Rights Counselor at the US Mission in Geneva.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands called the use of force “unlawful, indiscriminate and excessive.” Germany expressed deep concern and urged immediate steps to prevent further loss of life.</p>
      <p>The United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq released a set of recommendations on Sunday, including the release of peaceful protesters and investigations into deaths.</p>
      <p>Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Hussain Mahmood Alkhateeb, said the plan envisaged by Baghdad to address unrest was already being implemented and went “wider” than the UN proposals.</p>
      <p>“No demonstrator will stay in prison unless there is a criminal investigation against them,” he told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Iraq would consider trying Islamic State fighters on their own soil, as France and the United States has urged, he said: “Iraq believes that countries should take their nationals and this is a policy we are committed to.” — Reuters</p>
