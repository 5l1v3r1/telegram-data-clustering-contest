      <h2>Kim Kardashian appears to be modelling both diamond rings bought for her by husband Kanye West despite one being stolen in Paris during $10million robbery</h2>

      <p>Kim Kardashian has surprised fans by appearing to model two diamond rings despite one of them thought to have been stolen in Paris robbery.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was subjected to a terrifying theft while she stayed in the French capital in 2016.</p>
      <p>During the ordeal, thieves made off with $10 million (£7.78 million) worth of jewellery, with one of her diamond engagement rings from rapper Kanye being part of the haul.</p>
      <p>In the campaign for the Kardashian sisters new Diamonds Collection of KKW perfumes, it would appear that the stolen ring is back on Kim's hand.</p>

      <p>She posed along with her sisters Khloe and Kourtney, as they dripped in diamonds to promote the fragrances, which are called Original, Oud and Citrus.</p>
      <p>It was the big diamond on Kim's hand that caught the attention of the reality star's followers, who questioned whether the real thing had turned up again.</p>
      <p>Kanye gave her two rings, one an oval cut 15 carat diamond which he presented to her when he proposed in San Francisco during 2013.</p>
      <p>The other is a 20 carat emerald cut diamond ring which Kanye gave Kim during the summer of 2016 and it was this one that was allegedly stolen in the raid.</p>
      <p>In the pics for her fragrance promotion, the emerald cut diamond is back on Kim's finger but it is not know whether it is the original, another of the same ring or a fake reproduction.</p>
      <p>Captioning the pics, Kim was pleased to announce the launch of her latest products.</p>

      <p>The reality star wrote: "KKW Fragrance Diamonds by Kourtney x Kim x Khloé. Three fragrances encased in luxurious diamond bottles."</p>
      <p>Khloe and Kourtney were also in full promotional mode and similarly dripping in diamonds as they shared pics from the campaign.</p>
      <p>Kim continued on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , describing the nature of the fragrances: "This collection is really special because it's the first fragrance collaboration I've done with Kourtney and Khloe for my line. Each of the fragrances really capture us individually.</p>

      <p>"My scent is fresh and floral and becomes warmer as I wear it throughout the day. I can't wait for you guys to smell how amazing these scents are!!!"</p>
      <p>The joyous celebration could well be partly due to the return of her emerald diamond, or at least a replacement of it.</p>
