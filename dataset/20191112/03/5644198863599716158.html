      <p>WeWork is in discussions with T-Mobile US Inc Chief Executive Officer John Legere to take over as head of the office-sharing start-up, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: WeWork is in talks with T-Mobile US Inc Chief Executive Officer John Legere to take over as the head of the office-sharing start-up, the Wall Street Journal reported https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-11573494028?mod=rsswn&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2 on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The talks come weeks after SoftBank Group spent more than US$10 billion to take over WeWork, including a US$1.7 billion payoff to its co-founder Adam Neumann to relinquish control.</p>

      <p>WeWork did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure became the executive chairman of WeWork parent The We Company, following the bailout by the Japanese firm.</p>
      <p>Artie Minson, chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, vice chairman, currently serve as the co-chief executives of The We Company.</p>
      <p>SoftBank owns 80per cent of the troubled office-sharing startup, but has not consolidated the company on its books because it will not hold a majority of voting rights.</p>
      <p>SoftBank has four board seats on the company's expanded 10-member board. The startup is looking for a new leader who could join as soon as January, the WSJ report said.</p>
