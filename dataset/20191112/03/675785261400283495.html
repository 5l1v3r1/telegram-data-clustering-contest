      <h2>Legendary Arsenal striker says he'll miss football while he's in the I'm A Celeb jungle - but he won't miss VAR</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:59:59+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:59</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Ian Wright has joked he is taking part in I'm A Celebrity 2019 to get away from VAR.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners striker has been confirmed as one of the contestants in this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old scored 128 goals in 221 appearances for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> over a seven-year period and also fired in 90 for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>Now a TV pundit, he says he will miss football while isolated from the real world in hit ITV show.</p>
      <p>However, as the introduction of VAR into the Premier League this season lurches from one controversy to another, Wright said he will definitely not miss the decisions of the video assistant referee.</p>

      <p>In a video posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Wright said: "I'll miss football. I love football, it's my whole life.</p>
      <p>"I will not miss VAR. I'm going in there to get away from VAR."</p>
      <p>One Arsenal fan responded to the video by saying: "At least you won't have to hear about Arsenal's performances for the next month or so."</p>
      <p>The latest VAR row came after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> 3-1 in their titanic title-race showdown at Anfield on Sunday.</p>

      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola had been enraged during the Premier League clash as his side were twice denied penalties for possible handballs against Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>
      <p>The first was the most controversial, coming immediately before Fabinho opened the scoring. The second came late on as City rallied in response to further goals from Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk says he didn't celebrate Liverpool's opener against City because <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/virgil-van-dijk-explains-didnt-20859299">he was worried VAR was going to rule it out</a> .</p>
      <p>Also this weekend, Sheffield United had an effort ruled out against Tottenham after after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/gary-lineker-blasts-premier-league-20851070">John Lundstram's toe was ruled to be offside</a> following a lengthy decision-making process.</p>
      <p>That decision was criticised by Match of the Day presenter and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> striker Gary Lineker, who said: "This proves nothing. Stop trying to justify these absurdities."</p>
