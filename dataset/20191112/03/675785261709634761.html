      <p>This terrifying footage shows the moment an airplane skidded off a runway and slammed into the snowy ground.</p>
      <p>The busy American Airlines flight careered off the frozen airstrip when landing in Chicago, US, yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>One of the plane's wings can be seen smashing into the snow beside the runway, while passengers scream out in terror.</p>
      <p>One flyer can be heard saying 'no, no, no, no, no' as the aircraft swerves to the left.</p>
      <p>Another jokes 'I think we landed' after the plane, which had flown to Chicago from North Carolina, comes to a halt.</p>

      <p>"No injuries reported. All 38 passengers and 3 crew members were deplaned from the aircraft and are now safely back in the terminal."</p>

      <p>"We made a loop for about 20 minutes... As soon as we landed, we could start feeling something a little off there and we tried to do a little turn and that's when we started going sideways.</p>
      <p>"Everybody just held their breath until we stopped. And as soon as we stopped, everybody just kind of exhaled."</p>
      <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the aircraft's right main landing gear collapsed.</p>
      <p>Chicago has been hit by heavy snowfall in recent days, with up to six inches of snow expected in the area.</p>
      <p>More than 440 flights were canceled in and out of Chicago O'Hare Airport as of Monday morning, with a further 93 canceled at Chicago Midway Airport, according to <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/watch-plane-from-nc-skids-off-runway-in-chicago-due-to-icy-conditions/1007296881?utm_source=homestream&amp;utm_medium=site_navigation&amp;utm_campaign=homestream_click">WSOCTV</a> .</p>
