      <p>You can almost hear the sigh of relief from the global Sega fan community. The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szby7ZHLnkA">Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer</a>, which Paramount released this morning, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/12/the-new-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-is-a-giant-relief">is a giant improvement</a>. From a report:<i> Our spiky hero no longer looks like a nightmarish experiment in avant garde taxidermy. The <a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/19/05/24/1924219/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-is-getting-delayed-to-redesign-the-title-character">human teeth</a> have been extracted. He has big doe eyes, not the sinister mini-peepers of the original trailer. The new design genuinely captures a lot of what original character designer Naoto Ohshima set out to achieve -- a cool but cuddly mascot, infusing Japanese kawaii sensibilities with American attitude. His fur is bright, mimicking the famed Sega blue of the company's classic arcade games. He is no longer absolutely terrifying, an important achievement for a family film.</i></p>
