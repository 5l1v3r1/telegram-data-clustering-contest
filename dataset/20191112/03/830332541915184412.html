      <p>MADISON, Wis. - An Air Force member surprised his family with an early reunion during Saturday's Badger football game against Iowa.</p>
      <p>According to a story from the official University of Wisconsin Athletics website, Greg Slattery is a senior airman in the U.S. Air Force and a graduate of DeForest High School.</p>
      <p>Slattery and his father wanted to surprise the rest of their family by having Slattery come home early from his deployment to Afghanistan. The two of them worked with Wisconsin Athletics officials to coordinate his return.</p>
      <p>Slattery arrived in Madison at Truax Field after 3 p.m. and waited to rejoice with his son Kye a couple hours later inside Camp Randall Stadium.</p>
