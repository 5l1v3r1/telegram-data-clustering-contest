      <p>MEXICO CITY, Nov 12 — Bolivia's former President Evo Morales has boarded a plane to Mexico, where he has been granted asylum, Mexico's top diplomat said last night, as unrest shook the South American nation.</p>
      <p>The Mexican government's support has helped cement its emerging role as a bastion of diplomatic support for left-wing leaders in Latin America.</p>
      <p>“Evo Morales is now on the Mexican government's plane sent to ensure his safe journey to our country,” Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>He had said the life of Bolivia's first indigenous president was in danger and the decision to grant him asylum was in Mexico's long tradition of sheltering exiles.</p>
      <p>Morales' government collapsed on Sunday after ruling party allies quit and the army urged him to step down in the wake of a disputed election, adding to a sense of crisis in Latin America, which has been hit by weeks of protests and unrest.</p>
      <p>Looting and roadblocks convulsed Bolivia after Morales stepped down. He said “violent groups” attacked his house.</p>
      <p>Mexico's plane refuelled in Lima before picking up Morales in Bolivia, and Argentina's President-elect Alberto Fernandez praised Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra's cooperation.</p>
      <p>“He acted diplomatically to try to facilitate the arrival of the plane for Evo,” Fernandez said at an event in Buenos Aires.</p>
      <p>The departure of Morales, one of a wave of leftists who dominated Latin America's politics at the start of the century, comes amid a widespread rejection of incumbent leaders from either side of the political divide in the region, from Mexico to Brazil and Argentina.</p>
      <p>Mexico elected its first left-leaning government in decades last year, moving closer to like-minded governments and distancing itself from diplomatic initiatives aimed at pushing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power in Venezuela.</p>
      <p>Argentina last month elected left-leaning Fernandez, as voters rejected economic policies that were aimed at stabilising the economy but which deepened poverty and inflation.</p>
      <p>The resignation of Morales, who governed for 14 years, followed protests in Ecuador and Chile that forced their governments to step back from policies raising fuel and transport prices.</p>
      <p>Ebrard said earlier on Monday his government viewed Sunday's events in Bolivia as a "coup" because the military broke with the constitutional order by pressing Morales to resign.</p>
      <p>Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised Morales, saying he chose to resign rather than put the lives of Bolivia's citizens at risk. — Reuters</p>
