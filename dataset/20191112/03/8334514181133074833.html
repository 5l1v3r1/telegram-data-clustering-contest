      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles reportedly gave Brandon Brooks a four-year, $56.2 million extension Monday that makes him the highest-paid guard in the NFL.</p>
      <p>NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport first reported the deal, which includes $30 million in guaranteed money for the 30-year-old right guard.</p>
      <p>Brooks, a Pro Bowl selection in each of the past two seasons, is in the fourth season of a five-year, $40 million free-agent contract he signed in March 2016.</p>
      <p>Brooks has not missed a game since December 2016, starting 55 of the Eagles’ 57 games since joining the team from the Houston Texans.</p>
      <p>He appeared in 50 games (44 starts) for the Texans, who picked him in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft out of Miami (Ohio).</p>
