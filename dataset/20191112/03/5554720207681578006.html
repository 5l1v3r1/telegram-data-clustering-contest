      <h1>Deepak Chahar’s record-breaking bowling spell against Bangladesh under scrutiny, here’s why!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T03:54:54+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 03:54</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>India’s new bowling sensation Deepak Chahar on Sunday smashed the T20 International record for the most economical bowling spell by finishing 6-7. His six-wicket haul also included a hat-trick, which became pivotal in ensuring<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/deepak-chahars-hat-trick-guides-india-to-beat-bangladesh-in-t20i-win-series/272072/"> India’s stunning victory</a> against Bangladesh, allowing the hosts to win the three-match series.</p>

      <p>Soon after the match was over, the BCCI took to Twitter to announce that the bowler from Agra had become the first Indian to claim a hat-trick in a T20 International match. Its tweet read, “@deepak_chahar9 today became the first Indian to pick up a hat-trick in T20Is.”</p>

      <p>However, the eagle-eyed cricket fans wasted no time in reminding that it was wrong to claim that Deepak was the first Indian to achieve this extraordinary feat. Many fans reminded that left-arm spinner Ekta Bisht had achieved this feat for the India women cricket team way back in 2012 against Sri Lanka. Bisht’s 3-16 had played a key role in ensuring the nine-wicket win against Sri Lanka in a play-off match of the 2012’s ICC World Women T20 International competition.</p>

      <p>Deepak’s six-wicket haul in four overs by conceding just seven runs was the best-ever bowling figure in a T20 International match by any bowler as the Indian medium-pacer beat Sri Lanka’s <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/deepak-chahar-from-being-rejected-by-greg-chappell-to-becoming-bowler-with-most-impressive-spell-in-t20i-history/272079/">Ajantha Mendis’ record of 6-8.</a></p>
