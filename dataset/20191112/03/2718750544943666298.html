      <p>Season three, Episode 17, “Basic Lupine Urology,” or “The One Where My Wife Went Into Labor and I Couldn’t Leave Until I Finished My Scenes,” is Danny Pudi’s favorite<i> </i><a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/community/"><i>Community</i></a> episode, but not just for its fun <i>Law &amp; Order</i> parody. As he told Vulture Spot host Jamie Loftus while at Vulture Festival this weekend, alongside co-stars <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/yvette-nicole-brown/">Yvette Nicole Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/jim-rash/">Jim Rash</a>, the actor happened to be shooting that episode when his wife Bridget Showalter went into labor with their twins James Timothy and Fiona Leigh. The first clip-show episode was pretty good, too (and Brown’s personal favorite!), but yeah, if Danny Pudi had to pick, the one during which he became a father would definitely be the winner. Danny Pudi’s least favorite episode? Presumably the one he shot with a full-on broken nose.</p>
