      </p>
      <p>It’s a well-known fact that Facebook’s Instagram has blatantly copied a number of features from Snapchat. The popular Stories feature, for instance, is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview">direct knock-off</a> of Snapachat’s Story feature and Facebook didn’t even make the effort to give it a unique name. While this may or may not have directly influenced Snapchat’s declining popularity, it definitely helped Instagram get where it is today. Now, it seems like Instagram has set its sight on the popular video-sharing platform TikTok and is looking to copy an essential feature from the app.</p>
      <p>As per a recent tweet from prolific reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, Instagram is now working on a new TikTok-like video editing/remixing tool for Stories called Scenes. When released, this new tool will allow you to remix other users’ Scenes if their account is public. You’ll get the option to add your own music to the Scene, change the playback speed, add a timer or AR effects to each clip before you post it as your own story.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>For now, there’s no information from Instagram regarding this new feature, however, considering <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/instagram-test-boomerang-modes-layouts-stories/">Wong’s track record</a>, we can be sure that it will be released sometime in the near future. It’s worth noting that a similar unreleased <a href="https://wongmjane.com/blog/ig-clips">feature called Clips</a> was spotted within the app previously, so there’s a chance that Instagram might make further changes to it before it’s officially rolled out to the public. What are your thoughts on Instagram Scenes? Do you think it’ll be as popular as its counterpart on TikTok? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.</p>

      <h3>Update: Instagram rolls out new TikTok-like Reels feature in Brazil</h3>
      <p>Instagram has now launched the new feature under the Reels moniker in Brazil. As reported by <i>TechCrunch</i>, the feature will allow you to make 15-second clips set to music that can be shared as Stories. You can discover Reels from other users in the new Top Reels section in the Explore tab. Much like TikTok, users will get access to a vast library of soundtracks to create these new clips.</p>

      <p>The feature has already been rolled out to both iOS and Android users in Brazil, where it’s called Cenas. The feature can be found within the Instagram Stories shutter modes next to the popular Boomerang and Super-Zoom features. You can choose to record a silent video, borrow the soundtrack from another video found within the Explore tab, or choose one from the vast library at your disposal. A few viral audio clips will also get their own dedicated pages showing off the top videos that use the clip.</p>

      <p>You’ll also get access to a couple of editing tools to polish your Reels before you post them. These include things like timed captions, ghost overlays for transitions, and more. However, the feature still doesn’t have a number of filters and special effects offered by TikTok. Once you’re satisfied with your Reel, you’ll be able to post it as your story, share it with close friends, or message it directly to people. If you choose to share your Reels publicly, they’ll have the chance to appear within the Top Reels section of the Explore tab. Additionally, you’ll be able to add your favorite Reels to your profile as a highlight.</p>
