      <h1>Lata Mangeshkar's condition critical, slowly improving: Hospital sources</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:27:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:27</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>MUMBAI: Legendary singer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lata-Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>, who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital here after complaining of breathing difficulty, is still in a "critical" condition but is "slowly improving", hospital sources said.</p>
      <p>The 90-year-old singer was admitted to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Breach-Candy-Hospital">Breach Candy Hospital</a> in the early hours of Monday where Dr Patit Samdhani is treating her.</p>
      <p>"She is critical but her condition has slowly improved. She is still in the hospital," a hospital insider told PTI.</p>
      <p>However, the veteran singer's PR team in a statement on Tuesday said she was "stable".</p>
      <p>"Her parameters are good. Honestly speaking, she has fought so well that she is coming out of this setback. Being a singer, her lung capacity has pulled her through. Truly a fighter. We will update everyone when Lataji gets discharged and comes home. (We) request that we give family the space they deserve at the moment," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar has lent her voice for thousands of songs in Hindi, regional and foreign languages. Her last full album was for the late filmmaker Yash Chopra-directed 2004 film "Veer Zaara".</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar recorded her latest song this year - "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki", which was released on March 30 as a tribute to the Indian Army.</p>
      <p>She was awarded the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bharat-Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, the highest civilian honour in 2001.</p>
