        <b>The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) delegation comprising of Irfan Pathan, Parvez Rasool and Vinod Khajuria met the BCCI President Sourav Ganguly to discuss future plans for cricket in Jammu and Kashmir. After revoking article 370, the JKCA is looking to conduct fresh board elections.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Irfan Pathan and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/parvez_rasool">Parvez Rasool</a> were among the members of the JKCA that met <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> President <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a> for discussing the future of Jammu and Kashmir cricket. The BCCI President Ganguly and Secretary Jay Shah were briefed about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir after the Government of India revoked article 370 in Kashmir and the meeting went on for more than an hour.</p>
      <p>Most of the boards in Kashmir went through a breakdown after revoking the article 370 and have conducted elections till October but JKCA has still not undergone changes and thus wish to conduct fresh board elections according to the new BCCI constitution. The board will be looking to conduct the elections once the situation improves in the valley.</p>
      <p>The BCCI officials were also briefed about the ground conditions and preparations ahead of the start of the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/ranji_trophy">Ranji Trophy</a> season. The Jammu and Kashmir cricket team play their home games at the Sher e Kashmir stadium in Srinagar till November and then the home venue shifts to the college grounds in Jammu. The JKCA officials are hopeful that the board will provide all the necessary support to ensure all the facilities are available properly and that the J &amp; K cricket team gets the opportunity to play the home matches in Jammu. The team is now heading to Vadodara for their pre-season training camp.</p>
      <p>"Since they are confident of hosting the Ranji Trophy games in Jammu, the Board will provide full support to ensure that cricket is not affected," one of the senior BCCI officials toldÂ Sportstar.</p>
