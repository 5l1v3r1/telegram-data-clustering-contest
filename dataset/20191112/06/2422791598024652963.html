      <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry "definitely" plans to return this season from his broken left hand and is hoping to be back on the court at "some point in early spring."</p>
      <p>When exactly the two-time NBA MVP will be able to play again remains uncertain.</p>
      <p>Curry addressed the media Monday night for the first time since getting injured Oct. 30 and said he needs a second surgery on his non-shooting hand, probably in early December, to remove pins that were inserted during the first procedure Nov. 1 that involved his hand and index finger.</p>
      <p>"(Managing the) swelling is something that's going to be of the utmost priority early in the rehab process," Curry said, "to get me a chance to come back and get my range of motion back pretty quickly."</p>
      <p>The Warriors initially said Curry would be re-evaluated three months after the surgery, which would be early February.</p>
      <p>Curry referred to himself and injured teammate Klay Thompson as "caged animals right now, wanting to be unleashed."</p>
      <p>Thompson, the other part of Golden State's Splash Brothers combo, is recovering from surgery to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. The team hopes he can return in the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>Curry said he experienced some minor nerve irritation shortly after he underwent his first hand surgery, a common byproduct of the procedure. That's one thing doctors will continue to monitor throughout his rehab process, and it will impact when he can return.</p>
      <p>For now, Curry is working out his lower body and doing whatever training is permitted by the team's medical staff, saying he's using this three-month period without basketball as a "mini off-season" to fine-tune his body.</p>
      <p>The Warriors' longest-tenured player had praise for his teammates, who took the court Monday night against Utah with a 2-8 record that was tied with the New York Knicks and New Orleans Pelicans for the worst in the NBA.</p>
      <p>Curry described rookie Eric Paschall's energy as contagious and said the play of new guard D'Angelo Russell has been "unreal." Asked what the benefits would be for he and Thompson to return to the court this season if it was only for the final few weeks, Curry had an answer.</p>
      <p>"Just to understand the chemistry with the young guys," he said. "We can play around with rotations and just get a vibe of what the following season, when we're all healthy, looks like."</p>
