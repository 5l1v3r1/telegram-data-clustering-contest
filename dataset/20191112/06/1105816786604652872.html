      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>An accountability court on Tuesday rejected former president Asif Ali Zardari’s petition to transfer him to Karachi for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Zardari’s lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa requested the court to shift the former president to Karachi for better medical treatment, adding that Zardari’s entire medical history is in Karachi.</p>
      <p>“Zardari had not begged the government earlier, nor will he do so now,” said Latif.</p>
      <p>“A petition has been moved in the court for obtaining the legal right.”</p>

      <p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor responded, “requesting the government is not considered begging,” adding that Zardari was shifted to a hospital on the recommendation of a medical board constituted by the government.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor continued that the decision to transfer the former president does not fall under the jurisdiction of the court, adding that the hospital has been declared a sub-jail for the former president.</p>
      <p>He further said that Zardari should submit an application to the government if a private doctor was needed.</p>
      <p>Zardari was moved to Pims from Adiala jail on October 22. He was admitted to the cardiology department where he underwent a number of tests and was declared to be out of danger.</p>
