      <h1>Steve Clarke needs to grow a pair and stand up to Arsenal over Kieran Tierney Scotland omission</h1>
      <h2>Clarke has never backed down from a fight in the past so why is he tip-toeing around Unai Emery?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Clarke was never afraid to shirk an issue when he was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> manager. So why is he pulling out of tackles now he’s wearing a Scotland tracksuit?</p>
      <p>At Rugby Park, he railed against the SFA on a regular basis when he felt his club has been slighted. He absolutely demolished referee Steven McLean for the whistler’s performance in a 1-0 defeat to Aberdeen, claiming the official couldn’t handle the fact that his father was a Killie legend and overcompensated by giving the opposition too many decisions.</p>
      <p>That was pretty nonsensical and copped him a two match ban, but he had the guts to say what he felt, rightly or wrongly.</p>
      <p>He stood front and centre again when the some of the Rangers support chanting the ‘sad Fenian b*****d’ song at him, calling them out for it and bringing into the spotlight the abuse that far too many players and managers get from the stands.</p>
      <p>He was at it again after the last game of the season after beating the Ibrox outfit at Rugby Park to secure European football - well, a trip to Wales that ended in one of the biggest humiliations in the club’s history but he wasn’t to know that and he wasn’t around to stave it off.</p>

      <p>‘Bye bye Rangers,” he mocked. ‘And <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>’, as he endorsed Killie’s decision to slash the Old Firm’s ticket allocations.</p>
      <p>But the reality was really ‘Bye Bye Killie,” because within a week Clarke was wearing the SFA blazer and tie and the vast majority of Scotland fans believed he was the man for the job.</p>
      <p>The jury remains out on that but a verdict will be delivered over the course of the next three, hopefully four, matches.</p>
      <p>The forthcoming double header with Cyprus on Saturday and Kazakhstan a week today are the warm-up act for the Nations League play-offs in March that will determine whether Scotland reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time since 1998.</p>
      <p>Can you imagine the lift that would give nation?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The stakes couldn’t be higher and Clarke should be doing everything in his power to whip <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a>, the country AND the team, into a fervour. Yes, that’s a big ask, considering the hammerings we’ve suffered from Belgium, Russia and Kazakhstan (that one on Alex McLeish’s watch) but right now this international break is being regarded as nothing but a monumental pain in the backside for interrupting the most thrilling title battle in years.</p>
      <p>It’s Clarke’s job to change that perception but he’s never going to grab Michael Buffer’s microphone and yell “Let’s Get Ready To Rumble” from the top of the Hampden stairs. That’s not the man’s style.</p>
      <p>But then again, neither is it in his nature to let people walk all over him or any team in his charge, but that’s what has happened this week on two fronts.</p>

      <p>First there’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a>. I’ve no doubt this player would walk from Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium to Oriam to join the Scotland squad, so any thoughts that Tierney himself is behind his absence is a non-starter.</p>
      <p>This is Arsenal playing funny buggers. They don’t want their £25m left back playing another two games as he comes back from a long term injury but the fact of the matter is that if Clarke said ‘too bad’ they could do nothing about it.</p>
      <p>At the very least, he should be with the squad to be assessed by Scotland’s medical team and if they deem him unfit to play that’s fair enough. But for Arsenal to deny Clarke his services when he doesn’t appear to be injured isn’t on and the Scotland manager should be using the five-day rule to make sure if Tierney isn’t fit for Scotland then he can’t play for the Gunners the following week.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill wasn’t afraid to use the rule against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> when they pulled Kyle Lafferty from a squad last season, so why is Clarke tip-toeing around Unai Emery?</p>
      <p>The Scotland manager has never had the chance to work with Tierney and these two matches at the end of the qualifying campaign would have been the ideal opportunity to experiment with how he can fit him in with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a>.</p>
      <p>Now the first chance he’ll get to do that will be in the play-off in March.</p>

      <p>And talking of which, Clarke and his paymasters should be doing more than just HOPE that the SPFL and TV companies give them a hand in the run-up to that first play-off match.</p>
      <p>The Scotland boss hopes that they’ll cancel any plans to have a Sunday match, to give him an extra 24 hours to work with the players but he should be demanding that the entire Scottish top flight card be scrapped that week.</p>
      <p>This is huge for the nation and although the English Premier League won’t stop for us, it is not unreasonable to expect our own Premiership to do the country a favour by giving Clarke extra time to work with the likes of Callum McGregor, Ryan Christie, James Forrest, Ryan Jack, Scott McKenna, Stephen O’Donnell and Steven Naismith.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They can moan all the like about fixture congestion but they have to find a way to make it work. It’s their job to bring success to Scottish football and on this one, the two organisations should be singing from the same songsheet.</p>
      <p>There’s a time for diplomacy. And there’s time for standing up for yourself and your country.</p>
      <p>That time has come for Steve Clarke.</p>
