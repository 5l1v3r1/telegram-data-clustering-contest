      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — Blackpink has become the first K-pop group to achieve more than one billion views on YouTube for a single music video through one of its hit singles.</p>
      <p>Quoting the group’s agency YG Entertainment, English language daily <i>Korea Herald</i> reported that Blackpink’s <i>Ddu-Du Ddu-Du</i> music video surpassed the threshold yesterday afternoon, some 17 months after it was released June last year. </p>
      <p>The daily noted that Blackpink was the second K-pop artist with the achievement, after singer PSY, whose 2012 mega-hit <i>Gangnam Style</i> has chalked up over 3.4 billion views on YouTube to date.</p>
      <p>The quartet debuted in 2016 and is one of the most popular groups on the K-pop scene.</p>
      <p><i>Ddu-Du Ddu-Du</i> is from the group’s mini-album <b>Square Up</b>.</p>

      <p>It reached 900 million views on July 30.</p>
      <p>The group’s latest single, Kill This Love, released in April, has achieved more than 640 million views, while music videos of hit singles <i>Boombayah</i> and <i>As If It’s Your Last</i> have both topped 700 million views on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Blackpink also holds the record of having the most streamed debut song by a girl group in history with <i>Boombayah</i> which surpassed 1 billion streams worldwide (on Spotify and YouTube). </p>
