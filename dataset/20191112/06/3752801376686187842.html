      <p>Interviews for the next Deputy Public Protector will start on Wednesday and continue on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services last month whittled down the original list of 26 people, who have applied or have been nominated, to just eight.</p>
      <p>Nineteen of the 26 candidates met the legislative requirements set out in Section 2A (4) 9 of the Public Protector Act 23 of 1994, but in the end, the committee decided on the following eight candidates:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moshoeshoe Jeffrey Toba;</li>
        <li>Advocate Sonwabile Mancotywa;</li>
        <li>Advocate Shadrack Nkuna;</li>
        <li>Advocate Noxolo Mbangeni;</li>
        <li>Advocate Lwazi Pumelela Kubukeli;</li>
        <li>Advocate Puleng Matshelo;</li>
        <li>Buang Jones;</li>
        <li>Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jones is the acting legal head of the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) who found himself <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/etzebeth-case-sahrc-investigating-its-legal-head-buang-joness-conduct-20191008">embroiled in the controversy</a> around Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth.</p>
      <p>The former head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate, Robert McBride, is one of those who did not make the cut. McBride is currently taking a report of the Public Protector <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/mcbride-and-ipid-officials-want-public-protectors-report-overturned-on-18-grounds-report-20191009">on review</a>.</p>
      <p>Incumbent Deputy Public Protector Kevin Malunga's term comes to an end next month.</p>
      <p>Previously, committee chairperson Bulelani Magwanishe said that during a public participation process, members of the public had made allegations against some candidates.</p>
      <p>He said further allegations can be made against the candidates during the interviews "to further probe the fitness of the candidate to hold office".</p>
      <p>The Deputy Public Protector must be a South African citizen and be a fit and proper person for the post.</p>
      <p>He or she must also fulfill one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be admitted as an advocate or an attorney and have, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years after having been so admitted, practiced as an advocate or an attorney;</li>
        <li>Be qualified to be admitted as an advocate or an attorney and have, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years after having so qualified, lectured in law at a university;</li>
        <li>Have specialised knowledge of or experience, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years, in the administration of justice, public administration or public finance;</li>
        <li>Have, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years, been an MP;</li>
        <li>Have acquired any combination of experience mentioned above, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The meeting is scheduled to start at 09:30 in the Old Assembly Chamber.</p>
