      <p>Tesla's European gigafactory <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/elon-musk-picks-berlin-for-teslas-europe-gigafactory/">will be built in the Berlin area</a>, Elon Musk said Tuesday during an awards ceremony in Germany. TechCrunch reports: <i>Musk was onstage to receive a Golden Steering Wheel Award given by BILD. "There's not enough time tonight to tell all the details," Musk said during an onstage interview with Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess. "But it's in the Berlin area, and it's near the new airport." Tesla is also going to create an engineering and design center in Berlin because "I think Berlin has some of the best art in the world," Musk said. <br/><br/>Diess thanked Musk while onstage for "pushing us" toward electrification. Diess later said that Musk and Telsa are demonstrating that moving toward electrification works. "I don't think Germany is that far behind," Musk said when asked about why German automakers were behind in electric vehicles. He later added that some of the best cars in the world are made in Germany. "Everyone knows that German engineering is outstanding and that's part of the reason we're locating our Gigafactory Europe in Germany," Musk said. </i>On Twitter, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1194364798407852032">said</a> the Berlin-based gigafactory "Will build batteries, powertrains &amp; vehicles, starting with Model Y."</p>
