      <p><b>TOLEDO, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say a woman whose body was found on the side of a road in Ohio had been stabbed numerous times.</p>
      <p>The Blade in Toledo reports that Dr. Jeffrey Hudson, a deputy Lucas County coroner, says 30-year-old Michelle Keagler was stabbed two dozen times and some of the wounds were defensive ones. He said the weapon is believed to be a large knife.</p>
      <p>The coroner's office hasn't released a final ruling on the cause of death.</p>
      <p>Toledo police say officers found Keagler around 8 a.m. Saturday near Interstate 75 after a truck driver called 911 to report a person lying on the side of a road. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Officers are asking anyone with information that could help the investigation to call the Crime Stoppers program.</p>
