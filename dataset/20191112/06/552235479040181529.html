      <h1>The Jonny Hayes Celtic rise and why Neil Lennon has turned to Hoops star</h1>
      <h2>Hayes' former Inverness coach Maurice Malpas is not surprised that he's revived his Parkhead career.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T06:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Every time <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jonny-hayes">Jonny Hayes</a> suffers a blow he just hauls himself back off the canvas.</p>
      <p>It seems you can’t keep this good Irishman down.</p>
      <p>When Brendan Rodgers – the man who signed him from Aberdeen for more than £1million in the summer of 2017 left for Leicester – Hayes needed to impress the new boss.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take him long. Soon he was featuring for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> but his biggest test came in the summer when the boss stockpiled left-sided players.</p>
      <p>Boli Bolingoli arrived, Lewis Morgan returned from his loan and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> finally landed the man they had spent all window chasing – £2m Greg Taylor.</p>
      <p>All four are vying to be the long-term successor to Kieran Tierney. But it’s Hayes who Lennon has turned to.</p>
      <p>With Bolingoli injured the winger’s the man in demand at left-back.</p>

      <p>Hayes has not disappointed though, especially not in the 2-0 win against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> when he won man of the match. Now Lennon is even hinting at a new contract.</p>
      <p>Maurice Malpas isn’t surprised. The man who coached the player at Inverness knows how good a player Hayes is – so long as he is not asked to defend.</p>
      <p>But he also believes the 32-year-old is Celtic’s best attacker down the left, which is some compliment.</p>
      <p>Malpas, who knew a bit about being a full-back during a hugely-successful career with Dundee United and Scotland, said: “Jonny is the best getting forward out of all Celtic’s left-back options.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It seems crazy because it is a defensive position but Jonny is playing just now because he is the best going forward.</p>
      <p>“He is probably the worst defender – in fact he is the worst defender – but he has such quality going forward and that is an area where you need to be strong playing for a club like Celtic.</p>
      <p>“He’s doing well at left-back not because he is a good defender but because he is a good attacker. He was always a handful getting forward as a wide player and he is the same when he drops into left-back because of his speed and the way he drives forward.</p>

      <p>“When you play as a full-back at Celtic or <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> you are more of a midfielder or a winger, certainly in most domestic games outwith their European ties.</p>
      <p>“If you’re playing left-back for a team like Celtic you are judged on your runs and the number of crosses and assists in your play. It is more about that than stopping attacks because Celtic don’t seem to worry about that as much.</p>
      <p>“Ninety per cent of their games are played on the front foot so they want people getting forward and being positive and that is Wee Jonny’s game to a T.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hayes had been a squad player under Rodgers but has come to the fore in several positions under Lennon, from left wing to striker and even left-back.</p>
      <p>Malpas knows Hayes’ left-sided versatility will be vital to Lennon and his squad as they look to cope with the constant domestic and Europa League demands.</p>

      <p>He said: “Jonny’s biggest asset is that he can play a few positions for Celtic and offers real versatility within their squad. His pace is also a big thing for him wherever he plays.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he’s as quick as he used to be but he is still quick. He has good delivery and he can also chip in with his fair share of goals as well.</p>
      <p>“I have worked with Jonny and I know I am biased but he can cross the ball better than most right-footed wingers. His delivery has also improved with experience and age.</p>
      <p>“When he first came up to Inverness every cross had to be a World Cup ball but now it is about getting it past the first defender, especially if you have a half-decent striker to attack the ball.</p>
      <p>“It is a great threat for Celtic to have. He was great for getting us up the park at Inverness and now is the same at Celtic.”</p>
