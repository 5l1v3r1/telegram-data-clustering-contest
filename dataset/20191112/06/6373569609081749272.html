        <figcaption>Why volunteer at the homeless cafe?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"You're not feeding them," said Pc Jon Hitt, "you're feeding their problems, you're feeding their addiction."</p>
      <p>Homelessness and rough sleepers invoke a lot of emotional responses from the public. Governments and local authorities are lambasted for not doing enough, stretched charities try their hardest to fill the gaps while the public are conflicted between those who want to help those who are unfortunate enough to end up on the streets and others who want to blame them for their predicament.</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live joined police officers Pc Hitt and his colleague Pc Aimee Bruty who have to work in the grey areas. To some eyes it appears that they are clamping down on the unfortunates, the sidelined and desperate, moving on the forlorn and hopeless. But just one wet and cold Saturday morning with them reveals a very different and extremely galling picture. It also points towards the naivety of the public and the conniving manner of people who are falsely claiming to be homeless.</p>
      <p>It's 8.30am and we are driving out of Charles Cross police station as it buckets down with rain. In recent weeks Pc Hitt has targeted begging on Mutley Plain and other areas of the city centre, posting his results on his Twitter account. He has weathered criticism, both online and in public, pointing out that he has gone to great lengths to signpost those he encounters to a host of support agencies, issuing numerous fair warnings before using legislation to move on people who are begging.</p>

        <figcaption>Police speak to a woman who had dragged her sleeping bag, blanket and bags out her nearby tent before settling down at a pitch in the North Cross underpass<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I have a rule of thumb", he said. "I ask who they area, where they are from and where they are living. I try to get to know something about them.</p>
      <p>"If they are genuinely homeless we can signpost them to get help. We give them an opportunity to engage with the agencies which really want to help them. And we remind them that begging is illegal. We give them warnings."</p>
      <p>Pc Hitt said one or two have quickly "taken the hint" and sought help.</p>
      <p>"There's been some who have accepted the help on offer and we've not seen them again. The more persistent ones, especially on Mutley Plain, thought I was joking. I'd go around the corner and they'd just carry on."</p>
      <p>Issuing Public Spaces Protection Orders which explains what a person can and can't do within a specified area - such as beg for money - has had an impact, but it doesn't last long, said Pc Hitt. If the weather's good or the money is, they're back in their patches.</p>
      <p>The issue of patches is remarkable. There are "prime spots" across the city centre which some individuals will nab as their own if they can set up shop early enough. Pc Hitt revealed that fights were not uncommon between 'beggars' keen to take over a more lucrative patch.</p>
      <p>Highlighting locations such as outside particular store in Southside Street and Notte Street, or a large underpass at North Cross, or next to cash machines at Derry's Cross, Pc Hitt said: "They will actually get up early to get the best pitch. Sometimes we've even got reports of them fighting over a pitch.</p>
      <p>"A few years back we arrested a lad who had a £700 a week heroin habit. He used to sit in the alley by the Sports Direct store, which was a main cut-through for a lot of people. He admitted he was making £100 a day which was all going on drugs. He was probably our most successful beggar."</p>
      <h3>'I felt guilty arresting him'</h3>
      <p>While it's easy to think this is a rarity, a one-off, today's visits to some of the most regular haunts shows the opposite. It also shows a certain kind of deviousness and cynical manipulation of kindly and well-meaning members of the public.</p>
      <p>Pc Hitt highlights a recent article on Plymouth Live about Nelson Barreto who appeared at Plymouth Magistrates' Court in October. He was fined £28 for persistently begging in Cornwall Street. The Portuguese man admitted he regularly set himself up by the Methodist church where he would hold out his hand to parishioners and shoppers.</p>

        <figcaption>Another "prime" begging pitch at the entrance to Cornwall Street<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The court heard how he was warned several times in two weeks by officers - Pc Hitt being one of them - about begging. Each time he was warned and each time he ignored the warning. He claimed he was no longer begging and was now selling The Big Issue magazine.</p>
      <p>When challenged by the chair of the bench, Barreto admitted he begged to feed his heroin habit, but was now on a methadone prescription and was engaging with the Harbour drug rehabilitation centre.</p>
      <p>Last week Barreto appeared in Magistrates' court again. This time, stating that he was of no fixed abode, he admitted stealing a St Luke's hospice charity box from a shop counter. He was fined £90.</p>
      <p>Pc Hitt said: "He's a nice guy, very polite and to be honest I felt guilty arresting him. But he has a heroin addiction. He told us he'd come down from Taunton after getting mixed up with the wrong crowd. He said he wants to go back to Portugal, be with his wife and child, but once you've mixed with the wrong crowd it's a slippery slope.</p>
      <p>"We tried to get him off that slippery slope. We took him to the One Stop Shop, contacted Harbour, see if they could help him get accommodation. We brought him in and said we wanted to help him. He told us he got an appointment with Harbour and we said we'd come along at the right time and help him.</p>
      <p>"We turned up. He didn't. Turns out he didn't even book an appointment with them."</p>

        <figcaption>Police speak to a man holding a sleeping at the North Cross underpass who said he was waiting for his brother - who lived with him in a house in Albert Road<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Pc Hitt revealed he and his colleagues have had to weather the disapproving looks and challenges from angry members of the public as they speak to beggars and give them warnings.</p>
      <p>"People see it as us picking on the homeless - we're not. We're trying to help them as well. We trying to tell them that there's got to be a better option out there.</p>
      <p>"The problem is when you do checks you find they often have an address or had housing and then ruined it, either by antisocial behaviour or committing crime. You hear from landlords who've said 'I've had enough'. We take them down to the One Stop or Harbour but they'll disengage.</p>
      <p>"People do become quite hostile towards us, giving us stick without knowing the full picture.</p>
      <p>"I'd rather people ask me what I'm doing - or just wait for a few minutes and then ask to speak to me in private rather than just come up and start filming and shouting at me from across the road. I'm happy to speak to people. I had one incident recently with a mum and her son and she got him to film me while hurling abuse.</p>
      <p>"People don't know what we're doing - we could be safeguarding people, but some people just assume we're picking on them."</p>
      <p>In December 2016 police joined forces with a host of city agencies, including Plymouth Against Retail Crime, the Salvation Army, Plymouth Access to Housing (PATH), housing providers Westward and BCHA and homeless charities Thames Reach and Shekinah, to warn Christmas shoppers not to give money to beggars, but to hand it to charities who worked at the sharp end with the homeless.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article2732787.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/20161210_132739.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>You Kindness Can Kill posters handed out in 2016</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Their advertising campaign showed the outline of a body on the ground made up with coins and the slogan "Your kindness could Kill", highlighting how money handed over could end up being spent on booze or drugs. At the time, the co-ordinator of the campaign noted how money handed over in perfectly good faith could actually have a negative effect.</p>
      <p>This was backed up after research from homelessness charity Thames Reach, in London, showed many people beg largely so they can buy drugs, particularly crack cocaine and heroin, and super-strength beers and ciders.</p>
      <h3>'We know it's a controversial issue'</h3>
      <p>Pc Hitt said: "We've found that addictions are invariably the underlying common denominator with people we see begging.</p>
      <p>"When we began focusing on the begging in Mutley Plain we knew it was a controversial issue, one that people were reluctant to look at. We found people sat down everywhere along the Plain. Generally speaking, you go down there now and there's far fewer."</p>
      <p>Within just four hours on patrol we encountered a number of beggars who can only be described as "fakers". Their connivance is quite astonishing and their forlorn appearance makes a mockery of those who are truly homeless and in dire need.</p>
      <p>Pc Bruty remarks to her colleague about the man they found begging in an alleyway beside the Oggy shop, opposite the Marks and Spencer's store. He had eight large Cornish pasties in his bag and a couple of bars of chocolate - all handed to him by concerned passersby.</p>
      <p>The pasties were not wanted and were destined for a bin because he'd already had his breakfast at the Shekinah and was keen to get money rather than food - primarily because local drug dealers don't take Cornish pasties as payment.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3525566.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-11-11-at-103432jpeg.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Another "prime" begging pitch at the entrance to Cornwall Street<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We pass the 'Wedding Cake' memorial on The Hoe which Pc Hitt said was plagued by people during the latter end of the summer causing problems for sunseekers and nearby coffee shops.</p>
      <p>He said there were "three or four, shouting and swearing, clothes thrown everywhere, sh*t and p*ss on the ground - it was horrible". They were eventually warned by police to move on or face arrest, and the officers were surprised to hear from local coffee shop staff that the group had been causing trouble for weeks - but no-one had called police.</p>
      <p>Pc Hitt said: "We didn't know anything about them because it's not a regular begging location - so their behaviour was going unchallenged."</p>
      <p>This morning as the rain pours down there are four men stood in the shelter, all drinking coffee. One runs over and politely explains a couple of them had slept out in the memorial overnight but were about to head to the Shekinah for breakfast - if the appalling weather eased up for long enough. He admitted another already had a place at the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>Behind Union Street's Crash Manor, a few yards from the Shekinah, is Bath Place where police have had reports of homeless setting up camp and drinking.</p>
      <h3>'He's absolutely persistent... and people fall for it'</h3>
      <p>Pc Hitt said a local who rented a nearby motorbike shop was "fed up with people walking in and out every day" in his place, clearly either stoned or drunk or both.</p>
      <p>We check another regular spot at the Friary Retail Park on Exeter Street. Nestled between the Costa Coffee and the Pets at Home store is a pitch were a man frequently sits, bearing his "Veteran - ex-forces" sign.</p>
      <p>PC Hitt explains the man is not ex-forces and has been arrested and charged in the past for fraud.</p>
      <p>"He's absolutely persistent. He'll stand by the trolleys where you have to pay a pound, holding is sign, knowing full well people will hand the pound over to him. It's really conniving. He's no scruples at all - and people fall for it.</p>
      <p>"I don't want people being conned out of their hard-earned money and I don't want to see someone using a veteran's sign when they're not a veteran.</p>
      <p>"If you really want to give something, then give to official sources." You can donate to Plymouth's biggest homeless charity Shekinah <a href="https://www.shekinah.co.uk/donate/help-for-the-homeless-/5/credit-card">here</a>.</p>
      <p>It's 9.30am and we're at the North Cross roundabout subway which reveals a prime spot - particularly the one leading directly to the train station.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3525561.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-11-11-at-103427jpeg.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Tent overlooking North Cross roundabout - about 100 yards from a "prime" begging pitch at the underpass<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Pc Hitt and Pc Bruty spot a small dome tent on the hill at North Road East, overlooking the roundabout. Pc Hitt reveals the tent has been there for a while and yet calls to the council have been met with a reluctance to move it.</p>
      <p>We decamp from the police van and the officers spot what appears to be a little old lady, huddled up with a sleeping bag, blanket and bags in the nearby subway. To anyone passing by she's clearly a rough sleeper, down on their luck, hiding from the rain.</p>
      <p>But closer inspection reveals someone else entirely. She moves quickly as she sees the officers approach. The "little old lady" isn't so old, isn't so little and it turns out, on occasion, isn't a lady. She's well known to the officers and a quick records check reveals she's a known heroin user and convicted heroin dealer who with her partner has been housed previously but lost their tenancy due to their criminal activities.</p>
      <p>She claims she's just waiting for her partner and that the tent is hers - it's where she's been living the last few days. She also admits she's been offered places to stay by friends, but has eschewed them for the time being. She insists she's not begging but can't explain why she decided to take her sleeping bag and blanket and carry them the 100 yards from her tent to the underpass where she sits, waiting as people walk to and from the rail station.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The owner of the tent had chosen to drag her sleeping bag, blanket and bags out into the rain before setting up her pitch in the North Cross underpass<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She's warned about the law regarding begging, urged to move on and as we leave Pc Hitt explains that despite her diminutive size and quivering voice, officers in the past have been on the receiving end of a volley of abuse from her when they've come to execute a drugs warrant at her former address.</p>
      <p>Pc Bruty notes how students, tourists and other kindly folk, just arriving or leaving the city by train, would probably walk past and take pity on her, seeing the sleeping bag and blanket, not knowing the woman's penchant for hard drugs. As we drive off the woman is sat on a nearby bench under a huge golf umbrella. </p>
      <h3>'I like living on the streets'</h3>
      <p>At the rail station the officers speak with two members of staff about an incident on Friday afternoon. A man collapsed from a suspected drugs overdose in the foyer. Rail staff performed CPR, but paramedics took over, using a defibrillator and what the staff member believed was a syringe of adrenaline to revive them.</p>
      <p>It turned out to be Naxolone - a life-saving drug created to reverse the effects of an opiate overdose. The reaction was instantaneous and stark - but the man refused to be taken to hospital for further treatment.</p>
      <p>It was only when he collapsed again a few moments later that the decision was taken out of his hands.</p>
      <p>All this took place in front of shocked train passengers at 3pm on a Friday. Clearly not the best advert for a city which is trying to welcome visitors.</p>
      <p>Pc Bruty points out it's certainly not fun for young female passengers to use the nearby car park, walking up the stairwell to be confronted by "people laid out with needles around them", which has happened in the past.</p>
      <p>At Mutley Plain, sat in a bus shelter outside a trendy coffee shop, are two men drinking from a bottle of Newcastle Brown ale and a can of beer respectively. Brown ale man is known to police - he's self-nicknamed Scouse Jimmy - who almost proudly says he's "NFA" - no fixed abode.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3525569.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-11-11-at-103423jpeg.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>"Scouse Jimmy" wanted to stay at the bus shelter drinking, when he wasn't arguing with his drinking buddy<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When asked why he was homeless by Pc Hitt, Scouse Jimmy replies indignantly: "I wanna be. I like living on the streets". As the officers suggest they both move on and put their empties in a bin, two young teenage girls approach, wanting to get a bus but clearly afraid to stand under the shelter as Scouse Jimmy and his friend argue about their drink and who is responsible for refuse collecting. Scouse Jimmy remonstrates with police but eventually gives in and wanders off, listing like a holed ship and arguing with his friend.</p>
      <p>The Tesco and Co-op stores in Notte Street are similarly notorious for people begging by their front doors and we drive past a number of times to check. Again, both officers have encountered people who purport to be homeless, but investigation reveals they are nothing of the sort and are playing on the naivety of students and grocery shoppers.</p>
      <p>Pc Hitt said: "You don't know what you're giving it for. You don't know where it will go. If people ever asked or found out before they handed over their well earned money, they may reconsider."</p>
      <p>Moments later were in New George Street and there's a young man sitting on a planter. He claims to be waiting for two PARC people who said they would give him Big Issue magazines and a tabard. He admits he's begging and that if he wasn't doing that he'd be out shoplifting or even mugging people.</p>
      <p>He's angry and exasperated, claiming that when he came out of prison in August he was handed little more than £50 and told to get on with it. He remonstrates with the two officers about the cost of living and what little he gets to survive on as nervous members of the public walk past and throw furtive glances at the scene.</p>
      <p>A quick PNC (Police National Computer) check reveals that about a week after being released from prison he was arrested on suspicion of PWITS (Possession With Intent To Supply). He visibly deflates and admits he blew the money he was given when he left prison on a large quantity of cheap Valium because he wanted to "party", but he then decided to sell some of the tablets.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3525573.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_WhatsApp-Image-2019-11-11-at-103421jpeg.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>One man remonstrated with police saying he couldn't afford to survive without begging since he left prison - but admitted he blew nearly all his money on Valium tablets a week after being released<cite>(Image: Carl Eve)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He asks what the officers would do in his situation, declares how embarrassing it is to be begging on the streets as "pretty girls walk by", how he can be expected to live on so little money.</p>
      <p>He begins to complain that the Salvation Army is making big money - around £1.3m he exclaims - by housing homeless people in Plymouth. He claims they demand more than £300 a week from him for a room, demands the officers call up the PARC guys on their radios because they've promised him copies of Big Issue and a tabard.</p>
      <p>Despite being under no obligation to - and despite being on an entirely different radio network - Pc Hitt gets a call handler to call up PARC and learns that the two PARC officers had actually told the man they would help him by getting a form which he could fill in to apply to become a Big Issue seller. They were briefly called away on a more urgent job but said they would return very soon. We also note that it's very unlikely the Salvation Army charge him £300 a week for a room - unless the Salvation Army is now in the habit of renting out penthouse suites at Devonport House. </p>
      <p>The officers leave the young man with a warning about begging and wish him luck with The Big Issue.</p>
      <p>We head back to North Cross roundabout and its underpasses. The sun has finally made an appearance, but it's still very cold. In one of the subways the officers find a man sitting on the ground, cross-legged, a sleeping bag laid across his legs.</p>
      <h3>'No-one we've spoken to is actually homeless'</h3>
      <p>They know who he is already, but just to be sure they ask his name and he answers, getting up and collecting his sleeping bag under his arm. He says he's waiting for his brother who is somewhere else in the city centre right now.</p>
      <p>A few PNC checks later and he wanders off. Pc Hitt tells me the young man and his brother are well known to him. The brothers both live at an address in Albert Road, Devonport and most likely travel by bus - with their sleeping bags - to a good pitch in the city centre where they sit and beg.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Pc Hitt observes: "He used to sit in Mutley Plain, saying he was homeless. He wasn't and we warned him to leave the area or face arrest. The sleeping bag is like a tool of the trade for him."</p>
      <p>Pc Bruty replies: "It's like the sleeping bag is an item for going equipped, like a burglar does with a screwdriver. Going equipped to commit fraud?</p>
      <p>"You know - no-one we've spoken to so far today is actually homeless. Either they've already got a place to live, or they have been offered a place to live, or had a place to live and had to leave because of the way they've behaved."</p>

      <p>As we head back to the station for a quick break Pc Hitt observes that Plymouth has previously been seen as a soft-touch by some chancers.</p>
      <p>He said: "We've had three people arrested off the train from Torquay in the past. They were intercepted at the train station. They admitted they were coming to the city because they heard it was easy pickings. They all had places to live but they had no intention of doing anything other than presenting themselves as homeless.</p>
      <p>"We're not trying to target true homeless people in real need. What we are trying to do is safeguard people. The guy who overdosed in the train station was someone who has begged for money from people, then gone and bought drugs. He nearly died because people were trying to be compassionate. But you're not feeding them when you give them money - you're feeding their problems and their addiction.</p>
      <p>"If you want to help them, give money to the charities who can really help them."</p>
