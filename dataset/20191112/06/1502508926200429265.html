      <p>Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital here after complaining of breathing difficulty, is still in a "critical" condition but is "slowly improving", hospital sources said.</p>
      <p>The 90-year-old Mangeshkar was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital in the early hours of Monday where Dr Patit Samdhani is treating her.</p>
      <p>"She is critical but her condition has slowly improved. She is still in the hospital," a hospital insider told PTI.</p>
      <p>However, the veteran singer's PR team in a statement on Tuesday said she was "stable".</p>
      <p>"Her parameters are good. Honestly speaking, she has fought so well that she is coming out of this setback. Being a singer, her lung capacity has pulled her through. Truly a fighter. We will update everyone when Lataji gets discharged and comes home. (We) request that we give family the space they deserve at the moment," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar has lent her voice for thousands of songs in Hindi, regional and foreign languages. Her last full album was for the late filmmaker Yash Chopra-directed 2004 film "Veer Zaara".</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar recorded her latest song this year - "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki", which was released on March 30 as a tribute to the Indian Army.</p>
      <p>She was awarded the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour in 2001.</p>
