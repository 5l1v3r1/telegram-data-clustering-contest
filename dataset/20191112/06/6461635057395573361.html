      <h3>One of the most important agendas for Barcelona is to sign a replacement for Luis Suarez in one of the two transfer windows in 2020.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has been one of the best strikers in the world over the last five years. Since checking in from Liverpool, the Uruguay international has notched 185 goals for the Catalans and also laid 97 assists. Suarez’s numbers are stunning, but there has come a time now when Barca need to start scouting replacements for him, given that he will be 33 years old in January.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez will always be remembered as a legend at the Camp Nou for his exploits and making mincemeat of opposition, with arch rivals Real Madrid being one of his favourite victims. With three league titles and a Champions League title to his name apart from several other trophies, Luis Suarez will be a difficult fixture to replace.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we have a look at five names who could potentially fill-in for the former Ajax Amsterdam striker in the years to come.</p>
      <h4>LAUTARO MARTINEZ</h4>
      <p>Lautaro Martinez has been strongly linked with a transfer to the Camp Nou since the last few months. The Argentina international is on the books of Inter Milan currently and is having a very good season under Antonio Conte. In 16 appearances this season, Martinez has eight goals to his name, including three strikes in the Champions League. Additionally, the 22 year old has assisted thrice as well.</p>
      <p>The Inter Milan man is valued at over 100 million euros but on Lionel Messi’s recommendation, the Blaugrana will be expected to go for a player who could perfectly fit into the Barca system. The likes of Juventus and Real Madrid are also thought to be monitoring Lautaro Martinez, but Barcelona have something which no other suitor has- Lionel Messi.</p>

      <h4>CARLES PEREZ</h4>
      <p>La Masia product Carles Perez has been an asset for the Blaugrana whenever he has featured for them. The 21 year old only got his opportunities with the first team under Ernesto Valverde starting from the pre-season earlier this year and it’s fair to say that he took his chances well, even when it came to La Liga.</p>
      <p>In seven appearances so far in the domestic league, Carles Perez has scored once and assisted thrice. Not to mention, these seven matches were not even completed by him as he featured for just 450 minutes. With such promising stats in only his first season, there’s no reason as to why Perez wouldn’t be the perfect in-house replacement for Suarez.</p>
      <h4>ANTOINE GRIEZMANN</h4>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann joined Barcelona in a rather controversial transfer coming in from Atletico Madrid for 120 million euros. The Catalans got themselves one of the world’s top strikers and the Frenchman did not disappoint having made a fast start to life at the Camp Nou. However, things did start slowing down later but that primarily has got to do with his role as a left winger, and not as a central forward which is Griezmann’s natural position.</p>
      <p>In his comfortable position of a striker, Griezmann has proven himself and even with relatively newer surroundings, the France international has scored four times and assisted thrice in La Liga Santander. Griezmann would be a fantastic successor to Suarez, but he needs to be welcomed into the squad by the senior players rather than be grudged against for the way he rejected Barca in the summer of 2018.</p>

      <h4>PIERRE-EMERICK AUBAMEYANG</h4>
      <p>Among a long list of names linked with the Catalans over the last couple of months, Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been the most newly established player on the Blaugrana radar.</p>
      <p>The Gabon international has been most recently named as the Gunners’ captain, but with Barca looming over him, he may quit the club if an offer comes his way.</p>
      <p>During his Borussia Dortmund days, Aubameyang did reveal an attraction and desire to join Real Madrid, but the Whites always trusted Karim Benzema. Eventually, Aubameyang moved to Arsenal where he won the Premier League’s Golden Boot in his first full season showing Barca’s rivals what exactly they missed on. Should Barcelona actually be interested in Aubameyang, then he is an amazing choice but would cost some money.</p>
      <h4>TAMMY ABRAHAM</h4>
      <p>Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham is the only player from the five suggested replacements who has not even passively been linked with a move to the Camp Nou. But the England international will certainly be a stunning signing and more so after catching the eye of most European teams after a blockbuster start to the campaign with Frank Lampard’s side.</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham is challenging for the Golden Boot in his very first season with the Blues, but more importantly, he has better statistical figures than the likes of Alvaro Morata, Olivier Giroud and Gonzalo Higuain. An amazing aerial ability, plus some very good control and composure on the ball whilst finishing are the main characteristics which make Abraham one of the chief replacements for Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Who do you think would be the best successor for Luis Suarez at the Camp Nou?</p>
