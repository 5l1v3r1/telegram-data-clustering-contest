        <b>Social media followers left a string of angry comments on a now-deleted post on the UK fashion brand’s Instagram account showing the 38-year-old royal during Remembrance Day services at the Cenotaph in Westminster on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the photo, the Duchess of Sussex wears a black, wide-brim Stephen Jones wool hat with a black lace dress, Dents cashmere-lined “Helene” black leather gloves ($109) and a black belted double-breasted coat by McCartney ($2,325). </p>
      <p>“So honoured to have HRH Duchess of Sussex in our Autumn ’19 coat at Remembrance Day service. x Stella,” the caption read.</p>
      <p>However, fans were displeased, as many felt it was inappropriate for McCartney to highlight Markle’s apparel on a day meant to pay respect to those who had given their lives to protect their country.</p>
      <blockquote>“Remembrance day is to honour those that fought for us not to use for advertising purposes. Pretty shocked,” one follower wrote. “Using remembrance day to advertise your clothes is a little disrespectful!! People died and you take pictures of people showing respect for advertising purposes. Just wrong,” another commentator suggested.</blockquote>
      <p>Meghan has worn McCartney's designs a number of times, including at the reception following her royal wedding to Prince Harry. The duchess was in a white, high-neck number as she and Prince Harry stepped out for their private evening reception at Windsor's Frogmore House.</p>
