      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, there was a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/bitcoin-btc-price-rebound-facing-key-resistance-near-9100/">decent recovery</a> in bitcoin above $8,850 and $8,900 against the US Dollar. Moreover, BTC climbed above the $9,000 resistance and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>However, the upward move was capped by the $9,150 resistance. A high was formed near $9,150 and the price started another decline. It broke many supports near the $9,000 and $8,900 levels.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a close below $8,850 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. Finally, the price broke the $8,700 level and traded to a new monthly low near the $8,612 low.</p>
      <p>It is currently correcting higher above the $8,700 level. Besides, bitcoin is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,150 high to $8,612 low. On the upside, there are <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/10/bitcoin-btc-price-weekly-forecast-more-downsides-likely/">many resistances</a>, starting with $8,800 and up to $9,000.</p>
      <p>The first major resistance is near the $8,880 level and the 100 hourly SMA. It also represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $9,150 high to $8,612 low.</p>
      <p>The main resistance on the upside is near the $9,000 level. More importantly, yesterday’s major bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $8,980 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, bitcoin is likely to face a strong resistance near the $8,880 and $9,000 levels.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $8,680 level. The first key support is near the $8,600 level, below which there is a risk of an extended decline towards the $8,500 support area.</p>
