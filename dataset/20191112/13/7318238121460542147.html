      <p>Hungary's economic figures prove the country does not suffer from systematic corruption, its foreign minister has told Euronews.</p>
      <p>Péter Szijjártó was hitting back at a report by OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud office, that there were irregularities regarding Hungary's use of the bloc's cohesion funds.</p>
      <p>Szijjártó, Hungary's foreign and trade minister, said he did not know how OLAF had come to that conclusion.</p>
      <p>"Look at countries with serious corruption problems... if there's a systematic rate of corruption then money disappears. If there's no systematic corruption, money does not disappear," said.</p>
      <p>He said Hungary's employment and growth rates proved that there was no corruption problem.</p>
      <p>But in September, OLAF, the EU's anti-fraud agency, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/03/hungary-tops-eu-anti-fraud-investigations">released a report</a> that stated almost 4% of development funding that went to Hungary between 2014-2018 is in question.</p>
      <p>This was the highest percentage in the EU.</p>
      <p>When asked about why the anti-fraud agency said there were irregularities, Szijjártó replied: "Ask them. I don't know."</p>
      <p>Transparency International ranks Hungary 64 out of 180 countries on its corruption perceptions index.</p>
      <p>It is ranked at the bottom of the corruption index for EU countries, third lowest after Bulgaria and Greece.</p>
