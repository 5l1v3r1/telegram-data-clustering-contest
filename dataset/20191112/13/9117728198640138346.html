        <b>With just two races to go in the 2019 season, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> rookie <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> is eager to find out how close his MCL34 is to the top three teams currently ahead of McLaren, as the Brit will race for the first time at Interlagos on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Norris did complete FP1 for McLaren last season in Brazil, meaning he does have some on-track experience there, unlike some of the other drivers on the grid.</p>

      <p>Coming off the back of the United States Grand Prix, in which the 19-year-old finished seventh in what was his last race as a teenager, he hopes to be part of an entertaining race in Brazil, as they have been in the past.</p>
      <p><i>"It’s been the scene of some awesome races in the past, and I’m hoping for a good race of my own on Sunday,"</i> the rookie said when looking ahead to his first-ever Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"FP1 last year gave me the opportunity to learn the track, but I’ve been working hard in the simulator to make sure I can maximise performance as soon as we get started on Friday."</i>

      <p>Sitting in fourth place in the constructors' championship, McLaren have at times looked like they could challenge some of the top three teams, something which was unthinkable in previous seasons. Norris is eager to find out how they stack up at Interlagos.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There’s still work to be done and we’ll be pushing hard in every session to see how close we can get to the top teams. They’re still a long way off and our nearest rivals are very close but I'm looking forward to some good racing."</i>
