      <p>ULAANBAATAR (Mongolia): Two Indian boxers -- <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ankit-Narwal">Ankit Narwal</a> (60kg) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aman">Aman</a> (+91kg) -- advanced to the quarterfinals of the Asian Youth Championships on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>While Aman defeated Uzbekistan's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Makhmudov-Mimukhsin">Makhmudov Mimukhsin</a> 5-0, Ankit pravailed 3-2 over Mongolia's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tulga-Oyunbaatar">Tulga Oyunbaatar</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Mohit (75kg) lost 2-3 to Kazakhstan's Bektas to bow out in the opening round itself.</p>
      <p>India were assured of two medals in the event after Komalpreet Kaur (+81kg) and Sushma (81kg) got direct entry into the semifinals owing to the small size of their respective draws in the women's competition.</p>
      <p>The event features 180 boxers -- 113 men and 67 women -- representing 16 countries in the continent.</p>
