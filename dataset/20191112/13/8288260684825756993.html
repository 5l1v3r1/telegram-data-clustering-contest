      <p>Appearing on the YouTube show Filthy Fellas, Mitch said: "I went to Liverpool and it's still a s***hole.</p>
      <p>"I went there, people still haven't got jobs."</p>
      <p> </p>

      <p>A second video has also surfaced in which again made derogatory marks about the city when discussing Steven Gerrard' s move from the Reds to LA Galaxy, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bbc-presenter-craig-mitch-forced-20866468">reports Mirror Online.</a></p>
      <p>"He's going to a developed area. That's all it is," says the presenter.</p>
      <p>"He's leaving a deprived area and going to a very developed area where there's sun and low crime rates."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mitch said: "There is a video of me making insensitive jokes about Liverpool from 5 years ago on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"This was clipped from an old episode of a YouTube show. I apologise for the offence these comments could cause and just know, these are not my actual views about a place I have a lot of respect for.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes as football fans, we take banter too far. Back then, I did and I apologise for that."</p>
