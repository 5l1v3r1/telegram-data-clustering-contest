      <h2>Crystal Palace news including an update on the injury doubts facing Jurgen Klopp's side</h2>

      <p>Premier League leaders Liverpool have two major injury doubts ahead of their trip to Crystal Palace after the international break.</p>
      <p>Both striker Mohamed Salah and full-back Andy Robertson are both fighting to be fit for the trip to Selhurst Park as they nurse ankle injuries.</p>
      <p>Salah has been struggling with a problem with his ankle after having to leave the field in the club's 2-1 win over Leicester City at the start of October.</p>
      <p>The injury kept the forward out of the 1-1 draw with Manchester United the following week, and although he has been able to start every Premier League match since then, he is yet to complete 90 minutes in the league.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian forward aggravated the problem in the club's 3-1 win over Manchester City on Sunday, and has been pulled out of his national team's games vs Kenya and Comoros over the international break.</p>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/latest-mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-17243198">Liverpool Echo</a> , the 27-year-old could miss the match against Palace on 23rd November.</p>
      <p>But Salah is not the only injury concern for Jurgen Klopp ahead of the return of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Scottish full-back Andy Robertson is also a major doubt after withdrawing from the Scotland squad with a swollen ankle.</p>
      <p>The former Hull City man will not take part in any of the Tartan Army's games, but is staying with Steve Clarke's men for a few days before heading back to Anfield to be assessed by Liverpool's medical team.</p>
      <p>Should both players not make it back to fitness in time, it could serve as a major blow to Jurgen Klopp's men and a boost to Roy Hodgson's team as they hope to cause an upset.</p>
