      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:00:54+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/robvanstone" target="_blank">Rob Vanstone</a></address>
      <p>Jay Onrait will be on-stage on Friday.</p>
      <p>He will be in Regina later this week, alongside “SC at SportsCentre” cohort Dan O’Toole, for a recording of the popular “Jay and Dan Podcast” at the Conexus Arts Centre.</p>
      <p>The TSN duo will also attend Saturday’s Regina Pats WHL home game against the Prince Albert Raiders for “Experience Regina Night.”</p>
      <p>In advance of the visit, Onrait — a former Global Saskatoon sportscaster who has relatives in Balcarres — chatted with Regina Leader-Post sports editor Rob Vanstone.</p>

        <b>Q: What can the Regina audience expect from the podcast on Friday?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: If you had asked me before the tour started, I might have had a set answer. But what has happened over the course of the year is that every show has turned out to be different. There’s a bunch of different clips that we play — and I don’t want to give too much away — and that sort of forms the skeleton of the show, the structure of the show, and we play off these clips. Just like the TV show, we do a lot of ad-libbing. What we’ve found is that the further into the Prairies that we’ve gone, the more ad-libbing we are doing and the more we are talking about the town that we are in. For instance, we were just in Saskatoon. We spent the first 30 minutes of the show talking about our experiences in Saskatoon and the fact that I had lived there. I think Regina will be very similar, because we’ve both spent a lot of time there and we both really love the city. I think you can expect lots of talk about Regina and then a little journey through our broadcasting careers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Will Cody Fajardo be invited or have a presence?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I would love to have Cody on the podcast. I haven’t reached out to Cody, but I do have an idea that I want to present to our podcast audience about Cody. It involves something that I’ve wanted to do at Mosaic Stadium after every Fajardo touchdown, whether it’s him throwing for a touchdown or running for a touchdown. I want to see if I can establish a unique cheer that will go down in history as one of the great things that the fans of the Saskatchewan Roughriders will ever do. But it’s a little involved. I can’t explain it in the interview. You’re going to have to come to the podcast and participate to get it going. We’ve been very excited about it for a long time, so I’m hopeful that at the West final, the Sunday after we’re at Conexus, the fans will be adopting our cheer. Obviously, that would mean that Fajardo has thrown for a bunch of touchdowns, so that’s also good news.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: When Team Canada played pre-tournament games here in advance of the 2010 world junior hockey championship, there were attempts to get people to do the manufactured “Eh Oh Canada Go!” cheer and adopt it. I hope your Fajardo cheer does better than “Eh Oh Canada Go!”</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I’m so glad you brought that up. That was so rough. Their heart was in the right place, because there are times when I wish Canadian crowds were louder. Anytime you try to force that type of cheer on a crowd, it’s never going to work. I think this one will work because there’s a unique prompt to the cheer that makes it simple, and the only thing the fans have to say is “Fajardo.”</p>

        <b>Q: Why isn’t this event being held in Balcarres?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: As usual, the Balcarres hall is booked on a Friday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: But I just went on the Town of Balcarres’ website and clicked on “Town Calendar” and November is completely open!</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Maybe they’d just prefer that we go to Indian Head or Fort Qu’Appelle. Maybe they didn’t just want us to bring our act to Balcarres, the pride of the Prairies. I don’t know if I’ll make it back to Balcarres this time, but there are a lot of memories at the Balcarres hotel bar. The last time I was there, I understood that it was for sale. It was very tempting to pull a Brent Butt and just buy the Balcarres hotel and turn it into a hipster haven — sort of a weekend destination for young Reginans.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You don’t know that you’ve made it until you’ve bought a nightclub or a bar. Look at Joe Namath with Bachelors III.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It’s a symbol of success, and it always ends in failure, no matter who tries to do it. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t give it a shot. I remember when we were in Kyle, Saskatchewan, a few years ago. In Kyle, there’s a hotel called the White Bear Hotel, and they serve the most delicious chicken wings I’ve ever had in my entire life. We were there for the Kraft Celebration Tour. Someone said, “You know, this place is for sale, and it includes the recipes,” and that was the closest I ever came to really considering it, because I thought the price was quite reasonable considering the quality of the food and the uniqueness of the situation. But someone else purchased the White Bear Hotel and, let’s be honest, that’s probably for the best for the longevity of the place.</p>

        <b>Q: Why is it “Jay and Dan” and not “Dan and Jay”? Do you have a better agent than he does?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I think we decided that it just sounds better. I think it just rolls off the tongue better. A lot of times, you go alphabetically. I think we tried that and something about it just didn’t feel right. “Jay and Dan” just somehow feels right — at least that’s what I tell Dan when he has too many drinks and asks me that same question.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: I was doing a Wikipedia search for “Jay Onrait.” Everything is pretty standard except for the part which says “Onrait is unusually tall.” It makes it sound like you are a giraffe or Yao Ming. What is it like to be “unusually tall”?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I’m not THAT tall. I’m 6-6 and that’s tall, obviously, but there are taller people than me. There are other things in that Wikipedia entry that are so off-base and offensive but, for whatever reason, I keep neglecting to change it. I’m leaving it to the people to how they want my Wikipedia page to read. But I’m just like you. We are like that at “SportsCentre with Jay and Dan.” When it comes to research, we go straight to Wiki.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: I love jazz. You love jazz. But, honestly, is there a worse nickname in sports than Utah Jazz? </b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I guess it’s an inappropriate nickname for the geographical location, but they were previously the New Orleans Jazz, which makes sense. I wonder if there is a way to fix it all. Take the Memphis Grizzlies. Are there Grizzlies in Tennessee? That was from Vancouver. To me, the Sacramento Kings should give their name to Memphis, because Memphis is the home of The King. That makes sense. So then Utah should give their name back to New Orleans. I know the Pelicans are the state bird, but Jazz just sounds better. It’s so bad with Utah, but it sounds so cool with New Orleans. Maybe we could give Pelicans to Sacramento because, let’s be honest, no one really cares about Sacramento.</p>

        <b>Q: If the Roughriders win the Grey Cup on Nov. 24, what is that Sunday evening’s edition of “SC with Jay and Dan” going to be like?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: You know, it’s so funny, because when we returned to Canada, one of the things we assumed is that we would be taking this new show on the road to the Grey Cup every year, and that hasn’t happened. I’m hopeful that next year, when the Grey Cup is in Regina, we can make amends, and we can do our show each and every day of Grey Cup week at O’Hanlon’s. We can just serve up pizzas and have a great time. Dan said it best on the show: “The Grey Cup is the one sporting event in our country that I feel every sports fan needs to attend at least once.” It’s such a fascinating and fun and wonderful party. I can only imagine what it’s going to be like next year in Regina, and Calgary will be a great host, too. That show on Nov. 24 will obviously be Grey Cup-focused, but we will still be in the most un-Grey Cup of locations — Scarborough, Ontario.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: If you do “SC with Jay and Dan” from O’Hanlon’s, can you apply the perfect capper and buy O’Hanlon’s afterwards?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: That would be amazing! I love that idea. Did I mention that the pizza is so delicious there? You know, there’s something unique about pizza on the Prairies. Those are the types of things that you don’t realize when you grow up on the Prairies. And then you leave and you come back and you’re like, “Oh yeah. This is what pizza, in my mind, should taste like.” The crust is a little thicker, but not thick crust. The cheese looks like a “before” picture of a Lactaid commercial. They’re not shy with the toppings, and it’s just a delicious experience at 2 o’clock in the morning or whenever you’re having it. But I would absolutely love to do the show from O’Hanlon’s. That would be great.</p>
