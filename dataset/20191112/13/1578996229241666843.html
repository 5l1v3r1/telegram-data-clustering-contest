      <h1>Kristen Stewart's Rainbow Sequined Cutout Dress Was the Glitziest Thing on the 'Charlie's Angels' Red Carpet</h1>

      <p>Kudos to Kristen Stewart, who literally outshone everyone in the glitziest rainbow sequin cutout dress at the <i>Charlie's Angels </i>premiere in Los Angeles last night. Stewart wore the Germanier statement piece with navy Le Silla heels. Her co-stars Ella Balinska and Naomi Scott dressed elegantly, Balinska in a pretty nude Vera Wang gown and Scott in a sharp black Givenchy dress. Director Elizabeth Banks also incorporated some sparkle into her look with her two-toned dress. Really, everyone looked great:</p>

      <p>Stewart's big premiere look comes days after she gave a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29702024/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-marriage-interview/">very revealing interview </a>to Howard Stern while promoting the film. Stewart talked to the host candidly about her romance with Robert Pattinson during her <i>Twilight </i>days.</p>
      <p>Stern asked if she thought she'd marry Pattinson. "I don’t know, I wanted to…yeah, no, I think I’ve never been in—" she started. When Stern asked more plainly if she would've said yes if Pattinson proposed, Stewart eventually admitted that yes, she would've.</p>
      <p><b>"</b>I don’t know. I’m not a super duper traditionalist, but at the same time, like yeah," she said. "Every relationship I’ve ever been in, I thought that was it. I’ve never like casually—maybe one or two, okay, I’m not giving everyone that due. I’ve never really been the most casual person."</p>
      <p>She confirmed that yes, they were a very real couple who were trying to balance privacy with fame during their heyday. <b>"</b>We were together for years, that was my first [love]," she said, adding that Pattinson is still "the best," even now.</p>
