      <h2>Whether Apple is doing Black Friday this year is still under wraps - but that hasn't stopped major price cuts launching on Apple products at Currys and John Lewis - including their new 2019 MacBook</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:21:30+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/apple">Apple</a> joined in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> excitement a few years back, but rather than slashing the prices on their famous products, they usually offer gift cards instead on the big day.</p>
      <p>The tech giant is unlikely to unveil any information about its Black Friday deals and discounts until the big day, but if you can't hold out until then, there's often still plenty of other Apple bargains to be had on other online retailers.</p>
      <p>Last year, everything from iPhones, Macbooks, iPads and even Apple TV, Apple Watch and Beats headphones had some form of Black Friday offer attached to it, so we're expecting some similar deals to be revealed this year.</p>
      <p>If you can't wait until November 29th, we've already seen a few early price cuts appear on Apple products, such as at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fcomputing%2Ftablets-and-ereaders%2Ftablets%2F149_3402_32003_xx_xx%2Fxx-criteria.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fapple-black-friday-deals-2019-20866527">Currys PC World,</a> where iPads are down to just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fcomputing%2Ftablets-and-ereaders%2Ftablets%2F149_3402_32003_xx_xx%2Fxx-criteria.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fapple-black-friday-deals-2019-20866527">£289</a> ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Usually £319, the discount is on Apple's 2018 9.7-inch 32GB offering, which uses exactly the same processing chip as the 2019 model but without a few of the hardware design changes that streamline the latest model. So while it doesn't look identical, it works just the same.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile at John Lewis, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2F2019-apple-macbook-air-13-3-inch-retina-display-intel-core-i5-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd%2Fspace-grey%2Fp4259064&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fapple-black-friday-deals-2019-20866527">MacBook Airs</a> are <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2F2019-apple-macbook-air-13-3-inch-retina-display-intel-core-i5-8gb-ram-128gb-ssd%2Fspace-grey%2Fp4259064&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fapple-black-friday-deals-2019-20866527">now £985</a> rather than £1,057 - a rare discount on a new release. The new MacBook is one of the thinnest and lightest MacBooks money can buy, complete with a Core i5 CPU and 8GB RAM, you'll also get a year of Apple TV+ thrown in too for free.</p>
      <h3>Do Apple products go on sale for Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>You can absolutely expect discounts on Apple items over Black Friday, although whether they'll come direct from Apple is a different question.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Last year, Apple offered a £40 gift card with selected iPhones, Apple Watch, HomePod, Apple TV and Beats headphones, an £80 gift card with selected iPads, and £160 gift card with selected MacBooks, iMacs and Macs.</p>
      <p>If you don't want a gift card though, you can probably find a very decent deal elsewhere online on the big day.</p>
