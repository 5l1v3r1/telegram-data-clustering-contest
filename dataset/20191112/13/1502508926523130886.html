      <h1>Huawei to spend $285 mn on bonus to employees for coping with US sanctions</h1>
      <h2>Huawei's 180,000-member workforce also will receive an extra month's salary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:25:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">AP | PTI</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>is paying its employees bonuses for helping the Chinese tech giant cope with US sanctions that threaten its smartphone and other businesses.</p>
      <p>A company announcement circulated Tuesday on social media said 90,000 employees will share 2 billion yuan ($ 285 million), or about 22,000 yuan ($ 3,100) each.</p>
      <p>Huawei's 180,000-member workforce also will receive an extra month's salary.</p>
      <p>In a written response to questions, the company confirmed the document was genuine but said it had no comment.</p>
      <p>The announcement told employees the bonuses were to "thank you for your efforts" since US curbs on technology sales to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-huawei">Huawei </a>were announced in May.</p>
      <p>The larger bonus goes to employees in chip production, research and development and manufacturing-related jobs.</p>
      <p>The company has overhauled its product line to reduce use of US components.</p>
