      <p>The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, which was leading the investigation into the missing girl, "will await confirmation as forensics tests are completed," Demopolis police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Operational efforts will now shift to secure and process the evidence at the scene," police added.</p>
      <p>The search for the 5-year-old girl began on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>She was allegedly last seen in her home in Jacksonville around midnight on Wednesday when her mother put her to bed. The mother, Brianna Williams, said when she woke up around 7 a.m. she noticed the back door to the home was unlocked and Taylor wasn't in her room, according to authorities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mom-named-person-interest-disappearance-year-jacksonville-girl/story?id=66910209">Brianna Williams was named a person of interest</a> in the case on Monday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/amber-alert-issued-florida-missing-year-girl/story?id=66813441">Brianna Williams is not cooperating with investigators</a> and has not spoken to authorities since Wednesday, the day Taylor was reported missing.</p>
