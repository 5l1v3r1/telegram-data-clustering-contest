      <h4>What just happened? A new trailer for the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie has dropped, showing off the redesigned blue hero who now looks much closer to the computer game version and less like a nightmarish human-beast hybrid.</h4>
      <p>Back in March, we got worrying hints of what Paramount Pictures had in store for Sonic, with the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/79035-check-out-weird-movie-version-sonic-hedgehog.html">first poster</a> for the movie showing a silhouette that revealed his weirdly muscular, hairy legs. Fans’ fears were confirmed once the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/79874-fans-arent-happy-first-sonic-hedgehog-movie-trailer.html">first trailer</a> arrived in April, as they gasped in horror at his normal-sized eyes, white fur on his hands instead of gloves, and, most disturbingly, a mouth full of human teeth.</p>
      <p>Such was the outcry over this bizarre-looking Sonic, the movie’s director, Jeff Fowler, <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/79921-sonic-director-promises-change-character-design-following-outcry.html">promised</a> that changes would be made to the character before the release in November. “The message is loud and clear... you aren’t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It’s going to happen,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Six months didn’t seem very long to redo a CGI character completely in a feature-length title, and, surely enough, Fowler later <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/80225-sonic-hedgehog-movie-director-announces-three-month-delay.html">said</a> the movie's launch would be pushed back three months to February 2020.</p>
      <p>Now, a new trailer gives us a look at this updated Sonic, and things are a lot better. His body isn’t as long and thin as it was, and his eyes are much bigger, with less of a gap between them. But best of all are his teeth, which are fewer in number and a lot more subtle.</p>
      <p>Whatever your opinion of the trailer, at least this Sonic looks like he should, but whether the final movie will be any good remains to be seen.</p>
