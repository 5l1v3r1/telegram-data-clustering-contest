      <p>A little boy has been left in crippling pain when he walks after losing his fingers and toes to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">sepsis</a> .</p>
      <p>Jakub Kolek, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> , was 18-months old when he became ill in October 2016 with a high temperature.</p>
      <p>The next day, his parents Karina and Pawel, 37, found him unconscious and struggling to breathe.</p>
      <p>They rushed him to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh-royal-hospital-for-sick-children">Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh</a> , where they were given the devastating news that Jakub, now aged five, had <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">sepsis</a> .</p>

      <p>Within three months of the diagnosis, the tot's fingers and toes had turned black and dropped off.</p>
      <p>Karina said: "While he was in hospital, his fingers went black and cold, we were told that they had died and most of them had to be cut off.</p>
      <p>"The same thing happened to his feet and he lost all of his toes and the tissue in his feet and legs were badly damaged."</p>
      <p>Jakub's family are now trying to raise £60,000 for a life-changing operation to help him walk.</p>
      <p>His dad Pawel, recalled the horror they felt as the severity of the illness became apparent.</p>

      <p>Pawel added: "It all happened really quickly, when we arrived he was only half breathing and he was still unconscious.</p>
      <p>"As soon as we got into the hospital he was taken away, doctors were surrounding him and giving him injections."</p>
      <p>In January 2017, the family were finally allowed to take Jakub home to Wester Hailes, Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Jakub learnt to play with toys without his digits, but when he tried to walk the extent of the damage became apparent to his distraught parents.</p>
      <p>Dad Pawel said: "He would try and try to walk but we could see he was in pain after just a few steps."</p>
      <p>Medics told the family that Jakub's insoles were not developing, and his left foot had lost tissue from the sepsis.</p>
      <p>Where his heel should be, the bone protrudes, causing further twisting of the foot.</p>

      <p>On June 16 2018, Jakub underwent more surgery to scold the bone so that he could move.</p>
      <p>But a year later, the bone is continuing to grow, causing severe pain when Jakub tries to walk or play with his sister.</p>
      <p>Pawel said: "When we go to the playground with him and his sister, he tries to run on his feet but always falls over and gets left behind.</p>
      <p>"He ends up in so much pain that he has to ask us to carry him, and he gets very frustrated by this as he is an active boy who wants to run."</p>
      <p>As Jakub grew, his disability intensified, with the family starting to "lose hope" that their son would be able to "lead a normal life".</p>
      <p>In desperation, his parents took to the internet to find help.</p>
      <p>The family were ecstatic when they received a message from Dr Dror Paley, a world-leading orthopedic surgeon, specialising in limb lengthening in Florida.</p>
      <p>Dr Paley invited the family to London for a meeting where he told them about an operation, not available in the UK, to lengthen Jakub's feet and sculpt an in-sole.</p>
      <p>The op costs £60,095, and surgery has been pencilled in for April - and Pawel is hopeful the surgery will allow his son to walk upright without pain for the first time in his life.</p>
      <p>Pawel said: "When we went to the appointment in London it was the first time in a long time that I saw a chance for our son."</p>
