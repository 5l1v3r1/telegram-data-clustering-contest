      <p>Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s reply to a student who asked him to teach a new word is going viral for all the right reasons.</p>
      <p>The Thiruvananthapuram MP posted a video on his Twitter page in which he replied to a student who asked him to teach him and the crowd a new word in view of his reputation as a 'fount of exotic vocabulary' with a “very simple, very old word.”</p>
      <p>And the word the leader suggested was, ‘read’.</p>

      <p>The former statesman told students that reading was the only way he acquired vocabulary and he has barely opened a dictionary. "If you read widely, read extensively and you come across a word in three different contexts in three different books, you understand the meaning and the usage very quickly," he explained.</p>
      <p>Saying that he was an asthmatic child and he was often confined to the bed, Tharoor said he considered books as his escape and education. "My only advice to all of you is read, read, read! The more you read the better your vocabulary will also be," he said amidst applause from the audience.</p>
      <p>The video was well received by Twitterati, with many praising the leader and agreeing with him and calling his advice, "Excellent."</p>
