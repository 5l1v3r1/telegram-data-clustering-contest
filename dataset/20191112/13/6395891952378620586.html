      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, the Senate's first Asian-American woman and only current immigrant, is working on a memoir.</p>
      <p>Viking announced Tuesday that the book, currently untitled, will come out in 2021.</p>
      <p>Hirono, 72, will write about emigrating at age 8 to the United States after her mother fled an abusive marriage in Japan. In a statement issued through Viking, Hirono said the book was a tribute to her late mother's spirit and a chance "to bear witness on her behalf by telling the story of the daughter she inspired to live boldly."</p>
      <p>Hirono, a Democrat, made news last year as a leading critic of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual harassment and attempted assault. Kavanuagh, who was narrowly confirmed, denied the allegations.</p>
