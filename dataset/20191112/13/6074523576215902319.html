      <h1>AlphaPoint’s White Label Tech Now Lets Crypto Exchanges Offer Margin Trading</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:00:05+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Danny Nelson</a></address>
      <p>Crypto software firm AlphaPoint is bringing margin trading to its client exchanges.</p>
      <p>Announced Tuesday at CoinDesk’s Invest NYC conference, the technology provider is adding support for margin trading, with a raft of trading options and controls for crypto brokerages and exchanges utilizing its software. </p>
      <p>AlphaPoint’s platform is customizable, to better serve clients operating in different markets and regulatory regimes, spokesman Patrick Shields told CoinDesk:</p>
      <p>“Rather than creating a one-size fits all model, we focused on creating a platform that is highly configurable,” he said. “Some examples include requiring approval workflow for end users, and configurable minimum deposit size, leverage and liquidation levels, fees and other settings.”</p>
      <p>At launch, the company said that no clients were immediately implementing AlphaPoint margin trading, but “several firms” are beta testing the platform, including the Canadian cryptocurrency trader National Digital Asset Exchange (NDAX), according to a press release.</p>
      <p>Bilal Hammoud, NDAX founder and CEO, said in a statement that he looked forward to the partnership:</p>
      <blockquote>“We will bring BTC to CAD margin trading to Cryptocurrency and allow traders to enjoy a secure, compliant, and technologically advanced platform.”</blockquote>
      <p>Margin trading – when one buys a security (or in this case a cryptocurrency) using borrowed funds – is becoming increasingly prevalent in the crypto space as many popular exchanges continue implementing the feature. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-launches-platform-2-0-as-margin-trading-goes-live">Binance</a> rolled out margin trading in July, and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bakkt-ceo-crypto-trading-platform-wont-support-margin-trading">Bakkt</a>, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-institutional-traders-margin-bitcoin">Coinbase</a>’s professional trading platform and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/information/how-to-trade-crypto-on-kraken">Kraken</a> all have the option.</p>
      <p>But that increase has not come without pushback. Certain countries around the world have <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/malta-finance-regulator-warns-crypto-margin-trading-site">discouraged</a> crypto margin trades and placed tight controls on the practice, as in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/japan-to-tighten-rules-on-cryptocurrency-margin-trading">Japan</a>. </p>
