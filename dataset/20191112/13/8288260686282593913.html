      <h2>Lesley MacLennan, 85, made her name in her early twenties in Paris - working with Yves Saint Laurent himself when he was still an emerging designer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:49:49+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A former catwalk model with dementia has been given a fashion shoot to help her care - after she was spotted in her OAP home by a top Vogue photographer.</p>
      <p>Lesley MacLennan, 85, made her name in her early twenties in Paris - working with Yves Saint Laurent himself when he was still an emerging designer.</p>
      <p>She later encountered him again at Dior working with him both on the catwalk and in front of the camera.</p>
      <p>Lesley is now in a care home when one day she was spotted by high-end fashion photographer James Muller - who was visiting another resident.</p>
      <p>He said he was immediately struck by her "beautiful hands and the way she carries herself" - and she told him about her career.</p>
      <p>James then said he wanted to capture her "poise and class" and hair and makeup was arranged to do a fashion shoot more than sixty years after her career began.</p>

      <p>Her carers say finding ''something that motivates'' dementia sufferers ''can have huge benefits for their wellbeing and state of mind''.</p>
      <p>International photographer James, whose work has been featured in Vogue, was visiting a friend at Huntington House in Hindhead, Surrey, when he met Lesley.</p>
      <p>"I met Lesley in passing and thought how amazing it would be to capture her beauty again," said James, who is based in Farnham, Surrey.</p>

      <p>"When I asked her to look my way or turn her face, she did it with such grace – an absolute professional. She was very easy to direct.</p>
      <p>"I kept wanting to bring her beautiful hands in to the frame and every time I asked her to, she did so with poise.</p>

      <p>"I feel very honoured to have photographed Lesley, she has lived such a colourful life and to be a small part of it is magical. She’s an absolute delight."</p>
      <p>He added: "At the end of the shoot she held my hand and told me how much she enjoyed working with me.</p>
      <p>"I was truly touched and will never forget that moment. This is something that will stay with me forever, something I'll treasure."</p>

      <p>Lesley moved to London in her early twenties after her mother spotted her potential, and then made her way to Paris, where she met Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
      <p>Stunning black and white photos from 60 years ago show a stunning young Lesley modelling glamorous coats and large, furry hats.</p>
      <p>And today, she seems just as glamorous and comfortable in front of a camera.</p>

      <p>Speaking of her photoshoot with James, Lesley said: "I thoroughly enjoyed the photo shoot.</p>
      <p>"James made me feel perfectly at ease, he was the real McCoy. I would have said so if he wasn’t.</p>
      <p>"The red and black outfit was so vibrant, it was stunning. I just thought it was a dream.''</p>
      <p>And James admitted that he struggled to find many examples of models or actors of Lesley’s age when looking for inspiration for the shoot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "I did a bit of research on models and actors Lesley's age - there aren't many, which I think is sad.</p>
      <p>"But I looked at photos of Dame Helen Mirren, who I find inspirational, and supermodel Carmen Dell'Orefice, who is still a catwalk queen at 88 and the world’s oldest working model.</p>

      <p>"I drew a lot of inspiration from those images.</p>
      <p>"Age to me is just a number. During our shoot, Lesley was 'that' model again. Age made no difference.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure she has worked with many a top photographer so for me to get the opportunity at her age is simply incredible.</p>

      <p>"I think there aren't enough older models out there in the media. In many ways, social media etc. is telling us that it's wrong to age, but it's such a natural thing.</p>
      <p>"There is so much beauty in ageing too - we've just been taught to look at it the wrong way.</p>
      <p>"I'm all for taking care of yourself but also all for self-acceptance in the bodies we have and ageing," said James.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Charlie Hoare, director of the Huntington and Langham Estate where Huntington House is based, said: "It’s been wonderful to hear Lesley’s memories of her modelling days.</p>
      <p>"To see her back in front of the camera was just incredible - she’s never lost her sparkle.</p>

      <p>"Finding a sense of purpose at any stage of life is incredibly powerful, and for those living in a care environment to find something that motivates them, as Lesley has, can have huge benefits for their wellbeing and state of mind."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And Sarah Chapman, another Huntington and Langham Director, said: "Huntington and Langham's ethos is just to promote wellbeing.</p>
      <p>"We really want people to have a happier and better life.</p>
      <p>"With these experiences, they can really come out of themselves, and just enjoy the days, just like they were in their 20s and 30s. Age shouldn't matter."</p>
