      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Quarterback carousel turned out swell for Saskatchewan Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers</h1>
      <h2>An improbable, yet compelling, quarterbacking scenario has unfolded leading up to Sunday's CFL West Division final at Mosaic Stadium.</h2>

      <p>The “Bo Show” was a no-show in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/saskatchewans-opportunities-are-wide-open-to-cfl-pending-free-agents-like-mike-reilly">the Saskatchewan Roughriders aggressively wooed quarterback Bo Levi Mitchell with a $700,000-per-year contract offer</a> on Day 1 of the CFL’s free-agency period, he ultimately opted to re-sign with the Calgary Stampeders on Feb. 12.</p>
      <p>Plan B for the Roughriders was oft-concussed Zach Collaros, whose return to the Green and White wasn’t exactly greeted with the blaring of trumpets.</p>
      <p>While Riderville was still abuzz about the courtship of Mitchell and the new deal with Collaros, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-show-that-nice-guys-can-finish-first">first-year general manager and vice-president of football operations Jeremy O’Day</a> signed a quarterback named <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-being-cautious-with-quarterback-cody-fajardo">Cody Fajardo</a>, whose addition was a footnote.</p>
      <p>Nothing, as it turned out, really went according to plan.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders had sought to make Mitchell, a CFL superstar, the highest-paid player in franchise history. No such luck.</p>
      <p>Collaros, who was next in line, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-zach-collaros-status-in-doubt-after-hit-by-simoni-lawrence">suffered another concussion just three plays into the June 13 opener against the host Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a>. Uh oh …</p>
      <p>Quickly elevated into a front-line role was Fajardo, who had been expected to assume his usual role as a backup — with a sprinkling of short-yardage plays included in his repertoire.</p>
      <p>Not even five minutes into the regular season, everything was thrown into chaos.</p>
      <p>And for the Roughriders — and even for Collaros — it all worked out beautifully.</p>
      <p>Fajardo quickly became a sensation in the Rider Nation, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-named-west-divisions-most-outstanding-player">earning West Division most-outstanding-player honours</a> and a lucrative contract extension.</p>
      <p>Collaros was deemed expendable by the Roughriders, who dealt him to the Toronto Argonauts on July 31. He never played a down for Toronto before being dispatched to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on Oct. 9.</p>
      <p>The latter deal had barely been consummated when some commentators began to ruminate about the possibility of one of those “only in the CFL …” stories.</p>
      <p>What if Collaros were to quarterback the Blue Bombers in a playoff game, against the team with which he began the season, at Mosaic Stadium?</p>
      <p>That will indeed be part of the storyline — in a high-stakes game replete with scrumptious subplots — on Sunday when the first-place Roughriders entertain Winnipeg in the West Division final.</p>
      <p>With Collaros starting at quarterback this past weekend, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-to-face-winnipeg-blue-bombers-in-west-division-final">the third-place Blue Bombers upset the second-seeded Stampeders 35-14 at McMahon Stadium.</a></p>
      <p>Collaros completed 11 of 21 passes for 193 yards and one touchdown — a 71-yard payoff pitch to Darvin Adams.</p>
      <p>The passing stats were modest, but Collaros managed the game adroitly and eschewed turnovers, whereas Calgary relinquished the football four times.</p>
      <p>As a complement to Collaros, Bombers offensive co-ordinator Paul LaPolice deployed quarterback Chris Streveler to considerable effect.</p>
      <p>The rap against Streveler is that he isn’t exactly Peyton Manning, or even Preston Manning, when it comes to throwing the football.</p>
      <p>Simple solution: Don’t ask Streveler to throw the football. Brilliant!</p>
      <p>Playing with a foot injury of undetermined but undeniable severity, Streveler was in the game for 23 snaps — thanks to the Winnipeg Sun’s Ted Wyman for the stat — and did not attempt a single pass.</p>
      <p>Instead, Streveler rushed 13 times for a game-high 82 yards, including a 24-yard TD scamper that effectively punched the Blue Bombers’ ticket to Regina.</p>
      <p>The accomplished Mitchell, meanwhile, endured a miserable outing. He completed just 12 of 28 passes for 116 yards, with one TD and three interceptions.</p>
      <p>His quarterback-efficiency rating: 22.3.</p>
      <p>It was yet another unexpected turn in the West’s quarterbacking picture.</p>
      <p>Not so long ago, the Bombers’ season appeared to be sunk after starting pivot Matt Nichols suffered a shoulder injury that necessitated surgery.</p>
      <p>It seemed that Streveler would be at the controls of the Winnipeg offence for as far as it could go.</p>
      <p>Then Collaros arrived, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-cannot-allow-oft-concussed-zach-collaros-to-play-again">prompting questions about whether it was advisable for him to continue playing</a>, considering his history of concussions.</p>
      <p>But now, Collaros is the healthier of the starting quarterbacks as the West final approaches.</p>
      <p>Fajardo was forced to miss the Roughriders’ regular-season finale due to an oblique injury. In his absence, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-ride-rookie-passer-isaac-harker-to-victory">rookie Isaac Harker started at quarterback and helped Saskatchewan clinch first place by defeating the visiting Edmonton Eskimos 23-13 on Nov. 2.</a></p>
      <p>Now that the Roughriders have enjoyed the unaccustomed luxury of a first-round playoff bye, it will soon be time for the resumption of the all-consuming Fajardo Watch — something that was utterly unimaginable back in February.</p>
