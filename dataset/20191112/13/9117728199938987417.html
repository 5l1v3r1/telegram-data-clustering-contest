      <h1>Seidl determined to seal P4 for McLaren "before fully switching attention to 2020"</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> team principal Andreas Seidl has underlined he wants to secure fourth place in the constructors' championship before switching his attention to the 2020 season, as the Woking-based team need to score seven more points than <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> in Brazil to secure 'best of the rest'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The gap between the two teams leading the midfield is 38 points, which is very unlikely to be completely closed with just two races to go in 2019. Last time out in the United States, both teams scored 10 points, although Renault's season-high in points-scoring in a weekend has been 22 in Italy, as the RS19's crossed the line in fourth and fifth.</p>

      <p>With results like that being within the realm of possibility, McLaren will want to make sure they hang on to fourth place at Interlagos this weekend. Seidl is aware of this, as the German underlines he's still focussed on this season rather than 2020.</p>
      <p><i>"As we come to the close of the season, our focus as a race team is on securing the fourth-place Constructors’ spot, before fully switching our attention to 2020," </i>he said ahead of this weekend's action in Sao Paulo.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We gathered a lot of information in Mexico and the US, which has been important in our preparation for Brazil.</i>

        <i>"Interlagos is another high-altitude track, and although it is not as extreme as Mexico City, we still must ensure we’re doing all we can to adjust the car to these conditions and the complex track layout.”</i>
