      <p>Having qualified for the group stages of a continental competition for the first time in their history, Bidvest Wits have now discovered their opponents for the CAF Confederation Cup.</p>

      <p>The Clever Boys saw off Young Buffaloes of Eswatini and Mozambique’s UD Songo after being given a bye into the first round of qualifying, and Gavin Hunt will have been delighted after his side managed to score 11 goals over the course of the two ties. </p>
      <p>Now though, after making it through the qualifiers, Wits find themselves in a tough group alongside 2012 finalists, Djoliba AC of Mali, 16-time Guinean champions, Horoya AC, and 2018 Libyan Premier League champions, El Nasr.</p>
      <p>The top two teams from each group will head into the quarter-finals of the competition once all four clubs have played each other twice – home and away – and Wits will be hoping to make their home form count in a tournament that has notoriously tricky away matches.</p>

      <p>Wits and the rest of the teams in the group stages are due to get underway on December 1 according to CAF, and the Clever Boys will be seeking a positive start to the tournament proper when Hunt’s side start their campaign at home against Horoya.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you think Wits can make it out of this group? </b>
