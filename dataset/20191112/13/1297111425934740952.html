      <h1>Student-run health clinic in North Central celebrates 10th anniversary</h1>
      <h2>"It really breaks down barriers for students to be able to see the folks who live in this neighbourhood as people and not just statistics."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:00:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/jackerman55" target="_blank">Jennifer Ackerman</a></address>
      <p>A woman walks into a drop-in clinic simply hoping to find a safe place to spend a few hours and get a hot meal.</p>
      <p>As she settles in to enjoy the reprieve, a volunteer notices a slight limp and asks her how she’s doing.</p>
      <p>She admits she’s had a sore ankle for weeks, so after eating she’s invited to see the doctor or nurse practitioner.</p>
      <p>The cause of the injury turns out to be complicated and after getting her ankle looked at, she has the option of talking to a counsellor, too.</p>
      <p>She walked in for a meal, but left with more than just her need for food met. It’s a theoretical scenario, but one similar to what Emily Barber says she sees unfold time and time again at the SEARCH clinic.</p>
      <p>“People aren’t just one part of their health,” said Barber, SEARCH’s executive director, in an interview Sunday. “We take the four directions approach of mental, emotional, physical and spiritual health. All of those components coming together is the only way that we find a holistic balance with our health and overall in our lives.”</p>
      <p>SEARCH — Student Energy in Action for Regina Community Health — is a student-run interdisciplinary primary health care initiative located in Regina’s North Central community.</p>
      <p>The once-a-week, informal drop-in clinic offers a free meal, social programming, daycare services and access to medical professionals, social workers and counsellors.</p>
      <p>The clinic typically serves First Nation and Metis clients, anyone from individuals to families looking for a safe space, free of judgement, to get help.</p>
      <p>Celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, Barber spoke of the importance of this type of wraparound care, not only for the North Central community, but for the student volunteers and mentors who help run the clinic.</p>
      <p>“It really breaks down barriers for students to be able to see the folks who live in this neighbourhood as people and not just statistics,” she said. “To see our students making real connections with folks who live in this neighbourhood and see the people in this neighbourhood see people from outside of it caring for them as a wholistic person is, I think, one of the best parts of my job.”</p>
      <p>Barber became SEARCH’s executive director in August 2018.</p>
      <p>She followed in the footsteps of Kelly Husack, who acted as executive director from May 2015 to August 2018.</p>
      <p>“What I took away most from it was a deep understanding and appreciation for how different some of our lives can be depending on what area of Regina you live in, but just how fundamentally similar we all are,” said Husack in an interview Sunday. “We want the best for our families. We want the best for ourselves.”</p>

      <p>To help clients achieve that, she said the clinic focuses heavily on the social determinants of health — the economic and social conditions that influence the health of an individual or group.</p>
      <p>She said it’s also what makes SEARCH unique compared to the other organizations in the community that are also working to improve the experiences and lives of people living in the North Central community.</p>
      <p>“We wouldn’t necessarily consider or think of (those underlying factors) as being tied to our health in a deep way, but (they) actually moreso create positive or negative health outcomes for individuals,” said Husack.</p>
      <p>SEARCH operates out of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/four-directions-new-location-brings-promise-of-better-services-but-also-concerns-over-access">the Saskatchewan Health Authority’s (SHA) Four Directions Community Health Centre</a>, which offers a range of services like primary care, immunization clinics, addictions counselling, and parenting and Indigenous cultural programs.</p>
      <p>So when Four Directions moved to a new facility at the end of August, SEARCH moved along with it.</p>
      <p>Barber said the transition has come with some growing pains.</p>
      <p>“I think the word is still spreading about where the new facility is and people still figuring out that also SEARCH has moved there, too,” she said. “We’ve a little bit of lower numbers to start off this semester, which we were expecting.”</p>
      <p>But she said at the last couple of clinics, the numbers have been back in the normal range of 20-40 clients each day.</p>

      <p>The clinic is made possible through annual funding from the SHA to the tune of $50,000. SEARCH also receives funding from the Community Initiatives Fund, the City of Regina and other smaller grants.</p>
      <p>Last year, the organization unexpectedly received a grant that allowed them to expand services and programming to two days a week. It operated as such for about eight months, according to Barber.</p>
      <p>“It went really well, and we served about 30 per cent more clients last year than we had over the previous years and that was really exciting, but there was some logistical things that were very difficult to work out in conjunction with a turnover of an executive director,” she said.</p>
      <p>They are looking to expand again in the future, but want to make sure they have infrastructure in place so that when they do, it’s a smooth transition into a new normal.</p>
      <p>So how does a student-run organization with only one employee that relies on a variety of funding keep their doors open for 10 years?</p>
      <p>Passionate volunteers eager to make a difference.</p>
      <p>Currently, SEARCH has 15 to 20 university student volunteers who work alongside three to five mentors who make up the physician, nurse practitioner and a registered nurse team.</p>
      <p>They also have a volunteer social worker, counsellor, a dietician that helps plan and prepare the meals and a physiotherapist that comes once a month.</p>
      <p>“It’s very encouraging,” said Sarah Wiseman, a 23-year-old nursing student and chair of the SEARCH board. “I hear, ‘Oh, millennials are lazy, or they don’t put in effort for anything,’ but the fact that an entire organization is running based on the volunteer abilities of these millennials that everybody is saying are lazy, it shows a lot.”</p>
      <p>The longevity of the organization really comes down to students having the ability to commit year after year, even despite continuous changes like board turnover, new executive directors, funding changes and a move, said Barber.</p>
      <p>“It’s really, really impressive and I think just goes to show how passionate students are about community health in Regina and how necessary organizations like us are.”</p>
      <p>SEARCH, located at 1504 Albert Street, runs Saturdays from 12:20 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. from September to April. From May to August the clinic runs Monday nights from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.</p>
