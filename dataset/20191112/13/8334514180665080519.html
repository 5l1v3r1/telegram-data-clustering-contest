      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German police detained three people in the western city of Offenbach on Tuesday on suspicion of planning a bomb attack for the Islamic State militant group, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The three suspects wanted to kill as many “infidels” as possible in the planned attack in the Rhine-Main region, Frankfurt prosecutor Nadja Niesen said.</p>
      <p>No specific attack targets were yet known but evidence seized from raids of three homes in Offenbach should shed some light, she added.</p>
      <p>German intelligence agencies and police have been on high alert for potential attacks by Islamist militants since a rejected asylum seeker from Tunisia killed 12 people by ramming a truck into a Berlin Christmas market almost three years ago.</p>
      <p>The main suspect arrested on Tuesday is a 24-year-old German of Macedonian origin who wanted to manufacture explosives and tried to buy a weapon online. His two suspected accomplices are Turkish nationals aged 22 and 21.</p>
      <p>The suspects are believed to have told people they were IS supporters, Niesen said, adding she thought all three were known to police.</p>
      <p>Substances that could be used to make explosives and equipment were found at the main suspect’s home, she said. The authorities also secured written documents and electronic data.</p>
      <p>Niesen said a decision would be made on Wednesday on whether all three suspects or only one would be brought before the investigating judge at a court in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The judge will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant and order pre-trial detention.</p>
