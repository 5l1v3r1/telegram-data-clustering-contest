      <h1>BMW X8 M45e Reportedly Planned As An M Performance Hybrid Model</h1>
      <h2>It’ll allegedly have a 3.0-liter inline-six engine.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:30:29+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>The rumor <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/">BMW</a> is developing the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/bmw-x8/">X8</a> continues to swirl, with the latest nugget of news only fueling the speculative fire. A new report from <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/11/future-bmw-x8-will-have-an-m-performance-hybrid-x8-m45e/"><i>BMWBlog</i></a> says there will be an M Performance hybrid version of the X8 called the X8 M45e, and it’ll have inline-six power, too. And the X8 is a vehicle BMW has yet to confirm even exists. </p>
      <p>According to the publication, BMW will pair the company’s 3.0-liter inline-six engine with an electric drivetrain, just as it does with other hybrids. Currently, the powertrain produces about a combined 400 horsepower (298 kilowatts) and 440 pound-feet (542 Newton-meters) of torque. However, expect the powertrain to not only make more power in the X8, but it should also have a longer electric range, too.  </p>
      <p>Another bit of info suggests the X8 won’t borrow design cues from the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/x6/">X6</a> or <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/x7/">X7</a>. Instead, it will have its own design identity with a unique shape and kidney bean grille, which has become a controversial design element on new BMW models. Some rumors suggested the X8 would borrow from its stablemates, considering it’ll share a platform with X7, but that doesn’t appear to be the case anymore. </p>

      <p>There’s little information about what could be BMW’s priciest and most luxurious model ever. However, rumors abound. There could be three models, the regular X8, X8 M45e, and X8 M. The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/357392/bmw-x8-m-rumor/">bonkers X8 M</a>, which is likely still years away from going on sale, could use the brand’s twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V8 from the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/bmw/x6-m/">X6 M</a>. In that model, the mill produces 600 hp (447 kW). A V12 is also possible.  </p>
      <p>Don’t expect the rumors and speculation to end anytime soon. If the BMW X8 exists and the German automaker is planning to produce it, which all signs point to yes, then <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379960/bmw-x8-rumor-debut-2020/">we won’t see it until late 2020 or early 2021</a>, and even then it could be a concept previewing the model that’s likely another year or more away. And that’s just the regular X8. The X8 M45e and X8 M would debut after that. If the X8 exists, we won’t know about it until we spy some test mules.  </p>
      <p>And even then, BMW may stay mum about the model's existence.</p>
