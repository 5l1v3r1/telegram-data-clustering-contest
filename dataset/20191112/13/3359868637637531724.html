      <h1>BnkToTheFuture to Expand Its STOs Business to the U.S. Market</h1>
      <h2>The CEO of BnkToTheFuture, Simon Dixon, strongly believes that in 2020 we will observe a durable tilt towards security tokens.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:32:45+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:32</time> by <a rel="author">Adedamola Bada</a></address>
      <p>The online investment platform known as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bnktothefuture/">BnkToTheFuture</a> is yet again on another ambitious move and this time, its sights are fixed on the U.S. market. Knowing that without authorization from the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/">SEC</a>) such expansion is impossible, the company invested in a U.S. broker-dealer that has the full license from the SEC to conduct its security token offering business (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sto/">STOs</a>) in the United States.</p>
      <p>This move was made known to investors in a statement released on Nov. 7, notifying them of the recent acquisition made by the company. The statement showed that BnkToTheFuture now has a yet-to-be-revealed stake in BMI Capital International’s holding company, which is all that is needed by the lending platform to have access to the U.S market.</p>
      <h3>Security Tokens to Overtake Conventional Equity</h3>
      <p>The CEO of BnkToTheFuture, Simon Dixon, strongly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bnktothefuture-ceo-50-percent-of-funding-will-be-through-security-tokens-in-2020">believes</a> that the year 2020 will see a durable tilt towards security tokens. Since innovative security tokens can provide higher returns for investors compared to traditional equity, Dixon is of the opinion that about 50 percent of investors will choose security tokens by 2020. In the end, the company aims to build a new asset class and industry.</p>
      <p>BnkToTheFuture began operations in 2010. The Cayman Islands-based platform gives room for certified investors to raise equity for crypto companies and financial technology.</p>
      <p>In 2019, the company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bnktothefuture-sto/">opened</a> STO investments and has since launched two security tokens such as the Lottery.com revenue share token and the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bitfinex/">Bitfinex</a> hack recovery token convertible to Bitfinex equity. The CEO said presently 450 individuals are ready to invest in STOs and the platform has three more offerings slated for 2020.</p>
      <h3>Strategic Investments for Growth</h3>
      <p>BnkToTheFuture is currently on a growth-spree, hence its acquisitions and strategic investments. These business moves were made to ensure the expansion of the company’s STO business. One notable of such investments is in Altcoin.io.</p>
      <p>In the past, Dixon had made it known that of all the pitches for funding which BnkToTheFuture receives from various companies, about 18 percent are focused on security tokens.</p>
      <p>As of now, traditional equity makes up 95 percent of the BnkToTheFuture platform’s deals. Crypto investments, however, were 61 percent in 2019 and they include investments in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/">Ether</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and stablecoins. Ether received a 42 percent investment; Bitcoin had 36 percent while stablecoins got 22 percent.</p>
