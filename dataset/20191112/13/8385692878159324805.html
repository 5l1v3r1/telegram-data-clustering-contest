      <p>Best Buy is continuing its <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">daily doorbuster deals</a> ahead of Black Friday, and today you can get a Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch laptop for just $349.</p>
      <p>This laptop is a pretty good buy for those that are looking for a new laptop, especially at this price.</p>
      <p>The Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch laptop has, well a 15.6-inch display. It is a touchscreen, with a full HD display. Which isn't too bad, and actually surprising that it is a touchscreen. Though, it is not a 2-in-1. Meaning that you can't fold it back and use it like a tablet.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Inside, you'll find an Intel Core i5-8265U chipset, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage. That's pretty decent for a laptop at this price. Normally, at this price, you'd be stuck with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
      <p>This laptop will be pretty decent for gaming. It's not going to rival a gaming laptop, of course, but it can handle some gaming. This is thanks to the Intel UHD Graphics 620. That's going to allow you to get some good gaming in, without spending a fortune.</p>
      <p>All of this, while keeping this laptop pretty thin and light. The Dell Inspiron 15 comes in at less than an inch thick, and at under four and a half pounds. Meaning that you can easily stick it into your backpack, and not worry about it being to heavy to carry around all day.</p>

      <p>The Dell Inspiron 15 is going to be a great gift this holiday season, especially for someone that wants a new laptop. This will get that done, without breaking the bank. It's going to be very good for those that are students too, since it is pretty powerful, but still lightweight.</p>
