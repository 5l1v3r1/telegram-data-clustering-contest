      <p>Disney+ is now available. You can start streaming all sorts of Disney movies and TV shows on this new streaming service, and it'll cost you just $6.99. Or you can bundle Disney+ with Hulu and ESPN+ for just $13. Which is a really great price – considering, these would cost you $18 per month separately.</p>
      <p>In Best Buy's early Black Friday daily Doorbuster deals today, it is discounting a Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch laptop. Shaving $250 off of its regular price. This brings it down to $349. And this is actually a very capable laptop too. We're looking at an Intel Core i5 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage.</p>
      <p>Best Buy is discounting a number of OLED TVs right now, including the B9 series. Where you can get the 55-inch B9 series for just $1299. That is a really good price actually. Especially considering the B9 hasn't really dropped below $1500 since launching earlier this year. So if you want the latest OLED TV, then this is the one to get.</p>

      <p>Some Samsung TVs are currently at their lowest prices of the year on Amazon. These are not QLED TVs, but rather LED TVs, that are still at some incredible prices. And if you think that these prices will be lower on Black Friday, you're wrong. TVs are always discounted more before Black Friday than on Black Friday. It's usually the already cheap, and not that great, TVs that are discounted heavily on Black Friday – in doorbuster deals.</p>
      <p>Amazon is discounting a number of Nikon cameras and lenses right now, in its "Happy HoliDeals" event. Allowing you to save big on some great cameras on lenses. Including the Nikon D750 which is up to 15-percent off right now. There are some really good lenses on sale, like the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens, that is just $176 today – that's the same price as a used one!</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
