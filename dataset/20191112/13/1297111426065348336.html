      <h3>Liberals ignored western concerns</h3>
      <p>Re: Falling into the trap of partisanship will only deepen the divide between farmers and city dwellers, Toban Dyck, Nov. 4 Leader-Post:</p>
      <p>Can I suggest that if Mr. Dyck seriously wants to improve the level of political discourse engaged in by his fellow farmers, he not call them “Neanderthals” (a term, coincidentally, also used by Bill Morneau at one time to describe Conservatives). He also might want to avoid describing farmers as acting like bullies and venting when they voice legitimate complaints. This is an insult to the well-researched and articulate arguments put forward by a myriad of farm organizations. How dare he.</p>
      <p>Finally, may I also suggest that political discourse is a two-way street and during the election the Liberals made no secret of their contempt for people, like farmers, who work with their hands; disparaging and mocking Andrew Scheer, for instance, for a poster showing him shaking hands with someone wearing a yellow vest.</p>
      <p>The problems Mr. Dyck identifies that are afflicting the farming community in the West — failing trade relationships, poor commodity prices, rising input costs, unusual weather — are very real. And while the Liberals perhaps don’t control the weather, they were in government as many of these other conditions developed and did little or nothing to alleviate the plight of the farmers out West while bending over backwards, to the point of breaking the law, to supposedly defend a few thousand jobs in Quebec.</p>
      <p>There is a reason the Liberals didn’t win a seat in Saskatchewan and Alberta. And it is not because, as Mr. Dyck puts it, “How we as rural/farm people (chose) to engage with our leaders”, but because of how our Liberal leaders chose to engage, or, more accurately, not engage with western farmers and other resource workers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dyck argues that the election made otherwise progressive rural people Neanderthals. I disagree. But I will say that during four years of inaction under a Liberal government, playing nice by farmers got them nowhere. They have not become Neanderthals. But they just may be mad as hell.  And they’re not going to take it anymore.</p>

      <h3>Net metering change short-sighted</h3>
      <p>The opinion piece published recently in the Leader-Post written by Mike Marsh, SaskPower president and CEO, omits many important facts which either contradict or do not support his narrative. His article tries to justify the decision which so radically altered the former net metering program that it has effectively ended it for new participants.</p>
      <p>Net metering is a program that allows home and business owners to install solar panels on their property and both feed electricity into the grid and to pull power from the grid when needed.  Looking at net metering simply from the perspective of future lost revenue to SaskPower, and trying to make it about “fairness to all”, is sadly misleading and short-sighted. Leaving aside for now the justification that was offered, consider what the article simply ignored:</p>
      <p>·       Net metering customers pay for grid maintenance, just as all other SaskPower customers do.</p>
      <p>·       The rebate under the former program was recovered by SaskPower through accrual of carbon credits.</p>
      <p>·       The success of the former net metering program was creating green jobs, effectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meaningfully engaging hundreds of citizens and small business owners in the effort to mitigate climate change, all at no cost to SaskPower.</p>
      <p>·       Net metering customers were not getting an unfair advantage from the program. We all share responsibility for the past mistake of investing heavily and going into debt for carbon-based electrical energy production; we will all, as taxpayers, share the financial responsibility of correcting that mistake.</p>
      <p>·       True “fairness” should address inter-generational inequity; the failure to act boldly on climate change mitigation is locking down climate change and its associated costs on future generations.</p>
      <p>·       The electrical grid in Saskatchewan is publicly owned and should not be treated as the private property of SaskPower, to be used for its exclusive competitive advantage.</p>
      <p>·       The new net metering program will ultimately cost SaskPower a lot of revenue by driving producers from the grid as battery technology improves; SaskPower could have kept existing and future net metering producers connected to and paying for the grid in the long term if it had treated the grid as a public asset to be shared by all.</p>
      <p>·       The new net metering program is so unattractive to homeowners and small businesses that it is very unlikely to succeed in any meaningful way.</p>
      <p>As a publicly owned utility, SaskPower has a past history of acting as an agent of both economic development and societal good. Rural electrification is an example — it was not profitable in the short term, but went ahead as an investment in this province.  It achieved an important social good by bringing electricity to rural residents. In doing so, it created a foundation for rural economic development and future prosperity.</p>
      <p>Net metering had the potential to do the same thing for Saskatchewan, while making a significant contribution to meeting our targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p>

      <h3>Unproportional representation</h3>
      <p>Canada’s new House of Commons makes the country look far more divided than it really is.</p>
      <p>The current voting system consistently skews results in favour of larger parties, and exacerbates differences between the various regions of Canada. It is not very democratic and not very efficient. That, unfortunately, pushes both politicians and media to talk about regional alienation. The better conversation is electoral representation.</p>
      <p>Nationally, our “first past the post” (FPTP) voting system produced 34 more seats for the Liberals than for the Conservatives, despite the Conservatives getting 1.5 per cent more votes than the Liberals. In the four western provinces, the Conservatives scored about 53 per cent of the votes, yet elected about 68 per cent of the MPs. The bizarre outcomes exist across the country.</p>
      <p>By comparison, a proportional representation election would have produced seats proportional to the votes: about 116 rather than 156 Liberals, 117 rather than 122 Conservatives, 57 rather than 24 New Democrats, 22 rather than three Greens, and 26 rather than 32 Bloc MPs.</p>
      <p>The skewed results of the FPTP system render a false picture of a divided country. No wonder Canadian voters often feel conflicted and alienated.</p>
      <p>Here’s a memo to the pundits and the politicians: it’s not a national political crisis — it’s the <i>electoral</i> system, stupid.</p>

      <h3>School board exercised caution</h3>
      <p>I was pleased to see the Regina public school board vote to exercise caution when it comes to endorsing any action where there is public controversy like the recent gay celebration motion.</p>
      <p>Obviously, humanity’s religions have influenced people’s actions and opinions concerning sexual behaviour, both historically and currently.</p>
      <p>However, as opinions go, surely the school board is correct in choosing to not aggrandize, condone or promote one sexual lifestyle over another.</p>
