      <p>BERLIN: Authorities in Germany detained three alleged supporters of the Daesh group Tuesday on suspicion of preparing a deadly attack against non-Muslims.<br/>Frankfurt prosecutors said some 170 police officers searched three apartments in the nearby city of Offenbach and detained the men, who were already known to authorities.<br/>“The intervention occurred in time to prevent a concrete threat,” chief prosecutor Nadja Niesen told reporters in Frankfurt. She said that the suspects appeared to have planned an attack in the Rhine-Main region with the intention of killing “as many people, so-called unbelievers, as possible,” but it wasn’t yet known whether they had chosen a specific target.<br/>Niesen said the main suspect, a 24-year-old German citizen with Macedonian roots, had already acquired materials needed to make explosives and searched for firearms online. Police seized various substances and electronic devices at the man’s apartment.<br/>The other two suspects are Turkish citizens aged 21 and 22.<br/>All three suspects are alleged to have spoken of their support for the Daesh group in the presence of witnesses, who informed authorities, Niesen said.</p>
