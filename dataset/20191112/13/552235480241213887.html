      <p>The iconic Barony A Frame could be lit up at night.</p>
      <p>A councillor has called for the miner’s monument to glow violet in the darkness - meaning it could be seen for miles around.</p>
      <p>East Ayrshire Council has added the proposal as a reserve possibility to a list of planned projects in the coalfield communities. </p>
      <p>Speaking at a recent East Ayrshire Council cabinet meeting, Councillor Neil McGhee, Labour, said he would like to see the structure illuminated. </p>
      <p>The  Ballochmyle politician said: “We are very hopeful about this happening.</p>
      <p>"The monument is a testament to the mining industry. Lighting it up and making it prominent would be very exciting.” </p>
      <p>Previous attempts to shine a spotlight on the landmark did not last.</p>
      <p>Council leader Douglas Reid, SNP, said he would support the latest quest at a recent council meeting. </p>
      <p>There are also aspirations to install security cameras on the Barony A Frame site. Travellers have parked up in the area. </p>
      <p>The monument, which faced demolition was restored, and reopened by Prince Charles in 2008.</p>
      <p>Councillor McGhee said: “Our history is coal. But the coal dust is disappearing. There are kids who don’t know what a piece of coal looks like.”</p>
      <p>An illuminated Barony A Frame is part of a £113,000 coalfield industrial heritage hub plan. Moves would include restoring the High House pit site with a part-time tour guide.</p>
      <p>The aim would be to encourage visitors to Auchinleck and the A Frame to stay in the area for longer. </p>
      <p>The council is on a mission to pour about £6.6 million into projects in the historic mining areas in East Ayrshire.</p>
      <p>The A Frame proposal is a small part of the huge bid.</p>
      <p>The ambitious plans are part of an application to obtain cash from the National Lottery Heritage Fund for a Coalfield Communities Landscape Partnership.</p>
      <p>The council will contribute money alongside the National Lottery.</p>
      <p>Bosses will submit a bid later this month.</p>
      <p>No final decision has been taken yet but if approved work would start  in April or May next year.</p>
