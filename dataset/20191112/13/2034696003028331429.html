        <b>Stop right now, thank you very much</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tesco has pulled an advert featuring the face of <a href="http://nme.com/artists/spice-girls">Spice Girls</a> singer Mel B after she hit out at the supermarket chain for featuring her likeness.</p>
      <p>Posting on her Instagram page, the singer asked Tesco CEO Dave Lewis to contact her about the situation.</p>
      <p>The new poster, pictured on a bus stop to advertise Tesco’s new Clubcard, references Spice Girls song ‘Stop’.</p>

      <p>Responding to the poster, Mel wrote: “Can the CEO OF @tescofood DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you.”</p>
      <p>Now, Tesco has said the image was cleared for use but have now pulled it as Brown was “unhappy”.</p>
      <p>A Tesco spokesman said: “Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign.</p>
      <p>“We had authorisation to use this image, but we’re sorry Mel B is unhappy so we’ve stopped using it.”</p>
      <p>The image was reportedly purchased by Tesco through Getty Images and a contract was subsequently signed with Getty and Brown’s agent.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear why the singer took exception to her image being used in the advert.</p>
      <p>The advert formed part of Tesco’s latest campaign, which featured cultural references from the past century for its 100th anniversary, alongside the tagline: “Prices that take you back”.</p>

      <p>“The big thing is we don’t want it to end. We’ve had an incredible run here in the UK. We’d really like to get further afield,” she said, bringing up fans who travelled from all over the world to see them.</p>
      <p>“I think we’d really like to take it out to the fans that haven’t been able to travel but have supported us all these years. So that would be the immediate thing.”</p>
