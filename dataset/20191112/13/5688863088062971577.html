      <h3>Preview</h3>
      <p>After losing to Oman 2-1 in Guwahati in the opening fixture, India surprised everyone by holding Qatar in Doha for a goalless draw. However, the Blue Tigers with high expectations went on to draw with minnows Bangladesh in Kolkata. The neighbours were leading with one goal most of the time before a late Adil Khan header saved the day for India. India's shaky defence in the absence of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/sandesh_jhingan">Sandesh </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/jhingan">Jhingan</a> struggled a lot and with the experienced defender still missing, the defence will be a huge burden for Igor Stimac yet again.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Afghanistan started their campaign with a huge loss to Asian Champions Qatar 6-0. However, they beat Bangladesh 1-0 before falling to the gulf nation Oman 3-0 in Muscat. The war torn Afghanistan is playing their home games in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, owing to security reasons and they will take on India.at the Central Republican Stadium in Dushanbe on artificial turf.</p>
