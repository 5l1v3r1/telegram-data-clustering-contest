      <p>Today is the second Tuesday of the month, which means that its Microsoft's <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/patch-tuesday">Patch Tuesday</a>. Given the scope of Microsoft latest "major" update for Windows 10, it's quite appropriate that the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/windows-10-november-2019-update-rumored-for-tuesday-public-launch">November 2019 Update is landing today</a> (as you'll read later).</p>
      <p>Microsoft has just announced that the Windows 10 November 2019 Update is now available to the public, but only to users that actively seek to download it. Instead of pushing it to all users, or asking you to install it when your PC automatically checks for updates, the user will actually have to click the "Check for updates" button and select "Download and install now" for the Window 10 November 2019 Update (also called version 1909).</p>
      <p>By limiting the update to "seekers", Microsoft is appeal primarily to enthusiasts and those that know what they're getting into when it comes to an early public build of Windows 10. The folks in Redmond do caution, however, that you might not actually see the option to install the November 2019 Update in Windows Update. If this is the case, Microsoft says that you "might have a compatibility issue and a safeguard hold is in place until we are confident that you will have a good update experience."</p>

      <p>Unlike previous released like the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/october-2018-update">October 2018 Update</a> or the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/may-2019-update">May 2019 Update</a>, the November 2019 Update doesn't bring with it a slew of new functionality for users. Instead, there are mainly bug fixes, quality control updates, and minor tweaks to the UI and accompanying software. Keeping this in mind, the November 2019 Update seems more like the Windows Service Packs of yore that were released for operating systems like the beloved <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/windows-xp">Windows XP</a> and <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/windows-7">Windows 7</a>.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the improvements that are available in the November 2019 Update, these are the few that Microsoft chose to highlight:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly creating an event directly from the Calendar flyout on the Taskbar.</li>
        <li>Better managing notifications, including a new button at the top of the Action Center and the ability to sort notifications by most recently shown.</li>
        <li>Integrating OneDrive content online with traditional indexed results in the File Explorer search box.</li>
        <li>The navigation pane on the Start menu now expands when you hover over it with your mouse to better inform where clicking goes.</li>
        <li>Using your voice to activate third-party digital assistants from the Lock screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It's definitely not an exciting release, but we hope that it's one that doesn't come plagued with problems like the preceding October 2018 Update and May 2019 Update. To that end, Microsoft writes, "We continue to work to improve Windows 10 quality and will be closely monitoring and sharing the current status of the update via the Windows release health dashboard and following @WindowsUpdate on Twitter."</p>
      <p>If you want to go ahead and jump aboard the Windows 10 November 2019 Update train, head on over to Windows Update to get started.</p>
