      <h1>Man dies day after 'neck is broken' during chiropractor treatment</h1>
      <h2>John Lawler screamed "you are hurting me" at chiropractor Dr Arleen Scholten</h2>

      <p>An 80-year-old man died a day after suffering a broken neck while being treated by a chiropractor during a routine visit, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>John Lawler, a retired bank manager, had sought treatment at a private Chiropractic 1st clinic in August 2017 for an aching leg.</p>
      <p>His wife Joan told the inquest he suddenly yelled "you are hurting me" at chiropractor Dr Arleen Scholten during what was supposed to be part of a procedure to manipulate his spine.</p>
      <p>The grandfather-of-five looked like a "rag doll" after he lost consciousness during the appointment before paramedics arrived, his wife added.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mrs Lawler, 83, was later told he had multiple spinal injuries and a broken neck and would need a traumatic 14-hour operation to fit a brace.</p>

      <p>Mr Lawler, a father-of-three, was taken to Leeds General Infirmary immediately after the appointment but did not have the operation.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard Mr Lawler "just faded away" the next day in hospital surrounded by his heartbroken family.</p>
      <p>It was reported last year no-one was to face criminal charges over his death in 2017, following a police investigation.</p>
      <p>A woman, who had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following his death, was released without charge and the matter was passed to the coroner.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at the start of an inquest at York Racecourse, Mr Lawler's wife of more than 50 years gave a harrowing account of what happened.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler told how her husband was on the treatment table at Chiropractic 1st in York in August 2017 when things started to go wrong.</p>

      <p>She said he started shouting at chiropractor Dr Arleen Scholten "you are hurting me, you are hurting me".</p>
      <p>Mr Lawler then began moaning and said: "I can't feel my arms."</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler said Dr Scholten tried to turn him over and then manoeuvred him into a chair next to the treatment table but he had become unresponsive.</p>
      <p>"He was like a rag doll," she told the inquest on Monday. "His lips looked a little bit blue but I knew he was breathing.</p>
      <p>"I said, 'Has he had a stroke?' She put his head back and said 'no, his features are symmetrical'.</p>
      <p>"She started shouting to get an ambulance."</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler said paramedics arrived, treated her husband and took him to hospital before he was later transferred to Leeds General Infirmary.</p>
      <p>He had an MRI scan and a doctor told her he had suffered a broken neck, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lawler was then told bluntly her husband was a paraplegic and he could undergo a 14-hour operation which would be traumatic but he later "faded away" and died.</p>
      <p>The inquest, which is expected to last all week, continues.</p>
