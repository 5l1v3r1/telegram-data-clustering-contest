      <p>MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. -- Crews resumed a search Tuesday for boaters reported missing off the South Florida coast after one of the boaters was found alive Monday night.</p>
      <p>The three boaters left from the 'Caribbean Club' in Key Largo on Thursday. Their boat capsized Friday in rough waters near Haulover Inlet in Miami.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard says the boater who survived took off in the small rescue boat to find help while the other two stayed behind.</p>
      <p>“These gentleman have life jackets, which is great because a life jacket can significantly increase chances of survival,” says a Coast Guard spokesperson.</p>
      <p>There are plans Tuesday for planes in the sky and a Coast Guard cutter in the water, trying to find the other boaters.</p>
