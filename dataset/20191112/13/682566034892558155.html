      <h1>From 1994 to 2019: Bafana have upper hand over Ghana?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:51:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">Tashreeq Vardien - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana </b>kick-off their <b>2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON)</b> qualifying campaign on <b>Thursday, November 14</b> in a tricky away clash to <b>Ghana</b>.</p>
      <p>The last time South Africa shared the field with the Black Stars, Bafana Bafana held the west Africans to a goalless draw in an international friendly earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Nearly seven months after that fixture, South Africa will attempt to get an all-important three points at the Cape Coast Sports Stadium.</p>
      <p>Since readmission, Bafana have played the Black Stars on 12 occasions - <b>4</b> wins, <b>5</b> draws and <b>3</b> defeats - with the first clash dating back to November 1994.</p>
      <p>A 15 000-strong crowd travelled to Loftus Versfeld Stadium where Ghana fielded the likes of Samuel Osei Kuffour, Abedi Pele Ayew, Frank Amankwah and Robert Sabah.</p>
      <p>Clive Barker's South Africa beat Ghana 2-1 courtesy of goals from legendary Marks Maponyane and Theophilis Khumalo with Amankwah grabbing a late goal for the Ghanaians.</p>
      <p>That victory was the first of four wins South Africa would get over the Black Stars.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In 1996, Bafana beat Ghana 3-0 in an AFCON semi-final with John Mosheau scoring a brace and Shaun Bartlett netting a goal to guide South Africa to the final.</p>
      <p>Bafana were crowned AFCON champions after beating Tunisia in the final to claim their first major trophy - and sadly the national team's last.</p>
      <p>Thursday's clash is the first step towards a possible final in 2021 where Cameroon will host the tournament.</p>
      <p>Ghana's first win over South Africa only came in a World Cup qualifier 10-years after Bafana Bafana were granted readmission in 2004.</p>
      <p>Sulley Muntari and Stephan Appiah were on the scoresheet as Ghana dismantled South Africa 3-0 in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>A year later in 2005, Ghana travelled to South Africa and left with three points as Bafana Bafana failed to qualify for the World Cup in Germany.</p>
      <p>Ghana, currently ranked 7th in Africa, are expected to once again defeat South Africa (12th) who are going into their second match under new coach Molefi Ntseki.</p>
      <p>Ntseki's first match came in the Nelson Mandela Challenge last month against Mali in which South Africa won 2-1 courtesy of goals from Dean Furman and Themba Zwane.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old has recently stated that he hopes <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/BafanaBafana/bafana-coach-ntseki-outlines-plan-to-unsettle-ghana-20191112">Bafana Bafana can hold their nerve and grind out a positive result</a>.</p>
      <p>Kick-off is at 21:00 on Thursday evening (SA time).</p>
