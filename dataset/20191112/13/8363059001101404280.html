      <h1>Black Friday Lego Offer Sees Shoppers Get an Embiggened Brick for Free</h1>

      <p>In an offer that only true Lego lovers will give a shit about, the promo is giving away a big (presumably) brick made of bricks.</p>
      <p>There's some Lego stuff I can get on board with - the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/the-new-3300-piece-tim-burton-batmobile-might-be-the-best-lego-model-ive-ever-built/">1989 Tim Burton Batmobile</a> being one of them - but this one is not for filthy casuals  like me. The Black Friday promo will reportedly see a buildable red 2×4 brick given away with orders over $200 on Lego.com.</p>
      <p>Offers in the US store often appear in the UK, so if you like Lego bricks and would like to construct your own upscaled version out of normal-sized bricks for some reason, just fork out a few hundred pounds to get one for free.</p>
      <p>If you need suggestions for purchases, there's the aforementioned Batmobile which goes on sale on November 29 for £220, or the Technic Bugatti Chiron for £330 - although right now, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/you-can-save-114-on-legos-fancy-technic-bugatti-chiron-right-how/?utm_content=buffer4f49d&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer-gizmodouktw">you can pick it up for £216 on Amazon</a>, which might scupper your plans.</p>
      <p>The promo will kick in next weekend apparently, along with Double VIP points, which always seems to be a thing, so that's not too much of a surprise.</p>
      <p>Don't forget, you can nab yourself <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/lego-polybag-reindeer-promotion/">a free polybag reindeer with orders of £35 or more</a> until Sunday, November 17, while over in the US store, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/lego-unveils-one-of-its-black-friday-2019-promo/">orders of $120 or more will get you a Christmas Tree and a Mini Surfer Van set</a>. [<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/lego-black-friday-exclusives-rumoured-to-include-upscaled-brick/">Brick Fanatics</a>]</p>
