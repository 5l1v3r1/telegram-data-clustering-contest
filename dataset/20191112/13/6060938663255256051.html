And guess what? we got you some inside details about their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/anniversary-plan">anniversary plan</a>.</p>
      <p>A little birdie from the industry has whispered in our ears that Deepika and Ranveer are going to celebrate their first wedding anniversary in the most divine way. It is going to be a family affair for the couple and they have decided to celebrate it in a most private manner. According to the plan, DeepVeer along with their respective families would be heading first to Tirupati and then to Amritsar in order to seek almighty's blessings.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the source added that on 14th of November, they will be at Tirupati to visit the famous Balaji and the Padmavati temple and then fly to Amritsar to visit the Golden Temple on the 15th of November. Sighting the actor's busy schedules, the entire family will fly back to Mumbai on 15th.</p>
      <p>Yes! you got it right. The couple has planned their anniversary in a similar manner as their two-day wedding. For the uninitiated, Ranveer-Deepika first got married in a typical Konkani-South Indian style tradition on 14th which was followed by a big-fat Punjabi wedding on 15th of November.</p>
      <p>With such an adorable update on their first wedding anniversary, we wish Ranveer and Deepika many more years of togetherness in advance.</p>
