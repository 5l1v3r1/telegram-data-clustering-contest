      <p>Italian publication <i>Tuttomercatoweb </i>has reported that the Frenchman is still looking to make a few changes to his side this season, despite the team's recent resurgence.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos have kept five clean sheets in their past five matches, and scored 16 goals. They dropped points just once during that run, in their 0-0 draw with Real Betis earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Zidane, however, is still looking for ways to improve his squad, and reportedly has plans to get rid of both James Rodriguez and Isco â€“ two players who have been unable to cement a place in the club's starting XI this season.</p>

      <p>The 47-year-old coach wants his club to go after one or two of his preferred targets in January, with Manchester United's Paul Pogba reportedly his main priority.</p>
      <p>Sporting Lisbon midfielder Bruno Fernandes is said to be another target, as is Ajax Amsterdam's Donny van de Beek, who was heavily tipped to join Los Blancos at the beginning of this campaign.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed that Tottenham Hotspur's Christian Eriksen is also an option, along with Napoli and Spain midfielder Fabian Ruiz.</p>
