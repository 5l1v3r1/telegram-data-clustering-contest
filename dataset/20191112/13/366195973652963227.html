      <p>U.K.'s Fredo has been experiencing a monumental year in 2019. He's been leading the U.K. drill wave and dropped his debut album <i>Third Avenue</i> at the top of the year and continued to make major moves. He was included on the <i>Top Boy</i> soundtrack and recently, linked up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/popcaan/profile">Popcaan</a> and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ToryLanez/profile">Tory Lanez</a> for Stay Flee Get Lizzy's new song, "2 Cups." Now, he returns with a brand new banger titled, "Netflix &amp; Chill." Now, before you think that Fredo's gone all lover boy on us -- it's quite the opposite. The rapper gets in a melodious bag on this record as he continues to portray the U.K. streets over guitar-driven production.</p>
      <p>Perhaps this could kick off a campaign for a new project in the new year. Keep your eyes peeled.</p>
