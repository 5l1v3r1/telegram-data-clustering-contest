      <h2>The company is also offering discounted bundles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:41:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/igor-bonifacic" target="_blank">Igor Bonifacic</a></address>
      <p>It looks like someone at Amazon missed the memo that Black Friday is at the end of November, not the start. Ahead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/amazon-echo-show-8/">Echo Show 8</a>'s release on November 21st, Amazon has discounted both the charcoal and sandstone models by $30, making them <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQ3TCT2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=83c0f54e8a9c53362dcfa185ebae2695&amp;language=en_US">$100</a>, instead of $130.</p>
      <p>While not new, you can also get a discount on two pre-order bundles. For <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XLFVVKD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=4da4780ce6e8dce4425fa3328ee3eab4&amp;language=en_US">$170</a>, instead of $220, you can buy the Echo Show 8 and 5 together. Alternatively, you can purchase the Echo Show 8 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/ring-indoor-camera-stick-up-cam-alarm-kit/">Ring Indoor Camera</a> for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XSCH7W2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=hgg2019gallery-20&amp;linkId=5ef3a5ee83b1aab8bad0d833ffb484fc&amp;language=en_US">$160</a>, instead of $190.</p>
      <p>The Echo Show 8 features an 8-inch screen and borrows elements from both of Amazon's past smart displays. It features the same display and sound capabilities as the original Echo Show, and adds the camera shutter and form factor of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/29/amazon-echo-show-5/">Echo Show 5</a>. While we haven't had a chance to review the Echo Show 8 yet, we did like its smaller sibling a lot, giving it an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/24/amazon-echo-show-5-review/">85 when we put it through the paces</a>.</p>
      <p>If you pre-ordered the Echo Show 8 when Amazon first announced it back at the end of September, we've reached out to the company to confirm you'll get it for $100, instead of $130.</p>
