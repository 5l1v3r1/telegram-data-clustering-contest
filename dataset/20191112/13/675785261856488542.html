      <h1>Patrick Vieira gives verdict on Unai Emery amid speculation he could replace Spaniard at Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>Emery is under increasing pressure after struggling Arsenal were easily beaten by Leicester City on Saturday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T13:00:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Patrick Vieira has urged Arsenal fans to "get behind" under-pressure boss Unai Emery - after previously revealing his ambition to return to the Gunners as manager.</p>
      <p>Beleaguered former Sevilla coach Emery is under increasing pressure after the struggling north Londoners were easily beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Two wins from 10 in the league has seen the pressure mount on Emery's position with "Emery Out" once again trending on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in the immediate aftermath of that game.</p>
      <p>Vieira, 43, won three Premier League titles — including in 2003-04 when he captained the ‘Invincibles’ team as they went unbeaten for an entire season — and three FA Cups during his playing spell in north London.</p>

      <p>And the Frenchman, currently managing in Ligue 1 with Nice, has told Emirates chiefs to back Emery despite their miserable form.</p>
      <p>"It's true <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are going through a tough spell," Vieira said. "But I haven't watched all their matches, so I can't talk about their game.</p>
      <p>"They have a coach who is qualified and who works well. When a club is having a difficult time, it's important to be united. I think he has enough experience to get them through this difficult spell.</p>
      <p>"We have to get behind him and give him time to change things. I am not sure a change of manager will fix the problems."</p>

      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-legend-patrick-vieira-admits-20585401">Vieira admitted he would jump at the chance</a> of one day returning to Arsenal as manager.</p>
      <p>The French World Cup winner quit the Gunners to pursue a playing career in Italy before hanging up his boots following a brief spell with  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>  in 2011.</p>
      <p>Vieira began his coaching career at the Etihad and, after enjoying a maiden managerial spell with City-affiliated New York City, he is now boss of French top-flight outfit Nice.</p>
      <p>In an interview with French outlet  <a href="https://rmc.bfmtv.com/">RMC</a>  , Vieira seemingly suggested that he would be open to managing Arsenal if current boss Emery was to leave the club.</p>

      <p>When asked about managing his former club as well as the France national team, he said: “If it’s my dream to coach Arsenal or France? Yes, like any player, when we do this job we want to touch the very high level.</p>
      <p>"But the very high level I can touch with Nice from the moment we give ourselves the means to succeed and from the moment the way which we work is quite consistent.</p>
      <p>"But we do this job, and I do this job, to one day to be the coach of a team that participates in the Champions League.”</p>
