        <b>In Estonia’s north-west, a village, where different forms of the care of persons with autism spectrum disorder is under construction.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://news.err.ee/1001949/village-for-adults-with-autism-to-be-built-in-liikva">Estonian public broadcaster ERR reports</a> that the village in Liikva, Harju County, is meant for adults with autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome and other rare disorders. The project is planned to be completed in 2020, at a total cost of over four million euros.</p>
      <p>«Our plan is to begin by offering day- and weekly care, which at a later stage will transition to permanent services,» Janno Kell, a project manager at the Liikva Päikesekodu foundation, explained. «The need for this tends to come up after a child or client loses one or both of their parents.»</p>
      <p>ERR reports that the village would consist of three family homes for ten people each, one of which will be dedicated to Russian-speaking residents. An additional building will be erected for recreation and work purposes.</p>
