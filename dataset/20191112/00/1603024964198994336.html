      <p>The <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/finance-general/edelweissfinancialservices/EC01">Edelweiss</a> said that its investment advisory arm has raised up to $75 million from private equity firm Sanaka Capital and other investors.</p>
      <p>Sanaka Capital’s special purpose vehicle has committed to invest $44 million into Edelweiss Global Investment Advisors (EGIA), while talks are on for further investment of $31 million. The proposed investment is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
      <p>The move is part of the group’s strategy to separate its credit, investment advisory and insurance businesses into three distinct entities, Edelweiss said.</p>

      <p>EGIA includes wealth and capital markets, asset management and asset reconstruction arms. With this, EGIA manages more than $45 billion worth of customer assets.</p>
      <p>“The proposed investments by Sanaka Capital follows that of US based Kora Management and furthers the third and final process for the Investment Advisory business,” Edelweiss said.</p>
      <p>Edelweiss also announced partnership with South Korean financial services firm Meritz to raise $425 million for its realty financing platform.</p>
      <p>The platform will house funds that will buy out existing residential realty loans and provide requisite completion financing to good quality, commercially viable projects. The funds will be managed by the group’s alternative asset management arm.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
