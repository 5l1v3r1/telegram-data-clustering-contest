      <p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) - Authorities in North Carolina say an inmate has died after injuring himself in an apparent suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>Citing a Buncombe County sheriff’s statement, The Asheville Citizen-Times reports 45-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-grogan/">Eric Grogan</a> died Sunday. The statement says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-grogan/">Grogan</a> “injured himself” Friday and was immediately treated and hospitalized, but later succumbed to his wounds.</p>
      <p>Sheriff’s spokesman Aaron Sarver declined to detail the nature of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-grogan/">Grogan</a>’s wounds, citing medical confidentiality. He says the Buncombe County Detention Facility inmate was not on suicide watch at the time. An investigation into the death is ongoing. The cause of death is pending an autopsy set for Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sarver says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-grogan/">Grogan</a> was wanted on a fugitive warrant out of Georgia when he was apprehended by Asheville police last month. The underlying charges weren’t immediately available.</p>
