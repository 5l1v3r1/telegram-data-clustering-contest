      <p><i>Image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/moscow-russia-april-23-2018-stephen-1110862889">Anton Gvozdikov / Shutterstock.com</a></i> <br/><b>Apple co-founder</b> Steve Wozniak and his wife have been victims of the Apple credit card’s supposed gender discrimination. <br/><b>Wozniak revealed</b> that despite sharing bank accounts and other assets, his wife found that her Apple Card credit limit was 10 times lesser than that of Wozniak. <br/><b>The Wozniaks</b> seemed to share a similar experience with Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier, who had 20 times the credit limit of his wife. <br/><b>Wozniak tweeted</b> that Goldman Sachs and Apple should “share the responsibility” behind the sexist credit limit. <i><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50365609?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">BBC News</a></i> reported that the New York Department of Financial Services is currently investigating the matter and looking whether a biased algorithm is at play. <br/><b>When Heinemeier</b> raised his concerns on Twitter, Wozniak weighed in on the situation on his end, and said that he and his wife didn’t seem to have a credit problem with other cards, except for the Apple Card. They tried to highlight the issue to customer service, but couldn’t rectify the situation. <br/><b>Apple told</b> <i><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-sexism-steve-wozniak-2019-11?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Business Insider</a></i> that Goldman Sachs is responsible for the credit limits, to which the latter denied that gender played a role in determining someone’s credit limit. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The bank told</b> <i><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/10/business/goldman-sachs-apple-card-discrimination/index.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">CNN</a></i> that each credit application has been evaluated independently. Goldman Sachs assessed indivduals’ income and creditworthiness—including their debts and personal credit scores—claiming that, therefore, “it is possible for two members to receive significantly different credit decisions.” <br/><b>A spokesperson</b> for the New York Department of Financial Services told <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-09/viral-tweet-about-apple-card-leads-to-probe-into-goldman-sachs?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Bloomberg</a></i> that the team will be verifying if New York law has been violated. It is looking to ensure that all individuals are treated equally regardless of gender.</p>
