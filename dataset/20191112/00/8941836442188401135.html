      <p>RADCLIFF, Ky. (AP) - A man who co-founded and coached a local basketball program in Kentucky has been convicted of sodomizing one of its teen players.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 43-year-old Corvell Conley was convicted Friday and acquitted of his initial charge of third-degree rape.</p>
      <p>Conley was arrested in April 2018 days after the assault, which arrest records say happened when Conley drove the girl home from a Kentucky Future basketball practice. She was younger than 16 years old at the time. A hospital medical report says the girl’s accusation aligned with the findings of a sexual assault nurse examiner.</p>

        <p>The jury recommended Conley serve four years in prison on the charge, which is punishable of up to five years. He would be eligible for parole after a year. Sentencing is set for January.</p>
