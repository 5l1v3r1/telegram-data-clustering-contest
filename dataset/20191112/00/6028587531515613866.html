      <p>“It never hurts to ask.”Disabled people know better than most that this isn’t always true, even when our right to ask is backed up by federal law.</p>
      <p>The right to ask for and receive individual help is one of the cornerstones of disability rights law. In the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, it’s referred to as “<a href="https://www.dol.gov/odep/topics/Accommodations.htm">reasonable accommodations</a>,” or “<a href="https://www.ada.gov/reachingout/t3regl1.html">modifications in policies, practices, or procedures</a>.” Either way, it is a process involving:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A request for out of the ordinary help or adjustment,</li>
        <li>Instructions on how that help can best be provided, and</li>
        <li>Someone committing the time, effort, or resources to provide the requested help</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The intended result is the equal opportunity and service that <a href="https://www.ada.gov/2010ADAstandards_index.htm">accessible design</a> alone can’t always deliver.</p>
      <p>It can be as simple as asking a supermarket clerk to reach a jar of spaghetti sauce off a high shelf ... or as complex and essential as hiring a <a href="https://adata.org/factsheet/sign-language-interpreters">Sign Language Interpreter</a> for a Deaf customer negotiating the price of a new car. It might be a rule change, like allowing <a href="https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm">assistance dogs</a> into a coffee shop ... or a permanent <a href="https://askjan.org/publications/individuals/employee-guide.cfm">alteration in the functions and processes of a job</a>. Some of these accommodations really do just call for a quick request on the spot, and the friendly willingness of a salesperson to do as they are asked. Other accommodations need to be negotiated, with several alternatives debated, and requests for supporting documentation of need and disability.</p>
      <p>It’s supposed to be a mostly informal process governed by courtesy, common sense, and mutual respect. In practice it often is. But just as often, store clerks and managers push the envelope, demanding excessive proof of disability, or a convincing and sympathetic <i>story</i> of the customer or employee’s disability before they will agree that they <i>deserve</i> even minor accommodations. They may claim to be too busy. They may agree to help, but grudgingly, loudly, calling unwanted attention to the disabled customer or employee. They may regard these legally required adjustments as “special privileges,” and remind the disabled person of this, along with any curious or impatient onlookers.</p>
      <p>While needing to ask for help in a businesslike way encourages disabled people to practically and proactively explain their needs, it also imposes a cumulative emotional cost. Even when these interactions go well, asking strangers in public settings for individual help takes a toll … and these interactions don’t always go well or comfortably.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.adatitleiii.com/2012/08/reasonable-modification-to-policies-practices-or-procedures-must-be-considered-when-requested-by-a-person-with-disability/">2012, a fairly typical ADA court ruling</a> reaffirmed the ADA requirement to provide “reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures.” A person with a chronic digestive condition needed to stow his bicycle for longer than the 10 minutes usually allowed at a public facility, so he could use the bathroom to attend to his colostomy. Allowing him extra time would be a “reasonable” exception to an otherwise “reasonable” rule. The court agreed, and the man’s right to this disability accommodation was vindicated … a win for disability rights. But the case also reminds us that these victories don’t come without a cost. After all, he had to sue. And even if this hadn’t been necessary, he still had to reveal and describe very personal, possibly embarrassing details of his need.</p>
      <p>It’s not hard to imagine similar situations where disabled people have to endure a personal cost just to obtain essential, equalizing accommodations: For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Asking your supervisor for instructions to be written, when she prefers verbal instructions and hates writing memos … having to explain your learning disability in some detail in order to convince her that your request is sincere and legitimate.</li>
        <li>Asking a waiter for a large print menu, or for help reading the regular menu … and being asked to explain that you are legally blind, exactly what that means, and why you need help.</li>
        <li>Asking an airline for wheelchair assistance for your mobility impairment … and enduring nasty looks and intrusive questions when you stand up out of the wheelchair and walk short distances, causing onlookers to wonder if you are “really” disabled.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ADA has changed these kinds of interactions for the better. But almost 30 years after the law passed, barriers still get in the way, and emotional costs still add up.</p>
      <p>Despite the more equitable framework provided by the ADA, the charitable view of “helping disabled people” persists. It’s less pervasive and suffocating than it used to be, but people still often behave as if providing help is a personal favor, for which disabled people should be appropriately grateful ... and which can always be refused.</p>
      <p>The process of asking still opens the door for people to interrogate us about our disabilities. It fuels one of the most pernicious forms of ableism … the belief that people who “claim” to be disabled really aren’t, and are just trying to use people’s goodwill and laws like the ADA to score “special privileges” and unfair advantages.</p>
      <p>Disabled people are also still expected to follow an unwritten etiquette of asking for and receiving help. It’s one of the cardinal virtues disabled people are supposed to display, along with endless innovation, cheerful adaptability, and patience, always patience, no matter what happens.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to imagine a more empowering process for people with disabilities to ask for and reliably obtain individual assistance from employers and businesses. But that doesn’t alter the fact that people with disabilities pay a price for having to ask for things multiple times a day, every day, just to function.</p>
      <p>What can be done to lower this price?</p>
      <p>First of all, we must acknowledge cost. Disability counselors and advocates especially should remember that while disabled people benefit from strong negotiation and self-advocacy skills, reluctance to use them day after day should never be dismissed or minimized. The ADA legally supports requests for assistance, and that’s a good thing. But that doesn’t make asking easy, or painless. We often decide to just stay at home when we’ve reached our aggravation limit. So emotional costs also have practical consequences.</p>
      <p>Second, we should remember that while disabled people can become good<i> </i>at asking for help, few of us are entirely comfortable with it. Even those of us who arrogantly demand help and accommodations are often in fact deeply conflicted, struggling to balance self-sufficiency and humility, privacy and openness, assertiveness and self-centered rudeness.</p>
      <p>Finally, service providers should be quicker to offer and provide accommodations and modifications <i>without</i> extensive questioning or bureaucracy. Disabled employees and customers always pay a price for asking for help, but there are few lasting costs to providing it. Even in those few cases when flexibility and individual attention may not be <i>legally</i> required, it is usually good business for everyone to drop the prosecutor’s role, and give disabled people the benefit of the doubt.</p>
      <p>Doing this makes life a lot better for people with disabilities, and a lot less complicated for everyone.</p>
