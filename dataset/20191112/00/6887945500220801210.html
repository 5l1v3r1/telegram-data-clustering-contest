      <h1>Liverpool Biennial Announces 2020 Theme and Participating Artists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">BLOUIN ARTINFO</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool Biennial has recently announced the theme for its 2020 edition: “The Stomach and the Port”. The festival, which will feature commissions from more than 50 leading international artists, will run from July 11, 2020, through October 25, 2020.</p>
      <p>The somewhat enigmatic title of the biennial’s 11th incarnation pertains to Liverpool’s dynamic history as a port city; a point of global contact and circulation. It is intended to speak to the interconnected relationship between a body and its environment, challenging the idea of the individual as a self-sufficient unit. Press materials discuss how “The Stomach and the Port” can also be taken as an entry point into non-Western modes of inquiry.</p>
      <p>This year, the festival is under the new direction of Turkish-born curator and writer Fatoş Ustek, who has commented upon this year’s ambitious plans: “We are thrilled to bring new horizons to the Biennial in 2020. We will be expanding further into public spaces with permanent and temporary artist commissions, whilst increasing our visibility in the city through our programming. We have brought together artists from the UK and around the globe, whose practices demonstrate a breadth of inquiry into the world we live in, to research and engage with Liverpool, its history and cultural landscape.”</p>
      <p>Founded in 1998, Liverpool Biennial is the UK’s largest public festival of contemporary art. It takes place every two years, spread over historic buildings, pop-up spaces and art galleries as well as public spaces. Over the course of 15 weeks, Liverpool will be transformed with a program of free exhibitions, performances, screenings, and fringe events. Venues confirmed as for this year’s edition include Bluecoat, FACT, Open Eye Gallery, Tate Liverpool, and Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum. New for 2020, Liverpool Biennial’s reach will also expand to the city’s historic Fabric District and beyond.</p>
