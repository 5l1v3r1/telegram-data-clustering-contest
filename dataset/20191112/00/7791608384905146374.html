      <p><b>Black Friday</b> is commonly seen as a joyous occasion, depicted as a day when shoppers would crowd the malls after Thanksgiving, spending so much as to put retailers “in the black” for the year, per <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-friday-history-why-is-it-called-black-friday_l_5d951322e4b02911e1154386?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Huffpost</i></a>. <br/><b>However, the origin</b> of Black Friday was not so positive. The early historical usage of the phrase had nothing to do with Christmas shopping, but instead, it referred to the market crash caused by falling gold prices back in 1869. <br/><b>However, the modern</b> reference that people are more familiar with dated back to the 1950s or 60s. <br/><b>Traffic police</b> coined the term in Philadelphia, as they saw it as a day of “traffic jams” and “intense crowding” in retail stores, according to Emmy-winning stylist and author David Zyla. He added that the term was featured in an ad in the 1966 issue of <i>The American Philatelist</i>, as stated in <i>Huffpost</i>. <br/><b>Black Friday</b> also meant that Christmas shopping season has sprung and the sidewalks and downtown stores would be over-crowded with shoppers from opening to closing time. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The original meaning</b> of the term was also seen in a 1994 <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2011-August/111695.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">article</a>, where the late police reporter Joseph P. Barrett mentioned that “Black Friday” was used to “describe” the “terrible traffic conditions.” <br/><b>The negative connotation</b> of the term is evidenced again in an <a href="http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2009-August/092018.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">archived clip</a> published in a 1951 issue of <i>Factory Management and Maintenance</i>. The day was described as a “bubonic plague” that led to a lot of absentees, as they had to rush to “get the production out” and fell sick out of exhaustion. <br/><b>Over the years,</b> there were even casualties and fatalities on Black Friday, giving it a more somber backstory. It was reported that there were <a href="http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">12 deaths and 117 injuries</a> due to crowd clashes to date. <br/><b>Now, though businesses</b> have rebranded the term to give it a positive spin. Black Friday now has a reputation as a day full of fun and shopping. <br/>[via <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-friday-history-why-is-it-called-black-friday_l_5d951322e4b02911e1154386?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Huffpost</a>, cover image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/woman-using-tablet-holding-black-friday-739910872">Shutterstock</a>]</p>
