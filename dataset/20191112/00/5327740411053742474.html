      <h2>Elon Musk wants to put thousands of these Starlink satellites in orbit, to offer high-speed internet service everywhere</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/ap-staff/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>SpaceX launched 60 mini satellites Monday, the second batch of an orbiting network meant to provide global internet coverage.</p>
      <p>The Falcon rocket blasted into the morning sky, marking the unprecedented fourth flight of a booster for SpaceX. The compact flat-panel satellites — just 575 pounds (260 kilograms) each — will join 60 launched in May.</p>
      <p>SpaceX founder and chief executive Elon Musk wants to put thousands of these Starlink satellites in orbit, to offer high-speed internet service everywhere. He plans to start service next year in the northern U.S. and Canada, with global coverage for populated areas after 24 launches.</p>
      <p>Last month, Musk used an orbiting Starlink satellite to send a tweet: “Whoa, it worked!!”</p>
      <p>Employees gathered at company bases on both coasts cheered when the first-stage booster landed on a floating platform in the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>“These boosters are designed to be used 10 times. Let’s turn it around for a fifth, guys,” company’s launch commentator said.</p>
      <p>This also marked the first time SpaceX used a previously flown nose cone. The California-based company reuses rocket parts to cut costs.</p>
      <p>Stacked flat inside the top of the rocket, the newest satellites were going to manoeuvre even higher following liftoff, using krypton-powered thrusters. SpaceX said there was a potential problem with one of the 60 that could prevent it from moving beyond its initial 174 mile-high (280 kilometre-high) orbit. In that case, the faulty satellite will be commanded to re-enter and burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>Each satellite has an autonomous system for dodging space junk. In September, however, the European Space Agency had to move one of its satellites out of the way of a Starlink satellite. SpaceX later said it corrected the problem.</p>
      <p>SpaceX is among several companies interested in providing broadband internet coverage worldwide, especially in areas where it costs too much or is unreliable. Others include OneWeb and Jeff Bezos’ Amazon.</p>
      <p>According to Musk, Starlink revenue can help SpaceX develop rockets and spacecraft for travelling to Mars, his overriding ambition.</p>
