      <p>South Africa’s opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to allow members of the G40 faction back to the country as a show of political tolerance.</p>
      <p>Most G40 members were hounded out of Zimbabwe in November 2017 after the military staged a coup that deposed former President Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>Prominent members of the exiled G40 members include Professor Jonathan Moyo, Savior Kasukuwere and his brother Tongai, Mugabe’s nephew Patrick Zhuwawo, Walter Mzembi among many others.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday in a tribute to Mugabe, Malema offered to mediate between Mnangagwa and the G40 faction.</p>
      <p>“We want to make a clarion call for President Mnangagwa to allow the Zanu-PF comrades who are in exile to return home and that there should be a high level of political tolerance because the disagreements should not lead to targeting and victimising those who hold a different view,” said Malema.</p>
      <p>“If Zimbabwe is going to succeed, all the progressive forces will have to come together in defence of what President Mugabe stood for.</p>
      <p>“We also want to avail ourselves to engage in facilitating that type of agreement between the comrades in exile and those who remain in Zimbabwe.”</p>
