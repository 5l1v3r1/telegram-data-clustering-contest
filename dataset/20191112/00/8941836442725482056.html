      <p>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Mark Dantonio says he is not thinking about his future as Michigan State’s coach as the Spartans prepare to face rival Michigan this weekend.</p>
      <p>Michigan State has lost four games in a row and will finish the regular season with at least five losses for the third time in four years. Dantonio talked a bit about how he handles criticism and speculation about his program, then he was asked specifically whether he thinks about his own future.</p>
      <p>His response: “No. I get ready for the next game. I live in the present.”</p>
      <p>The Spartans take on the 14th-ranked Wolverines on Saturday in Ann Arbor. Michigan State will be without tight end Matt Dotson, who is out for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.</p>
