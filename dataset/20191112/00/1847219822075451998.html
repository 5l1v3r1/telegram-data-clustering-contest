        <b>In Lithuanian schools, there currently learn more than 500 students from Ukraine, including the war-torn east of the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reports that the Vilnius Lithuanian House school now hosts 52 children from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Its Director Gintautas Rudzinskas says: «We are waiting for another 15 students from the war zone who should come in November».</p>
      <h3>«The children arrive truly traumatised,» he point out. «There are cases where one of the parents has died.»</h3>
      <p>The goal is to provide opportunities to unplug from the environment they have lived through, LRT reports.</p>
      <p>To keep the Ukrainian students busy, the school keeps a long list of post-curriculum activities, including cookery, sports, town and museum visits. The children live in shared accommodation that include free meals.</p>
