      <p>Each year, thousands of companies around the world use the DISC tool to determine if their employees have dominant behavioral style of Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, or Conscientiousness (or some combination of the four). Typically offered during new hire orientation, or as part of a leadership or team building workshop, the simplicity of the DISC assessment has made it one of the most popular personality profiles in the world. Similar tools include <a href="https://www.insights.com/us/products/insights-discovery/">Insights Discovery</a>, <a href="https://eu.themyersbriggs.com/en">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>, <a href="https://www.thinkherrmann.com/">Herrmann Brain Dominance Index</a>, and using a strengths-based approach, the Gallup <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252137/home.aspx">CliftonStrengths </a>assessment. </p>
      <p>People love to learn about themselves, and although DISC activities are always very popular in the workshop itself, how long do people remember their results?</p>
      <p>And how many managers remember the DISC results of their team members?</p>
      <p>Most importantly, how often do people <i>actually</i> apply their DISC style to improve their communication, conflict resolution, and overall effectiveness?</p>
      <p>
        <b>DISC And The Knowing-Doing Gap</b>
      </p>
      <p>The huge chasm between what we know and what we actually apply back on the job has been called the “Knowing-Doing Gap”. It’s estimated that 40-85% of all training becomes “scrap learning”, relegated to knowledge forgotten or never applied.</p>
      <p>There are many potential reasons why people don’t apply DISC results over the long-term, but it doesn’t take a research study to see that we are all so “crazy busy” that we generally operate with short-term thinking in task-mode. It’s hard to remember our own style, others’ styles, and to take the pause—the long deep breath—to think and modulate our approach.</p>
      <p>Traditional methods of reminding people of their DISC results include stickers or pins to use during the workshop, placards to be placed on one’s desk, or encouragement to declare your style in the footer of your email.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scale and Sustain DISC With Nudges</b>
      </p>
      <p>But what if you had a DISC coach who could remind you every week of your profile and how to leverage it?</p>

      <p>These little reminders are examples of behavioral <i>nudges</i>. And nudges can make a dramatic difference in human behavior, and can substantially close the Knowing-Doing Gap.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What Is A Behavioral Nudge?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A nudge is an indirect suggestion or subtle reminder intended to influence people’s behavior.</p>
      <p>Officially, the term “nudge” was defined and popularized by two huge professors of economics, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein. In their 2009 book, <i>Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness</i>, they define a nudge as:</p>
      <p>
        <i>A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Practically speaking, nudges can take the form of a sign posted in a public place, a message sent in the mail or email, or even just in the design of a process, or placement of objects that are intended to result in positive choices (e.g., move fruit cups to the front of the buffet line and fries further back, and people will eat more fruit).</p>
      <p>Today, HR professionals and trainers now have access to digital tools that make sending nudges far easier than ever before. Soon it will be rare for a behavioral profile <i>not </i>to be coupled with a nudge system tailored for the specific job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Your Nudge Strategy</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you think tactics from behavioral science may be a good supplement to the training and development programs you are already offering, here are some questions to consider:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Who should get the nudges? Everyone who takes the DISC or only managers?</li>
        <li>How often should the nudges be delivered? Daily? Weekly?</li>
        <li>How long should the nudge reinforcement strategy be used? Ninety days after the training so ingrain the habit? One full year to reinforce the learning? Forever, because people’s teams change.</li>
        <li>How will you deliver the nudges? Via email or as notifications on mobile phones?</li>
        <li>How will you inform employees that their DISC profile will be known by colleagues? How do you inform them of that now?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Reinforcing DISC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leadership is about behaviors, and even motivated managers struggle to move from task-orientation to people-focused behaviors. While there is no silver bullet, we know that more training and more stickers and buttons probably aren’t the answer. With today’s digital technologies—from email to messaging to audio messages—it’s easier than ever before to add behavioral nudge campaigns to DISC assessments, and to defeat the knowing-doing gap.</p>
