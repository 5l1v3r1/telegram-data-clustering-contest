      <p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - Former Alaska <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/">Gov. Sarah Palin</a> says she learned her husband was seeking a divorce in an email from his attorney.</p>
      <p>The revelation came in an interview released Tuesday with James Dobson, founder of the Family Talk Christian ministry. He said the interview had been conducted previously.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/">Palin</a> says she received an email June 19 from the attorney, almost three months before Todd Palin filed on his birthday in September.</p>
      <p>She described the filing that came shortly after their 31st wedding anniversary as devastating.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sarah-palin/">Palin</a> says they’re going through counseling and their marriage isn’t “over, over.” She says attorneys are “getting rich” off them.</p>
