      <h1>Republican Resistance To Medicaid Expansion Is Killing Thousands Of Americans</h1>

      <p>U.S. healthcare policy is literally a matter of life and death. Economists have developed a macabre but necessary count of both the benefits of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and the costs—often, the ultimate price—of Republican state politicians’ efforts to curtail insurance coverage in opposition to federal policy.</p>
      <p>Medicaid expansion mandated through the passage of Obamacare has saved at least 19,000 lives of adults age 55 to 64 between 2014 and 2017,<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds"> according to a new study</a> from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.</p>
      <p>“The lifesaving impacts of Medicaid expansion are large: an estimated 39% to 64% reduction in annual mortality rates for older adults gaining coverage,” write the report’s authors, Matt Broaddus and Aviva Aron-Dine.</p>
      <p>Some 15,600 older adults died prematurely because of state decisions not to expand Medicaid, according to the study.</p>

      <p>Medicaid expansion ranks among other major public health initiatives in lifesaving potential, the authors write.</p>
      <p>“If all states had expanded Medicaid, the number of lives saved just among older adults in 2017 would roughly equal the number of lives that seat belts saved among the full population, based on estimates from the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission.”</p>

      <p>The study also provides state-level estimates of lives saved and lost depending on state officials’ decisions to accept federal funds or reject them. There are 14 Republican-controlled states that have still not yet adopted or implemented expansion, including Texas, North Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>“This clear evidence of the lives that are at stake provides yet another reason—on top of the already well-documented improvements in access to care, health outcomes, financial security and state and hospital finances—for these states to take up expansion without delay,” the authors argue.</p>
