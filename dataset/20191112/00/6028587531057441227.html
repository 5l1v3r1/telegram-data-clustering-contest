      <h1>Current/Elliott Partners With The Vampire’s Wife For A Holiday Capsule Collection</h1>

      <p>If you like your jeans with an old Hollywood twist, make some room in your closet: The Vampire’s Wife has teamed up with denim brand <a href="https://www.currentelliott.com/the-vampire-s-wife">Current/Elliott</a> for a holiday capsule collection and it’s just as covetable as you’d expect. The collaboration perfectly melds the vintage glamour of The Vampire’s Wife (TVW) with the west coast tomboy ease of Current/Elliott. The 10‐piece line showcases both brand’s Los Angeles aesthetics, filled with denim, leather, liberty floral prints and knits. TVW’s signature ruffled Kate dress gets a Current/Elliott makeover in denim and leather, plus there’s wide‐leg pants, culottes, Led Zeppelin-inspired jeans and blouses, and lace galore.</p>

      <p>That melding of the minds is what attracted both lines to the collaboration. “I loved the LA connection and I wanted to explore working in LA, the city that I love,” says Susie Cave, Founder &amp; Creative Director, The Vampire’s Wife. “I was excited to see TVW translated into denim and leather. We worked closely together to integrate the classic TVW styles into a more casual street look. ” James Miller, CEO of Current/Elliott, explains, “It was a chance for us to explore the evening wardrobe for the Current Elliott woman. Who better than TVW, which so perfectly fuses the LA energy with a strong structural aesthetic.”</p>

      <p>Cher, particularly her famous denim looks from the 70s, is the inspiration behind the collection. “Cher, if it must be known, is the muse behind <i>all</i> my clothes,” Cave says. “There is no one on earth that wears clothes with the same boldness and sense of spirit as Cher. She has been my pin-up girl for as long as I can remember!”</p>

      <p>Each designer pushed the other to reach beyond their typical sartorial boundaries. “Any collaboration has to have a purpose for both brands to succeed where they typically wouldn’t venture,” Miller says. “Current Elliott’s collaboration with TVW continues to push both brands forward and we’re extremely proud of this collection. Both brands have such different points of view when it comes to fabrication. Experimenting with denim and leather but following the codes of TVW silhouettes had some truly breathtaking results. Susie’s lens for her customer is extremely purist and that’s what we loved about this design opportunity. We haven’t diluted that vision and that shows in the dramatic pieces we’ve created.”</p>

      <p>Working with denim was an enjoyable challenge for Cave. “Demin has a mind of its own,” she says. “It is very difficult to right. I tried various denim things in TVW but could never quite get there. The same goes for leather. It’s a whole different feel. I loved the way they reinterpreted the classic mini Kate into denim. It had a more rough and ready look. I loved that… I was very happy to finally get to make a pair of jeans. Something I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but it is the mini Kate that is closest to my heart.”</p>

      <p>As for his favorite, of course Miller flocks to jeans. “The lace Shangri-la denim jean is that bold expressive Cher muse moment,” he says. “It shouldn’t work, but that’s the wonderful aspect of this collaboration — it does.”</p>
