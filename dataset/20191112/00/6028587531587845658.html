      <h3>Apple iPhone XS</h3>

      <p>The iPhone XS may be last year’s model, but that doesn’t make it any less of an incredible device. The phone features the latest and greatest Apple iPhone design, along with a beautiful 5.8-inch display, an Apple A12 Bionic processor, and up to a massive 512GB of storage. </p>
      <p>Perhaps even better than the display on the phone is the camera. Sure, it’s not quite as impressive as the dual-sensor camera on the iPhone 11 Pro, but it still has a ton to offer — and will easily take incredible photos in almost all situations. Safe to say, if you don’t need the latest and greatest iPhone, but still want an excellent device, the iPhone XS is the way to go.</p>
      <p>The phone is currently available on eBay for $779.99, which is $220 off its launch price of $999.99.</p>

      <h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 9</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 is the latest flagship smartphone from the company. It comes with a big, 6.4-inch screen and works with a dual-lens camera array on the back. And since it has small bezels at the top and bottom and hardly anything to the side, the front appears to have an all-screen design.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Note 9 differentiates itself from other products in the market with help from its S Pen stylus, which comes with the device and allows you to digitally write on the screen. Add that to ample power from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip, and the Galaxy Note 9 is a clear winner.</p>
      <p>Still, at $999, it can be expensive. But if you act now and buy it on eBay, you can get it for just $620 — a massive saving off its regular retail price.</p>

      <p>Perhaps all you want is a reliable iPhone that won’t break the bank — and the iPhone 8 is an excellent option. The device may not look as modern as Apple’s latest devices, but it still boasts great performance and a solid camera for a low price.</p>
      <p>Like any other iPhone, the iPhone 8 comes with Apple’s iOS operating system, which will allow you to integrate the device with the rest of your Apple devices. You’ll be able to use it with your Apple TV to type instead of scrolling through a keyboard, easily access your Apple Music library and more.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 8 is available from eBay for $428.88.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, power isn’t everything. And in those cases, getting your hands on an iPhone that can work well in today’s market, but not break the bank is a really good idea. And that’s precisely what you can get with help from eBay’s offer on Apple’s iPhone 7.</p>
      <p>Over at eBay, you can get the iPhone 7 for just $204. Better yet, it’s available on any GSM carrier so you can put it on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile’s network.</p>
      <p>Apple’s iPhone 7 is a few years old. But what you lose in age, you make up for in significant value. And since the iPhone 7 still works well with many of today’s most popular apps, your smartphone experience should still be quite good.</p>

      <p>Each year, Samsung kicks off its flagship launches with the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+. And it’s the latter option, which is available at a significant discount, that you can get now on eBay.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s Galaxy S9+ ships with a 6.2-inch curved screen and has thin bezels at the top and bottom that leave no room for a physical home button. There’s also a dual, vertically aligned camera array on the back and the handset ships with both a fingerprint sensor and face scanner for verifying your identity.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S9+ is one of the most capable smartphones on store shelves today and will work well with any app you use on it.</p>
      <p>On eBay, the smartphone is priced at $515. If you buy it new, you’ll fork over $840.</p>
