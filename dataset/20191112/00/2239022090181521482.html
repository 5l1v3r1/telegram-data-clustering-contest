      <p>Regardless of whether it’s “high” or “fast,” fashion shouts (or dog-whistles) its way through the crowds with branded signifiers. But the linguistically opaque garments gathered here are <i>shanzhai</i>: Chinese counterfeits of branded merchandise, and often hectic amalgamations of homely graphic design, queerly philosophical lamentations, and grammatically errant versions of trendy political statements. Operating as an offshoot of <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Display%20Distribute">Display Distribute</a>, an “itinerant artistic research platform” and occasional exhibition space based in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Ming%20Lin">Ming Lin</a> and <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Alexandra%20Tatarsky">Alexandra Tatarsky</a>—the duo that make up <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Shanzhai%20Lyric">Shanzhai Lyric</a>—archive images of such clothes on Instagram or contextualize them through essays. And now, they have brought a feast of mistranslation and liberated nonsense to two humble wooden structures at the Abrons Art Center, one installed downstairs and the other displayed upstairs in the main half-rotunda. Each functions as a rack for long- and short-sleeved T-shirts printed with text, and on one of the plywood bars of the upper-level piece, <i>The Incomplete Poem</i>, 2017–, is a low-hanging fruit, a grape-and-teal-striped number over which is printed in a black, all-caps font: “WE SHOUL ALLB FEMINIS.” Hung above this, a white tee with interlocking gold C’s is boldly labeled “CNANEL.” And just like that, the statement T-shirt loses its laughable earnestness and attains the surreal levity and unnerving presence of found poetry: ambiguous, with facets of parody and stabs of poignancy.</p>
      <p>Pinned to the wall by <i>The Incomplete Poem </i>is a half-page of typed poetry, <i>Endless Garment</i>, 2015–, an edited transcription of the <i>shanzhai </i>shirts’ text. Here, redundancy matters, insofar as it speaks to the global pileup of the unnecessary; yet it can also be a détournement of cultural excess and runoff, especially when the prospect of authorship has been foreclosed. The word <i>shanzhai </i>can be translated as “mountain hamlet,” implicitly identifying the bootlegger with the role of the sansculotte, a provincial outsider of creative industries, engineering their permission-less products in what’s ironically a center of production for many Western designers and auteurs. Sadly, this abundance of creativity isn’t so good for the planet anymore. However, the anonymous designers of these garments still manage a paean to Earth’s wonders—on a Kelly-green shirt, one can read: “The world seen powdery pink to shades of green is dressed in joy.” Hear, hear.</p>
