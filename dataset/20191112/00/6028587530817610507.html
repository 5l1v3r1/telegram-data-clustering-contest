      <h1>The 2020 List Of The World’s Best Cruises Is Out Now</h1>

      <p>U.S. News &amp; World Report has released its annual list of the <a href="https://travel.usnews.com/cruises/">world’s best cruises</a>. The report evaluated 176 ships in 17 of the top cruise lines to determine the rankings in six categories including best cruise lines for the money and best luxury cruise lines.The findings factored in evaluations from cruise industry experts, health assessments conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, price classes, itinerary offerings, and reputation among travelers. The final rankings reflect offerings across the entire fleet of each line rather than information on individual ships within each fleet and the varying services each might include.</p>

      <p>Royal Caribbean came in at number one in the Best Cruise Line for the Money category, while Viking Ocean Cruises earned the top spot in both the Best Luxury Cruise Line and Best Cruise Line for Couples categories thanks to its high-end amenities, adult-focused ambiance, and romantic touches like private verandas in each stateroom and fireplaces in common areas.</p>
      <p>No surprise, Disney Cruise Line maintained its hold on the top spot for Best Cruise Lines for Families yet again – it has earned this distinction in every one of U.S. News’ annual rankings. This year, it also won Best Cruise Line in the Caribbean for the seventh consecutive year. Rounding out the roster of winners, Seabourn Cruise Line remained the number one Best Cruise Line in the Mediterranean for 2020.</p>
      <p>Among the new and notable trends in the cruise industry this year are intensifying eco-conscious initiatives with major investments in liquefied natural gas-powered ships, the elimination in onboard single-use plastics, and the addition of more offbeat destinations such as the Galapagos Islands and Antarctica in response to the cruising public’s growing appetite for adventure.</p>
      <p>You can find all the rankings <a href="https://travel.usnews.com/cruises/">here</a>, but these are the individual categories with the top three lines listed in U.S. News &amp; World Report’s list of the world’s best cruises for 2020.</p>

      <p>While interesting in and of themselves, these rankings require some context in order for consumers to determine which lines might be best for their preferences. Among the factors you should consider when choosing a cruise line and a specific itinerary is whether its route includes ports of interest, the size of the ship, and the specific amenities it offers, such as particular restaurants or expansive spa facilities. However, even unmoored as they are, these rankings do set a good benchmark for quality across the cruising industry and a detailed overview of the offerings currently available.</p>
      <p>For more background and information, it pays to cross-check these findings with the annual cruise rankings compiled by other major publications including <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/best-cruise-ships-gold-list">Condé Nast Traveler</a>, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/worlds-best/top-cruise-lines">Travel + Leisure</a>, and <a href="https://www.cruisecritic.com/memberreviews/cruiserschoice_index.cfm?Category=Overall">Cruise Critic</a>.</p>
