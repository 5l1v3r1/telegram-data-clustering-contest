      <p>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Florida and Arizona State have agreed to play a home-and-home series beginning in 2028.</p>
      <p>The school announced the deal Tuesday. The Gators will make the trip to Tempe, Arizona, in 2028, and the Sun Devils will travel to Gainesville three years later.</p>
      <p>It’s the latest step in both schools’ quest to improve non-conference schedules.</p>
      <p>The Gators played two teams from the Football Championship Subdivision this season, and their 2020 schedule includes visits from Eastern Washington, South Alabama and New Mexico State.</p>
      <p>But athletic director Scott Stricklin has taken a more aggressive approach to future schedules, signing contracts in the past 17 months to face South Florida (2021, ‘22, ‘25), Utah (2022-23), Miami (2024-25), Colorado (2028-29), Texas (2030-31) and now Arizona State (2028, ‘31).</p>

      <p>Arizona State has future series scheduled with Oklahoma State (2022-23), Mississippi State (2024-25), Texas A&amp;M; (2026-27), LSU (2029-30) and Texas (2032-33).</p>
      <p>Florida and Arizona State have never played in football.</p>
