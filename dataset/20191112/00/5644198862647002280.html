      <p>Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 6-4 in a high-quality battle of the debutants at the ATP Finals on Monday.</p>
      <p>LONDON: Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 6-4 in a high-quality battle of the debutants at the ATP Finals on Monday.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, the first Greek player to qualify for the tournament, had lost all five previous matches against the Russian, but turned the tables in impressive fashion.</p>

      <p>The 21-year-old served superbly and did not face a single break point and took his chances in clinical fashion to the delight of the O2 Arena crowd who clearly enjoyed his style.</p>
      <p>Playing the more adventurous tennis, Tsitsipas earned a set point in the opening set tiebreak with a volley onto the sideline and converted when Medvedev netted a forehand.</p>
      <p>Striking the ball with venom, the swashbuckling Tsitsipas earned three break points at 3-3 in the second set but Medvedev responded with some gutsy tennis to hang on.</p>
      <p>A misjudgement by Medvedev at 4-4, leaving a ball that landed on the baseline, gave Tsitsipas another break point and this time he took his chance.</p>
      <p>Tsitsipas, who won 39 of 44 points when he landed his first serve, claimed victory with a smash.</p>
      <p>"I had goosebumps today, playimg on this court that I dreamed of playing on, it's pure joy," Tsitsipas said.</p>
      <p>"This was one of my most important victories of my career so far. Everything worked pretty well.</p>
      <p>"Not easy coming in knowing you have lost five times but I made a deal with myself that I would keep trying."</p>
