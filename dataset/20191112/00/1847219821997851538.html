        <b>The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko is on Tuesday, November 12, on a visit to Austria. It is his first foreign visit to an European Union member state in three years.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/belarus-leader-visits-austria-seeking-closer-eu-ties/">Belgian news portal EurActiv reports</a> that the Belarusian leader has met with Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen in his first official visit to the Alpine nation following a trip of then Austrian head of government Sebastian Kurz to Belarus in March.</p>
      <p>Often described as «Europe’s last dictatorship», Belarus has been the target of Western sanctions over its human rights violations and lack of fair elections, and 65-year-old Lukashenko has rarely visited EU member states.</p>
      <p>Karin Kneissl, Austria’s former Foreign Minister under Kurz’s previous administration, noted in January that her country wanted to develop closer ties with Belarus as a «buffer state» between Russia, the EU and Ukraine, EurActiv reports.</p>
