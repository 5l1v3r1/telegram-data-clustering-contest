      <p>This past week, critics started to be a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/09/heres-why-there-are-no-early-reviews-of-disney-pluss-the-mandalorian/#746b88361937">little confused</a> about why they weren’t getting advance screeners for <i>The Mandalorian</i> on Disney Plus. Some were hinting that it could indicate Disney was trying to avoid potentially bad buzz about the show if it wasn’t great, but now that it’s here?It’s great. It really is.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t the issue. Rather, it was as Disney said, they were trying to avoid potential spoilers for the show making their way out into the world ahead of time, and yes, even as a journalist, it’s usually the case that <i>someone</i> spills the beans for most shows, hence why HBO also stopped giving out <i>Game of Thrones</i> screeners eventually.</p>
      <p>The rest of this article is going to get into spoiler territory for the first episode of <i>The Mandalorian</i>, if you couldn’t tell from the title. Yes, I know it just came out a few hours ago (in the US, at least) and that the service has been broken half the time, but I think a lot of people will have finished the first, short, 39 minute episode by the end of the day. So when you’ve done that, come back here and let’s discuss.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Spoilers ahead. For real.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All throughout the episode, I kept wondering what exactly the big “reveal” was that Disney was hiding. One kind of “whoa” moment was the reveal of the scuffed-up Stormtroopers hiding the former Imperial played by Werner Herzog, who hire the Mandalorian to find a target. But that wasn’t it.</p>

      <p>Nor was it the theory I held in the back of my mind that Disney was going to reveal that this was, in fact, a Boba Fett series that takes place after he crawls out of the Sarlacc pit and gets new armor, despite them claiming that it wasn’t. But actually, I think that notion is flat-out disproven this episode when we see flashbacks to the Mandalorian’s childhood where he was orphaned, presumably during some sort of attack on Mandalore, which is certainly not the origin story of Boba Fett, which was spelled out explicitly in the prequels (he’s a clone of Jango, etc. etc.).</p>
      <p>Rather, it became clear what was being hidden in the final moments of the episode, where the Mandalorian discovers that his “50 year old, dead or alive” target is none other than a baby uh, Yoda, for lack of a better term. It’s not <i>literally</i> Yoda (this series takes place after the events of ROTJ), it’s just Yoda’s species. But as Star Wars fans know, Yoda’s species is so mysterious and rare it does not even have a name, so finding a baby is…a very significant plot development for the entire Star Wars universe.</p>
      <p>And of course, this is complicated by who sent the Mandalorian <i>after</i> Baby Yoda (I really am going to have to stop calling him that) in the first place. That would be the ex-Imperial commander, who doesn’t seem to care if it’s dead or alive, and we actually learn that the IG unit was given instructions to kill it outright. The Mandalorian fries the IG instead of letting him do that (I hope the IG comes back, he was great), and now has to decide what to do with the child. The Imperial-aligned scientist wanted it alive, but no doubt for nefarious purposes all the same.</p>

      <p>Why is this a big deal? It’s not just that Yoda’s species is rare, it’s that pretty much every member of that species that shows up in the lore is a powerful Force user. So, the Imperials either want it dead, so it can’t rise up to be as powerful as someone like Yoda was, or they want to study it, figuring out how it has so much Force power, using that to their benefit or perhaps, raising it to be a dark side Sith…Yoda.</p>
      <p>It seems pretty clear that Baby Yoda will be the impetus for the plot for at least this first season of the show, and it stands to reason that the Mandalorian is <i>probably</i> not going to turn over an alien infant to be murdered or dissected in a lab, so he will then find himself at odds with probably whoever the Imperials send after him, whether that’s more rag-tag Stormtroopers or other bounty hunters. Given the nature of the show, probably both.</p>
      <p>This was a very, very cool turn, and I understand why Disney wanted to keep it under wraps. This has massive implications for the entire Star Wars universe and when paired with a show that’s as good as <i>The Mandalorian</i> looks to be, that’s very exciting news indeed. More to come.</p>
