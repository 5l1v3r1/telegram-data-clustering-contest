      <p>COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Texas A&amp;M; welcomed back forward Josh Nebo from injury, perhaps the difference between a win and loss on Monday night for the Aggies.</p>
      <p>“Nebo is a big force down low,” A&amp;M; guard Jay Jay Chandler said following the Aggies’ 63-57 comeback victory over Louisiana-Monroe. “Doing what Nebo does is a big plus.”</p>
      <p>Nebo earned his first action of the season with 17:50 remaining in the game, and not a moment too soon for the Aggies (2-0). They trailed the Warhawks 34-24 at the time, and he wound up making all three of his field-goal attempts, blocked three shots and grabbed four rebounds the rest of the way.</p>
      <p>Chandler also came up clutch in the second half, as the Aggies wiped out the double-digit deficit. A&amp;M; trailed 36-26 with 17:08 remaining in the game when Chandler sank consecutive 3-pointers to pull the home team within four at 36-32.</p>
      <p>Chandler then followed with two made free throws after a foul on his drive to the basket, giving ULM (2-1) a 36-34 advantage.</p>

      <p>“Those were shots I always work on,” Chandler said of his long-range offerings. “So they didn’t come with any pressure.”</p>
      <p>A&amp;M; finally tied the game at 45-45 on a thunderous alley-oop dunk by Nebo, who revealed that a hamstring injury had sidelined him in training camp.</p>
      <p>The Aggies finally grabbed a lead at 47-45 when Nebo blocked a shot and Chandler finished the resulting fast break with a dunk at the 7:52 mark. Nebo then upped the lead the Aggies wouldn’t relinquish with another dunk, in lifting A&amp;M; to a 49-45 advantage.</p>
      <p>“We kind of lost our nerve a little bit defensively, especially when they hit a couple of threes,” ULM coach Keith Richard said.</p>

        <p>Warhawks guard Michael Ertel led all scorers with 25 points, in making 6 of 13 3-pointers. ULM (2-1) hurt itself with 20 turnovers, including five by Tyree White.</p>
        <p>“You can’t have 20 turnovers and give them free points, and expect to win,” Richard said.</p>
        <p>The Aggies played before only a couple thousand fans in a 13,000-seat arena, in Buzz Williams’ second game as A&amp;M; coach.</p>
        <p>Williams said drawing larger crowds is akin to the movie “Field of Dreams” - in that he must build the program with a solid foundation to consistently interest fans.</p>
        <p>“If you build it, they will come,” Williams said in citing the line from the popular baseball film.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Texas A&amp;M;: The Aggies defeated Northwestern State by 14 in their opener on Wednesday and were never really in any trouble. They overcame a 10-point second half deficit to prevail against the Warhawks, which should give them a lift on Friday against a top 10 foe.</p>
        <p>ULM: The Warhawks can take plenty of heart in their first setback of the season, leading the Aggies by 10 in the second half before more talented A&amp;M; mounted a comeback.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>The Warhawks stay on the road against the SEC on Thursday at Mississippi State.</p>
        <p>The Aggies hope to finally draw a decent home crowd when they host No. 8 Gonzaga on Friday.</p>
