      <p>PARIS (AP) - The Paris screening of a new French-Italian film “An Officer and a Spy” is going ahead despite a new allegation that its director <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roman-polanski/">Roman Polanski</a> raped a woman decades ago. Tuesday’s screening will be attended by the film’s crew.</p>
      <p>French media say several interviews with actors from the movie have been canceled, however, including with Jean Dujardin and Louis Garrel.</p>
      <p>The French daily Le Parisien on Friday reported claims from a French woman in her early 60s that she was assaulted at age 18 in 1975 by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roman-polanski/">Polanski</a> at his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roman-polanski/">Polanski</a> “firmly contests” the allegation, his lawyer said.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roman-polanski/">Polanski</a> has been a fugitive from the U.S. for more than four decades since pleading guilty to a sex offense.</p>
