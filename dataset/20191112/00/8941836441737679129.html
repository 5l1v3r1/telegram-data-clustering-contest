      <p>BOSTON (AP) - The state’s Cannabis Control Commission has issued a quarantine order for marijuana products and devices that rely on vaporization.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s order includes vape pens, vape cartridges, aerosol products, and inhalers. The order doesn’t apply to medical use marijuana vaping devices designed for marijuana flower.</p>
      <p>The commission is also asking testing labs if they can test for vitamin E acetate, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified as a culprit in vaping-associated lung injuries. The labs currently test for contaminants like heavy metals.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Superior Court Judge Douglas Wilkins ruled last week marijuana cultivated for medical use must be exempted from Republican Gov. Charlie Baker’s four-month ban on vaping materials starting Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Baker issued the emergency ban in September in response to lung illnesses attributed to e-cigarette use.</p>
