      <h1>Spinning Out Tech - Why Some Universities Do It Better Than Others</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Trevor Clawson</a></address>
      <p>Riddle me this. Which U.K. university has been most successful when it comes to creating spin-out technology companies? Clearly it must be Oxford or Cambridge, or one of the many institutions located in the capital. Imperial College perhaps?  . </p>
      <p>Actually, according to a new report by VC firm <a href="https://octopusventures.com/">Octopus Ventures</a> and<a href="https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/centres-and-initiatives/entrepreneurship-centre/ideas-2-impact"> Ideas 2 Impact, </a>it is Queen’s University Belfast that currently that is currently leading the way in spinning out its research, with Cambridge in the number two position.  </p>
      <p>But more importantly perhaps, the study also sets out to highlight at least some of the factors that tend to be instrumental in driving spin-out success. And as partner, <b>Simon King</b> explains, in commissioning the research, Octopus was seeking to gain insights into how the policies of universities fed through into entrepreneurial impact. “We wanted to look at what was being done well and where there was room for improvement,” he says.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Underperforming?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the report points out, Britain’s leading universities are on a par with their U.S. counterparts in terms of the high quality research work they produce. However, it’s generally acknowledged that U.K. institutions underperform when it comes to capitalising on the intellectual property developed within their walls.  </p>
      <p>Octopus cites the record of just one U.S. university - the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - which has played a role in the creation of 26,000 businesses, supporting 3.3 million jobs and generating a turnover of $2 trillion. British universities come nowhere close to those numbers.</p>
      <p>So what can be done to unlock the potential of U.K. academia? And what separates Britain’s top performers from those who are less successful in spinning out their intellectual property.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Unlocking Potential</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report’s rankings provide a good place to start. As King explains, the ranking process factors-in several data points, including the number of startups created by each institution, the value and returns generated by the companies in question. The success rate is also taken into account - a university responsible for the creation of a relatively small number of startups may nonetheless be pushed up the rankings if the percentage of successes is higher than the average.   </p>
      <p>By applying those criteria, the report has created a top five featuring the aforementioned Queen’s University Belfast, Cambridge, Cardiff University, Queen Mary’s College London, and Leeds. Just a little way behind, Dundee, Nottingham, Kings College London, Oxford, and Imperial College London occupy the six to tenth positions. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Policy Matters</b>
      </p>
      <p>King says some universities are better - or perhaps more forward-thinking - than others in the way that they approach to licensing out their research. “Universities should make the process easy,” says King. “Startups need to move at a fast pace but sometimes it can take a long time to work out the agreements. It would be helpful, if universities introduced standard terms and conditions for spin-outs.”  </p>
      <p>King also makes a case for a change in academic culture. In the past, he says, the progress of an academic career would be driven in great part by the individual’s ability to publish research. “It was a case of publish or perish,” he says. Today, he argues, there is a case for factoring in the successful creation of companies as a factor in defining career success. This would create an incentive for academics to engage in commercialization projects. </p>
      <p>Business/Academic connections can play an important role in identifying a customer base for a particular type of technology. “Academics often develop a technology without thinking of potential markets,” says King. “So they come up with a solution first and then they look for a problem, So it’s important to talk to potential customers.” Connections with the business world enable academics to understand the commercial potential of the projects they are working on. </p>
      <p><b>Balanced Teams</b> </p>
      <p>Funding is an important factor. According to the report, there is a correlation between finding finance at an early stage - for instance, while prototypes are developed - and long term survival. Universities that do something to address the funding requirement achieve greater success. </p>
      <p>And of course, people come into the picture. As King points out, investors are looking for the right mix of skills - for instance, technologists, managers, marketers and product designers. Assembling a balanced team often depends an ability to recruit people from the business world or from another discipline within the academic system. As an example, King cites strong links between Imperial College London and the Royal College of Arts - links that have helped to forge strong founding teams. “You see technologists coming out of Imperial and product designers from the RCA,” he says. </p>
      <p>Perhaps what all this suggests is that first-rate research isn’t enough. If U.K. universities are to maximize the potential of their IP more needs to be done to create networks, develop ecosystems, streamline processes and (to some extent at least) change cultures. At least, according to the Octopus report.   </p>
