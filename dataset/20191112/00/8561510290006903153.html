      <h1>Watch Police Drag Away Truck That ICEd Tesla Driver</h1>

      <h3>Mr. Cool ICE</h3>
      <p>As electric cars are becoming more and more common, cities are making small changes to infrastructure to accommodate them, from dedicated charging stations to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/norwegian-gas-station-becomes-first-world-replace-all-pumps-electric-chargers-1461714">replacing fuel pumps</a> with chargers at gas stations.</p>
      <p>But not everybody is cooperating with those infrastructure shifts. Police used a crane to lift an enormous Ford pickup truck away from a parking spot in Berlin this week, after it was found to be blocking a dedicated electric vehicle charging stall, <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-owner-helped-by-berlin-police-after-de-iceing-of-ford-truck-from-ev-charging-station/"><i>Teslarati</i> reports</a>.</p>
      <h3>Supercharge</h3>
      <p>It’s the latest example of a troubling trend called <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/gasoline-iced-tesla-charger">ICEing</a>, a term that refers to internal combustion engine-powered cars protesting electric vehicles by parking their cars in charging spots.</p>
      <p>Gas guzzlers have waged this war for <a href="https://qz.com/1506901/trucks-are-ice-ing-tesla-owners-from-charging-stations/">almost a year</a> now, sometimes blocking chargers in <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/gasoline-iced-tesla-charger">entire towns</a> and leading organizers of popular car meetup Cars &amp; Coffee to recently <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/car-show-ice-tesla-chargers">plead with their participants</a> to leave Tesla Superchargers open.</p>
      <h3>Airlifted</h3>
      <p>Some more assertive hoodlums have taken to keying the sides of Tesla vehicles. Fortunately, some have been caught on camera thanks to the vehicle’s “Sentry Mode,” and in <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/tesla-vandal-sentry-mode-caught">more than one</a> instance, the perpetrators decided in the end to <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/pickup-truck-driver-vandalizing-tesla">turn themselves in</a> after the videos of them caught in the act went viral.</p>
      <p>“Had the big blue [Ford pickup] actually tapped the charging station, the surrounding households would have probably lost power,” reads a tongue-in-cheek tweet by Berlin’s police force over the weekend.</p>
