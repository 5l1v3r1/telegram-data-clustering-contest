      <p><b>The production value is there, but the first episode of the Disney+ show feels awkwardly staged, and it’s thus far coasting on the <i>Star Wars </i>brand name.</b>So, the big spoiler that Disney claimed necessitated them hiding <i>The Mandalorian </i>from critics until Disney+’s launch day is… no big deal. No, I’m not going to reveal it, but it’s mostly an amusing surprise and not remotely the kind of reveal/event that would justify both hiding the show from critics or hyping it up. It’s also not the kind of thing that critics would have revealed in their pre-release reviews, because that’s generally not how we operate. But the most important “spoiler” in regard to the first episode of the new live-action <i>Star Wars </i>television show, is that it’s not all that good. Yes, it’s just the pilot, but considering it’s directed by Dave Filoni, written by Jon Favreau and considered to be the big event on Disney+’s launch day, it’s a disappointment.</p>
      <p>The money is on the screen, and the production values seem to be top shelf, but there’s something off about the whole show. Simply put, it doesn’t feel like a movie, but it also doesn’t feel like a TV show. Maybe it’s a frame-rate issue, but much of the show, especially the interiors, have the look and feel of a stage play, which is that much more of a problem considering the dialogue isn’t all that sharp. The opening episode, which runs a refreshingly brisk 39 minutes, concerns our title character being tasked with snatching a very expensive and very top-secret bounty. Yes, the big spoiler is arguably, by default, the identity of that target, because nothing else in the show qualifies as exceptionally surprising or eventful.</p>
      <p>The first ten minutes lumber along, thanks to a grating performance by Horatio Sanz as a captured target attempting to chatter his way to mercy. Things improve once the main plot kicks into gear, with our masked protagonist (Pedro Pascal) meeting up first with Greef Carga (Carl Weathers) who gives him the mysterious bounty courtesy of “The Client” (Werner Herzog, easily a highlight as he approaches Christopher Walken levels of self-satire) and sets him on his way. Much of the pilot is less about a singular story or even table-setting (an acceptable purpose for first episode) than it is a mere waiting game as we wait to discover who or what the Mandalorian is hunting, and frankly things only kick into gear in the final ten minutes.</p>

      <p>It’s in that final stretch where we get a genuinely interesting action sequence along with an interesting supporting character (a robot voiced by Taika Waititi) as we get a shoot-out that feels like a mix of <i>Star Wars </i>and a conventional backlot western. It’s also more conventional, in terms of construction and storytelling, than a similar shoot-out in the first act of <i>Rogue One</i>, which only serves to remind you that, production value and aspirations aside, this is <i>Star Wars </i>on TV as opposed to <i>Star Wars </i>on the big screen. We do get some past-tense exposition for our title character and I liked Nick Nolte’s brief cameo, but the entire first episode is mostly set-up for the big reveal. And the reveal isn’t very big.</p>
      <p>You can debate to what extent it should “matter” that this first episode of the first big live-action <i>Star Wars </i>TV show of the Disney+ era is, at best, just okay. Later episodes may be better, but Filoni’s <i>Clone Wars </i>and <i>Rebels </i>got off to much stronger starts (not counting the theatrical <i>Clone Wars </i>movie), and the rest of the Disney+ original TV shows (<i>High School Musical: The Musical The Series</i>, <i>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</i>, <i>Encore</i>, etc.) are also various degrees of “Eh, fine, I guess.” That Disney is releasing new episodes on a weekly basis means that folks like myself will be more likely to sample the next couple of shows in the hopes that things improve. But that Disney didn’t send any episodes to press is a little worrying.</p>
      <p>The biggest problem, at least in this episode, is how oddly stagey it looks and feels. I can’t put my finger on it, but it feels less like a cinematic TV show (or even a conventional TV show) and more like a dress rehearsal of a very expensive play. I can’t speak to the frame rate or the presentation (yes, I turn off those settings on my televisions), but the entire show has a level of artifice that is distracts from the onscreen pleasures. Yes, there are interesting <i>Star Wars </i>nuggets, some fun creatures and a few promising story threads. But, thus far, it is a conventional and awkwardly staged space western that is coasting on the <i>Star Wars </i>brand name. The force is not yet strong with <i>The Mandalorian</i>.</p>
      <p>Considering the ungodly number of existing movies and TV shows available on Disney+ as of this morning, the quality of their originals is arguably a lesser concern. Yes, you can watch essentially almost any Disney TV show or movie you can think of (not counting <i>Song of the South</i>, natch) right now, along with the aforementioned new stuff and two new movies (<i>Noelle </i>and <i>Lady and the Tramp</i>) which I plan to watch later today. My son is psyched because, at long last, he can check out that 2003 <i>Lilo and Stich </i>series. My 12-year-old couldn’t care less, but I might try getting her into <i>Gargoyles</i>. As for my four-year-old, we can finish watching <i>Meet the Robinsons</i>, which he will enjoy (under penalty of death).</p>
      <p><b>Note - </b>Since this article as a whole isn’t very flattering to Disney, I should note that I looked up <i>Dumbo </i>and, despite earlier statements/fears, the 1941 animated feature has not been edited. It merely notes, as you can see, the film may contain “outdated cultural depictions.” This is exactly what Disney should be doing in these circumstances, so kudos on that note.</p>
