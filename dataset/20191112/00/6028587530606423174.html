      <p>Windows or Mac? It’s a tale as old as, well, not “time”—but old enough that it”s been part of the warp and woof of technological culture for many people’s entire lives. Now that rivalry has spread to the Pro tablet computing arena. Both Apple and Microsoft have tablets that are meant to replace your laptop. But do both achieve that goal? Let’s take a closer look. </p>

      <p>The Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is a tablet computer that rivals the iPad for portability and ease of use. It’s also, well, a tablet computer, instead of a tablet that does some computing. What’s the difference? I’ll get into that in a second. First, let’s talk about the device itself. The Surface Pro 7 utilizes the same form factor as last year’s Pro 6, but with a USB-C connector. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. The integrated kickstand and solid case make it a surprisingly versatile device that you can plop down and use almost anywhere. Add a Surface Type Cover (which you’ll want to do) and that functionality increases exponentially. The Microsoft Surface Pen, with its rubber eraser and interchangeable tips, is a welcome addition as well, even if using it can feel a little floaty sometimes in comparison to the Apple Pencil. It’s when you pick it up and use the Surface Pro 7 that you'll notice the difference between Microsoft’s tablet and Apple’s.</p>
      <p>While Microsoft has improved their instant-on tech over the past year, it’s still not quite as snappy as the iPad. It’s also true that though Windows 10 is the best operating system Microsoft has put out in years, it can be frustrating at times trying to do desktop things on a tablet computer. And as far as lap-ability goes, I find the “type cover in front, kickstand in the back” configuration to be less stable than the iPad’s wraparound keyboard folio. Still, if you’re a Windows user through and through, then Surface Pro 7 is the best table that Windows has to offer. It’s compatible with all your Microsoft services and software and will let you take the party on the road in an even more portable form factor than a laptop. Prices start at $749 without a cover or pen, but most will want to start with the mid-tier model with its 256 GB of RAM at $1,199.</p>

      <p>The iPad Pro was recently refreshed with larger screen sizes than the previous generation Pro. The 11" is the sweet spot for most, but if you need a truly gargantuan iPad, there’s also a 12.9" model. Both have an edge-to-edge screen design, and there’s no Touch ID, instead using the Face ID of the latest iPhones. It’s quite capable as well, able to unlock your Pro—even if you wake it up when it’s on its side—much faster than anything Windows 10 has been able to achieve so far (though they are getting closer). Whereas other iPads top out at 256GB or less of storage, you can get up to 1TB on the Pro. The iPad Pro supports my favorite mobile keyboard, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2019/09/08/the-best-tablet-keyboards-of-2019">Smart Keyboard Folio</a>.</p>
      <p>The iPad Pro also uses the “feels like it should be a dumb plastic stick but it’s a pressure sensitive stylus” Gen 2 Apple Pencil. The camera is the best you can get in an iPad—able to shoot 4k video and capture 12mp images. The front-facing camera supports Portrait Mode and Portrait Lighting as well. The audio is excellent, with four speakers to other iPads’ two.</p>
      <p>In this contest, the iPad does cost $50 more than a similarly equipped Surface Pro 7, but once you add a stylus and keyboard cover, they top out at similar prices. The Pro is an amazing tool if you’re an artist and need the latest digital stylus or you need the most versatile productivity device in Apple’s stable. Personally, I pack mine whenever I go anywhere. Even if I’m not planning on working, I know with the iPad Pro in my bag I can quickly dispatch anything that arises. And at home, once you upgrade toiPadOS 13 and macOS Catalina, you can use your iPad as a second screen to your iMac or Macbook using the Sidecar feature. It’s pretty impressive and a great way to bring Apple Pencil input to macOS. </p>

      <h3>The Verdict</h3>
      <p>This is going to come down to OS preference. If you feel more comfortable with Windows, then the Surface Pro 7 is a great tablet. But then, I’m a Mac guy, so the iPad Pro makes more sense to me as a laptop replacement. Its operating system is made for mobile, and it feels like there are fewer compromises in the form factor. Plus, its integration into Apple’s desktop computing ecosystem is extremely well done. </p>
      <p>And if I’m voting with my wallet, the Apple iPad Pro 11" is my device.</p>
