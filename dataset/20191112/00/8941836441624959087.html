        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Nikki Haley</a>, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in her book, “With All Due Respect,” that then-Secretary of State <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Rex Tillerson</a> and then-White House Chief of Staff <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-kelly/">John Kelly</a> asked her in a meeting to help them oppose some of President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s policies and in so doing, “save the country.”</p>
      <p>And now <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> has issued a denial.</p>
      <p>But it’s a sort of, kind of dubious denial. </p>
      <p>This is what <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> wrote, according to The Washington Post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rex-tillerson-denies-he-tried-to-undermine-trump-says-nikki-haley-was-rarely-present-at-meetings/2019/11/11/70de3520-04d4-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">excerpting</a> an advance copy of her book: “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-kelly/">Kelly</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren’t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country. … It was their decisions, not the president’s, that were in the best interests of America, they said. The president didn’t know what he was doing.”</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2019/11/11/rex-tillerson-said-he-resisted-trumps-decisions-or-else-people-would-die-nikki-haley-claims/">went</a> on with this: “To undermine a president is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> reportedly keyed in the president in on these conversations with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-kelly/">Kelly</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a>, and gave him a heads-up of the disloyalty. But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> denies the chat ever took place.</p>
      <p>“At no time did I, nor to my direct knowledge did anyone else serving along with me, take any actions to undermine the president,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/469994-tillerson-denies-haleys-claims-of-taking-actions-to-undermine-trump">said</a> in widely reported remarks. “Once the president made a decision, we at the State Department undertook our best efforts to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rex-tillerson-denies-he-tried-to-undermine-trump-says-nikki-haley-was-rarely-present-at-meetings/2019/11/11/70de3520-04d4-11ea-ac12-3325d49eacaa_story.html">implement</a> that decision. Ambassador <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> was rarely a participant in my many meetings.”</p>
      <p>But here’s the thing: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> didn’t directly accuse <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-kelly/">Kelly</a> of taking action to undermine <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>. She only accused that they confided in her of resisting the president’s policies.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> never actually denied having this conversation with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a>. He only said that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> rarely participated in his meetings. But then again, it would only take one meeting, wouldn’t it?</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>It would only take one small, slight, short, brief meeting for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a> to tell <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a> what she said he told her.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rex-w-tillerson/">Tillerson</a>’s denial of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nikki-haley/">Haley</a>’s claims is not exactly rock tight.</p>
