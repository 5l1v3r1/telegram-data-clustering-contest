      <p>“I think that my father would be so surprised,” mused Jodi Serling, daughter of Rod Serling, the creative genius behind the enduringly popular and wildly influential The Twilight Zone. This year sees the show celebrate its 60th anniversary.“Back in 1975, he did an interview about <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, about his legacy, and he was asked how he wanted to be remembered 100 years from now. My father’s humble answer was, ‘I don’t care if they’re not able to quote a single line that I’ve written, but just that they knew that I was a writer.’ If he only knew about this legacy living on, he would be shocked and also very honored.”</p>
      <p>To celebrate the milestone, six specially selected episodes of the show are going to be screened in select theaters for one night only, Thursday, November 16, 2019. They’ll be accompanied by a brand-new documentary short about Rod Serling himself.</p>
      <p>“My dad just had this extraordinary ability to transform his ideas and his belief into extraordinary and beautifully written stories, and his work is still pertinent today,” explained Serling. “He covered issues that extend over our generations, including racism and bigotry. I know that he felt that TV was important and could be an art form and had a responsibility not only to entertain but to illuminate social injustice. My dad believed that the role of the writer was to manage the public conscience. So, he did. He used radio, television, and film as vehicles of social criticism. What he wrote about is just still pertinent today, and it’s never going to die for as long as those issues continue to exist.”</p>
      <p><i>The Twilight Zone</i>’s influence went well beyond its TV origins and became a pop culture phenomenon, including the iconic theme tune. The show has had two revivals, most recently led by Jordan Peele. It also spawned a 1983 movie (which grossed $29.5 million against at $10 million budget), games, comic books, and theme park rides as well as merchandise from lunchboxes to pinball machines and beyond.</p>
      <p>However, Rod Serling’s success was driven by something other than money. </p>
      <p>“He wrote for a lot of reasons, a lot of it was very cathartic for him. He felt that he needed to send a message, and I think it was purely something that was inside him that needed to come out like that,” his daughter explained. Rod Serling was a decorated U.S. military veteran father who had a Purple Heart, a World War II Victory Medal, and Philippine Liberation Medal, among others.</p>
      <p>“When he was over in the war, it was very difficult for him. When he came home from the post-traumatic stress and what he had to deal with over in the Philippines, he came home broken. I mean, there was no question. He had to start a whole new life, and he used writing as a form of therapy. It was beneficial. I don’t think it was a money thing. He was just a gentle, kind man who just wanted to educate the public and hopefully make a change in the world. Anything else, financially, was seen as a bonus.”</p>
      <p>Another example of Serling refusing to let money be his motivator was the way he wrote real-world issues into <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, something that was frowned up for fear of it affecting the show’s saleability. She revealed: “He realized to get the point, or a controversial message, across that you had to do it a certain way. He did feel that it was criminal for writers not to be permitted to address the social evils that exist. The networks and the sponsors did not interfere with <i>The Twilight Zone</i> because they didn’t realize what my father was trying to convey.” </p>
      <p>“Because of this hostile environment that my father was confronted with, he saw the advantages of using science fiction and fantasy to convey his messages. The advertisers would routinely approve if they took place in a fictional world. That’s where he was able to use aliens and so on to get the point across. The networks weren’t sure or weren’t aware of what he was doing.”</p>

      <p>And that quest to make a difference, and to push for progress and change, is something that he practiced as much as he preached.</p>
      <p>“He definitely kept us sheltered from the Hollywood life. He used to say to me that he used to put his pants on one leg at a time like any other father. He was very humble; there was no element of conceit with him at all,” she confirmed. “He had this like childlike quality to him, and he used to say that he needed to hold on to these beautiful, innocent qualities, that everyone is gifted as a child. He believed that if we don’t carry these qualities with us as adults, then we become old. That’s what kept him young in mind and spirit as well.”</p>
      <p>She added: “He was always helping people. He loved the younger generation, and he felt that they would be the voice of the future. That’s why he went into teaching. I also remember my dad drew the line at helping deadbeats or lazy underachievers. He didn’t like those who thought that the world owed them a living, the kind of people who kept on taking because it was easier than facing the world where they’d be exposed for the incompetents they were. My father had solid values and a commitment to the basic values and honesty and simple sincerity.”  </p>
      <p>The screening of the six episodes is not only a chance for fans to enjoy the classic show in a new way, but it also marks a special moment for his daughter too.</p>
      <p>“Like most people, I’ve only ever seen <i>The Twilight Zone</i> on regular TV. I’ve seen some of his other work, some of his movies, on the big screen but never this. To have <i>The Twilight Zone</i> up there is going to be incredible for people to see for both those people who grew up with it and the younger generation who are just discovering it. My father was probably one of the most creative and uncompromising writers that have ever been around, and there was something cinematic about his work for television. It is thoughtful and powerful stuff.”</p>
