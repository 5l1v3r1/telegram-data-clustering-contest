      <p><b>Topline:</b> A Boston federal court <a href="http://news.trust.org//item/20191112201540-swfh2/">ruled Tuesday</a> that U.S. federal agents can’t conduct “suspicionless” searches of international travelers’ smartphones and laptops at the border and other ports of entry, a decision hailed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as a “major victory for privacy rights.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In a 48-page <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/alasaad-v-mcaleenan-opinion-summary-judgment">decision</a>, U.S. district judge Denise Casper ruled that border officials need justifiable reasons to search a person’s electronic devices, which should be balanced against the privacy interests of travelers.</li>
        <li>According to Reuters, Casper’s ruling is a higher standard than current U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies.</li>
        <li>Casper also ruled that the CBP and ICE policies violate the Fourth Amendment, which provides people protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.</li>
        <li>Agents, however, are still not required to obtain search warrants to examine phones and laptops with reasonable suspicion. </li>
        <li>The ACLU was representing the case’s 11 plaintiffs; lawyer Esha Bhandari said the decision “significantly advances Fourth Amendment protections for the millions of international travelers who enter the United States every year.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big number: </b>33,000. That’s the number of searches conducted by CBP in 2018, a fourfold increase over the 8,500 searched in 2015, according to the ACLU. </p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: The group of travelers⁠—which included a NASA engineer, a military veteran, two journalists and a software engineer⁠—filed the lawsuit in 2017 against CBP. Ten of the travelers are U.S. citizens, and one is a lawful resident. They claimed their devices were taken and their personal data searched without cause. According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/02/719337356/aclu-border-agents-violate-constitution-when-they-search-electronic-devices">NPR</a>, the federal government has previously claimed the searches are necessary to protect the U.S. </p>
      <p><b>Surprising fact:</b> CBP policy allowed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/05/02/719337356/aclu-border-agents-violate-constitution-when-they-search-electronic-devices">two kinds</a> of searches: basic and advanced. Basic searches had officers manually looking through devices. But advanced searches let officers connect travelers’ electronics to external machines to review or copy their data.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote: </b>“The CBP and ICE policies for ‘basic’ and ‘advanced’ searches, as presently defined, violate the Fourth Amendment to the extent that the policies do not require reasonable suspicion that the devices contain contraband for both such classes of non-cursory searches and/or seizure of electronic devices; and that the non-cursory searches and/or seizures of Plaintiffs’ electronic devices, without such reasonable suspicion, violated the Fourth Amendment,” Casper wrote in her <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/alasaad-v-mcaleenan-opinion-summary-judgment">ruling</a>.</p>
