      <p>Nokia is expected to launch the Nokia 8.2 at the Mobile World Conference 2020. While several reports in the past claimed to reveal the specifications of Nokia 8.2, a recent report states that Nokia 8.2 will come in a single 5G variant only.</p>
      <p>Past rumours suggested that HMD Global will launch the Nokia 8.2 with 4G and 5G support. A new report by <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/only-one-version-of-value-flagship-nokia-8-2-in-works-with-5g-support-coming-at-mwc-2020/">NokiaPowerUser</a> hints the company has dropped the idea of launching a 4G variant and instead will launch a 5G-compatible Nokia 8.2 only.</p>
      <p>The report also reveals some other specifications of Nokia 8.2. As rumoured previously, the <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/nokia-8-2-could-launch-at-the-mwc-2020-with-5g-and-64mp-quad-camera-setup-4534241.html">Nokia 8.2 will have an all-screen design</a> and a pop-up front camera.

      <p>On the back, Nokia 8.2 will have a quad-camera setup. The camera module will be circular in shape like the OnePlus 7T (<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/oneplus-7t-review-the-oneplus-smartphone-of-the-year-4547611.html">Review</a>).  Nokia 8.2’s primary camera will have a 64 MP sensor and would use pixel binning. Night Mode will also get an improvement and is said to be better than the Nokia 7.2. </p>
