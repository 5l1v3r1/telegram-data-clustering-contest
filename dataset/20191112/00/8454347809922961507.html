      <p>We’re heading into the final stretch of 2019, and while the year may be lagging behind 2018 at the overall box office it has certainly provided its fair share of mega hits and rocked the all-time box office. This year, <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>officially became the number 1 movie of all time, globally, when Disney and Marvel Studios re-released the film with a tiny amount of fan-baiting new footage (it was a gamble that paid off, as it was looking like the movie might not be able to catch previous number 1, <i>Avatar</i>,<i> </i>despite a record-shattering opening weekend box office). Meanwhile, the Mouse House’s live-action remake of <i>The Lion King </i>– or “computer-animated remake,” depending on which side of the argument you’re sitting on – entered the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time, and it’s <i>still going</i>.</p>
      <p>Simba’s kingly box office performance means that Disney now occupies six of the 10 top box office rankings worldwide. Meanwhile, this year Sony released its highest-grossing film to date, <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i>, which entered the top 25, and <i>Toy Story 4 </i>and <i>Captain Marvel </i>gave Disney even more reason to celebrate as they entered the top 50. And the year’s not over, yet: <i>Jumanji: The Next Level </i>and <i>Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker</i><i> </i>all have their sights set on joining this list of all-time box office winners.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the year’s biggest box office surprise – and maybe even its biggest box office story? The phenomenal success of Warner Bros.’ R-rated <i>Joker</i>, the standalone DC film starring Joaquin Phoenix that just last weekend entered the top 50 list at number 44. It shows no signs of slowing down, and could jump up several spots before it finishes its theatrical run.</p>
      <p>For the list below, we’ve included global box office performance, as well as domestic, and release date. We included dollars earned in re-releases, and in each of our descriptions, we look at where the film stood record-wise at the time of its run, and dive into things like critical and audience reception. <b>We’ll be here to track the progress of new blockbusters and regularly update this list of top box office performers.

        <b><b>Domestic: $858.4 million (including re-releases)<br/></b><b>Release date: April 26, 2019<br/></b>The journey that began in 2008 with <i>Iron Man </i>was coming to an end – at least for some of the characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Audiences that had been holding their breath for an entire year after perhaps the biggest cliffhanger since <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/empire_strikes_back">Empire Strikes Back</a> </i>could not wait to buy their tickets – and did they ever <i>buy those tickets </i>when they finally could. Opening weekend for <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>in April 2019 surpassed <i>Infinity War</i>’s year-long record by nearly $100 million. In just eight days, the film had grossed a half-billion domestically. On day 10 it was over $621 million. One by one the records fell, leading many to ignore the words “if” and “can” and focus instead on “when” <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/avatar"><i>Avatar</i></a>’s previous record ($2.787 billion) as the highest-grossing movie would fall. But <i>Endgame </i>began to show signs early in its run that its impressive sprinting start might not be enough for it to ultimately come out ahead of James Cameron’s epic; it only had the second-biggest second weekend ever and the fourth-best third weekend. In the era of the modern blockbuster, even a record-breaker can be front-loaded and only spend three weeks atop the charts. It really all came down to a final dash near the finish line. After just six weeks of release, <i>Endgame</i> was about $73 million away from dethroning <i>Avatar – </i>substantial ground to make up. But then Marvel and Disney re-released the film on June 28 with new goodies over its end credits. And then, over the weekend of July 19, 2019 – its 13th week of release – when another Disney release would begin its run for the top 10 all-time earners (hello, <i>Lion King</i>), <i>Endgame</i> squeaked ahead. It may not have been able to catch <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens"><i>The Force Awakens</i></a> for the all-time domestic leader, but by the time summer was over, it would pull in front of <i>Avatar</i> and become the king of the world (sorry, James).</b>

        <b><b>Domestic: $760.5 million (including re-releases)<br/></b><b>Release date: December 18, 2009<br/></b>The world had to wait some 12 years for James Cameron to follow up the biggest film of all-time with what would become <i>the new biggest film of all time</i>. Nobody believed he was going to surpass <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/titanic"><i>Titanic</i></a>’s numbers with this tale of an alien planet and the paraplegic Marine who teams up with its inhabitants in the battle for Unobtanium. But he did. At the peak of a 3-D reemergence, aided by the filmmaker’s usual technological gamesmanship (and higher ticket prices), <i>Avatar</i>‘s<i> </i>seven straight weekends at number 1 led to over $595 million at the North American box office. Then, two days later on Feb. 2, 2010, its 47th day of release, the movie became the highest domestic earner ever. <i>Avatar</i> held that record for five years and eleven months and went on to become the only film ever to earn $2 billion outside of the U.S. and Canada, making it the world’s highest grosser at the time. It held onto its impressive global record for nearly 10 years. Until <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</b>

In 1997, Cameron blew out the budget again and this time there was worry he may have gone too far. Though delayed from July until December, <i>Titanic</i> nevertheless became a global phenomenon the likes of which the box office had never seen at the time. After 15 straight weeks at number 1, 14 Oscar nominations and 11 statuettes, <i>Titanic</i>, its stars and its song were ingrained in the hearts and tear ducts of the world, and the movie would hold the all-time box office record for 12 years – until Cameron would eclipse himself once again with <i>Avatar</i>.</b>

        <b><b>Domestic: $936.7 million<br/></b><b>Release date: December 18, 2015<br/></b>Twelve years after the completion of the <i>Star Wars </i>prequel trilogy, J.J. Abrams was tasked with making <i>Episode VII – </i>a monumental undertaking, and a risky one. Were people still interested after the prequels? Were they burnt out? The approach was to mix the old and the new, and it worked. Abrams gave a brand-new cast of characters the chance to interact with the original trio of Luke, Han, and Leia, and generations of fans were so ready for the adventure that they gave the film the highest opening weekend in history ($247.9 million). In just under three weeks, <i>The Force Awakens</i> became the all-time domestic champion, passing <i>Avatar</i> and joining the $2 billion club within 54 days. It still remains the highest-grossing domestic release of all time.</b>

The film bested <i>The Force Awakens</i>’ three-day opening weekend record with $257.6 million, and hit the $2 billion mark in 48 days. Domestically, it would ultimately come up just short of <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_panther_2018">Black Panther</a></i>, which was released two months prior.</b>

That made sense given that the 1994 original, at the time, was one of the studio’s most successful films in the middle of its rebirth, and director Jon Favreau’s CGI-fueled version traced it for a new generation. The result is the highest-grossing domestic release to receive a Rotten score on the Tomatometer, at 53%. But its $191 million opening was the eighth highest of all time and it became the 14th film to pass a half-billion domestically and just the ninth film to rack up $1 billion overseas.</b>

The culmination of the journey that began in 2001 also ushered in a new trend of splitting final chapters in halves. The back half of the <i>Potter </i>finale set the new record for an opening weekend at the time with $169.1 million, and its $960 million international haul ranked only behind <i>Avatar</i> and <i>Titanic</i>.

Its $116.1 million start was the sixth-largest movie opening ever at the time and the second-highest for Disney behind the second <i>Pirates</i> film. It was Burton’s seventh collaboration with Johnny Depp and the director has not had a film gross as much domestically in total as <i>Alice</i> made in its first three days since – not even with his attempt to replicate the success with <i>Dumbo</i> in 2019, which grossed a total of $114.7 million. But back in 2010, only <i>Avatar</i>, <i>Titanic</i>, and <i>The Return of the King</i> had made more money outside of North America than <i>Alice</i> did.</b>

A planned two-parter turned into a full-blown trilogy and critics were feeling the bloat: While Jackson’s<i> Lord of the Rings</i> films all scored over 90% on the Tomatometer, the <i>Hobbit</i> films never rose above 74%, with the first film right in the middle with 64%. Audiences were not tired just yet, though, even if this was the last of the Middle-earth series to hit $300 million domestic and $1 billion worldwide. On the glass-half-full side, Jackson’s first four Tolkien films grossed a combined $3.938 billion globally.</b>

It was the central piece of what is considered one of the greatest comic-book films ever made. The movie’s $158 million opening weekend broke the previous record-holder, <i><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman_3">Spider-Man 3</a></i>, by more than $7 million, and <i>Dark Knight </i>held the record for nearly three years to the day until the final <i>Harry Potter</i> chapter was released.

        <b><b>Domestic: $313.513 million<br/></b><b>Release date: October 3, 2019<br/></b>The director of <i>The Hangover</i> films wanted to make an origin story out of Batman’s most infamous nemesis. The project was met with skepticism, and then it began a run on the festival circuit. Venice awarded the film its top prize in the Golden Lion; some critics were hailing it a masterpiece. Though its Tomatometer score is among the lower in the Top 50 (69%), Todd Phillips’ <i>Joker</i> had the highest-opening ever in the month of October (passing the previous years’ <i>Venom</i>) and ultimately became the highest-grossing film ever released in that month in North America, surpassing Alfonso Cuaron’s <i>Gravity</i> domestically. The film ranks as not only the 9th-highest–grossing film in Warner Bros.’ history – as of November 10, 2019 and it could soon become the studio’s 6th – but also earns a place as one of its most profitable films of all time.</b>
