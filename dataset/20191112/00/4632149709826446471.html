      <h1>Good news techies: Varthur to soon get a new bridge</h1>

      <p>Varthur bridge is one of the key connecting bridges for commuters, particularly techies traveling from the Whitefield tech corridor towards Varthur, Sarjapur and other areas. However, many are scared to use this bridge as ‘tremors’ are felt on the dilapidated structure. Now, Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) is assuring the commuters that their concerns will be soon addressed as the new bridge will be thrown open shortly. <br/><br/>Rajesh K, a techie residing in Panathur area said that despite the ban, many heavy vehicles pass through the bridge and one can feel that the bridge shake. It was a risky situation as hundreds of heavy trucks and school buses pass through the bridge. Devesh R, another techie said, “This is the shortest connecting route from Varthur to Marathalli side which causes a huge traffic jam on the bridge. Additionally, one has to bear the stink from the surroundings while waiting in endless traffic. And the cherry on the cake is the vibrating bridge. If I take this bridge, I am in constant fear of it collapsing it midway.”</p>
      <p>The construction of the new bridge is almost complete. There are some land acquisition issues but we are trying to speed it up</p>
      <p>–BH Anil Kumar BBMP commissioner<br/><br/><br/>BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar has said that new alternative bridge is already under construction as the existing bridge is very old. “Once complete the existing bridge would be closed. The construction of the new bridge is almost complete. There are some land acquisition issues but we are trying to speed it up. We will request Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) to speed up the work,” the commissioner told Bangalore Mirror. <br/><br/><br/>For the last few years, the Varthur Bridge is giving jitters to commuters due to vibrations. Though the BBMP has done preliminary repair work of the bridge, the motorists are still scared to use this bridge.</p>
