      <h1>UFC heavyweight champ Stipe Miocic sends warning to Tyson Fury: ‘Be careful what you wish for’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, MTK Global released <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956119/video-tyson-fury-train-darren-till-move-mma-dana-white-attention-ufc-news-boxing">video footage</a> of heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury training MMA with UFC welterweight Darren Till, and ‘The Gypsy King’ didn’t look half bad.</p>
      <p>In fact, Fury’s pad work with ‘The Gorilla’ soon caught the attention of UFC president Dana White, who seemed more than impressed with the 31-year-old’s in-cage athleticism and work ethic.</p>

      <p>It wasn’t long before the video found its way to Stipe Miocic’s Twitter feed, and the UFC heavyweight champion had quite a different reaction than Dana White.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Tyson_Fury">“@Tyson_Fury</a> be careful what you wish for...,” Miocic posted on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Fury, who holds multiple world titles in boxing, recently made the transition to the world of professional wrestling, where he beat Braun Strowman at WWE’s Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia, earning a reported figure of £11.9 million for his performance.</p>
      <p>Miocic, 37, reclaimed the heavyweight title at UFC 241 with a fourth-round TKO of former Olympian Daniel Cormier. The two-time heavyweight champ and part-time firefighter is expected to collide with ‘DC’ in a trilogy bout next year.</p>
