        <b>Sharekhan's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/personal-care/emami/E06">Emami</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Consolidated revenue grew by ~5% y-o-y, driven by a 20% growth in international business (organic growth was 7%), while domestic business grew by 3.4%; domestic volumes stood flat. Gross margins improved by 111 BPS due to benign raw material costs; higher other expenses dragged down the OPM 58 bps to 29.2%. Domestic business grew in single-digits for the fifth consecutive quarter; the management expects growth in H2FY2020 to be at 10-12% in backdrop of good winter season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We broadly maintain our earnings estimates for FY2020/21; maintain our Hold rating on the stock with an unchanged PT of Rs. 352.</p>
