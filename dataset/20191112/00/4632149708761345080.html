One is Nati Binodini, which revolves around the life of the famous South Asian actress, Binodini Dasi (1862–1941), who born to prostitution, started her career as a courtesan and eventually joined Calcutta’s National Theatre. As the play moves forward introducing several acquaintances of Binodini, it slowly takes a steep turn and brings into light the sacrifice, pain, betrayal, and misfortune of the famous actress, and how the mentally-devastated artist left the stage at the age of 25. <br/><br/>While this will be staged on Thursday, Sesh Shringo will go up on Friday. It revolves around Chitrabhanu, a famous poet. Search of his long-lost painter friend, who went missing 40 years ago during the Naxalbari revolution, urges the poet to constantly leave his home. Mahua, the poet’s wife, being the silent witness of his behaviour in all these years, becomes worried because of the poet’s deteriorating health. <br/><br/>WHERE: Ranga Shankara, JP Nagar, 2nd Phase <br/>WHEN: 7.30pm, November 14-15 ENTRY: `200, bookmyshow.com <br/><br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></p>
