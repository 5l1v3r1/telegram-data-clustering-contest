      <p>Amol Palekar will be returning to the stage after two-and-a-half decades with a Hindi play Kusur (The Mistake). The thrilling crime drama has been written and codirected by Sandhya Gokhale along with Palekar, who will also be seen as the protagonist. <br/><br/>“The fast pace story whirls us through the twists and turns disturbing our complacency and overturning our assumptions. The deep subtext will linger in our minds beyond the curtain drop,” said the actor-director, who essays the part of ACP Dandavate in the play. <br/><br/>Amol, who turns 75 on November 24, when the play premieres in Mumbai, added, “As an actor, the role poses an enormous challenge, demanding tremendous emotional and physical energy at my age.” <br/><br/><br/>Sandhya, who has written the play, said, “It may be called a social thriller that can happen in any of our lives.” <br/><br/>Adapted from the Danish film “Den Skyldige”, Gokhale’s narrative illuminates the multi-cultural complexities of a contemporary life in a modern Indian city like Mumbai. <br/><br/><br/><b><i>► Disclaimer: This article has been produced as a part of a promotional feature</i></b></p>
