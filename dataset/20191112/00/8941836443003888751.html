      <p>SEATTLE (AP) - Seattle Children’s hospital officials have confirmed that a surgical patient at Seattle Children’s hospital contracted an infection from a fungus found in three operating rooms.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-seattle-times/">Seattle Times</a> reports officials announced the patient’s infection Tuesday and said the hospital is monitoring a second patient who might also have been infected.</p>
      <p>Tests at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/seattle-childrens-hospital/">Seattle Children</a>’s found the recent Aspergillus mold in three of the 14 operating rooms and two procedural areas at the hospital’s Seattle campus during routine tests Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>Closure this week of the contaminated rooms comes about four months after all the hospital’s operating rooms were reopened after problems with Aspergillus.</p>
      <p>Testing for Aspergillus in the operating rooms and affiliated areas has been happening at least once a week since the operating rooms reopened.</p>

      <p>Three other patients were sickened by the fungus earlier this year, following three patients who were infected in 2018. One of those patients died in the spring.</p>
