      <p>Integration of fashion and fitness has encouraged even those who’ve never set foot in a thread mill to get into more active lifestyles. Since <i>athleisure </i>influence over sartorial sensibilities, individuals have become more open to the idea of mixing up a designer coat with a pair of leggings or trainers. While some still argue that workout gear is never to be considered proper attire, the fact stands that garments once worn exclusively for exercise have now evolved to also suit other daily activities. Today, we see men and women going to brunch on a lazy Sunday morning in coordinating tanks and compression leggings. A cropped hoodie and joggers drenched with inspired prints or done in hushed color ways are now just as stylish an option as a shift dress on a day for doing errands in the city. There is benefit to be had with fashion’s new found love for celebrating active lifestyles. Not only has it brought the most unexpected characters to the fitness studios (myself included) it has also encouraged many of us to embrace health and wellness as part of a life in style.</p>
      <p>As the year comes to a close and more resolutions for the new year ahead are drafted, I’ve shortlisted essentials inspired by the active lifestyle that will inspire many of us to keep living our best lives.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dplusk.com.au/"><b>D+K</b></a> (pronounced as D plus K) wears like second skin. The Australian-made active wear label utilizes Lycra, organic bamboo and other recycled materials in the creation of tank tops, leggings and shirts. Fabrics are soft and quick-drying, which help to keep the body cool and comfortable even after a killer sprint during spin class. Waist bands on leggings are snug so they stay in place especially during inversions or deep stretches. Tank tops give ample support without it feeling like your blood circulation is being cut off. The stretch technology feature of D+K garments also ensure that they stay in shape even after several uses.</p>

      <p><a href="https://norba.clothing/"><b>NORBA</b></a> creates active wear garments that make you feel good. Using Econyl nylon, items created by this Ukranian brand are intended to empower women by providing clothes the fit “both sports and daily routines.” Inclusivity and reliability are at the core of their designs. Key styles include the bike short or leotards that can suit all body types and lifestyles. Contemporary patterns and feminine color palettes reflect an ethos for uplifting the modern woman, her lifestyle and the many roles she takes on. Make sure to browse through the label’s chic collection of leotards that can take you from day to night; from gym to gin.</p>

      <p><a href="https://alalastyle.com/"><b>ALALA</b></a><b> </b>offers clothing that get you through 18-hour days. It takes inspiration from the “sophisticated downtown attitude” of New York City and celebrates the countless facets of modern living. Pieces from this label are designed such that wear it for an early workout, pair with other pieces for a high-low daytime ensemble and glam up at night just in time for cocktails and dinner. Alala’s current collection, Superbodies, celebrates inclusivity and body love. It reinforces that fact that “every woman has a super body no matter her age, shape or size.” Styles from this collection are available from XS to 3X. You will also love Alala’s metallic infused collection which makes a strong argument for disco dancing in the gym.</p>

      <p><a href="https://cariuma.com/"><b>CARIUMA</b></a> has ended the search for a truly sustainable, ultra comfortable sneaker. Just recently, the Brazilian sneaker company introduced the “first ever, one-of-a-kind, comfortable as hell, sustainable Bamboo knit and Sugar Cane EVA shoe” called IBI. This carbon neutral design innovation delivered on the promise of sustainability, style, comfort—and more.</p>

      <p>The sneaker, made entirely with plant based materials, recycles 100% of the water used to produce them. Use of bamboo means that there is absolutely zero waste in the production of these sneakers. The Cariuma team adds, “No brand has successfully turned bamboo into a high performance show fabrication—until now. With bamboo being a material known for its light weight, flexibility and resistance, this proprietary blend composed of a high percentage of bamboo and a percentage of recycled plastic from water bottles, creates an all-day-hug-your-feet, form-fitting upper out of this sustainable plant.”</p>

      <p>Special knit and construction of the IBI Sneaker reduces pressure point that up the comfort levels. Sugarcane EVA used for soles ensure that the shoe is 30-40% lighter. “We have pioneered a unique cup sole construction that touts perfect shock absorption and is far more durable due to our proprietary stitching method. Our knit features a generous amount of flex so your sneakers move with you.” You’ll have to try on a pair to feel the difference.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tavinoir.com/"><b>TAVI NOIR</b></a> proposes a stylish alternative to your typical Barre, Yoga or Pilates grip socks. Certified organic cotton ensures that your footwear is comfortable, durable and eco friendly. Design features of the Tavi sock include arc compression for added support as well as fitted heel for stability and balance. Fun and feminine designs make Tavi Noir the ideal accessory to your favorite workout. I especially love their over the knee grip socks which give the illusion of long and lean legs. Their sports sock line is also great especially for running, spinning and other high intensity workouts.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-studios/clp"><b>RAYBAN STUDIOS X HONEY DIJON</b></a><b> </b>marries fashion, music and sport with its limited collection of eyewear inspired by the legendary DJ Honey Dijon’s body of work. Three styles from the special line pay tribute to Dijon’s uncanny ability to “clash genres and eras with integrity and style.” The Olympian aviator pulls from the sensibilities of the 60s with its gradient lenses and white frames. Meanwhile, the Square 1973 brings forth strong 70s disco glamour. Going all out with glamor and gold is a 24k plated wraparound pair called Wings II. A pair from this collection immediately adds street style quotient to any athleisure look.</p>
