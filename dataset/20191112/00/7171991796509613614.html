      <h1>Azobenzene Stores Solar Energy</h1>

      <p>Probably the most efficient way to convert solar energy into electricity is the old fashioned way, heating water into steam and turning a turbine. This remains a messy affair though and you don’t really want a steam boiler on your roof, so solar cells are popular. However, there’s some new research showing how <a href="https://research.chalmers.se/publication/511209/file/511209_Fulltext.pdf">a molecule can absorb solar energy, store it, and then release the heat on demand years later</a>. This could offer new ways to collect and even transport solar power. This new molecule, derived from azobenzene, holds immense promise to change the way we work with solar power.</p>
      <p>The idea behind the system is that a parent molecule is isomerized by solar irradiation. The resulting photoisomer is stable for a long period. Adding a catalyst or heat will cause the photoisomer to revert back to the parent molecule, releasing energy in the process.</p>
      <p>We will admit, we aren’t chemists so some of the paper was a bit over our heads. But the basic idea is appealing, and this sounds like a field where a garage chemist might be able to contribute. Perhaps one day the desert will be producing photoisomers in the same way it currently produces petroleum.</p>
      <p>We always thought the future of fuel might be <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/10/04/this-biofuel-cell-harvests-energy-from-your-sweat/">biofuels</a>, but maybe it will be solar, instead. Maybe the future solar car won’t <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/10/using-super-efficient-solar-cells-to-keep-your-electric-cars-battery-topped-up/">look like this</a>, after all.</p>
