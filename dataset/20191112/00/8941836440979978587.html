      <p>“Tracking Game: A <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/timber-creek/">Timber Creek</a> K-9 Mystery,” Crooked Lane Books, by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/margaret-mizushima/">Margaret Mizushima</a></p>
      <p>An explosion turns a fun evening into a rescue and mystery in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/margaret-mizushima/">Margaret Mizushima</a>’s latest novel, “Tracking Game.”</p>
      <p>Deputy <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mattie-cobb/">Mattie Cobb</a> is spending the evening at the town of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/timber-creek/">Timber Creek</a>’s community event with the local vet, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-walker/">Cole Walker</a>. When they hear the boom and see the flames, they rush to discover a burning van and the body of Nate Fletcher. She soon discovers that he didn’t die in the fire but was shot twice in the heart. With her K-9 partner, Robo, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mattie-cobb/">Cobb</a> and her companion start to investigate.</p>
      <p>The small town and isolated mentality of the region play heavily into the story line. The motive and culprit at first appear to be obvious, but soon prove to be wrong. From that point, the narrative turns from a mystery into a secret world of poaching and hidden secrets. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mattie-cobb/">Cobb</a> has trust issues due to her turbulent past, so it’s difficult for her to deal with the case while juggling her growing feelings for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cole-walker/">Walker</a>. Thankfully Robo is there for emotional support, and his keen set of skills might just save the day.</p>

Everyone will want to follow these three every step of the way.</p>
