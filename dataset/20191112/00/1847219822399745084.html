        <b>Results of pre-trial investigations of the Internal Security Bureau (IDB) do not inspire improvement for the situation to improve within interior affairs services, which remain riddled with crimes of various categories, the bureau admits.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Information compiled by IDB shows that over the four years the bureau has existed a total of 557 criminal processes have been investigated. This year’s increase is 15%. So far 41 people have been tried.</p>
      <p>IDB Chief Valters Mūrnieks says the increase of the number of criminal processes is associated with multiple factors and one of the most significant of them is insufficient internal control mechanism within institutions.</p>
      <p>Mūrnieks has stressed many times that assessment of internal risks is one of the most effective measures for prevention of criminal acts – by identifying internal risks and adopting necessary measures, it becomes possible to either reduce the risk or completely prevent the possibility of officials or employees of the company committing crimes.</p>
      <p>«Unfortunately, institutions do not pay enough attention as risk appetite is enormous in different institutions. IDB has multiple cases in the works and multiple criminal processes for illegalities that could have been avoided had there been preventive measures,» said the chief of IDB.</p>
      <h3>For example, the number of criminal processes regarding disclosure of sensitive information has tripled in the nine months of 2019. The number of bribery cases for road traffic police remains unchanged. The same applies to abuse of official power and forgery of official posts.</h3>
      <p>These illegalities can be limited using an efficient internal control mechanism, says Mūrnieks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the criminal processes imply interior affairs institutions have done nothing to organize procurements, which leads to wasting of state resources, IDB notes.</p>

      <p>An anti-record was achieved in October, because 15 people, including nine interior affairs sector’s employees, were detained. Persons were detained for crimes involving property and corruption. Currently IDB’s pre-trial investigation results do not suggest the situation has improved in the interior affairs sector.</p>
      <p>Mūrnieks says every year the number of complaints submitted to IDB increases. The bureau explains this with increasing recognition of the institution and society’s desire to have violations reviewed by an objectively independent institution.</p>
