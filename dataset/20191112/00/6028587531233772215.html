      <p>Optimism is an essential ingredient of leadership. Just ask Bill Gates. If you haven’t read <i>Factfulness</i>, don’t bother applying to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. “It’s pretty fundamental” that aspiring leaders read the book, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/01/bill-gates-reading-these-books-is-pretty-fundamental-for-new-hires.html">according to Gates</a>. <i>Factfulness</i>—by Gates’s late friend and statistician Hans Rosling—covers ten reasons why the world is much better than people think. “It’s better to be born today than ever, and it will be better to be born twenty years from now than today,” <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612924/bill-gates-explains-why-we-should-all-be-optimists/">Gates says.</a> “It does bother me that most people aren’t optimistic.”  </p>
      <p>Gates is an unshakable optimist because he sees the big picture, a mindset he shares with his friend, Warren Buffett. Buffett’s optimism is a fundamental reason for his success. Buffett became a rich man by buying stocks for the long run when most investors panicked in the short term.</p>
      <p>Optimism is a recurring theme in many of this year’s books written by successful entrepreneurs and business leaders. “To be a successful investor, you’ve got to be an optimist,” says billionaire Charles Schwab in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invested-Changing-Forever-Americans-Invest/dp/1984822543/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XBYWU3KJQN88&amp;keywords=invested+charles+schwab&amp;qid=1573535811&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Invested%2Cstripbooks%2C255&amp;sr=1-1"><i>Invested</i></a>.  “You've got to know the future will be better than the past. I believed it when I started Schwab against so many odds, and I still believe it today.”</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ride-Lifetime-Lessons-Learned-Company/dp/0399592091/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HTS01HR14OAR&amp;keywords=ride+of+a+lifetime+bob+iger&amp;qid=1573535846&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=Ride+of+a+%2Cstripbooks%2C215&amp;sr=1-1"><i>The Ride of a Lifetime</i></a>, Disney CEO, Bob Iger, writes that optimism is one of the most important qualities of a good leader. Iger defines optimism as a “pragmatic enthusiasm for what can be achieved.” An optimistic leader does not yield to pessimism, says Iger. “Simply put, people are not motivated or energized by pessimists.”</p>
      <p>Gates, Buffett, Schwab and Iger have a combined 300 years of life and business experience. Surviving professional setbacks and living through politicial and global upheaval gives leaders a broader perspective about politicial or economic events. These leaders keep their heads when everyone else is losing theirs because they’ve seen the story play out many, many times. </p>
      <p>Great leaders are also students of history, which gives them the fuel to pursue innovation. “A lot of times people are quite negative about the present. But really, if you're a student of history, when else would you rather be alive? Now is the best time,” Elon Musk said recently. “Those who think the past is better have not read enough history.”</p>
      <p>Younger, aspiring leaders don’t have to wait until they turn into elder statespeople to gain perspective. In recent years, a growing category of books written by ‘New Optimists’ of scholars, thinkers and leaders combine history, economics and science to broaden our perspective of world events.</p>
      <p>Here is a short list of books that will get you started. Bill Gates has already read most of them. </p>
      <h3>1. Factfulness by Hans Rosling</h3>
      <p>This is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814">the book</a> that Gates says is ‘pretty fundamental.’ In 2018, he offered a free digital download to anyone who graduated from college. Rosling puts data into context that’s easy to understand. For example, he writes that two hundred years ago, almost everyone on Earth faced disease, malnutrition, starvation, and early death. Life expectancy was about 30 years everywhere in the world. Today it’s 72. </p>
      <p>One of the most remarkable statistics that Rosling offers is about global poverty. About fifty years ago, half the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, about 9 percent of the world’s population lives in extreme poverty. It’s still a big number, but the progress is unlike anything the world has ever seen. </p>
      <h3>2. Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker</h3>
      <p>When I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2018/03/18/great-business-leaders-are-unshakeable-optimists-a-conversation-with-harvards-steven-pinker/#707fc213dc8d">sat down</a> with Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, one of Bill Gates’s favorite authors, we talked about the negativity bias. Simply put, we don’t focus on the good because our brains are drawn to the bad. Pessimism served our cave-dwelling ancestors well because they had to detect threats around every corner. Today, focusing on the negative news that bombards us daily gives us a distorted view of the world. </p>
      <p>“The world has made spectacular progress in every single measure of human well-being and…almost no one knows about it,” says Pinker. </p>
      <h3>3. Bourgeois Equality by Deirdre McCloskey</h3>
      <p>McCloskey is a professor of economics, history, english and communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. <i>Bourgeois Equality </i>is a big book—nearly 800 pages. But McCloskey has a lot of ground to cover—and a lot of evidence to present. </p>
      <p>McCloskey calls the progress humans have made from 1800 to today “The Great Enrichment.” For most of human history, the majority of people didn’t have freedom to choose their livelihooods, access to plentiful food, medicine, education or a living wage. All of that changed when the free exchange of goods, services and ideas began to spead. McCloskey cites the astonishing fact that the average standard of living has risen by 10,000% in the past two hundred years. </p>
      <p>After reading McCloskey’s book, I found it hard to complain about minor inconveniences like long lines at the grocery store or plane delays. Instead, I look at every day as a gift and an opportunity to create an even better world. </p>
      <h3>4. The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley</h3>
      <p><i>The Rational Optimist </i>was the first of the progress books that inspired me to read the others. It, too, was based on Gates’s recommendation. Here’s how Gates <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704243904575630761699028330">wrote about it</a> for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. </p>
      <p>“As Mr. Ridley shows, there have been constant predictions of a bleak future throughout human history, but they haven't come true. Our lives have improved dramatically—in terms of lifespan, nutrition, literacy, wealth and other measures. Too often this overwhelming success has been ignored in favor of dire predictions…Mr. Ridley deserves credit for confronting this pessimistic outlook.”</p>
      <h3>5. It’s Better Than It Looks by Gregg Easterbrook</h3>
      <p>Easterbrook is a <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author who has written for <i>The Atlantic </i>for nearly 40 years. In his new book he covers the “reasons for optimisim in the age of fear.” </p>
      <p>Easterbrook’s book explains why Americans <i>feel </i>worse off today even though they’re better off—statistically—than ever before. According to Easterbrook, a generation ago our parents and grandparents got bad news once a day in the form of the morning paper or perhaps the nightly news on one of three networks. Today, the 24-hour news cycle and social media at our fingertips brings a never-ending cascade of bad news which, according to psychologists, passes through our mental filters more easily than good news. </p>
      <p>“Every day we’re bludgeoned by news of how bad everything is…yet, we’ve made more progress over the last 100 years than in the first 100,000,” writes Easterbrook. “We are witnessing the greatest improvement in global living standards ever to take place. </p>
      <p>Great leaders, by definition, stand apart. They enter a room and lift the spirits of those around them. To do so, they must protect themselves against the pessimism that infects so many others. Remember, optimists do not deny the very real problems we face today. Instead, they choose to be inspired by the spirit of human achievement. </p>
