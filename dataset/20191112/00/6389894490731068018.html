      <h1>Revolut investor Balderton Capital unveils $400m seventh fund</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:01:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Nicolle</a></address>
      <p>One of London’s biggest venture capital players has today debuted its seventh early-stage fund for European startups at $400m (£311.1m), after a mooted lack of investor interest as the UK prepared for Brexit failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>Balderton Capital, an early backer in the likes of Revolut, Citymapper and Lovefilm, said the new fund will continue to focus on its series A niche following “unprecendented momentum” in the European tech scene.</p>
      <p>“I think the idea that like a day after an exit, suddenly the UK will fall off a cliff with regard to sort of entrepreneurial technology companies is clearly just not true,” Balderton partner Suranga Chandratillake told <i>City A.M.</i></p>
      <p>He added Balderton had yet to see any investor or company significantly change their behaviour as a result of the upcoming exit.</p>

      <p>“The UK is a great place for entrepreneurial investment. Europe is part of that recipe, but it is only one of the ingredients.”</p>
      <p>Approximately a third of the fund will be put towards investing in UK companies, while the rest will be spread out across Europe.</p>
      <p>It comes as 2019 has already broken records for foreign investment in British startups, surpassing the entirety of 2018’s intake in August. The UK is also expected to reach an all-time high for total venture investment by the end of the year.</p>

      <p>Chandratillake said Balderton will focus on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing in its seventh fund, as well as more “mainstream” sectors like fintech and consumer brands.</p>
      <p>The firm has plans to increase its internal staff by about 10 per cent by the end of 2020, and will also funnel more investment into its entrepreneur platform Build.</p>
      <p>However Chandratillake warned the government must work to uphold the UK’s reputation as a “cosmopolitan, open, liberal society” if it wishes to avoid a post-Brexit drain on talent.</p>
      <p>“All indications are positive, so I don’t have any real concern, but I think you have to keep an eye on it,” he added.</p>
