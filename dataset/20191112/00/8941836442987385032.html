      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) - Fairbanks has been well represented in pageants this year as the newly crowned Miss Alaska USA 2020 and Miss Alaska Teen USA 2020 both hail from the city, officials said.</p>
      <p>Hannah Carlile accepted the Miss Alaska USA crown and Jadyn Fraser was awarded the Miss Alaska Teen USA crown Nov. 2, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported Monday.</p>
      <p>The pageant in Anchorage was a preliminary event to the Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants, officials said.</p>
      <p>Carlile is a graduate student at Vanderbilt University pursuing a master’s degree in international education policy and management. She serves as an education research consultant in partnership with Columbia Law School’s Center for Public Research and Leadership.</p>

      <p>Fraser is a graduate of West Valley High School who hopes to advocate for people with depression, anxiety and other diseases. The 18-year-old suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that causes the body’s immune system to attack joints and can lead to painful swelling.</p>
      <p>“I live with the consequences of my body, and with that I’ve had to learn to be confidently beautiful even when I can’t be comfortably beautiful,” Fraser wrote on social media.</p>
      <p>Neither winner could be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>The Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants began in 1954 in Long Beach, California. Miss Teen USA debuted in 1983 in Lakeland, Florida, officials said.</p>
