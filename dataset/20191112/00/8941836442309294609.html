      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - An Alabama judge has denied bond to a suspect in the disappearance of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris’ missing stepdaughter.</p>
      <p>Court records filed Tuesday show that Lee County District Judge Russell K. Bush denied bond to 29-year-old Ibraheem Yazeed, who’s charged with first-degree kidnapping.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Aniah Blanchard was reported missing on Oct. 24. She was last seen at a convenience store and has yet to be found.</p>
      <p>According to charging documents, police in Auburn, Alabama, said the passenger area of Blanchard’s car had blood evidence showing someone had suffered “a life-threatening injury.” A state forensics lab determined the blood was Blanchard’s.</p>
