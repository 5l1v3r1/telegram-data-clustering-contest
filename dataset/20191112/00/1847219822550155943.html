        <b>Healthcare Ministry has come forth with a proposal to increase wages of local residents by 20% and wages of all other healthcare workers by 10%.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ministry proposes dividing funding for wages based on four basic principles. This includes increasing wages for resident doctors by 20% and 10% for all other healthcare workers. This also includes the condition under which allocated funding is provided as efficiently as possible to help increase the lowest wages.</p>
      <p>When signing contracts for provision of state-funded services, National Health Service (NVD) will be able to allocate funding in accordance with contract conditions to help increase wages, but no more than three average wages in the national economy.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the goal is securing increase of wages for medical personnel in daycare centres, the ministry adds.</p>
      <p>On top of that, to ensure generation switch in healthcare and balance development of the profession in the long run and motivate students to stay in Latvia, it is planned to increase wages for residents by 20%, allocating EUR 4.04 million for this, explains the ministry.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Increase of the lowest wages by 10% would require EUR 48.2 million. This means the lowest wages will increase for doctors who perform state-funded healthcare services, the ministry reports.</p>
      <p>10% increase is also planned for medical staff of institutions under Healthcare Ministry and ambulance brigades, allocating EUR 6.26 million for this. EUR 1.6 million has been outlined to increase wages for other people employed in the healthcare sector.</p>
      <p>Generally this means that, for example, the lowest monthly wages of certified doctors may increase by EUR 108 (from EUR 1 0179 in 2019 to EUR 1 187 in 2020) and the lowest wages of certified nurses and assistants would increase by EUR 71 (from EUR 714 to EUR 785).</p>
      <p>The ministry reminds that in 2020 it is planned to increase doctors’ wages for the first consecutive time. Funding of EUR 60.1 million has been allocated for this.</p>
