        <b>Anand Rathi</b>
      </p>
      <p>HDFC Bank reported net interest income growth of 22.9 percent in its Q1-FY20, driven by asset growth and a core net interest margin of 4.3 percent. Provisions stayed a tad higher at, up 38.3 percent QoQ. Earnings growth continues to stay healthy at 21 percent YoY .</p>
      <p>Total advances at the end of Q1-FY20 came increase of 17.1 percent over Q1-FY19. Domestic advances grew by 17.9 percent over Q1-FY19 comprising of domestic retail loans which grew by 16.5 percent and domestic wholesale loans which grew by 19.6 percent. The domestic loan mix between retail and wholesale was 54:46. Overseas advances constituted 3 percent of total advances.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Total deposits at the end of Q1-FY20 came an increase of 18.5 percent over Q1-FY19. CASA deposits grew at 12.8 percent, resulting in CASA deposits comprising 39.7 percent of total deposits as at the end of Q1-FY20.</p>
      <p>Provisions came in higher largely due to higher provisions for agri book &amp; increased rate of provisions on unsecured book. The bank has also made contingent provisions of Rs 1650 million and Rs 860 million towards NBFC/HFCs, respectively. Overall asset quality marginally deteriorated with GNPA ratio at 1.4 percent, up 4 bps QoQ.</p>
      <p>The bank stated it has been trying to push for deposit mobilization and hence, has been steadily increasing deposits to support loan book growth. Adjusting for the cash management-related inflows which are outside of the deposit accounts and the long-term institutional funding, credit-deposit ratio comes down to 75 percent.</p>
      <p>Considering the strong positioning, healthy balance sheet growth and superior asset quality&amp; management, we believe the bank is well poised to deliver consistently with margin leadership &amp; robust return ratios.</p>
      <p>We continue to remain positive on the company over medium to longer term perspective and maintain our buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1410 per share.</p>
