      <p>The folks at ZeniMax Online have done a good job of bringing much of Tamriel to life for players in <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i>. Considering how few zones were available back at launch, by comparison, there is ton of ground to cover across the various provinces now. From the sandy hills of <i>Elsweyr </i>and lush jungles of <i>Murkmire </i>all the way to the dense, rolling fields of <i>Summerset </i>and ashen mountains of <i>Morrowind</i>, it’s one of the most diverse MMO worlds out there.But the universe of <i>The Elder Scrolls </i>is far more than just the mainline single-player games and this MMORPG. In fact, there are still regions in and around Tamriel we have never seen – not to mention areas of Nirn, the world Tamriel exists on, outside of the immediately surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>I’ve picked the following five regions / lineages / general themes for potential future expansion chapters and listed them <b>alphabetically</b> below:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Akavir</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unless you’re a pretty deep Elder Scrolls fan there’s a good chance you’re not too familiar with the Akaviri outside of maybe a few thematically inspired pieces of armor here and there, as shown above. So as a real throwback, Akavir is a continent to the east of Tamriel separated by an ocean that sits as the kingdom of the beasts.</p>
      <p>It’s a region that’s rich with history and has the rare potential to be almost entirely foreign to most Elder Scrolls players. The serpent-people of Tsaesci are known to feast on humanoid races and it strong connections to dragon lore, which is a great gateway to connecting the end of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjagneaux/2019/10/21/elder-scrolls-online-final-dlc-for-2019-dragonhold-now-out-for-pcmac/#61943b124a52"><i>Dragonhold</i> DLC </a>to keep things flowing narratively. They’re actually the ones responsible for founding the organization that became the Blades and they’ve helped establish many customs and traditions across Tamriel.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ancient Dwemer (Dwarves)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dwemer are an integral part of Tamriel lore and their artifacts, creations, inventions, and machinations are still found roaming crypts and ruins across the continent. However, players have only had very limited contact with actual Dwemer themselves seeing as how they mostly vanished following the <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Red_Mountain">Battle of Red Mountain in the First Era.</a></p>
      <p>With all that was left behind though, very little is actually known about their origins. A DLC storyline that uses time travel, portals, or some other mechanic to allow players a window the past and some input into how and why they disappear could be a fascinating and delicious bit of content for <i>ESO</i> players.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Mer Origins</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did you know that in addition to the Altmer (High Elves), Dunmer (Dark Elves), Bosmer (Wood Elves), Orsimer (Orcs), Dwemer (Dwarves), and Maormer (Sea Elves), there are actually several other Mer cited throughout history in Tamriel? Such as the Aldmer, or the First Ones, the original ancestral Elven race that even forked off and led to the establishment of the Nords, Redguards, and others as well.</p>
      <p>If you ever played <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> then you’re definitely familiar with the Ayleid, which were known as the Wild Elves and settled areas across northern Cyrodiil. Their ruins are mythical and full fof haunting magic. There’s even the Chimer, related to the Aldmer, and worshiped Daedric princes directly.</p>
      <p>Point being: Tamriel lore is deep, far-reaching, and generally speaking extremely under-represented in the actual <i>Elder Scrolls </i>games themselves. There are thousands of years of rich content that is barely ever touched upon explicitly and the origins of many fan-favorite races would be a great topic.</p>

        <b>New Oblivion Crisis</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’ll die on a hill screaming that <i>Oblivion</i> is a better game than <i>Skyrim</i>, no matter what you or any sales numbers tell me, and a big part of that is the dual-world mechanic offered with the introduction of the Planes of Oblivion. Essentially, it’s the <i>Elder Scrolls</i> version of Hell. There are various different Planes, just like circles of Hell, and each has different Princes that rule in different ways. The Daedric are often some of the most challenging enemies in any <i>Elder Scrolls</i> game, and <i>ESO </i>is no different.</p>
      <p><i>ESO </i>already visits the Planes of Oblivion a bit in the original main quest line, but a chapter that mostly takes place across planes of Oblivion, or has portals opening up all over the continent instead of just in a new zone (such as dragons only attacking in <i>Elsweyr</i>) could be a refreshingly intense shake up to the formula.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Pyandonea</b>
      </p>
      <p>Personally, my number one pick would be a sea-faring adventure to the island of <a href="https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Pyandonea"><b>Pyandonea</b></a>, which sits a bit south west of <i>Summerset</i>. If you played the Summerset chapter then you likely remember coming across Sea Elves, also known as the Maormer. They look a lot like Altmer (High Elves) but feature skin that’s awfully pale blue or white in tint. I would love to see this race offered as a playable option for the first time in any <i>Elder Scrolls</i> game.</p>
      <p>ZeniMax Online could even pull from some of the Mer origins and Atmora lore to further flesh out something like this that would make it feel fresh and unique without retreading Summerset themes and content. <i>Morrowind</i>, <i>Summerset</i>, and now most recently <i>Elsweyr </i>have all been quite different regions geographically, but almost all of <i>Elder Scrolls Online</i> feels extremely landlocked. A diversion to Pyandonea would be an excellent antidote.</p>
