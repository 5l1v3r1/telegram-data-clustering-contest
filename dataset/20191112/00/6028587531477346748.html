      <p>The holidays are quickly arriving. Chances are, your shopping list includes gifts for golfers. While it may be an expensive sport to play, you certainly don’t need to break the bank buying a gift. Consider some of these:</p>

      <p>It’s extremely difficult to surprise someone else with the proper clubs for their game. Sure, you can get them off-the-rack models, but odds are good that they won’t be properly fitted to your golfer’s swing. Instead, a clubfitting session may be ideal. National fitting chain <a href="https://clubchampiongolf.securetree.com/?_ga=2.101279745.1005417676.1573500981-1105120187.1573500981"><b>Club Champion offers gift cards</b></a> ($100 and up) to help your golfer find the exact clubs and specifications for his or her unique swing. Nothing may be as valuable to a golfer as the gift of better scores.</p>

      <p>Every golfer can use fresh golf balls, for sure.

      <p>So you don’t know the first thing about golf but still want to buy a golf gift? Here’s your answer. <a href="https://www.meiomi.com/"><b>Meiomi’s Pinot Noir</b></a><b> </b>($25/bottle) is the Official Wine of the PGA Tour and PGA Tour Champions. It’s ideal for wine-loving golfers. Made on the California coast, it boasts the velvety and smooth flavors of strawberry, jammy fruits, mocha and vanilla — along with toasty oak notes. It pairs well with tomato-based pasta dishes, thin-crust pizza, grilled lamb or turkey. Plus, it sports a simple screw top.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The problem with golf travel bags is that they’re generally too large to store — whether you’re on the road or at home. Until now. <a href="https://www.sunmountain.com/kube-travel-cover-detail"><b>Sun Mountain’s new Kube golf travel bag</b></a> ($230) looks like a hard-shell plastic suitcase. But unbuckle it, and the bag spreads opens into a full-sized golf travel bag with plenty of room for a full set of clubs. Weighing only 6.8 pounds, it’s made of durable, ballistic style, reinforced fabric and features plastic half-shells with dense foam padding through the top of the bag to protect clubs. It’s available in eight colors.</p>

      <p>Lightweight and comfortable, <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/635923"><b>Garmin’s Approach S40 GPS golf watch</b></a> ($300) displays exact yardages to the front, center and back of the green in real time — updating with each step. And it’s pre-loaded with 41,000 course maps, immediately recognizing the course and hole it’s on. A bevel around the watch display has slots numbered one through 18 — for each hole on the course. It lights up a bright orange marker to indicate the current hole. Plus, it performs smartwatch functions.</p>
