      <h1>Broadway’s <i>Tootsie</i> Will Close in January</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:30:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jackson McHenry</a></address>
      <p>The stage adaptation <i>Tootsie</i> may have made it through this summer’s big <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/king-kong-and-the-cher-show-are-closing-on-broadway.html">culling of Broadway musicals</a>, but it will only barely last out the year. The producers behind the movie-to-musical adaptation, which stars <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/santino-fontana-tootsie-broadway-encounter.html">Santino Fontana</a>, announced today that <i>Tootsie</i> will play its last performances at the Marquis Theatre on January 5, 2020. The production was nominated for 11 Tony Awards earlier this year, but won <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/2019-tony-awards-winners-complete-list.html">only two</a> — for Fontana’s lead performance as Michael Dorsey, an out-of-work actor who takes on the persona of Dorothy Michaels to get work (the role Dustin Hoffman played in the movie), and for Robert Horn’s book. <i>Tootsie</i> will still live on (a.k.a. try to make up the money lost on Broadway) in a national tour that’ll launch at Shea’s Buffalo Theater in Buffalo, New York, in October 2020, and in “several international productions,” according to producers. For anyone who’s still longing to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/theater-review-can-tootsie-work-when-its-not-1982.html">watch a movie about cross-dressing with questionable gender politics get reformatted for Broadway</a>, good news: A <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-mrs-doubtfire-musical-cast-broadway-2020.html"><i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i> </a>musical is coming this spring!</p>
