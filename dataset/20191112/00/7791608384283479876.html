      <p><b>Banksy’s elusive works</b> have been highly sought-after, and breaking record sales are not something new to the anonymous street artist. Last month, Banksy’s <i><a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406621/Banksy-s-Devolved-Parliament-Fetches-Record-Breaking-12-Million-In-Auction/">Devolved Parliament</a></i> painting racked up almost US$12 million when it went under the hammer at an auction in London. <br/><b>Another record-breaking</b> sale price for the hooded artist work might not come off as a surprise, but it is now in the books. The album cover Banksy designed for Norwegian electronic duo Röyksopp is now named as the highest-priced sale over on massive online music database Discogs. <br/><b>The vinyl, which</b> depicted the duo’s name in the artist’s iconic stenciled font along with roughly spray-painted graphics resembling tree tops, was sold off for US$10,256. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The highlight, though,</b> was not the design but the fact that this was one of the rare 100 pieces hand-painted by the artist himself back in 2002. <br/><b>Banksy also launched</b> his latest merchandise line, <a href="https://grossdomesticproduct.com/info.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Gross Domestic Product</a>, with <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406834/Banksy-Opens-Online-Store-But-You-Have-To-Answer-One-Question-To-Buy-The-Merch/">quirky rules</a> and even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ryrXJHbmy/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">quirkier products</a>.</p>
