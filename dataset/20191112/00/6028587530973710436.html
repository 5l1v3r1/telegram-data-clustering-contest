      <p><i>This is the first of a series of articles I’ll do leading up to Thanksgiving and during the holidays about the benefits of infusing kindness, gratitude, and presence into your work experience. </i><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlynborysenko"><i>Follow along</i></a><i>. </i>A few years back, researchers from the Hong Kong Institute of Education <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25222798">conducted a rather simple experiment</a>. They recruited 100 healthcare professionals (made up of physicians, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) and split them into three groups to explore the possible benefits of gratitude on the employee experience.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Gratitude: </b>The first group was instructed to keep a journal of work-related events in which they expressed gratitude or thanks for something they appreciated about their day, such as a colleague swapping schedules with them or helping them out in a way that made their job easier. This was the group with the “gratitude” condition.</li>
        <li><b>Hassle: </b>The second group was instructed to keep a similar journal with one crucial distinction: Instead of focusing on things they were grateful for, this group was instructed to write about the things that hassled them at work, such as having an exhausting day or being annoyed at a comment a patient’s relative made to them. This group was assigned the “hassle” condition.</li>
        <li><b>Control: </b>The third group was the control group, and did not participate in keeping a journal to create a baseline by which to judge the other two interventions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The experiment lasted just one month, with both the gratitude group and the hassle group writing an experience in their journal twice a week. At the end of the month, the results were clear: Those who journaled about experiences they were grateful for showed a significant decline in both stress and depressive symptoms, while the other two groups showed no noticeable change.</p>
      <p>In a world where stress levels of today’s employees <a href="https://www.coloniallife.com/about/newsroom/2019/march/stressed-workers-costing-employers-billions">cost organizations billions of dollars</a> and the World Health Organization has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/karlynborysenko/2019/05/29/burnout-is-now-an-officially-diagnosable-condition-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-it/#49929ce82b99">classified burnout as an officially diagnosable medical condition</a>, simple gratitude may provide a solution to some of today’s most pressing challenges.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why Gratitude Works</b>
      </p>
      <p>Practicing gratitude is the mindful act of focusing your energy and attention on the things that enhance your experience, rather than on the things that detract from it. Most human beings will default to focusing their energy and attention on the negative aspects of their experience at work. This is why the study presented did not see a significant difference between the “hassle” group and the control group in the experiment, essentially indicating that the control group was focusing their attention in a similar way as the hassle group organically, without being instructed to do so.</p>
      <p>This inclination is part of our survival mechanism: Your brain will pay close attention to the things it perceives as potentially dangerous so they have less chance of hurting you. In regard to not getting eaten by a lion back in the day when we were out in the field hunter/gathering, this made sense. However, in modern times, if your goal is to create a fulfilling and empowering work experience, it doesn’t work out so well because it keeps us consistently focused on the negative elements.</p>
      <p>Gratitude at work works because it redirects your attention to make the positive elements of your experience more pronounced in your conscious awareness, and allows you to be thankful for events that you may have otherwise ignored or forgotten. Positive aspects exist all around you every day but are frequently overlooked simply because we have a limited number of places we can focus our conscious attention at any given time. That means that, if you want a positive work experience, you have to make the choice to redirect your energy to all the good things you have going for you. No one can make this choice for you - not your boss, or your co-workers, or HR. You are the only person that has the power to change how you see the world in which you operate day-to-day.</p>
      <p>It may help to think of practicing gratitude as simply developing a new habit. In a few short weeks, many folks are going to create a new year’s resolution to get back to the gym and get in shape. Let’s be honest: Going back to the gym when you haven’t been in a while is a painful proposition. You can’t do the things you want to do, will struggle at first, and will probably be tending to some sore muscles until your body adapts. But if you’re consistent about it, your body will catch up. Soon you’ll be running faster on the treadmill, lifting heavier weights, and it won’t be nearly as hard as when you started.</p>
      <p>Getting back to the gym is a very tangible physical act, but the process of creating new mental habits is similar: It’s harder at first, but if you’re consistent, it gets easier. When it comes to integrating gratitude into your experience, you’re training your brain to look for things to be grateful for consistently. The more you do it, the better you’ll become. Soon, those positive elements will become a more pronounced part of your work experience and will balance out those less desirable elements. That’s not to say it will rid you of difficult colleagues, tight deadlines, or a schedule full of meetings entirely, but it will put those attributes in a greater context. And just like you build more muscle when you go to the gym regularly, practicing gratitude will only perpetuate more good things happening. The more you believe you have things to be grateful for at work, the more you will start behaving in accordance with that belief. Those behaviors, in turn, will result in more things to be grateful for!</p>

        <b>Getting Started With Gratitude</b>
      </p>
      <p>Getting started with a gratitude practice is easy and quick. All you need is a journal and a few minutes at the end of the day a few times a week to document your positive experiences (remember, the participants in the study who reduced their stress and depressive symptoms only journaled twice a week!).</p>
      <p>What do you write? <a href="https://gratefulness.org/resource/what-is-gratitude/">Robert Emmons</a>, one of the world’s leading scientific experts on gratitude, notes that there are two elements to consider. First, gratitude is the <i>affirmation of goodness</i>, or an acknowledgment of the gifts and benefits you’ve received. Secondly, gratitude is the recognition that the source of <i>those gifts is one outside of ourselves</i>. That source could be your team, your colleagues, your boss, your friends, your family, even a higher power. Especially in the office, you are not operating on an island by yourself and your success will depend on the contributions of others. It’s important to acknowledge that.</p>
      <p>Still, when facing a blank page of a journal it can be easy to make it more complicated than necessary. Resist overthinking it. Simply acknowledge positive experiences you had at work, whether they are big or small. Perhaps you had a day without back-to-back meetings so you could get more productivity time in, or a colleague who supported an idea you had in a meeting, or the receptionist had your favorite candy in the bowl on their desk, or you had the chance to learn a new skill, or you got approval for a project you’re passionate about, or you got that promotion you’d been angling for. Express gratitude for anything that made your day a little bit brighter, without restricting yourself or thinking it was too insignificant to be worthy of a mention.</p>
      <p>As you progress over time, you’ll develop your own approach. The most important thing right now is simply to get started. No excuses, no putting it off. Just start today. It won’t take long until you experience the benefits of it and then you’ll wonder what took you so long to implement such a simple strategy to enhance your own wellness.</p>
