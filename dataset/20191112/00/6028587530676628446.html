      </figure>
      <p>Every year Google releases a smartphone with two major selling points: the latest version of Android and arguably best in-class computational photography software helped by the amount of data Google has compiled, but almost every year that device has a major glaring hardware omission or flaw that is jarringly behind the times. The original Pixel, released in 2016, had a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2016/10/03/google-why-is-your-new-phone-an-iphone-clone/">large top and bottom bezel</a> at a time when phones had begun pushing screen edges toward the border. The third Pixel had a hideously large notch at a time when other Android brands were finding clever ways to reduce screen cut-out. And with this year’s Pixel 4, Google doubled down on the hardware omissions by refusing to add an ultrawide-angle camera when every other phone has one, and stuck with an alarmingly small battery on the standard Pixel 4.</p>
      <p>That’s a shame, because the Pixel 4 does many things well. Its haptic engine is the best I’ve ever experienced, which leads to the best typing experience ever; and the main camera is as strong as ever. Android 10’s gesture navigation is also a huge improvement over Android 9’s pill navigation, and the phone overall has a unique design and great build quality. But the downright terrible battery life and lack of that wide-angle camera that’s generated near-universal praise for the new iPhones make this yet another frustrating device.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hardware and Design: it’s different!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Google’s Pixel series has always marched to the beat of its own drum in terms of looks and design, but while in the past that has resulted in some unattractive devices, I like the Pixel 4’s looks.</p>
      <p>Google decided to skip the notch and other quirky alternative methods around hiding the selfie camera. It simply gave the phone a forehead bezel. It’s not too large and allows the phone to house a strong earpiece and loud speaker, along with the 8-megapixel selfie camera and a Time of Flight (ToF) sensor to pull off true 3D facial scanning for real face unlock.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The sides have this matte finish that looks like plastic but is aluminum.<cite>Ben Sin</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The back is glass as usual but the aluminum chassis has been coated in this matte finish that makes it look almost plastic. It feels great, and the square camera module improves upon similar designs by Huawei and Apple. But then of course, this module is also omitting a very useful camera lens so I’m not sure this is a fair comparison.</p>
      <p>The dual-camera system here consists of a 12-megapixel main f/1.7 lens with a focal length equivalent of 28mm. The other camera is a 12-megapixel telephoto zoom lens that shoots at an equivalent of 45mm.</p>
      <p>On the smaller/standard Pixel 4 I tested, the screen measures 5.7-inch diagonally with a resolution of 1080 X 2280. It’s a crisp OLED panel that’s entirely flat. The larger Pixel 4 XL has a 6.3-inch screen of similar quality. Both of these screens feature a 90Hz refresh rate that was first made popular by the OnePlus 7 Pro. It’s definitely superior to standard 60Hz panels, but OnePlus does a better job of letting you “feel” the higher refresh rate via animations.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The internals are quite frankly, a bit below par for a 2019 flagship device. The Pixel 4 is powered by Snapdragon 855 – not the slightly newer 855+ – and has only 6GB of RAM with storage options of either 64GB or 128GB. Releasing a phone approaching 2020 with only 64GB of internal storage and no expandable storage options feels almost user-hostile.</p>
      <p>Overall the phone lacks the eye-grabbing flourishes of other devices – there’s no razor-thin bezels; no curvy screens; no pop-up cameras or wild gradient-colored glass backs. But it’s clean and minimal in a stylish way, like Google’s overall “Material Design” philosophy. The smaller size of the Pixel 4 also makes it a great one-hand phone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Software: Stock Android 10 is much better than stock Android 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>A big selling point for the Google is that it runs a pure, “stock” version of Android, uninterrupted by extra third party software overlays (aka “Android skins”) that phone brands are keen to apply to their releases.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, stock Android was definitely preferable a few years ago, when Android skins from Samsung or Chinese brands tended to be garish and even detrimental to the Android experience. But in recent years, phone brands such as Samsung, Xiaomi and Oppo have really cleaned up their UIs, to the point that it could be argued to be superior.</p>
      <p>For example, Android 9’s gesture navigation system – aka “the pill” – was <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-androids-gesture-navigation-sucks-and-how-to-fix-it-de9393ca2172">widely</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/20/18002976/android-pie-multitasking-gestures-google-pixel">panned</a> for being difficult to use and lacking in internal logic. Xiaomi and Huawei’s UI instead offered a much more intuitive, iPhone-like gesture navigation system.</p>
      <p>Android 10, I’m happy to report, has ditched the pill navigation for a revamped navigation system that is very similar to the aforementioned Xiaomi/Huawei versions, which means it closely follows the iPhone’s system.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Android 10 has a clean, bubbly UI and an option to darken interface.<cite>Ben Sin</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While it must have pained Google engineers to mimic Apple to this degree, this system of maneuvering around the phone’s UI is highly intuitive and natural.</p>
      <p>Android 10 also finally allow users to pull down the notification shade by swiping down from anywhere on the homescreen – previous versions of stock Android forces users to swipe from the very top of the screen. This is another major improvement to stock Android that has long been available on Xiaomi’s MIUI or OnePlus’ OxygenOS, for example.</p>
      <p>I still think OnePlus’ OxygenOS is the best version of Android around – it’s basically stock Android with dozens more useful additions – but Android 10 is excellent. The best-in-class haptic engine of the Pixel 4 adds to the experience. Every swipe, every tap, I can feel the phone in ways I don’t on other devices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>General use performance: smart, smooth but baffling at times</b>
      </p>
      <p>As mentioned, the 90Hz panel is smooth – though not as smooth as the OnePlus devices – and getting around the phone was fine despite the pedestrian 6GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 unlocks via scanning my face and the experience is fast. Often I’d pick up the phone and the device would be unlocked by the time it’s at eye level. However, the Pixel 4 also unlocks even when my eyes are closed or not looking at the phone.</p>
      <p>Virtually every other phone that offers facial scanning, from the iPhone to Samsung Galaxy Note 10 to Huawei Mate 30 Pro, requires eye contact to unlock the phone. This is an extra security measure to prevent someone from unlocking your phone while you’re sleeping or not paying attention. Google omitting this is baffling. What’s the point of having a large top bezel to house a complicated facial scanning system if it lacks the most basic security feature against misuse?</p>
      <p>The phone is overall smarter than the typical Android, however. Whenever I enter a place with free WiFi, such as a coffee shop or a mall, the Pixel 4 identifies this and asks if I want to connect. Unlike Apple, whose products tend to push its smarts on you too much, the Pixel 4 only asks about the WiFi if I enter the settings page. It’s helpful without being pushy, which I can’t say about iOS.</p>
      <p>This being a Google phone, Google’s excellent digital assistant is built into the phone in intuitive manners. A swipe up from the corners triggers the assistant, as can a squeeze of the phone’s lower sides, made possible via pressure-sensitive triggers placed on the left and right chassis of the phone. Squeezing the phone, and then asking it a question is an odd usage experience at first, but it’s quickly become second nature. I will miss this when I jump back to another phone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Camera: the main one is excellent</b>
      </p>
      <p>My favorite way to describe the cameras of Huawei phones is that they have the highest ceiling of any smartphone but also a lower floor than the big names – meaning if I know what I’m doing and I shoot with the right mode, I can capture more stunning or impossible images with a Huawei P30 Pro or Mate 30 Pro than I can with any iPhone, Samsung or Google phone. But Huawei phones also get basics like exposure or human skin texture wrong regularly, resulting in shots that sometimes look brilliant, and sometimes mediocre. The iPhone camera, meanwhile, doesn’t have as high a ceiling as Huawei cameras, but they always work, producing usable shot no matter what I’m doing.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The Pixel 4 (right) and the iPhone 11 Pro Max.<cite>Ben Sin</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Google has built its camera system similar to Apple’s philosophy. The Pixel 4 is likely the most dummy-proof Android camera system, in that it’s designed for point and shoot without thinking and the result will be a usable image.</p>
      <p>The camera app, for example, is very basic compared to other Android camera apps. There’s no manual/pro mode. There’s no built-in filters, no zoom button (you zoom instead by pinching or double-tapping on the viewfinder). Google, like Apple, wants you to just open the camera app and see a shutter button. Press that button and you have a good image.</p>
      <p>New to the Pixel 4 this year is real-time HDR preview right in the viewfinder, which Google dubs WYSIWYG (”What you see is what you get”). This means whatever colors or exposure you see in the viewfinder before you shot, is how the photo will look. This, again, makes the entire photography experience feel more seamless, natural, more iPhone-like.</p>
      <p>For the most part, the Pixel 4’s images are very similar to the iPhone 11 Pro’s images, in that they find great balance even against backlight. Color accuracy is natural without overdoing contrast. The big difference is in color temperature. The Pixel 4 tends to aim for a cooler tone while Apple keeps things warmer.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This is a good thing, by the way. I am in the fortunate situation to handle every new phone and the iPhone 11 Pro has the best camera system around right now. The Pixel 4’s main camera is basically as good as the iPhone 11’s, except it excels a bit more in really low light conditions, thanks to Google’s computational low light photography mode known as “night sight”.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc7b9132c886a0007ebcc32/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Google’s night sight can do wonders.<cite>Ben Sin</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I can do more with other phone cameras. For example, as I’m testing the Pixel 4 I’m also testing Xiaomi’s 108-megapixel camera, and the latter can capture more details which afford a closer crop than the Pixel 4 or iPhone 11, but Xiaomi’s handset also blows out lights every single time I shoot at night. Huawei’s P30 Pro or Oppo’s Reno 10X, likewise, have far superior zoom capabilities, but neither phone can match the Pixel 4 or iPhone 11 in human portraits or general dynamic range.</p>
      <p>Video performance on the Pixel 4 is very good for an Android, with superb balance. But falls short of the iPhone 11 in stabilization. I think the South Korean flagship phones (LG and Samsung) have slightly more capable video performance too, but the Pixel 4’s video abilities are far better than Chinese offerings, making it a top three or four video camera phone.</p>
      <p>With selfies, the 8-megapixel sensor is a bit behind industry standards, but it almost doesn’t matter because Google’s computational photography is so good. Whether it’s software assisted bokeh effects or using “night sight” to artificially add lighting, the Pixel 4’s selfie camera is more than fine. The below image contains two selfies stitched side-by-side. The left image was taken with portrait mode, and notice the natural edge detection. The selfie on the right was captured with “night sight” and it fixed what was a very yellow scene for more natural skin tones.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ultimately, the lack of an ultrawide camera is too big an omission for me to forgive. I shoot a lot of landscape photos of buildings and scenery, and having a wider field-of-vision is something I’ve long enjoyed, going <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2017/05/25/the-lg-g6s-wide-angle-lens-is-the-best-travel-camera/">all the way back to LG phones.</a></p>
      <p>Now that the iPhone has added the ultrawide lens and made it “mainstream,” other reviewers also demand the lens, and the <a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/10/17/rant-google-has-no-good-excuse-for-the-pixel-4s-missing-ultrawide-camera/">widespread negative reaction</a> from the tech writing community over the Pixel 4’s camera omission says it all. The main Pixel 4 camera is great. Arguably best on the market by a hair. But I, and most reviewers, will take a main camera that’s marginally inferior for the extra versatility.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Battery life: dreadful</b>
      </p>
      <p>Almost as baffling as the camera omission is Google’s decision to put only a 2,800 mAh battery. The larger XL device has a 3,700 mAh which is much better, but still less than what everyone else is offering.</p>
      <p>On the smaller Pixel 4, I would start my day with 100% battery life at 10:30am, and by 8pm the phone would be down to under that scary sub-25% mark. Even taking into account that I’m a heavy user, this is unacceptable in 2019.</p>
      <p>A phone that struggles to last a 9am to 9pm all-day usage cycle was acceptable a few years ago, when Apple and Samsung dictated market trends and prioritized thinness over everything. But Chinese brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi have changed the game. They showed consumers it’s possible for a phone to simply go all day without ever needing to be topped up. For what it’s worth, the larger Pixel 4 XL, from what I’ve heard from peers, can go all day but just barely.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conclusion: Google’s in no position to act like Apple</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am an Android guy. Even though the Apple Watch is significantly better than any Android alternative and the iPhone’s video cameras are so good I use it to shoot a lot of my video content, I still always default back to using an Android as my main phone because Apple’s restrictions on UI customization frustrate me.</p>
      <p>What I’m trying to say is that I want to love a Google phone. But the Pixel 4, like previous Pixels, just makes too many baffling hardware decisions for me to love it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc827b92c886a0007ebcded/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>The Pixel 4 has great build quality and a strong camera system but it omits one too many crucial ... [+] features.<cite>Ben Sin</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s not that Pixel’s product planners don’t understand the appeal of an ultrawide-angle camera or larger battery or bezel-less design. They are just stubborn in pushing their vision. Google Research’s Marc Levoy confirmed as such when <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/editors-desk-googles-wrong-about-ultrawide-cameras">he explained</a> that a telephoto lens is more important and useful than an ultrawide-angle camera.</p>
      <p>This type of attitude, ironically, reminds me of Apple. These tech giants believe in a vision – Apple on software; Google on hardware – and they want all users to follow it. As much as iOS’s lack of customization annoy me, so too does the Pixel team’s insistence that they don’t need to keep up with hardware trends.</p>
      <p>Apple can get away with this “our way or the highway” attitude because the iPhone and iOS are unique. There is no alternative to that specific Apple experience. Google, ironically, licenses its Android software to everyone, including aggressive, forward-thinking, less stubborn tech companies in Seoul and Shenzhen.</p>
      <p>There are people to whom the Pixel 4 still holds great appeal: those who value standard mobile photography above all else, and those who want the purest Android experience with the most up-to-date software.</p>
      <p>That’s a niche group, however. For everyone else, the Pixel 4 is a bit too expensive considering its missing some crucial flagship hardware parts.</p>
