      <p>Whether you’re a carnivore, vegetarian or craving some authentic Chinese, these upscale San Francisco restaurants have you covered with new tasting menus meant to excite and surprise diners.<a href="https://alexanderssteakhouse.com/sanfrancisco/">Alexander’s Steakhouse</a> is offering a one-of-a-kind A5 Hitachi Waygu beef tasting menu that utilizes all parts of a Hitachi cow that has been delivered straight from Japan specifically for this dining experience.</p>
      <p>Up next is <a href="https://chinalivesf.com/fine-dining-in-san-francisco/">Eight Tables</a> which is offering a menu that highlights traditional Chinese cuisine (with a twist), in addition to the country’s depth of culinary expertise, with each course.</p>
      <p>Lastly, <a href="https://one65sf.com/">O’ by Claude Le Tohic</a> is presenting a vegetarian menu that proves that you don’t need meat to have an over-the-top, elegant meal. Not to mention, this vegetable-focused menu is one that also takes in to account the environment impacts of meat consumption.</p>
      <p>We chatted with each of the restaurants’ head chefs on what’s unique about their tasting menus and why now is the best time to expand your palette with their thoughtful cuisine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexander’s Steakhouse</b>
      </p>
      <p>This classic American steakhouse is one of the few restaurants in the country that is both certified and licensed to to serve Authentic Kobe beef by the Kobe Beef Association in Japan. Most recently, it became the exclusive provider in the U.S. for authentic Japanese Hitachi wagyu beef.</p>

      <p>“American steakhouses focus on the primal cuts, such as the ribeye or filet,” said executive chef Eric Upper. “Not only is it unsustainable, but it’s limiting, both for the chef and the diner. I’m looking forward to introducing our guests to an array of delicious beef cuts and parts, inspired by international cuisines and local ingredients that will be presented throughout the menu. Each dish is highlighted and named for the part of the cow that is being used.”</p>

      <p>The Hitachi Wagyu tasting menu features eight different dishes with highlights such as the “shin” with cappellacci, bourbon butter and dry age stock; “the filet” with a selection of tasting salts; and “brisket” with grilled onigiri, leeks and double fermented soy. Each dish showcases a specfic part of the cow in exceptionally creative ways. It’s even presented in dessert form.</p>
      <p>To get a taste of this rare Japanese meat, only available at Alexander’s Steakhouse, set up a reservation for a special six-course <a href="https://www.exploretock.com/alexanderssanfran">Hitachi Whole Cow Dinner</a> on Nov. 12, 2019.</p>
      <p>“The idea behind the Hitachi menu was truly to be a progressive steakhouse with us as the experts of wagyu. I wanted to get a whole A5 Hitachi cow from Japan to learn how every cut of the cow looks, reacts and how to utilize all of it to be more sustainable, but to still give people a true steakhouse experience interpreted through my eyes featuring wagyu in every course. I’m very proud of the whole cow hitachi menu. Right now I just finished curing some pancetta and bresaola. That is what I’m most excited about at the moment.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eight Tables</b>
      </p>
      <p>Situated in China Live, the Chinese food and retail emporium in Chinatown, Eight Tables presents shifan tsui food, or “private chateau cuisine,” which is a type of luxe residential dining in China. The menu is eight courses and there are only eight tables up for reservation each night. Dishes include four seas caviar dumpling featuring Russian osetra caviar, trout roe, scallop and sea urchin; Sichuan black cod with fermented rice porridge; and barbecue ‘shao kao’ with Peking duck and Iberico char siu.</p>

      <p>“At Eight Tables we want to present elegant Chinese cuisine in a different light, bringing the glory of a classic cuisine to the present with modern interpretations from a San Francisco perspective,” said George Chen, creator, founder, and executive chef of Eight Tables. “Crafted in a world-class show kitchen, the menu will push Chinese culinary boundaries and serve as an ongoing wellspring of novel approaches to a grand cuisine.”</p>

      <p>“The tasting menu at Eight Table has never been done before, not just here in the U.S., but seldom seen in Greater China, and it’s about time! We’re showing the greatness of a cuisine through China’s rich culinary heritage through a tasting menu that features history and technique.”</p>

        <b>O’ by Claude Le Tohic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Located at the top floor of ONE65, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chelseadavis/2019/05/14/meet-the-chef-behind-one65-san-franciscos-new-six-floor-french-culinary-destination/">San Francisco’s unique culinary destination</a> that offers four distinct French-inspired dining experiences under one roof, <i>O’ by Claude Le Tohic </i>is a fine dining restaurant that features modern French cuisine.

      <p>“With the plant-based menu available at O’ by Claude Le Tohic, I wanted to show that vegetables are not only decorative accents or a garnish, but can be the stars of the plate, showing that simplicity can also be sophisticated and tasty. We have guests who are not vegetarian who request this menu for a different experience, but our regular tasting menu, which is also not meat-centric, is our most popular. We want to show that one can have a luxurious dining experience at O’, that also is environmentally cautious.”</p>
