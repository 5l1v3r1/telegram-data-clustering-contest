      <p>GENK, Belgium (AP) - Belgian champion Genk has fired coach Felice Mazzu with the club at mid-table in its domestic league, and last in a Champions League group led by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Genk says in a statement the team is trending “ever more negative, and club management does not have the feeling that the current technical staff can still turn things around.”</p>
      <p>Mazzu was appointed in the offseason after six years at Charleroi. He replaced Philippe Clement, who returned to his former club Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>Clement has Brugge five points clear at the top of the league, and held Real Madrid to 2-2 at Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Genk started its Champions League group losing at Salzburg 6-2, and was beaten twice by Liverpool in recent weeks.</p>
