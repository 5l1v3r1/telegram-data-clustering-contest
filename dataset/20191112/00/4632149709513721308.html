      <p>With an eye on the regional connectivity scheme and to woo airlines and other stakeholders, Airbus flew down the single-aisle A220 to the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Monday. <br/><br/>The aircraft landed at KIA as part of Airbus’s demonstration tour of the Asia-Pacific region. The single-aisle A220 was showcased in the presence of airline and government officials. Monday’s demonstration tour comprised static display and a demonstration flight. <br/><br/>KIA is the first Indian airport for the aircraft to touch down and its next stop is the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi. <br/><br/>According to Airbus, the A220, with the largest and quietest cabin in its class, offers a wide-body passenger comfort in single-aisle aircraft. “It incorporates state-of-the-art technologies, the latest aerodynamic design and new generation engines resulting in fuel savings of 20 per cent. It is the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150 seat market and offers extended range capability of up to 3,400 nautical miles making it particularly suitable for operations in India,” it said. <br/><br/><br/>The aircraft was originally developed by Bombardier in Canada as the C Series, the A220 is a clean sheet design and the only aircraft purpose-built for the 100-150-seat market. <br/><br/>It is estimated to represent at least 7,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. <br/><br/><br/>So far, the aircraft manufacturer has received 511 historical orders from 20 customers worldwide. It has delivered 83 aircraft delivered to six customers, which include SWISS, airBaltic, Korean Air, Delta Air Lines, Air Tanzania and GTLK.</p>
