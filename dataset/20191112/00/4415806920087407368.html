      <p>There is a dramatic drop in children’s physical activity levels by the time they finish primary school, a study has found.</p>
      <p>Children lost on average more than an hour of exercise per week between the ages of six and 11, with a greater fall at the weekends, the research found.</p>
      <p>Researchers monitored the behaviour of more than 2,000 children from 57 schools across the south west of England during primary school.</p>
      <p>They found children became 17 minutes less active per week each year.</p>
      <blockquote>This isn’t about getting children to exercise more, but rather maintaining their activity levels</blockquote>
      <p>Russ Jago, professor of paediatric physical activity at the University of Bristol, said: “Evaluating patterns of physical activity across childhood is an important way to identify key ages in which to intervene to change behaviour – and establish healthy habits for life.</p>
      <p>“These numbers prove that more needs to be done to ensure children keep active as they approach adolescence.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t about getting children to exercise more, but rather maintaining their activity levels.</p>
      <p>“Developing early intervention strategies that help children retain activity levels could include after-school physical activity programmes, focusing on participation and enjoyment in addition to popular sports – and a greater emphasis on promoting weekend activities.”</p>
      <p>In the study, children wore an accelerometer for five days, including two weekend days.</p>
      <p>This provided an assessment of how many minutes per day the children participated in moderate to vigorous physical activity – defined as making them slightly out of breath and sweaty.</p>
      <p>The UK Chief Medical Officers recommend that children do an hour of such activity every day.</p>
      <p>The study found that 61% of children in Year 1 did at least an hour of this activity per day but by Year 6, only 41% achieved the target.</p>
      <blockquote>Almost a third of children in the UK weigh more than they should, while one in four primary school children are not meeting the recommended levels of exercise</blockquote>
      <p>In girls, the figure fell from 54% to 28% by the time they finished primary school.</p>
      <p>Results showed that average weekday activity decreased between age six and 11 by 2.2 minutes per day per year.</p>
      <p>Average weekend activity decreased by 3.1 minutes per day per year.</p>
      <p>Girls were less active than boys at all ages but the gap became wider as the children aged, with a nine-minute per day gap increasing to 15 minutes at age 11.</p>
      <p>The research also examined how body mass index is associated with physical activity in childhood and whether associations change as children age.</p>
      <p>Data from the 2017/18 National Child Measurement Programme shows that 10% of children aged four to five in England were obese.</p>
      <p>This figure doubled to 20% for 10 to 11-year-olds.</p>
      <p>In total, 90% of children who were obese at the age of three remain overweight or obese in adolescence.</p>
      <p>Professor Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Almost a third of children in the UK weigh more than they should, while one in four primary school children are not meeting the recommended levels of exercise.</p>
      <p>“We know that children living with obesity are more likely to become obese adults – putting them at increased risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases and their risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, later in life.</p>
      <p>“Staying active must be combined with policies that help families make healthy and informed choices, such as a 9pm watershed on junk food marketing and restricting the promotion of unhealthy foods.”</p>
      <p>The research found that at age six, there was no difference in the activity of children who were a healthy weight compared with those classed as overweight or obese.</p>
      <p>However, a child that was obese aged six and remained so at age 11 engaged in 10 minutes less activity per weekday than a similar child at a healthy weight at both ages.</p>
