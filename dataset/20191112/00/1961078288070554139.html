      <h1>After Schumer Praised the Retiring Rep. King, Some Democrats Jeered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:49:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse McKinley</a></address>
      <p>Maybe he just should have called.</p>
      <p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York responded to the announcement on Monday that Representative Peter King, the Long Island Republican, was retiring by <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1193873613746778114?s=20">publishing a warm tribute to Mr. King on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>Such an across-the-aisle embrace has long been par for the course on occasions of retirement, death or other political farewells.</p>
      <p>But in a hyperpartisan era in which ideology often trumps old-fashioned bonhomie, Mr. Schumer was rebuked by members of his own party for saying Mr. King “stood head &amp; shoulders above everyone else” and “fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3.”</p>
      <p>“I will miss him in Congress &amp; value his friendship,” the senator concluded.</p>
      <p>Many Twitter followers of Mr. Schumer, the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, did not agree with the sentiments.</p>
      <p>“Good grief,” read one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/metaquest">more polite response</a>s. “Have you lost your mind?”</p>
      <p>Indeed, the tweet prompted more than 10,000 replies, mostly negative and some downright nasty. Videos of <a href="https://twitter.com/rhinosoros/status/1193951847935094784">thumbs-downs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Mel_Ankoly/status/1193958774475612161">eye-rolling</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/morninggloria/status/1193905058741510144">heads shaking “no,”</a> flooded into Mr. Schumer’s feed, as the word “resign” got tossed about.</p>
      <p>Many of those outraged by Mr. Schumer’s praise pointed out Mr. King’s more controversial positions and statements, including when he said that there are <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-now/2007/09/rep-peter-king-there-are-too-many-mosques-in-this-country-003213">“too many mosques”</a> in America; that protesting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/may/26/republican-lawmaker-says-nfl-player-protests-are-premised-on-lies">N.F.L. players are similar to Nazis</a>; and that <a href="https://www.vox.com/xpress/2014/12/4/7332193/peter-king-eric-garner">Eric Garner’s death</a> was the result of his obesity and asthma, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/nyregion/daniel-pantaleo-fired.html?module=inline">rather than the chokehold applied</a> by a New York Police Department officer.</p>
      <p>Add in Mr. King’s frequent support for President Trump and his policies, and Mr. Schumer’s comments seemed even more galling — and divisive — to some on the left.</p>
      <p>Another of Mr. King’s congressional colleagues, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota — a Muslim-American who herself has been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-tweet-ilhan-omar-death-threats-twitter/">the subject of Twitter fury</a> — had a blunter take <a href="https://www.facebook.com/271424728416/posts/10157884248848417?d=n&amp;sfns=mo">on his retirement announcement</a>, noting his inflammatory statements about Islam and Mr. Garner.</p>
      <p>“Good riddance,” <a href="https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1193925337379463169">she said</a>.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the criticism, Mr. Schumer did not delete the tweet despite <a href="https://twitter.com/cassady2euca/status/1193973632407609344">some calls to do so</a>.</p>
      <p>“SERIOUSLY SCHUMER??,” wrote <a href="https://twitter.com/peterdaou/status/1193891167362002946">Peter Daou,</a> a former adviser <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/nyregion/27hillary.html?module=inline">to Hillary Clinton</a>, about the tweet. He chastised Mr. Schumer for “fawning” over Mr. King and other Democratic leaders for “enabling” Republicans. “We need a new Democratic Party.”</p>
      <p>The reaction to Mr. Schumer’s tweet was not completely unexpected, though some said it was overblown.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-brian-fallon-hillary-clintons-press-secretary-self-radicalized-and-became-a-resistance-leader">Brian Fallon</a>, the executive director of the activist group <a href="https://www.demandjustice.org/">Demand Justice</a> and a former top aide to Mr. Schumer, noted that Mr. King had a deep local and middle-class appeal — he will have served more than a quarter century when he retires — and that the senator had become “fond of him.”</p>
      <p>“The two of them worked shoulder to shoulder in the years after 9/11 fighting to get Homeland Security funding for New York,” Mr. Fallon said. “Pete King would criticize his own party when Bush’s budgets would shortchange the grant amounts allotted for New York, and Schumer respected that about him.”</p>
      <p>Angelo Roefaro, a spokesman for Mr. Schumer, said the senator and the representative “had many disagreements on many issues, especially on immigration, his attitude toward Muslims, and women’s rights,” which manifested itself in efforts by the senator and other Democrats to defeat Mr. King last fall.</p>
      <p>But, he added, “they’ve worked closely together on issues vital to New York, like delivering much-needed federal aid locally post 9/11, Superstorm Sandy and backing universal background checks legislation,” for guns.</p>
