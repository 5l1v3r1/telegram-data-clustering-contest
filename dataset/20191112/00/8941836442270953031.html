      <h1>Former President Jimmy Carter enters hospital for surgery</h1>

      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - Former U.S. President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Jimmy Carter</a> was admitted to a hospital on Monday evening for a surgery to relieve pressure on his brain, caused by bleeding due to his recent falls, his spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The procedure is scheduled for Tuesday morning at Emory University Hospital, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/deanna-congileo/">Deanna Congileo</a> said in a statement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> has fallen at least three times this year, and the first incident in the spring required hip replacement surgery. He traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, and helped build a Habitat for Humanity home after getting 14 stiches following a fall on Oct. 6. And he was briefly hospitalized after fracturing his pelvis on Oct. 21. He received a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 but survived and has since said he is cancer-free.</p>
      <p>Nearly four decades after he left office and despite a body that’s failing after 95 years, the nation’s oldest-ever ex-president still teaches Sunday school roughly twice a month at Maranatha Baptist Church in his tiny hometown of Plains in southwest Georgia. His message is unfailingly about Jesus, not himself.</p>
      <p>Rev. Tony Lowden, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a>’s pastor, said the ex-president was hospitalized Monday on what he called “a rough day.”</p>

      <p>“We just need the whole country to be in prayer for him,” Lowden said in a telephone interview.</p>
      <p>The church has announced that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jimmy-carter/">Carter</a> will not be teaching his Sunday school class this week.</p>
