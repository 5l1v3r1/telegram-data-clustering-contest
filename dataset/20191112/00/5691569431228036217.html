      <h1>Better batteries are fueling a surge of electric scooters in India and China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Venkat Viswanathan, Shashank Sripad</a></address>
      <p>When it comes to electric cars, 2019 has been a big year. Tesla <a href="https://qz.com/1703260/teslas-model-3-may-never-catch-up-to-the-nissan-leaf/">ramped up production of its Model 3 sedan</a>, Audi launched its <a href="https://www.audiusa.com/technology/efficiency/e-tron">e-Tron</a> all-electric SUV, Porsche unveiled the <a href="https://www.porsche.com/usa/models/taycan/taycan-models/taycan-turbo/">Taycan</a> sports car, and perhaps most significant of all, Daimler announced that it has <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/09/19/daimler-stops-developing-internal-combustion-engines-to-focus-on-electric-cars/">no plans to develop next-generation combustion engines</a>, but instead will focus on electrification.</p>
      <p>Cars dominate personal transportation in developed countries, but in the developing world, two-wheelers — motorcycles and motor scooters — account for the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-10-14/electric-scooters-are-the-future-of-transportation">majority of vehicles on the road</a>. China and India are the <a href="https://motorcyclesdata.com/2019/10/15/world-motorcycles-market/">two largest markets for two-wheelers</a>, which contribute to their air pollution problems. About <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.01.037">20 percent of the CO2 emissions and 30 percent of particulate emissions</a> in India are due to two-wheelers.</p>
      <p>Among the world’s <a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/">50 most polluted cities</a>, 37 are in India and China. That’s why there is a pressing need to examine this sector closely. But for electric vehicles to become mass market products, batteries need to improve, and we have studied what those requirements are.</p>
      <h3>Minimum driving range</h3>
      <p>In an <a href="https://theconversation.com/mass-market-electric-pickup-trucks-and-suvs-are-on-the-way-107952">earlier Conversation piece</a>, we discussed a simple approach to estimate the energy an electric vehicle would need to carry on board — usually in the form of a battery — for a given driving range.</p>
      <p>In much the same way, in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b02103">recent research paper</a>, we analyzed the battery requirements for electric two-wheelers to better understand the cost requirements to compete with gasoline-powered motorcycles and scooters.</p>
      <p>We found that for a range of about 60 miles, a battery pack of about 2.5 kiloWatt-hours is needed. This is about eight times smaller than the battery pack needed for driving the same range in a sedan. A distance of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0739885918301823">60 miles is the upper limit</a> of the typical daily driving range for two-wheelers, although gas-powered two-wheelers can cover up to 186 miles with a full tank of gas.</p>
      <p>By understanding the battery needs of two-wheelers and projected battery costs — the other vitally important factor — one can get a better idea of when electric two-wheelers will be competitive with gas-powered vehicles. This means consumers can better evaluate when electric-powered two-wheelers will meet their daily driving needs.</p>
      <p>The cost challenge</p>
      <p>To move, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1149/2.0671711jes">a vehicle has to resist three forces</a>: drag, or resistance from the wind; friction from the road; and inertia, or resistance to a change in speed. These factors all influence energy storage capacity — and thus battery size.</p>
      <p>In an electric sedan or SUV, space and weight <a href="https://theconversation.com/mass-market-electric-pickup-trucks-and-suvs-are-on-the-way-107952">constrain the battery pack size</a>. But this is not a bottleneck for electric two-wheelers because their total storage needs are substantially lower, as they are smaller vehicles and carry less cargo.</p>
      <p>The specific energy of commercial batteries, or the amount of energy stored relative to their weight, is generally improving. This has a significant impact on the driving range of larger electric vehicles. But as the total energy capacity needs of two-wheelers are lower, this ongoing technical progress provides a negligible increase in driving range for a given scooter or motorcycle.</p>
      <p>Of course, the cost of the battery pack matters, too. The average retail price for two-wheelers in India is <a href="https://www.pricedekho.com/bikes/scooter+bikes-price-list.html">$1,000</a>. Currently, the battery pack cost is around <a href="https://data.bloomberglp.com/bnef/sites/14/2017/07/BNEF-Lithium-ion-battery-costs-and-market.pdf">$180/kWh (PDF)</a> for small-volume markets, resulting in electric two-wheelers needing close to $500 for just the battery pack.</p>
      <p>The general trend on <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/behind-scenes-take-lithium-ion-battery-prices/">battery prices is downward</a>, going at a rate few have predicted. The battery cell price broke the $100/kWh barrier in 2018 for high-volume markets, such as electric vehicles, and cost declines are expected to continue over the next decade.</p>
      <h3>Electric micromobility</h3>
      <p>There is a major push in India and China to drive adoption of electric two-wheelers. Electric two-wheeler sales reached 40 million last year, with <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-electric-motor-scooters-are-leading-electric-vehicle-revolution-in-asia">China accounting for 90 percent of this</a>. India has launched a program called <a href="https://www.fame-india.gov.in/">FAME</a> to provide financial incentives for 86 models of electric two-wheelers.</p>
      <p>Given the small battery pack, electric two-wheelers can be charged easily from a regular wall socket. To explore these aspects, we worked with the CEO of electric scooter maker <a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/">Ather Energy</a> and the principal adviser to Indian policy think tank <a href="https://niti.gov.in/">NITI Aayog</a> to better understand charging in India.</p>
      <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.9b02103">Data from Ather Energy</a> indicate that a large majority of electric two-wheeler owners tend to charge at home. Hence, a policy push toward establishing residential charging facilities, especially in large residential buildings such as apartment complexes, would have a positive impact on adoption and use.</p>
      <p>Advances in the performance metrics of batteries and cost reductions are spurring a revolution in micromobility in general. In addition to electric scooters, a market is emerging for electric mopeds, one-wheel scooters and skateboards, each with a range around six to 12 miles. Vehicle trips under six miles are about 60 percent of total trips; in terms of person miles traveled, <a href="https://twitter.com/skorusARK/status/1030545329773600768">they make up only about 15 percent</a>, according an analysis from Ark Investment, citing U.S. government data.</p>
      <p>Our analysis shows three key trade-offs when it comes to engineering electric two-wheelers: battery pack storage capacity, which translates into driving range; the average speed of the drivers; and the cost per kilowatt-hour. Electric motor scooters already are being purchased by hundreds of thousands of consumers in Asia — there’s even an electric version of the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/bajaj-chetak-to-be-sold-initially-through-ktm-showrooms-in-india-414663">iconic Indian scooter called the Bajaj Chetak</a>. Once manufacturers can make two-wheelers that achieve a range of 60 miles at a comparable price to gas-powered vehicles, we believe even more consumers will opt for the electric option.</p>
