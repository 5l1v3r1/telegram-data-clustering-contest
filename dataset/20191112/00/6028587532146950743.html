      <p>It’s Disney+ day, the long-awaited arrival of the entertainment titan’s new streaming app and serious competitor to Netflix. It’s a big rollout, both in terms of content and in terms of platforms: Disney wants to hit the ground running and leave as few users behind as possible as it makes its play in a potentially profitable new field. There are a ton of gamers out there that use their consoles as their media boxes as well, and most of them will not be left behind. Most of them. The good news here is for Microsoft and Sony fans. PlayStation 4 and Xbox One support Disney+, so Star Wars fans can comfortably switch between watching <i>The Mandalorian</i> and playing <i>Jedi: Fallen</i> order when it launches later this week.</p>
      <p>Nintendo Switch fans, however, will be left behind. Disney+ is not currently available on the Switch, and I wouldn’t hold my breath for an app, either.</p>
      <p>This isn’t entirely surprising: Nintendo has a complex relationship to non-gaming services and, really, to online services in general. It has Hulu and Youtube, but that’s it where streaming services are concerned. You still can’t watch Netflix on the thing, even though there’s something tempting about the idea of an all-in-one entertainment device that comes complete with the Switch’s signature switching. I suppose expanding the streaming options would, to a certain degree, make the Switch feel a little bit more like a souped-up phone and less like the magical device Nintendo likes to present, but I do feel like anything capable of playing <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> will do just fine on the magic front.</p>
      <p>I do hope that Nintendo chooses to expand the Switch’s media capabilities at some point, but until then video game console users still have plenty of options to watch all of the endless sea of content that Disney+ has to offer.</p>
      <p>Me, I just have a PC plugged into my TV. It’s rarely not the best option, and I’d recommend it to anyone that wants maximum flexibility out of all the screens in their house, no matter how large.</p>
