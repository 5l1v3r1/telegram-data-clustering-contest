      <h1>Tesco Pulls Mel B’s Image From Ad After Using Her Face Without Permission</h1>

      <p><i>Image via <a href="https://shutterstock.7eer.net/c/1262811/42119/1305?u=https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/mel-b-5th-biennial-stand-cancer-481244473">Tinseltown / Shutterstock.com</a></i> <br/><b>Spice Girls’ Mel B</b> demanded for the CEO of Tesco to call her immediately after learning that the company had used her photo for a bus stop ad without her permission. <br/><b>The singer took</b> to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4url90prVb/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Instagram</a> to share a photo of the supermarket’s Clubcard ad, which featured Mel B in a leopard print bodysuit and a sports bra underneath it. The original image was taken at the 1997 Brit Awards. <br/><b>Next to her</b> was a speech bubble that read, “Stop right now. You get 10 percent off two big shops a month for 7.99 pounds.” The tagline seemed to be a play on Spice Girls’ hit song <i>Stop</i>, which features the lyric, “Stop right now.” <br/><b>The singer was stunned</b> to see herself in the blown-up billboard and demanded the CEO of Tesco Dave Lewis to contact her urgently. Since then, the supermarket has removed the image. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>A spokesperson from Tesco</b> said that the company had “authorization to use the image,” and the team was excited to feature her in their ad. However, the image was taken down after Mel B expressed unhappiness towards the advert. <br/><b>The photo was part</b> of Tesco’s 100th anniversary campaign that draws cultural references from its last 100 years.</p>
