      <p>The wine pairing game at Thanksgiving feels a bit like playing roulette—you never know what you’re going to get, so best to stock up on wines that have versatility at their core. This list features everything from American gems worth the splurge to amazing values that will keep a big crowd happy. Sparkling wine is always a winner, and, based on current consumer passions, you should expect your guests to guzzle it so buy plenty. Other top choices include classic Italian reds (which just pine for food) as well as a solid Chardonnay and Pinot Noir offering that won’t break the bank. For the finale, toss in a patriotic surprise for dessert with our Founding Father’s favorite libation: Madeira. <i><u>Classy American Sparklings to Start the Party:</u></i></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.stollerfamilyestate.com/">Stoller Larue’s Brut Rose, Oregon, 2015:</a> Crafted with premium fruit from the Stoller Estate’s higher elevation vineyards, this sparkling is delicate, charming and refined. It’s 75% Pinot Noir and 25% Chardonnay, with bright raspberry notes, citrusy freshness and beautiful texture. Kick off the evening with a bottle, or serve it with sweet potato pie and slice of turkey. $65</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rexhill.com/">Rex Hill Grand Cuvee Oregon, 2015:</a> A decadent sparkling wine with a fine mousse texture and delicious notes of baked apple, brioche and lemon cream. Barrel fermented and aged on the lees, this sparkling was crafted to have depth, complexity and bold richness—and it delivers. $65</p>

      </p>
      <p><a href="https://olemawines.com/cremant">Olema Brut Rosé, Crémant de Loire:</a>  A wonderfully crisp and delicate sparkling wine from France’s Loire Valley. The pretty salmon color and notes of raspberries and lemon cream make this a nice choice as an aperitif. Made with 80% Cabernet Franc and 20% Grolleau.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pertinace.com/en/prodotto/barbera-dalba-doc/">Pertinace Barbera d’Alba DOC, 2017:</a><i> </i>Soulful and rich notes of black cherry with hints of tobacco and a top note of cinnamon and warm spice. Savory, with a silky full mouthfeel, this wine drinks like $50 but you’ll find it around town for closer to $15. You can also find in Delta One, where sommelier Andrea Robinson continues to sleuth out terrific wines without breaking the wallet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.albert-bichot.com/en">Maison Albert Bichot Secret de Famille Chardonnay 2017 and Secret de Famille Pinot Noir 2017</a>: Maison Albert Bichot is well-regarded for crafting a large selection of ultra-premium Burgundy wines and these entry-level offerings are two of the region’s better values. The Chardonnay is buttery and fresh with an appealing mineral edge while the Pinot Noir delivers all that people love about this varietal: strawberry and raspberry notes over soft tannins. Both are priced around $22 a bottle.</p>

      <p><b>La Caccia di San Giovanni IGT Italy, 2017:</b> This Italian Super Tuscan is comprised of 50% Sangiovese, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Crafted from estate fruit (part of a property owned by four Americans) this wine shows layers of dark black cherry with notes of warm spice, cassis and a dark chocolate. Mouth-watering and nicely tannic, it will pair well with several dishes, especially roasted meats (turkey anyone?). This is the winery’s first vintage, all from organic fruit. <b>$50</b></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.winebow.com/our-brands/secondo-marco/valpolicella-classico-ripasso-doc/"><b>Secondo Marco Valpolicella Classico Ripasso DOC 2014:</b></a><b> </b>Secondo Marco is a relatively new brand created by Marco Speri, a fifth generation of one of the most important winemaking families in Valpolicella. His goal is to make elegant, food-friendly wines by focusing on higher acidity, lower alcohol, and less residual sugar. This medium-bodied wine is rich and textural with red-fruit flavors accented by spice and floral notes. Because of this, the wine can be paired with a wide range of foods from cheeses and grilled red meats to pastas and risottos. This wine is perfect to bring to a holiday gathering, whether drinking before, during or after a meal. $30</p>
