      <p>Before the April draft, new Oakland Raiders general manager Mike Mayock – who is second in command in the organization behind $100 million czar Jon Gruden – said this year’s selection process would shape the franchise for years.</p>
      <p> Simply put, Mayock said the Raiders, who went 4-12 last season with one of the worst rosters in the league, needed to acquire foundation players in the 2019 draft.</p>
      <p> Nine games into these rookie’s careers, it looks like Gruden and Mayock have hit on several players who can set the tone for the team as it becomes the Las Vegas Raiders next year.    </p>
      <p>The upstart Raiders are 5-4 and are very much in the AFC playoff picture with an easy remaining schedule. Several rookies have contributed greatly to every victory (rookies scored every touchdown of the Raiders’ Week 9 win over Detroit). Let’s break down each key rookie in the order of being drafted:</p>
      <p><b>Clelin Ferrell: </b>The No. 4 overall draft pick was a dud – until Week 10. The defensive end from Clemson had 2.5 sacks and made a major impact in a crucial win over the Chargers. Many people around the league thought Ferrell was overdrafted. Perhaps his play last Thursday is the start of something big for Ferrell. <b> </b></p>
      <p><b>Josh Jacobs: </b>The No. 24 overall draft pick is the odds-on favorite to win the NFL offensive Rookie of the Year award. He has 811 rushing yards, which is the sixth most in the NFL. The Alabama product <a href="https://www.dailyfantasycafe.com/draftkings-promo-code">is a great fantasy football play</a> and is a big reason why Oakland’s offense is vastly improved. He can be the key to the offense, and take pressure of quarterback Derek Carr, for the next several years.</p>
      <p><b>Johnathan Abram: </b>The No. 27 overall draft pick suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the Week 1. The safety looked very good in that game. So, the future is bright for Abram, who can be a longtime stalwart of the Las Vegas defense.</p>
      <p><b>Trayvon Mullen:</b> The second-round pick from Clemson became a starting cornerback when the Raiders traded Gareon Conley to Houston. He is still a work in progress, but he has a chance to be part of the future.</p>
      <p><b>Maxx Crosby: </b>The fourth-round pick has been a dynamic pass-rusher. The defensive end from small-school Eastern Michigan has a chance to be one of the steals of this draft. He looks like a keeper.</p>
      <p><b>Isaiah Johnson:</b> The cornerback, taken in the fourth round, is just back from the injured reserve. He will get a chance to fight for reps late in the season.</p>
      <p><b>Foster Moreau</b>: The fourth-round pick from LSU could have a nice future. The tight end is a good receiver and blocker. He’s already come up big when needed.</p>
      <p><b>Hunter Renfrow</b>: The slot machine from Clemson started slow, but he has become a big part of the Raiders’ winning ways. This guy has a chance to be the next ultra-productive slot receiver. He’s perfect for Gruden’s offense.</p>
      <p><b>Quenton Bell:</b> The athletic defensive end was a lottery ticket. He was cut and signed to the practice squad. He was then cut off the practice squad. He is now on Tampa Bay’s practice squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Undrafted rookies</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Alex Ingold: </b>The fullback from Wisconsin is a Gruden Grinder. He has been excellent on fourth down and is a great lead blocker for Jacobs. Fullbacks aren’t a big thing around the NFL, but Ingold has found a home with Gruden.</p>
      <p><b>Andre James:</b> The center from UCLA played well for for an inured Rodney Hudson for two games.</p>
      <p><b>Keelan Doss:</b> The ‘Hard Knocks’ star has been mostly inactive.</p>
      <p><b>A.J. Cole:</b> The punter has had a nice season. He could be around awhile.</p>
      <p><b>Conclusion:</b> This group has already made an impact and and it could be a big part of bright future in Las Vegas.</p>
