      <p>Home rentals like those offered by Airbnb and Vrbo have been a thing for years now. In fact, we’ve gotten to the point where the brand name “Airbnb” is synonymous with the service it offers. Instead of staying in a hotel room, you stay "in an Airbnb." </p>

      <p>If you’re a little late to the trend, you might be wondering what all the hype is and if it’s really worth it signing up for an Airbnb (or another home rental brand) account, talking to hosts and going through a somewhat more lengthy booking process than just booking the same-old room you always get at the Marriott. </p>
      <p>Well, to help you decide where you want to stay the next time you travel, here are the various pros and cons of staying in an Airbnb. </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Cons</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. A Lengthier Booking Process</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, the first con is that the booking process is generally lengthier. Booking a hotel is so easy. You just go to a website, add in some credit card info and book. Done and done.</p>
      <p>Booking an Airbnb requires an account on the website and then actually conversing with the host (in most cases) to get your stay booked, something that might take days. There are, of course, instant book options available on Airbnb. But even then, you’re still at the mercy of the host.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. The Host</b>
      </p>
      <p>This con can go either way. Some travelers love people. They love getting to know locals. Others do not.</p>
      <p>When you stay in an Airbnb, you may meet your host and they may be very chatty. You may get roped into a long conversation. They may make you a snack. This could be good or bad, depending on your preferences.</p>
      <p>However, it is most definitely a con that, regardless of how nice your host may be, you’re always at their mercy. If they decide the day before your stay that they can no longer rent their room or home out to you, they can cancel. </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. It’s Not Always Cheaper</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of people tout Airbnb as a more affordable option to staying in a hotel. This can be true in some circumstances. But, as with most things in life, you get what you pay for.</p>
      <p>An Airbnb private room in your host’s home might be more affordable than a hotel room, but it’s also not as private as a hotel room (for example, you probably won’t get your own private bathroom). An Airbnb that gives you a full apartment to yourself might be more affordable than a hotel room, but it may also be in a more residential part of town, away from the city's more desirable areas.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. You’re A Business Traveler</b>
      </p>
      <p>The business travel market is one that Airbnb has consistently tried to tap but without much success. Business travelers just want amenities that most Airbnb properties don’t offer. They want plenty of plugs and places to charge their devices, a workspace, reliable internet, somewhere that makes it easy to get around, quiet spaces to work and maybe even places to meet with colleagues. </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Pros</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. The Options Are Unique And Nearly Endless</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re looking for a very unique stay, then Airbnb could be absolutely perfect for you. Unique, one-of-a-kind accommodation options is something that Airbnb offers in droves. Whether you want to stay on a boat, in a treehouse, a glamping pod, a cabin or even a castle, you can find it on Airbnb.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. You Really Can Feel At Home</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you want to feel completely at home when you travel, then an Airbnb could be just the thing. You get all the creature comforts that come with being in an actual home. You can cook in the kitchen, lie on a couch and watch television, walk around the block and see what the locals see.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that, just as you’d have to pick up after yourself at home, you’ll have to pick up after yourself at your Airbnb, too. Or you'll pay a cleaning fee.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. It’s Perfect For Big Parties</b>
      </p>
      <p>Big parties such as family reunions, bachelor or bachelorette parties, girl's trips, etc. can really make use of Airbnb spaces to their full potential. Large properties provide plenty of bedrooms and social spaces for a price that, when broken down among a group, often makes staying in an Airbnb more affordable than staying in a block of hotel rooms.</p>
      <p>Plus, these properties targeted to traveling groups often offer you things you could never get in a hotel, such as a private game room with pool or foosball tables, a hot tub, yard space, pool and/or a large dining room. </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Immersion is Easy</b>
      </p>
      <p>When staying at a big hotel in a foreign city, it can be easy to feel like you’re staying really anywhere in the world. After all, most big brand hotels all feel the same inside. Close the curtains and you could be somewhere else entirely.</p>
      <p>Immersing yourself in a foreign culture can be much easier when you stay at an Airbnb, especially if you book a single room instead of an entire property. This gives you the chance to socialize frequently with your hosts who can offer the best insider advice about your destination.</p>
