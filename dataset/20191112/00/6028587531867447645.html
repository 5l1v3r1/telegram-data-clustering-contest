      <p>Four times a year, things get a little crazy in Galena, IL. A seasonal release of an aged has whiskey lovers driving through the night and sleeping in their cars to get their hands on the extremely limited and extremely hard to find Blaum Bros. Oldfangled Knotter Bourbon. “It’s older than our distillery,” says Mike Blaum, COO, chief distiller and distillery co-founder with his brother Matt, CEO. The distillery opened its doors in 2013.</p>
      <p>Before they opened their distillery’s doors, they bought some 7-year-old barrels of bourbon from MGP in Indiana, which they continued to age, and then they blend different aged barrels together to get Oldfangled’s apparently bewitching elixir. “MGP ‘s bourbon is distilled by wizards,” Mike says.</p>
      <p>The bourbon itself is cask strength, non-chill filtered, and it has been exposed to some pretty cold temperatures, which helped develop its flavors. And it’s a big deal – such a big deal that hundreds of people flock to Galena as soon as they hear that some new bottles of Oldfangled are being released.</p>

      <p>The brothers released their first batch of Oldfangled about four years ago, but it wasn’t until August of last year, that things started to get crazy. “Suddenly, underground bourbon nerds caught on and decided they must have it,” says Matt, CEO. “Before this, it sat on shelves. It wasn’t a total dud, but it wasn’t as popular as it is now. The brand exploded.”</p>
      <p>The Blaum brothers don’t list their release dates on the calendar –it’s when the bourbon seems ready to them, and then they announce it via social media a week out from the time and day of the release. This happens four times a year, about once a quarter, but it never happens on the same day. </p>
      <p>“But we get calls every week, all year round, from folks asking when we’re going to release another bottle,” says Mike. “Our bartenders keep a tally of how many people are (jerks) when they call.”</p>
      <p>“Last time we released a bottle, we had people coming here on the Friday before, and they were at our bar at 5 p.m., and they told us they were here for the release,” says Matt. “We had people sleeping in their cars in our parking lot the last time.”</p>
      <p>This past Saturday, they had 150 people crowded in at the bar at 9 a.m. before the official 10 a.m. release of the bourbon. “From conversations I learned that some people showed up around midnight or 1 a.m.,” Matt says. “They got rooms at the hotel next door or stayed in their cars, and they were waiting for that first person to go stand by the door.”</p>

      <p>The first person walked to the door around 6 a.m. “Then everyone went to the door, and it was mayhem,” Matt says.</p>
      <p>Cars were lining up for blocks down the street, which is actually a highway, from the distillery, and the small tasting room was packed, crammed full with people. “People parked on the shoulder of the highway, and cars were stretched for about a quarter of a mile,” says Matt.</p>
      <p>This year, people drove from as far away as Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota and even the bourbon epicenter of the world, Kentucky.  “Some people drove in and stayed overnight at the motel next door,” Matt says. “Others drove for eight hours straight, and they got here too late and didn’t get a bottle.”</p>
      <p>Scott Crayven, from St. Louis, rode to Galena with his wife and two friends. “It’s not just about getting a bottle,” Crayven says. It’s about this whole experience. Coming here, meeting these guys (the Blaum brothers), meeting other fans. It’s an amazing experience.”</p>
      <p>The brothers estimate that that less than five percent of the bourbon fans came from Galena or a drive of two hours or less to get the latest release, which on the bottle, says it is 12 years old, but it’s not. “It’s actually 13 years old, but we were too cheap to do new labels,” says Matt. “We’re thrifty guys. People get a kick out of it.”</p>
      <p>Once people purchased their bottles, they took photos with Matt and Mike at the register, and then uploaded them onto social media platforms. “It’s weird for us,” says Matt. “We're just a couple of dorks who are making whiskey for a living, but people get really crazy.”</p>
      <p> “Our bottles just fly off the shelves, and at our last release, we had this poor little, old lady who could barely walk who was buying it for her grandson,” Mike says. “I told her ‘Your grandson’s a jerk, and you are the best grandma ever.’”</p>
      <p>At Saturday’s release, they sold the $90 bottles at only one per person, until 130 bottles sold out. Their distributors got another 800 bottles, and they’re distributed in Illinois, Wisconsin, Tennessee and Colorado. </p>
      <p>“A lot of stores in Chicago get calls year-round, too,” says Matt. “A manager at Binny’s who came on a tour says they get a call about three times a day at each of their stores. It’s a pretty wild thing for us.”</p>
      <p>Once these bottles are gone, they’re gone…unless they’re resold for sometimes upwards of $1,800 per bottle, which some people do. “People just gobble this up,” says Matt. “We’ve never raised our price.”</p>
      <p>“This is better than Christmas,” says Mark Abernathe, after he finally got his bottle on Saturday. “This bottle is all I wanted.”</p>
      <p>“It’s something, all right,” Matt says.</p>
