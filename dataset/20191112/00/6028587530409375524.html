      <p><a href="https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2019/adidas-deploys-speedfactory-technology-at-asian-suppliers-by-end-2019/">Adidas has announced plans</a> to withdraw its “speed factories” out of Germany and the US, instead opting to reassign their newfound expertise in 3D printing and automation to suppliers in Asia.As the majority of Adidas’ products are already manufactured in Asia, it makes fiscal sense for the company to keep production costs down by moving expensive processes to a region with greater manufacturing capabilities.</p>
      <p>This may prove to be short-sighted for Adidas, however, as keeping up with consumer demand and fierce competition becomes more difficult each day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fast fashion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Adidas’ “speed factories”, operated by German company <a href="https://www.oechsler.com/">Oechsler AG</a>, used 3D printing techniques such as bonding and molding to eliminate the need for manual stitching and gluing. The factory in Ansbach needed just 160 people to make 500,000 pairs of shoes annually and had <a href="https://www.oechsler.com/en/products/footwear/">automated the entire production process</a> all the way to boxing the shoes.</p>
      <p>This process also cut down the production time for a pair of shoes to one day, rather than the typical two to three months that it would take for constituent parts to be sent around different factories in China and Vietnam.</p>
      <p>Proponents of Adidas’ foray into automation held these speed factories up as a major contribution to a new era of manufacturing in the West, bringing new, innovative techniques to market and boosting productivity. The project was also originally seen as a way for Adidas to produce footwear in high-cost, developed economies while still being profitable.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A fiscal misstep?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Automating their factories and utilizing 3D printing techniques to cut down production times looked like a solid plan for Adidas to gain new ground on its competitors, and to react more quickly to ever-changing consumer demands.</p>
      <p>With speed factories, Adidas started on a path to decentralize their manufacturing processes, bring production closer to the user and to create much more customized and personalized products (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlestowersclark/2019/04/26/3d-printing-discussing-new-balance-and-root-canals-with-formlabs-david-lakatos/">something that has infinite permutations with 3D printing</a>). In fact, Adidas says it is still interested in these new production technologies, as long as the process can be further simplified, with a view to possibly use these new technological skills to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-09/adidas-targets-instant-satisfaction-with-in-store-shoe-printing">pursue in-store production</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Two steps back</b>
      </p>
      <p>Indeed, it is getting increasingly difficult to anticipate the desires of the market, and cutting production costs may be Adidas’ best bet to keep up by creating new models faster and get more shoes around the world.</p>
      <p>But the decision to move automated production to Asia could have the opposite effect—by increasing the volume of shoes as well as the number of SKUs thanks to cheaper production costs, Adidas could end up distancing themselves from what consumers want.</p>
      <p>They also risk producing too many products that aren’t personal or meaningful enough to consumers in their home markets, at a time when technology has driven people to expect products that are unique to them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thinking forward</b>
      </p>
      <p>Apart from losing autonomy amongst a background of Chinese trade sanctions and political unrest on both sides of the Atlantic, Adidas may also be giving up more impressive technology in the future by cutting ties with innovative, experienced companies working in Europe and the US.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing may be far, far more cost-effective in Asia, but the thinking behind some of the most advanced technologies comes from the US and Europe. By abandoning their newly formed speed factories in the US and Europe, Adidas may be cashing in their share in the technology race too early.</p>
