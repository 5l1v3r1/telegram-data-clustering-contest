      <p>The total proposed investment for Pune project is Rs 361.53 crore, while it is Rs 336 crore for the Kancheepuram project.</p>
      <p>Infosys has sought formal approval for setting up a sector specific SEZ for IT/ITeS at Kancheepuram district in Tamil Nadu over an area of 5.37 hectares.</p>
      <p>The Pune project is proposed at 10 hectares of land.</p>
      <p>According to the agenda paper, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has sought formal approval from the government to set up IT/ITeS zone in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>"TCS Ltd has proposed to invest Rs 900 crore in this zone and provide employment to about 12,000 persons," it said.</p>
      <p>The company has requested to allow for setting up of unit with an initial development centre and start the business operations before the deadline of March 31, 2020.</p>
      <p>All these three proposals are placed before the board for their consideration, it added.</p>
      <p>Further, the Tripura Industrial Development Centre too has sought approval for setting up SEZ for agro-based food processing sector over an area of 16.35 hectares in the state.</p>
      <p>The estimated investment for the project is Rs 1,550 crore.</p>
      <p>SEZs are demanding support, including removal of minimum alternate tax, from the government with a view to boost outbound shipments from these zones.</p>
      <p>SEZs are major export hubs in the country as the government provides several incentives and single-window clearance system.</p>
      <p>Exports from these zones stood at over Rs 7 lakh crore in 2018-19.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
