      <p>Disney Plus is out in the world, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t having problems. The entertainment conglomerate’s hotly-anticipated streaming service launched a little bit early last night, something that companies sometimes do in order to space out the server load by stretching launch day traffic out a little bit. That may have worked or it may not have, but the service is marked by technical problems this morning, with many people reporting receiving an “unable to connect” message.My own experience has been a little touch and go. Clicking on various icons and menu headers on the PC browser version routinely yields a “Something Went Wrong” message, but once I’m able to get something streaming it’s actually remarkably speedy, which bodes well for how well the thing is going to work as we move out of launch day. But going on social media reveals a pretty steady stream of people reporting issues with streaming, including “unable to connect” messages, slow speeds and more.</p>
      <p>This shouldn’t be entirely surprising: major, anticipated products like this often have troublesome launches for two basic reasons. The first is just sheer capacity: at launch day you’re likely to see more people interested in something than will be at any point in the future, and it can be hard for a company to brace itself for a massive influx of users even when it knows those numbers will inevtiably go down as usage stabilizes.</p>
      <p>And the second is scale of a different kind: no matter how much bug testing you can get on one of these things before launch, and something is bound to go wrong when a couple million people hit the service all at once. Some bugs are small and others are large, and they can add up to server issues for all kinds of reasons. In this instance, higher server capacity doesn’t really help because all your servers will wind up having issues, anyways.</p>
      <p>Regardless, I wouldn’t expect this to last too long. Even the worst launches I’ve seen in recent years usually recover in a day or so, and this is far from one of the worst launches. So take a breath and take a moment, it will be fine.</p>
