      <p><i>“Gee, I want to go to a beautiful tropical resort and be nickel-and-dimed for everything I do” –</i> said no one ever.That’s why I’m excited – pinch me – to tell you all about a brand new ALL-INCLUSIVE resort in Mexico that features everything you want, all-included in one price: your accommodations, meals, alcohol and watersports, and a whole lot more.</p>

        <figcaption>Enter the Margaritaville lobby and you'll be handed a welcome drink -- and a pair of flip flops!<cite>Margaritaville</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Margaritaville is a global lifestyle brand inspired by the lyrics and lifestyle of singer, songwriter and best-selling author Jimmy Buffett, whose songs evoke a passion for tropical escape and relaxation.</p>
      <p>Karisma Hotels &amp; Resorts is an award-winning luxury hotel collection that owns and manages properties in Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe. </p>
      <p>Kelly Poling, Chief Executive Officer of Premier Worldwide Marketing, the exclusive representative of Karisma Hotels &amp; Resorts, spoke to me at length about what makes this new resort special, unique and different. She said, “We typically do gourmet inclusive, with an elevated version of all-inclusives. Other places have low-quality alcohol and big buffets. We are the antithesis of that. Top-shelf alcohol. Chef-curated cuisine and a la carte menus. And highly personalized service.” </p>
      <p>It definitely gives new meaning to the words, “all-inclusive.”</p>
      <p>And I can tell you this much. After you have entered the world of all-inclusives – you will never want to go to a regular hotel again. You will be spoiled for life.</p>
      <p>Yes, this is a “spoiler alert,” as you will definitely be catered to and coddled at Margaritaville.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Mini-Bar Raises The Bar</b>
      </p>
      <p>You know how you typically open your mini-bar in your room, only to find drinks and snacks you don’t really want? In addition, if it <b>is</b> something you desire – your credit card is typically hammered for it? Well, that’s an experience you won’t have at Margaritaville.<i> </i>The mini bars are also all-inclusive, so hang on to your Panama Hat. You can grab a beer, a Coke, whatever you want, and your fridge is re-stocked regularly. You can customize your mini-bar, at any point in your stay. You get points and you can go down to the market right on property and select. “This way, you just choose what you want. Wine, cheeses and meats, cookies and chocolate – you can go to the store with your points and this is how we customize your experience,” Ms. Poling added.</p>
      <p>“Whether enjoying a morning coffee, mimosa, mid-day beer, or a frozen Margarita on the balcony at sunset, nothing will beat the comfort, privacy and convenience of this experience.”</p>
      <p>Hearing all that, I’m all in – aren’t you?</p>
      <p>Ms. Poling added, “What will set this hotel apart is that wonderful melding of high-end perfect luxury, with a sense of fun and escapism that comes with Margaritaville. It’s a luxury vacation without any pretense – which makes our partnership a perfect marriage.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Perfect Day Without Pretense</b>
      </p>
      <p>She then went on to explain to me some of the resort’s elements for an ideal day. The perfect day, she says, would start by having a cup of coffee delivered to you on your balcony. “All of the rooms are luxurious suites. Every room is within steps of the ocean. Just get up and you’ll hear the waves and see the scenery. From a service standpoint, the rooms are high-end. We will have an 8,000-square-foot spa with all of the amenities, plus some Margarita-cocktail salt scrubs with lime, incorporated into your spa experience. Some of the really cool things that differentiate us is that when guests walk into the lobby, we want them to feel that they have crossed a threshold and can leave everything behind. They get a welcome drink and are handed a pair of flip flops. All of your worries are to be left behind.” </p>

      </figure>
      <p>She continued, “Then you get settled into your suite – get a spa appointment – or spend the afternoon at the pool. There are four pools on property. In the interest of making things easy – for an afternoon snack when you’re floating in the pool – every day there is a ‘foodie hour,’ when we bring out gourmet bites right to you. So you don’t have to worry about getting up – we will bring it to you. In the evening, Margaritaville wouldn’t be complete without lots of live music and you can choose to eat casually – the best fish taco of your life – all the way up to a high-end Italian restaurant with a great bottle of wine and an exquisite meal.” </p>
      <p>With only 148 guestrooms and suites, the intimate beachfront property allows for a highly personalized vacation, with plenty of space to seek refuge at any of the resort’s four pools, four restaurants, six specialty bars, and 8,000-square-foot St. Somewhere Spa, by Karisma. “The spa will have a couples suite and a bridal suite with an expansive hydrotherapy area, beauty salon, herbal steam room, and dry sauna.” St. Somewhere Spa by Karisma presents offerings designed to awaken the senses, strengthen circulation, soothe nerves, improve digestion and balance metabolism, in addition to fun margarita-inspired treatments. Cheers!</p>
      <p>The swim-up suites will probably be the most popular room category – Karisma says they are the first hotel  group to introduce swim-up suites.  (I have stayed in swim-up suites at other resorts in the past, and I can assure you – they are a decadent delight.)</p>
      <p>Tamara Baldanza-Dekker, Chief Marketing Officer of Margaritaville, said, “With an unparalleled level of personalized service, unique amenities and a mix of fun and relaxation around every palm tree, we can’t wait to give our guests a new way to vacation in Margaritaville.”   </p>
      <p>Margaritaville Island Reserve by Karisma Riviera Cancún will offer nine styles of guestrooms and suites reflecting an upscale coastal design, with direct access to the main swimming pools. All accommodations open to a balcony complete with Adirondack chairs or daybeds, overlooking either the pools, gardens or Caribbean Sea. Influenced by the colors of the sea, sand and sky, accommodations have a “no worries” tropical vibe with custom maritime-inspired furnishings and authentic Mexican touches, while still providing all the expected modern conveniences, such as smart TVs and Wi-Fi. “You just fly into Cancun and the resort is about 40 minutes from the airport. We provide airport pickup in brand new full-size SUVs,” said Ms. Poling.</p>
      <p>  Highlights of the food and beverage options include:</p>
      <p>·        Homemade Italian cuisine served with wine from an extensive <b><i>Wine Spectator-</i></b>awarded wine list at <i>Frank &amp; Lola’s</i></p>
      <p>·        <i>Rita’s Taco House, </i>serving traditional Mexican fare<i> </i>with phenomenal ocean views</p>
      <p>·        Open-air Caribbean-inspired <i>Beach House</i></p>
      <p>·        <i>Stranded on a Sand Bar Swim-Up Bar</i> complete with hanging beds; <i>Blended</i>, where guests can whip up their favorite fresh fruit on a bike blender. Plus, Margaritaville’s signature concepts, <i>License to Chill</i> <i>Bar</i> and <i>Five o’Clock Somewhere Bar</i></p>

        <b>A New Experience With Ambassadors</b>
      </p>
      <p>Exclusive to Margaritaville Island Reserve, the guest experience at the new Riviera Cancún property will be kept casual yet customized thanks to a team of Island Ambassadors who are passionate about Margaritaville, the destination, and ensuring every guest’s vacation is entertaining and memorable. A concierge, vacation-planner, and a catalyst for fun rolled into one, these Ambassadors are on-call to answer questions, take requests, and to make guests smile throughout their stay – and then snap a photo, so the moment in paradise is never forgotten. “Rather than having a concierge in the lobby, we will have Ambassadors throughout the property so that you can talk to someone at any moment and obtain their recommendations. These floating ambassadors obviate waiting in line in the lobby – instead, they are readily accessible to you to personalize and optimize your experience,” said Ms. Poling. </p>
      <p>Margaritaville Island Reserve by Karisma Riviera Cancún will also offer a breathtaking backdrop for weddings and private events. Whether it is a group gathering, a yearly family reunion, a corporate retreat, friends’ getaway or a social club get-together, the resort combines Margaritaville’s sense of fun and escapism with an expert team of event planners dedicated to creating unforgettable events in paradise for up to 140 people. Premium facilities include a beachfront gazebo and signature Sky Wedding location with stunning 360-degree views from the private rooftop terrace, as well as restaurants, specialty bars, and dynamic conference spaces to meet, share and celebrate.</p>
      <p>For younger guests, the resort will have a Parakeets Kid’s Club with supervised daily activities for children 4-12 years old, including cooking classes, mad lab experiments, piñata making, pajama parties and movie nights.</p>
      <p>So, it seems that no matter your age, you can be a kid at heart at Margaritaville. Sign me up for one of those mad lab experiments! </p>
