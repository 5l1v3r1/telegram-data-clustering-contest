      <p>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — Zimbabwean banks on Tuesday began issuing new notes and coins aimed at easing severe cash shortages, but they are severely limiting the amounts that people can withdraw.</p>
      <p>“What can I do with such a pittance?” asked Shorai Tomu after withdrawing the equivalent of about $5. “It can only buy five loaves of bread.”</p>
      <p>The new notes are the latest currency reform in the troubled southern African country’s constantly changing, and at times confusing, monetary framework.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe now has the <a href="https://apnews.com/1ce81eed4b064a529163513931b30178">world’s second highest inflation</a> after Venezuela, according to International Monetary Fund figures. With prices rising faster than at any point in a decade amid rapid devaluation of the local currency, cash is king.</p>
      <p>In 2009, Zimbabwe’s government abandoned the local currency amid hyperinflation and adopted a multi-currency system dominated by the dollar. In June the government outlawed the use of foreign currencies, opting for a local currency mainly consisting of electronic and mobile money and a trickle of bank notes.</p>
      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa has struggled to fulfill promises to improve the economy two years after taking office following the resignation of the late Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>Many retailers and service providers now demand payments in cash only. Others, including street vendors, charge a higher price for goods paid for using mobile money or bank cards.</p>
      <p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe says it will “drip feed” ZW$1 billion in the new small notes and coins to manage the cash shortages. The highest denomination is ZW$5. The notes are strikingly similar in design to the old ones.</p>
      <p>“It is just like the old money, and like the old money it can’t buy anything of value,” said 81-year-old Filbert Sibanda after withdrawing his monthly pension, enough to buy a kilogram of beef.</p>
      <p>Other customers left disgruntled.</p>
      <p>“This is not an improvement,” said Wicknell Magidha, waving a few new notes and a plastic bag filled with coins. “These coins are just too heavy.”</p>
      <p>People trooped out of one bank carrying similar bags of coins, shaking their heads. Others in line laughed.</p>
      <p>Magidha said the small bills and coins leave him with another headache, that of haggling with traders who usually reject them.</p>
      <p>“The same item can have three different prices: one for cash, one for mobile money and another one for those paying using small coins,” Magidha said. “The government should just print higher denominations to match this inflation.”</p>
