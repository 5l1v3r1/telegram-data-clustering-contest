      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a>’s brand-new streaming service <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> Plus may be a victim of its own success.</p>
      <p>The $7-a-month service offering an array of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> classics and new shows suffered some technical difficulties hours after launching at 3 a.m. E.T. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The problems started a little before 7 a.m., according to downdetector.com, a website that tracks outages. It received more than 8,000 reports of difficulties, mostly with video streaming. Others reported problems logging in. The reports peaked around 9 a.m. and had dwindled by 1 p.m.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> said it was working to resolve the issue after consumer demand exceeded its expectations, said spokeswoman Karen Hobson. The company did not say what caused the problem.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> has invested billions in its streaming service, beginning with the purchase of a stake in streaming technology company BAMTech in 2016, which it later increased to a majority stake. In 2018 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/disney/">Disney</a> launched ESPN Plus using technology from BAMTech. That service now has 3.5 million subscribers.</p>
