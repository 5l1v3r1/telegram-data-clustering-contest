      <h3>OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANK</h3>
      <p>Twitter lit up this past weekend thanks to a November 7 tweet from Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson when he tweeted:</p>
      <blockquote>“The @AppleCard is such a f**king sexist program. My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple’s black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work. Even when she pays off her ridiculously low limit in full, the card won’t approve any spending until the next billing period. Women apparently aren’t good credit risks even when they pay off the f**king balance in advance and in full.”</blockquote>
      <p>Hansson goes on to excoriate Apple’s customer support, saying “The customer service experience is infuriating too. They’re quick to respond, but nobody is authorized to discuss the credit assessment process. Very nice, courteous people representing an utterly broken and reprehensible system. The first person was like “I don’t know why, but I swear we’re not discriminating, it’s just the algorithm.”</p>
      <p>Later in the thread he does report that, ultimately, his wife’s credit limit was changed to match his limit.</p>
      <h3>The Woz Jumps On It...</h3>
      <p>Adding fuel to the fire, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak shared his thoughts on the matter with this November 9 tweet:</p>
      <blockquote>“The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.”</blockquote>
      <p>Wozniak went on to call for government intervention in the matter, citing “excessive corporate reliance on mysterious technology” according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-10/apple-co-founder-says-goldman-s-apple-card-algo-discriminates">report</a> from Bloomberg. According to Wozniak, “These sorts of unfairnesses bother me and go against the principle of truth. We don’t have transparency on how these companies set these things up and operate.”</p>
      <h3>...And A Regulator Responds</h3>
      <p>By the evening of November 10, New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) had contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card. According to an agency spokesperson:</p>
      <blockquote>“The department will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex. Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.”</blockquote>
      <p>In a tweet, the DFS spokesperson asked consumers who believe they have victims of discrimination to contact the agency directly.</p>
      <h3>Three Crucial Questions in the Apple Card Sexism Scandal</h3>
      <p>Quite a turn of events for Apple in the course of about one week.</p>
      <p>Barely a week ago, Apple was being heralded for launching the most successful credit card ever, with $10 billion in credit already extended.</p>
      <p>And now it faces charges of being sexist.</p>
      <p>For all the press and attention this has received, there are a number of important questions that are getting glossed over.</p>
      <h3>1) Is This How Regulatory Action Should Be Taken?</h3>
      <p>If I’m getting the timeline right, it was less than 48 hours from when Hansson first tweeted to when New York’s DFS announced it was launching a probe.</p>
      <p>It’s possible, of course, that plenty of complaints had already been filed, and Hansson’s or Wozniak’s tweet was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. But that seems highly unlikely or it would’ve made the news because the DFS would’ve announced it long ago.</p>
      <p>If there were no (or few) prior complaints, however, should regulatory agencies be launching probes because of the accusations of two people?</p>
      <h3>2) If There Was Discrimination, Who’s to Blame?</h3>
      <p>It may be helpful to remember that neither Apple nor Goldman Sachs had much motive to discriminate against women.</p>
      <p>The higher the credit limit Hansson’s and Wozniak’s wife have, the more they can spend, which translates into more revenue for Apple and Goldman Sachs.</p>
      <p>The Twitter mob (and Bloomberg article) focused the blame for the alleged discrimination on the “algorithm.”</p>
      <p>Two points to consider here.</p>
      <p>First, the “algorithm” might not be the culprit here. Unlike some other credit cards in the market, the Apple Card is an individual card–there is no joint account.</p>
      <p>Hansson’s tweet indicated that he and his wife file joint tax returns, but, for better or worse, that doesn’t matter to Apple’s credit card application. Without knowing what information Hansson and his wife (and Wozniak and his wife, for that matter) entered into their respective applications, it’s impossible to determine if the algorithm was biased.</p>
      <p>Second, there’s a question of whose algorithm it is. Apple’s or Goldman Sachs’? The Bloomberg article implies that it’s “Goldman’s Apple Card algorithm.”</p>
      <p>But Apple advertises that the card was “created by Apple, not a bank.”</p>
      <p>If the algorithm really is from Goldman Sachs, would that make Apple’s advertising false? Maybe a regulatory agency should look into that (but alas, I’m not high-profile enough to get a probe launched).</p>
      <h3>3) Should Card Issuers Be Forced to Make Their Underwriting Details Public?</h3>
      <p>Bloomberg reported that, in an interview, Wozniak said “We don’t have transparency on how these companies set these things up and operate.”</p>
      <p>That’s precious coming from the guy whose firm created proprietary technologies that were sold for premium prices, which (it could be argued) caused disparate impact in lower-income consumers’ ability to purchase those products.</p>
      <p>The calls for transparency in algorithms ignore the fact that these algorithms are assets of the companies that own them.</p>
      <p>While there is a responsibility on the part of these companies to prove that the algorithms don’t result in disparate impact (or some other form of discrimination), that’s very different from having transparency into the inner workings of the algorithm itself.</p>
      <p>It’s funny (sad) how many people say they hate statistics and math but all of a sudden become experts in data science and algorithms.</p>
      <h3>Apple Card Realities</h3>
      <p>Perhaps lost in the discussion are some operational issues facing Apple and its new credit card.</p>
      <p>There’s little dispute that the application process is the slickest in the industry. But from there, the customer experience isn’t necessarily flaw-free.</p>
      <p>As Hansson mentioned in his tweet, even when his wife pays off her credit limit in full, the card won’t approve any spending until the next billing period.</p>
      <p>In addition, Apple Insider <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/01/apple-card-users-having-problems-with-making-payments">reported</a> that some cardholders were having trouble making payments through the Wallet app, with some accidentally making multiple payments. According to the article, “One user reports trying to pay a balance and being given the message the amount is ‘too high,’ and some actually attempt the payment but do not get a verification of the payment itself.”</p>
      <p>Regardless of how the sexist accusations are resolved, Apple (and Goldman Sachs?) have some work to do on the Apple Card.</p>
