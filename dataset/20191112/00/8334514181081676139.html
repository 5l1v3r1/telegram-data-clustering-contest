      <p>(Reuters) - Taiwanese electronic component company Yageo Corp plans to acquire U.S. rival Kemet Corp in a $1.8 billion deal aimed at expanding its global footprint, the two companies said.</p>
      <p>Yageo will offer $27.20 per Kemet share, representing an 18% premium to Monday’s closing share price.</p>
      <p>“The integration will enhance our ability to serve customers in consumer electronics as well as in the high-end automotive, industrial, aerospace, telecom and medical sectors”, Yageo Chief Executive Officer Pierre Chen said.</p>
      <p>Yageo’s global footprint would increase with additional operations in North America, Europe and Asia, the companies said in a joint statement.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2020 and would result in combined annual revenues of about $3 billion, the companies said.</p>
      <p>It has been approved by the boards of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.</p>
      <p>Yageo said it intends to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and committed financing.</p>
