      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Law enforcement officials trying to bolster safety on Nevada’s roadways ahead of the upcoming holiday season are warning that impaired drivers continue to be a contributing factor in the majority of fatal traffic crashes in the state.</p>
      <p>The Nevada Department of Public Safety says 55.4% of the 893 fatal crashes in Nevada were caused by a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or a combination of both over the three-year period from 2016 to 2018. They accounted for 55.9% of the state’s 967 roadway deaths during that span.</p>
      <p>Department spokesman Andrew Bennett says that’s a total of 494 fatal crashes over three years involving an impaired substance accounting for 540 deaths. He told the Las Vegas Review-Journal , “That’s 540 dreams lost and unfulfilled.”</p>
