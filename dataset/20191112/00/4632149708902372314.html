      <h1>All-women gang uses child to steal phones</h1>

      <p>A seven to eight all-women attention diversion gang entered a mobile showroom on 8th mile at Hessarghatta Main Road and managed to distract the employees, to steal four mobile phones. <br/><br/>The gang had allegedly trained a 10-year-old girl child, who was accompanying them, to steal the mobiles. The girl looked in the cash counter, but did not find any money, so she stole four new mobile phones worth Rs. 95,000 and hid it in a bag she was carrying. The incident came to light only after the employees went through the CCTV footage. <br/><br/>Dileep Nagaraju, a resident of Shanthinagar and an employee of the store, file a complaint with the police on Thursday. The incident had taken place on Wednesday around 2 pm. Dileep said that he was at the shop when around seven to eight women walked in together. “They asked us to show them mobile phones and as some of them were busy checking out the new models we were showing them, a few were standing near the cash counter. Since there were so many of them, we did not notice the ones, who were standing near the cash counter,” he said.</p>

      <p>At the end of the working day, the employees were locking up the drawers and found that they were missing four mobiles that were kept for demo. Then they went through the CCTV footage. Police said that the women entered the showroom along with three children, including a 10-year-old girl. “Two women were holding two young children and others were looking around and trying to divert the attention of the staff. The girl seems to have been trained to steal,” said the police. <br/><br/><br/>An officer said, “The gang seemed to have tried to steal from the neighbouring shops and when they entered the showroom, the owner of a neighbouring shop alerted them about it. The staff were focusing on the adults and were asking them to leave when the little girl sneaked inside and stole the mobile phones.” He added that most gangs use children to steal items so that if they are caught in the act they themselves can beat the children in front of them and escape as people would go easy on children.</p>
