      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The Honolulu City Council and Mayor Kirk Caldwell have approved a $214 million spending bill for a city rail project.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday that the bill approves an annual maximum of $26 million toward the $9.2 billion project for rail service from East Kapolei to Ala Moana.</p>
      <p>The bill is expected to be funded through the sale of bonds that would be repaid from the general fund, which primarily includes revenue from property taxes.</p>
      <p>The council passed the measure by a 5-2 vote Wednesday and Caldwell signed the bill Thursday.</p>
      <p>Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation officials say their projections did not show a need for money from the city’s general fund.</p>
