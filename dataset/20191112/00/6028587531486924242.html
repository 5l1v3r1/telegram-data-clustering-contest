      <p>2019 may well be a record-setting year for the holiday shopping season, and already, many retailers have announced some pretty major deals. And, as is often the case, TVs are set to be one of the biggest and most important items for the season. Sales of HDTVs exploded this time last year, and this year will likely be no different. With so much money to be made, and confidence levels being so high, this could be a record-breaking year for TV sales. The biggest retailers have already announced huge sales, unveiling a ton of striking holiday deals well before Black Friday and Cyber Monday. We've gone through the listings, to find some of the best deals on TVs around. We'll compare and contrast the three main retailers to help you determine who has the best pre-Black Friday deals on HDTVs.</p>
      <h3>55-inch TVs</h3>
      <p>Let's take a look at the most popular size of TVs on the market. We'll be looking at the main types of HDTVs from Best Buy, Walmart and Amazon side-by-side to help you make up your mind which one's best for you.</p>
      <h4>Insignia 55" Class - LED (Best Buy)</h4>

      <p><b>List Price:</b> $329.99</p>

      <p>Best Buy has the most extensive deals on home electronics of any tech retailers this holiday season. Their listings of HDTVs under $500 are truly extensive.</p>
      <p>If this Best Buy exclusive deal on the Insignia 55" Class LED is any indication, they're a good place to look for HDTVs under $500. The Insignia 55" Class LED gives you above-HD quality and cutting-edge LED brightness without breaking the bank.</p>

      <p><b>Savings:</b> $160</p>
      <p>Best Buy might be a great spot for low, low prices on TVs, but Walmart is truly delivering the savings. They've got so many sales on the best-quality electronics for the lowest possible prices it's a little ridiculous.</p>
      <p>Take the Sceptre 55" Class 4K Ultra HD. The Sceptre also offers above-HD quality, supporting up to 2160p resolution, going above and beyond even what your Blu-Rays might require. With over 8 million pixels, you won't believe the stunning color and lifelike fluidity of motion as your favorite movies, TV series, sporting events and video games play out, larger than life in your own living room.</p>

      <p>For the ardent cinephile or hardcore gamer, a 75-inch TV is the Cadillac of home viewing. It's a little unbelievable we can watch movies and TV in such startlingly crisp color and rich detail in the comfort of our own home. It's one of the greatest things about living in the future.</p>

That’s thanks to the TV’s built-in a7 Gen 2 Intelligent Processor, which can upscale even older content to look great. The TV supports standards like Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and considering its size, you’ll essentially get a cinema-like experience in your living room.</p>
      <p>The TV normally comes at $1,799.99, but from Amazon you can get it for an impressive $1,496.99.</p>

      <p>The TV is normally a hefty $2,998, but it’s now available for an impressive $1,798. That’s an incredible $1,200 off its normal price.</p>
