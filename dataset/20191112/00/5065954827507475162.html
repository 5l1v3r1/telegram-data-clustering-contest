      <p>FILIPINO seafarers on board ships passing though the Strait of Hormuz will no longer get any additional pay and benefits for passing high-risk zones.</p>
      <p>This after the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) on Monday issued Memorandum Circular 12, series of 2019 removing the area’s risk-zone status.</p>
      <p>“Designation 5 of the Strait of Hormuz as an ‘IBF [International Bargaining Forum] Temporary Extended Risk Zone’ is hereby withdrawn effective 19 October 2019,” POEA said.</p>
      <p>In its Governing Board Resolution 07, Series of 2018, POEA imposed premium pay for Filipino seafarers passing through such high-risk zones.</p>
      <p>The benefits include bonus pay, doubled compensation for death and disability, and the right of workers to refuse sailing and be repatriated at company’s cost.</p>
      <p>The POEA included the Strait of Hormuz on its list of high-risk zones in September 2019, upon consultations with the Maritime Industry Tripartite Council due to the identified risks there on September 24.</p>
      <p>Earlier that month, 12 Filipino seafarers were detained by Iranian authorities for allegedly engaging in fuel smuggling. </p>
