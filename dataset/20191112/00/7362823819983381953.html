      <p>Andrew Collins' attorney, Craig Silverman, announced the settlement on Monday, according to <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-pays-300k-to-united-airlines-pilot-after-indecent-exposure-arrest-at-dia-hotel">Denver’s KMGH-TV</a>.</p>

      <p>Collins was arrested in September 2018 after being accused of standing naked in front of his 10th-floor hotel window overlooking the Denver International Airport terminal. He pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>A judge dismissed the misdemeanor charge in March, but the incident led to a six-month suspension from United Airlines for Collins, from Leesburg, Va.</p>
      <p>Silverman has said that Collins didn't know that people could see him when he partially opened the curtains of his hotel room.</p>
      <p>Despite returning to his job, Collins told <a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/11/denver-will-pay-300000-to-pilot-wrongfully-arrested-for-being-naked-in-dia-hotel/">Fox 31</a> he is still dealing with the consequences of the charges.</p>
