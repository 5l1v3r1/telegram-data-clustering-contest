      <p>Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on November 12 targeted the Narendra Modi-led NDA government over the economic situation of the country, saying the government is not at all paying attention to the economy.</p>
      <p>"Industrial output contracts for second straight month, down 4.3 per cent in Sept, which is weakest performance in nearly 8 years due to sluggishness across a number of sectors including manufacturing," Gehlot said.</p>
      <p>"It is yet another sign of #EconomicSlowdown but NDA is not at all paying attention to economy," he tweeted.</p>
