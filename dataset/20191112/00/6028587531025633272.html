      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party claims it was hit with a “large and sophisticated” cyberattack, a month to the day ahead of the U.K. election on December 12.Little information was forthcoming from Labour, though a spokesperson said in a statement that the attack was repelled and they didn’t believe any data had been lost.</p>
      <p>“We took swift action and these attempts failed due to our robust security systems. The integrity of all our platforms was maintained and we are confident that no data breach occurred,” the spokesperson added.</p>
      <p>“Our security procedures have slowed down some of our campaign activities, but these were restored this morning and we are back up to full speed. We have reported the matter to the National Cyber Security Centre. </p>
      <p>“Labour is out campaigning hard both on and offline for a Labour government that will bring the real change our country needs.”</p>
      <p>The NCSC, which is part of the U.K. intelligence agency GCHQ, had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.</p>
      <p>Fears of foreign interference in the crucial vote that could resolve the Brexit crisis have abounded since the vote was called earlier this month. Political parties in the United States and Europe have been successful hacked, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/09/13/hacker-guccifer-2-0-dnc-hacker-london-slags-tech-companies/">notably in the case of the alleged Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee</a>, but a British political party’s computer systems have not yet been breached by digital attackers.</p>
      <p>The news landed on the day former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50382668"><i>BBC</i></a> it was “shameful” the U.K. wouldn’t be releasing a report on Russian interference in U.K. politics. That report, written by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, is known to include allegations of spying, subversion and interference in both the Brexit vote and the 2017 general election.</p>
