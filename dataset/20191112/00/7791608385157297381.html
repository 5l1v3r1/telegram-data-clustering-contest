      <h1>Jeff Koons’ Paris Sculpture Gets Defaced And Compared To A Bunch Of Anuses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Thanussha Priyah</a></address>
      <p><b>Jeff Koons’ <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/406594/Jeff-Koons-Is-Saddened-His-Tulips-Have-Been-Causing-Distress-In-France/">disputed</a></b> <i>Bouquet of Tulips</i> in Paris was marred with a red graffiti tag despite being recently installed. A rogue had sprayed “11 Trous du c…” on the statue, roughly translating to mean “11 holes of the butt…,” and now many cannot unsee the resemblance. <br/><b>Koons previously gifted</b> the 33-ton sculpture to Paris in the wake of the 2015 terror attacks at Bataclan concert hall, which left 130 people dead. The French was not too pleased with the installation, calling it “product placement” and a hindrance, as it would have blocked views of the Eiffel Tower at its formerly-proposed location. <br/><b>Jérôme de Noirmont,</b> the leader of the company that produced Koons’ sculpture, first spotted the mark and notified city officials of the act on Thursday morning. However, he shared with <i><a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/vandal-tagged-jeff-koonss-controversial-paris-sculpture-11-holes-butt-1699902?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">artnet News</a></i> that he did not believe the 15-centimeter (six-inch) inscription on the work leveled up to a case of vandalism, claiming that the French press was just “exaggerating.” <br/><b>Inspired by Pablo</b> Picasso’s 1958 lithograph, the sculpture depicts 11 balloons held by a hand, mirroring the way the Statue of Liberty holds her torch, to symbolize the affinity between France and the US. The balloons are meant to represent "remembrance, optimism, and healing,” according to Koons. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>This isn’t the first</b> time the work has been tied to anuses. Last week, philosopher Yves Michuad wrote in French daily magazine <i><a href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/culture/20191005.OBS19360/les-tulipes-de-koons-onze-anus-colores-montes-sur-tiges.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">L’Obs</a></i> that the 39-foot-tall looked like, “11 colored anus mounted on stems,” resulting in the nickname, “a bouquet of ‘culipes,’” which more or less means “ass-tulips.” <br/><b>However, the recent</b> graffiti on the work has led to an investigation and the mark has since been removed, per <i><a href="https://designtaxi.com/www.leparisien.fr/paris-75/paris-qui-a-tague-les-tulipes-de-jeff-koons-08-11-2019-8189511.php?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Le Parisien</a></i>. The vandal has yet to be identified.</p>
