      <p>The manic holiday shopping season is a couple of weeks away and, in typical fashion, the big retailers have given us an early look at what deals will be available.If you’re looking to pick up some Black Friday tech then keep an eye on my buying guides over the next couple of weeks as I round-up the best deals and explain what is - or isn’t - good value. </p>
      <p>
        <i>First up is Best Buy, which looks like it will have some good deals on unlocked Android phones this year. </i>
      </p>
      <p>Best Buy is advertising “up to” <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/iphone-11-pro-iphone-11-pro-max">$500 off</a> the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro with a 24-month contract, which start at $199 and $499 respectively. </p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 and 4 XL are <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/mobile-cell-phones/mobile-phones-with-plans/pcmcat209400050001.c?id=pcmcat209400050001&amp;qp=modelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Google%20Pixel%204%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Google%20Pixel%204%20XL">$400 off</a> with a contract, whilst Samsung’s flagship range has upwards of <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/mobile-cell-phones/mobile-phones-with-plans/pcmcat209400050001.c?id=pcmcat209400050001&amp;qp=modelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20Note10%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20Note10%2B%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20Note10%2B%205G%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20S10%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20S10%205G%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20S10%2B%5Emodelfamily_facet%3DModel%20Family~Samsung%20Galaxy%20S10e">$500 off</a>, or contract offers at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-store/samsung-galaxy-s10/pcmcat1549040874329.c?id=pcmcat1549040874329">$5 a month</a> with up to $300 off the upfront cost. </p>
      <p>The exact contract details haven’t been released yet, but as has been the case in previous years, that deal likely is a mix of a discounted monthly cost, reduced up-front cost and some additional money off for trading in your old phone. Do check the small print though, because some 'deals' on Best Buy’s website will tie you to an eye-watering 30 month contract. </p>
      <p>If, however, you’re looking for a real bargain then unlocked phones might be your best bet... </p>
      <p>The very capable Pixel 3A XL, which is arguably better value for money than the Pixel 3, is <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/unlocked-pixel-3a">$100 off,</a> bringing the price down to $249. There’s also a straight <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/unlocked-google-pixel-4?irclickid=yKg1zr0lyxyOR3k0MdV3iVCmUkn1zX0p3200Ug0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;ref=198&amp;loc=yKg1zr0lyxyOR3k0MdV3iVCmUkn1zX0p3200Ug0&amp;acampID=648818">$200 off </a>an unlocked Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL. </p>
      <p>Reprising last year’s deal, all of Samsung’s current flagship lineup - the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s10-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-prism-prism-black/6323528.p?skuId=6323528">S10</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s10-with-128gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-prism-white/6323857.p?skuId=6323857">S10+</a> and the <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-note10-with-256gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-aura-glow/6359979.p?skuId=6359979">Note 10+</a> are all $200 off. There’s an additional $100 discount if you take up a contract. As ever, read the fine print before you enter into any sort of agreement because they’re often more costly over the course of the contract than buying it upfront. </p>
      <p>As far as I can see there aren’t any deals for other recently released Android phones like the dual-screen LG G8x or Sony Xperia 1 - both excellent phones in their own right. What you’ll notice is that for devices that aren’t from the top-tier manufacturers - iPhones, Galaxys and Pixels - the big retailers won’t handover ad space in their Black Friday catalogues for something that might not sell well. It’s a bit feast and famine. The latest - household name - devices get prominence and the mega cheap prepaid phones get a look-in too. </p>
      <p>With that said, there <i>will </i>be discounts for these other devices - it just requires a bit of research. I’ll be updating my guides when those deals go live. </p>
