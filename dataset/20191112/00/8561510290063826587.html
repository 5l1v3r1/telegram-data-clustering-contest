      <h1>UK Teen Needed Life Support After Vaping for Just Five Months</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>When British teen Ewan Fisher was 16 years old, he traded in his cigarette-smoking habit for vaping because he “thought it would be healthier,” the now-19-year-old recently <a href="https://www.countypress.co.uk/news/national/18030226.teenager-almost-died-warns-others-not-vape/">told <i>The Press Association</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>But instead of seeing his health improve, Fisher soon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/12/uk-teenager-needed-life-support-over-vaping-linked-disease">found himself with</a> a fever, a persistent cough, and difficulty breathing that eventually landed him in the hospital with serious respiratory failure.</p>
      <p>“I was vaping for about four or five months before I got ill,” he told the <i>PA</i>, later adding, “I ended up in intensive care and needed two forms of life support. I almost died.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, the doctors who treated Fisher published a <a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2019/10/21/archdischild-2019-317889">case study</a> on him in the the journal <i>Archives of Disease in Childhood</i>.</p>
      <p>According to the paper, the teen was treated for hypersensitivity pneumonitis — essentially, his lung tissue became inflamed when he used e-cigarettes because he was allergic to something he was vaping.</p>
      <p>“The evidence we gathered showed that it was that (vaping) that was to blame,” Jayesh Mahendra Bhatt, one of the study’s authors, <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/teen-lung-failure-in-the-uk-lined-to-vaping-4887725-Nov2019/">told the <i>PA</i></a>. “I know at least one colleague who has seen a similar case.”</p>
      <p>Three years later, Fisher told the <i>PA</i> his health is still only at 80 percent of what it was before he began vaping. And while his <a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/cdc-knows-causing-vape-lung">reaction to e-cigarettes</a> clearly wasn’t the norm, it provides two valuable “learning points” for health officials, according to the case study’s authors.</p>
      <p>“The first is always to consider a reaction to e-cigarettes in someone presenting with an atypical respiratory illness,” the authors wrote. “The second is that we consider e-cigarettes as ‘much safer than tobacco’ at our peril.”</p>
