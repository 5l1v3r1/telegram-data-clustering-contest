      <h1>Black Friday holiday warning as 'deals' last year found to cost people more</h1>
      <h2>Black Friday isn't just about cheap tellies, with more and more travel companies now getting in on the action - but how far can you really trust the discounts on offer?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Brits are being warned to tread carefully on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> after travel firms were found to be selling last year's deals for more than they would have cosy later on.</p>
      <p>Consumer group Which? - who conducted the research  - said some of the deals advertised as part of the annual sales bonanza "aren't always what they appear to be".</p>
      <p>Which? Travel  editor Rory Boland said: "Nothing beats the feeling of saving hundreds on your next holiday, but that feeling can quickly turn to anger when you discover it would have been cheaper if you'd waited to book.</p>
      <p>"Our research reveals that Black Friday travel deals aren't always what they appear to be. Avoid disappointment by comparing prices and approach attention-grabbing saving claims with scepticism."</p>

      <p>Which? looked into promotions by major airlines and travel firms on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> in 2018 - which fell on November 23 - and checked what prices were two weeks later.</p>
      <p>Ryanair advertised a 25% discount on one million seats purchased by midnight, but none of the flights Which? included in its study were more expensive if booked on December 7.</p>
      <p>EasyJet's Black Friday sale claimed travellers could save £50 on 60,000 city breaks, although eight of 21 trips analysed were cheaper after a fortnight.</p>
      <p>The research found a three-night break from London Luton to Barcelona cost 13% less if holidaymakers waited to book until two weeks after Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Airline Norwegian advertised discounts of "up to 30% off short-haul fares and 15% off long-haul fares", but the biggest saving found by Which? was just 10%.</p>

      <p>In response, Norwegian said the figures used in its promotion were based on fares excluding taxes and charges, but Which? claimed this was not clear when viewing the carrier's website.</p>
      <p>Travel firm Tui offered discount codes worth £100 or £150 off selected bookings, but they did not work on two of the five holidays Which? analysed.</p>
      <p>This year's Black Friday falls on November 29.</p>
