      <p>To a man, the New Orleans Pelicans believe their 2-8 record after ten games is not indicative of their talent. Alvin Gentry expressed this belief during the media availability period at practice a day after another home loss, this time to the Houston Rockets. J.J. Redick said the same immediately following the game. “I think we are a better basketball team than 2-8.”</p>
      <p>In the locker room and the Smoothie King Arena seats, there is still a sense of hope the team can still accomplish the season’s goals and live up to the offseason expectations. Most fans would agree judging by the attendance (16,695) on a cold Monday night. Redick even used a question to define the vibes in the room and the team’s eventual direction after the game.</p>
      <p>“Yea for sure, that’s optimism. That’s what optimism is. There is a hope that things start going your way. That you start feeling comfortable and clicking and get into a rhythm as a team.”</p>
      <p>That rhythm has yet to come. The Pelicans are on pace for only 22 wins this season. The injury report gets most of the blame. Even short-handed Redick sees the team’s potential but he also realizes what is lacking.</p>
      <p>Redick said, “I think it’s just a level of consistency throughout a game. It’s a lot of spurts. Right now if we can control the things we can control a little bit better [such as] defensive rebounding, turnovers, fouling. We are giving up a large chunk of points just on that stuff and some of that is figuring out the system and a lot of new guys, a lot of new lineups, there are reasons behind that other than ‘we’re not just playing bad basketball’, there are reasons behind that and hopefully as this season progresses we will get more comfortable. If we can control that, we will give ourselves a better chance to win.”</p>
      <p>Josh Hart agreed, saying “I think we need to work on our execution. I thought we were good for a good amount of the game. We got to make sure we do that for a full 48 minutes. It’s all correctable mistakes. We can do it. We get a film session in and do the right kind of things. We can kind of see what we are doing, see what mistakes we are making, and correct them.”</p>
      <p>Alvin Gentry had a similar diagnosis. Just by being better at executing the plays and not making simple mistakes would go a long way to earning a few more wins.</p>
      <p>Gentry said after the second loss to the Rockets this season, “ I thought we did a good job, but we shoot our self in the foot again. We walk in at halftime and we’ve got 12 turnovers or whatever it was and we talked about having 14 turnovers for the game. We had eight in the first quarter. So all that does is put you behind the eight-ball. We just got to start valuing the basketball and we got to stop making the bad turnover.”</p>
      <p>There is understanding but also a certain level of frustrations with the sloppy, pressing play.</p>
      <p>“I understand if we’re trying to make the correct play, but we’re turning it over making bad decisions...We have eight turnovers the first quarter – that’s eight opportunities we don’t get to score and against (Houston), you’ve got to be able to score.”</p>
      <p>The Pelicans are making scores look respectable in garbage time but defense throughout the game has been suspect. The same problems popped up in the home game against Houston. Still, Jrue Holiday is avoiding any excuses. Giving up is not an option even amid a very slow start to the season for himself and the team.</p>
      <p>Holiday said he had to “just keep pushing. I feel that everybody just goes through slumps. Not shooting efficiently, missing easy buckets to the rim. My (three-point) shots not falling, but making other things happen. I know when I’m out there it’s not just form. I can produce in other ways.”</p>
      <p>Holiday is confident he will find his form. Gentry is sure that Holiday’s confidence will not waver even if his shot is not falling. That same confidence is extended to the rest of the team. Eventually, the hard work will pay off, or so the team hopes.</p>
      <p>Holiday addressed those concerns stating, “We are more of a younger team but we have guys in here who have been in similar situations with their previous team. I think just being positive day in and day out, bringing that positive energy, we will continue to keep our spirits up. Every day with the coaches, with me and guys that have been here, we’ve been in situations like this before. Just stay positive, stay happy. I feel like sometimes when you get sad or down on yourself, it seeps into everything else you do. We still play basketball at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>Gentry sang that same positive blue-collar tune, saying “We just got to continue to work. Like I said, long, long season. We can’t feel sorry for ourselves. We’ve just got to find a way to start grinding these things out and put ourselves in a position where we have an opportunity to win the game at the end, but we can’t do it if we continue to give up.”</p>
      <p>That last phrase might worry the segment of the fanbase that wants a new coach. It was a verbal slip that might cost him more with the fanbase than that absent-minded entering the court technical foul call. However, the team has not given up yet. There are still 72 games to be played. Zion Williamson has yet to play a game. All of the long term goals, all of those lofty expectations from the offseason are still possible going forward.</p>
      <p>It all crumbles should the team ‘give up’ or start making excuses. Gentry knows its a tough balance to remain positive as the losses mount. It is even easier when star players are missing games.</p>
      <p>“Yeah. That’s the thing is that we can’t – we’re never going to start using who’s out and who’s not playing as an excuse. We’ve got all of these guys, we put depth on our team and so next man up has to play and the next man up has to play well and if he has to elevate his game. All of them have to elevate their game when you have your leading scorer out. Brandon (Ingram) has given us 25 points a night. One guy’s not going to step in and make that up. We’ve got to have everybody elevate their game to the point where we can collectively make up for not having him be out here tonight.”</p>
      <p>There is still a belief that positive energy and hard work will elevate the Pelicans up the standings and into playoff contention. Redick knows it will be tough but reinforcements are on the way.</p>
      <p>“No one is more frustrated by losing than me. I’m trying to keep a positive mindset and hope that one, we will start playing better and two, that Zion will be healthy and will make an impact for us.”</p>
