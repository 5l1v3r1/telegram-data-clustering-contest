      <h1>Siemens CEO Denies Slamming “Pot Smoking” Elon Musk</h1>

      <h3>Someone’s Jelly</h3>
      <p>It seems even billionaire CEOs like to throw the occasional shade via Twitter — and then deny it when confronted.</p>
      <p>The tea: On October 31, Roland Busch, deputy CEO of German engineering powerhouse Siemens, called SpaceX CEO Elon Musk a “true visionary of our time” in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BuschRo/status/1189944256040972288">tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>Eight days later, Busch’s boss, Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser, published a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeKaeser/status/1192786315143716866">tweet</a> of his own.</p>
      <p>“Amusing opinions in our country: When a German chief executive proactively orients his company toward the future, he is regarded as ‘lofty’ and ‘philosophical,” he wrote in German, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-siemens-tesla/siemens-ceo-deplores-admiration-for-pot-smoker-after-deputy-praised-elon-musk-idUSKBN1XJ0EN"><i>Reuters’</i> translation</a>. “When a pot smoking colleague in the United States talks about Peterchen’s moon ride, he is an admired visionary.”</p>
      <h3>Walking Back</h3>
      <p>The use of the term “visionary,” the mention of the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/what-worries-elon-musk-spacex-moon-base">Moon</a>, and the fact that Musk famously <a href="https://futurism.com/elon-musk-interview-joe-rogan">smoked cannabis</a> during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2018 all suggest that Kaeser was referring to the SpaceX CEO with his tweet.</p>
      <p>But when journalist Axel Höpner asked, Kaeser denied the connection.</p>
      <p>“This is NOT AT ALL about Mr. Busch and/or Mr. Musk,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeKaeser/status/1192825903497302023">tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>Keep telling yourself that.</p>
