      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - When <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">John Cena</a> was offered an audio series about a former college football star chasing an NFL dream, he felt a personal connection to it right away.</p>
      <p>“The project really resonated with me because I played college football and didn’t know what I was going to do after my career ended,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a> said. “When I read the script, I wanted to do it right away.”</p>
      <p>That project, “64th Man,” makes its debut on Audible on Thursday. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a>’s character in the 10-part series works at a grocery store and as a trainer at a gym while pursuing anything to get an NFL tryout.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a> starred on the offensive line at Division III Springfield College, where he was a captain and led the school to its first NCAA postseason appearance in 1998. He pursued a career as a bodybuilder and worked as a limousine driver before training in professional wrestling. He was eventually signed by World Wrestling Entertainment, and of course, became a superstar with the WWE and also a movie star.</p>
      <p>Besides <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a>, the series also features Anna Chlumsky (“Veep”), “Saturday Night Live” alums Jane Curtin and Leslie Jones, and current “SNL” stars Chris Redd and Alex Moffat.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a> said the recording process was similar to doing voiceover work for an animated film or series. However, it is unique because it is sketch comedy for the ears.</p>
      <p>“You are able to encapsulate yourself in a world of imagination. It is being able to imagine things and come to your own conclusions,” he said.</p>
      <p>The series was written by Bryan Tucker, senior writer at “Saturday Night Live”, and Zack Phillips, former head writer at Above Average and its sports site The Kicker.</p>
      <p>Tucker said that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a> was the perfect choice after he saw him showcase his skills on “SNL.”</p>

        <p>“When we remember our favorite moments in sports, often the first things that come to mind are sounds: the announcers, the crowd, the buzzer,” Tucker said. “We hope to use audio to give the listener that same feeling, while also being a funny character comedy,”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-cena/">Cena</a>, who also has the movie “Playing With Fire” in theaters, said the series was “a blast to record and I hope to do it again.</p>
        <p>“Hopefully they can have me back or have another concept that comes at the perfect time.”</p>
