      <p>Wharton management professor Sigal Barsade teaches, “If I smile, you’ll smile, but it’s not just mimicry. (You’ll) actually feel the emotion.” The odds are also very strong that you won’t recognize that this emotion has been passed on to you. Instead, you’ll perceive the emotion as your very own.This process is called emotional contagion, and it means that moods and emotions pass from person to person.</p>
      <p>Let’s stop for a moment and consider how you would behave if you knew you had the flu. Would you sit down in the middle of a meeting? I hope not. Most of us would recognize that we represent a danger to others, and we would isolate ourselves until better.</p>
      <p>You ought to act the same way when experiencing strongly negative moods or emotions: either take action to shift your state into more positive territory, or steer clear of other people.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, much of our society today is working in exactly the opposite manner.</p>
      <p>Many world political leaders are stuck in an incredibly negative cycle: they open every interview and interaction with a stream of negativity, obsessed with what they don’t like. (To avoid spreading negative emotions, I won’t share any examples.)</p>
      <p>In the same manner, much of social media is negative.</p>
      <p>That’s why years ago, I made a pledge to never be negative online. I might hear something that makes my blood boil, but I’m not going to say so online. Instead, I find something positive to say.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We all have a choice...</b>
      </p>
      <p>In virtually every circumstance, you can find a way to begin an interaction in a positive manner, and thus start to spread positive emotions. Even if you sit down in the same room with someone whose beliefs and actions you find offensive, you can still say, “You look very nice today.”</p>
      <p>But I’m not just talking about small interactions: I’m talking about the sum total of all human interactions. Every leader has the choice to spread positive or negative emotions, knowing that whatever emotion they display will spread disproportionally (due to their power over others.)</p>
      <p>You can lead through motivation or fear. You can follow with joy or resentment. No matter how much power or influence you have, your emotions are contagious. We all have the option to decide what we will spread in this world.</p>
      <p>Professor Barsade told Wharton Magazine that, “The biggest feedback I get when I speak to employees about emotional contagion is that this explains so much about what’s going on at work between people and among groups.”</p>
      <p>I’d add that it also explains so much about what’s happening in the world today. We all need to be much more thoughtful about the moods and emotions we spread.</p>
