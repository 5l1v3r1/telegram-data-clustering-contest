      <h1>6 Issues With Apple’s New AirPods Pro After 1 Week Of Use</h1>

      <p>Apple’s new AirPods Pro have met with almost universal acclaim and applause since being launching. Reviewers love them and have been raving about them. But, like any product, they’re not perfect.This should not be shocking.</p>
      <p>Almost nothing is, after all.</p>
      <p>But I’ve found a number of issues with mine that Apple can and should fix in subsequent releases. None of them are deal-breakers, but they are annoying, and could make a difference for some potential buyers.</p>

      <p>Let me get this out right off the top: I like my new AirPods Pro. I bought the original AirPods, still have them, and was using them until last week. The ease of connectivity to Apple devices that Apple built into them is still their best feature. And I would buy both the original and the Pro versions again.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s good?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let me start with what’s good. Connectivity I already mentioned, but size is another.</p>
      <p>The AirPods Pro are smaller than the original AirPods. That means they’re less visually obtrusive, which is nice, but it also means they don’t brush out of your ears as easily. I use my AirPods when I work out, and I’ve dropped the originals several times when changing my shirt.</p>
      <p>The Pro models stay in even when getting brushed by clothing or other things, which I really appreciated when de-planing yesterday and lifting my messenger bag over my head. Despite touching my AirPods Pro, it did not dislodge them.</p>
      <p>The smaller size also means that you can lie your head down on a pillow while they’re in your ears without pain, something you couldn’t do with the original AirPods.</p>
      <p>(At least, I can. Your mileage may vary.)</p>
      <p>Active noise cancellation enhanced by the passive noise muffling of the silicon tip is another major win.</p>
      <p>I only brought my AirPods on my current trip to San Francisco this week, leaving my over-ear noise cancelling Bose QuietComfort 35 headphones at home. That’s a massive win, since they’re bulky. But AirPods Pro are probably only about 75-85% as good as the over-ear Bose at muffling airplane engine noise, so I’ll likely only do this on short trips. (And, of course, without an additional dongle, they won’t plug into airline entertainment systems.)</p>
      <p>Finally, the sound quality is better than the original AirPods. They’re still not audiophile quality – far from it – but they’re better, with more bass.</p>
      <p>Transparency mode is really quite good, amplifying external voices very nicely.</p>
      <p>In fact, I expect that people with mild hearing disorders can, in the future, use a version of AirPods or other in-ear audio solutions instead of traditional hearing aides. Even today they would be useful.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But I did find some issues</b>
      </p>
      <p>In my first week of use, here are six issues I found.</p>
      <p>Battery life is not amazing. I’ve never really worried about battery life with AirPods, because I’m not an all-day wearer. I typically wear them for a workout, a call, a walk or other defined, short periods of time.</p>
      <p>When you intend to wear them for an entire airplane flight, however, that’s another matter. While the flight from Vancouver to San Francisco is only about two hours, a quarter of my AirPods Pro battery life was gone just halfway into the trip. That suggests a real-world battery life of four hours with active noise canceling engaged—something that won’t work well for longer flights.</p>
      <p>My Bose headphones last 10 hours even three years after I bought them, and if you plug them into a plane’s entertainment system, they take a trickle charge that keeps them loaded with electrons.</p>
      <p>More surprisingly, I had some pairing issues with my AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>That’s shocking, because the best feature of AirPods has always been pairing with Apple devices. But I had two workouts this past week when one AirPod Pro would play but the other refused. I generally could fix this by pulling them out multiple times and forcing them to reconnect or reset, but having the issue in the first place was disconcerting.</p>
      <p>Another annoyance was controlling the AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>If you have an Apple Watch, you can very easily manage whether your AirPods Pro are in noise-cancelling, transparency or off modes. Tap on your music, tap an icon on the screen, and select the mode.</p>

        <figcaption>Apple's Control Center settings does not have an AirPods Pro option<cite>John Koetsier</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This is helpful when you want to chat with someone while your AirPods are on.</p>
      <p>But if you don’t have an Apple Watch, you need to tap on Settings on your iPhone, find and tap on Bluetooth, find and tap the little “i” icon next to the AirPods Pro device listing and then make your changes.</p>
      <p>This is a longish and not completely straightforward journey. Being able to control your AirPods Pro mode from Control Center would be much quicker and easier, but there is no such control yet. (<b>Update</b>: you can, but you have to long-press the volume control in Control Center.)</p>
      <p>You can also grip the AirPods Pro stalk: there’s a “button” to press there to switch between modes. In use I’ve found it a bit challenging to find and use, especially while moving around. It’s easy to grip slightly on the wrong axis, or not grip long enough.</p>
      <p>That may change over time.</p>
      <p>Findability is also an issue with the AirPods Pro fit test, which ensures that you have the right silicon tips on your earbuds to enable a tight seal. This is important for good noise cancellation, but it’s not easy to find.</p>
      <p>I started using my AirPods Pro without doing the fit test because I didn’t know where it was, and Apple didn’t surface it on first use. Only later did I find that to perform it you need to access the “i” menu item in Settings, in Bluetooth, for the AirPods Pro device.</p>

      <p>The fifth issue is a bit more trivial.</p>
      <p>But, it’s part of the user experience.</p>
      <p>I don’t find it easy to get the AirPods Pro out of their case. The old AirPods just slid right out: simple, easy, never a problem. The new Pro models are hard to grip because they’re seated deeper in the case, and the slick plastic parts are the highest. They’re slippery, while the grippy silicon tips are angled down lower. It might be small, but every time you want to use the AirPods Pro, it’s a little challenge just to get them out of the case.</p>
      <p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/YoungComm">Matthew Young</a> shared a tip with me: use one finger to pull them forward from the back. They will then slide forward into a position from which you can grab them more easily.)</p>
      <p>Finally, as is pretty obvious, the case is not quite as pocketable as the original AirPods case. It’s larger, wider and while it definitely still qualifies as pocketable, it’s also definitely something you’ll feel.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Overall: still a good buy</b>
      </p>
      <p>As I mentioned off the top, the positives outweigh the negatives, and I still recommend AirPods Pro. But, buyers should be aware of potential issues, even if they’re relatively minor.</p>
      <p>What’s minor to me, after all, might be major to you.</p>
