      <p>Former '<b>Produce X 101</b>' contestants <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kim-kook-heon">Kim Kook Heon</a> and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/song-yoo-bin">Song Yoo Bin</a> have announced their new duo name!</p>
      <p>Up until now, the two former <b>MYTEEN</b> members have simply promoted as the duo Kim Kook Heon x Song Yoo Bin. But now, fans can begin calling them <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/boy">B.O.Y</a>, or<b> B.OF. YOU</b>!</p>
      <p>The duo name was selected after the boys received over 2,000 suggestions via their fans. The name symbolizes two phrases simultaneously - <i>"Best of you"</i> and<i> "Both of you"</i>. B.O.Y's first official activity under their new name will be their year-end mini concert '<b>Dear, YOU</b>', set to take place from December 24-25. Afterward, you can look forward to new music from B.O.Y early next year!</p>
