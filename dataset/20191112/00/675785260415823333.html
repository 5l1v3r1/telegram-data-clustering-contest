      <h2>Former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa is not looking forward to coming face-to-face with I'm A Celebrity's infamous creepy-crawlies but will use the jungle as a detox</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:14:12+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 00:14</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa has spoken out about her fears as she enters the Australian jungle for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> .</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old former EastEnders actress has revealed that she "doesn’t do creatures" and is not looking forward to coming face-to-face with the millions of creepy crawlies the ITV show has in store.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of her time in the jungle, Jacqueline - who quit in 2018 as Lauren Branning in the BBC1 drama after eight years - has said she is "scared of everything."</p>
      <p>She believes her friends from Albert Square will be shocked to see her in the line-up for this year's show, especially as she has such a nervous disposition when it comes to insects.</p>

      <p>Despite her fear of anything with eight legs, Jacqueline has said that being herself and not a fictional character is also going to be a challenge.</p>
      <p>She said: "It’s going to be so difficult going in as me and that’s definitely going to be the hardest part. I have never done a show where I have been myself.”</p>
      <p>“And I am also scared of everything – especially spiders! They are the worst, there will be tears!”</p>
      <p>“My old colleagues on EastEnders are going to be shocked. I don’t think they can imagine me in there. I don’t like creatures. It is not my thing.”</p>

      <p>It's not just the creepy-crawlies that could prove problematic as Jacqueline revealed that she is not really a 'great outdoors' person.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I have also never done rock climbing, jumped out of a plane or camped in my life. I am not that kind of girl.</p>
      <p>"But having said all that, I am really excited. This is something completely different and it’s going to be a totally new experience."</p>
      <p>The TV actress also hopes to dispel some misconceptions about her.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline explained: “I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat.</p>
      <p>“I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best.”</p>

      <p>One of her toughest challenges, as a mum to two young children, Jacqueline readily admits she is going to find it very tough being separated from them.</p>
      <p>She admitted: “This is definitely the longest I have ever been away from them and that is going to be really hard.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know how to face even telling them. In the end, I thought the best idea was to say ‘mummy is going away for work’ and I would see them soon. My family is so close-knit and I will miss them all terribly.”</p>
