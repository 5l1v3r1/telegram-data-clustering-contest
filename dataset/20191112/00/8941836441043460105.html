      <h1>Don Cherry not sorry for ‘you people’ remarks: ‘I kn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T00:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/victor-morton/" target="_blank">Victor Morton</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/don-cherry/">Don Cherry</a> isn’t backing off.</p>
      <p>The legendary “Hockey Night in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/canada/">Canada</a>” announcer was fired Monday for comments about “you people that come here” not wearing poppies, the traditional symbol of support for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/canada/">Canada</a>’s soldiers on Nov. 11. The remarks were construed as anti-immigrant.</p>
      <p>In a phone <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-don-cherry-fired-over-controversial-poppy-comment">interview</a> with the Toronto Sun, the former NHL coach known for his loud suits and louder persona, was unapologetic.</p>
      <p>“I know what I said and I meant it. Everybody in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/canada/">Canada</a> should wear a poppy to honour our fallen soldiers,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/don-cherry/">Cherry</a> said.</p>
      <p>He also said that he wouldn’t have wanted to continue his 35-year run as host of the “Coach’s Corner” segment if he had to feign political correctness.</p>

      <p>“To keep my job, I cannot be turned into a tamed robot,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/don-cherry/">Cherry</a> said. “I would have liked to continue doing ‘Coach’s Corner’. The problem is if I have to watch everything I say, it isn’t ‘Coach’s Corner’.”</p>
      <p>For decades before the weekend’s firing, Canadian nationalism had been a part of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/don-cherry/">Cherry</a>’s broadcast persona, which is also heavy on braggadocio.</p>
      <p>When Scandinavian and East European players began playing in the NHL in large numbers in the 1980s (and in the latter case, especially after the fall of Communism) <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/don-cherry/">Cherry</a> would often lament both the influx of foreigners and the influence of them on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/canada/">Canada</a>’s national sport and league.</p>
      <p>During broadcasts, he would mispronounce Slavic or Scandinavian names; offhandedly refer to the East Europeans as “commies” or “reds”; and say how, in an easily mocked Canadian accent in words he’d frequently use, these European softies were taking roster spots from hard-working Canadian boys.</p>
