      <p>NORTH FORT MYERS, Fla. -- We're working to find out if Lee County deputies have caught the person they were searching for overnight in North Fort Myers.</p>
      <p>The Fox 4 Breaking News Tracker was on scene as deputies, including K-9 units, canvassed several blocks near the Motel 6 off N. Cleveland Avenue.</p>
      <p>This all happened around 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In addition to the K-9 units, our crew also saw choppers circling overhead.</p>
      <p>The area is clear now. Most deputies left the area around 3 a.m.</p>
