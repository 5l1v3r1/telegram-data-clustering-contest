      <h1>This 12-year-old Nigerian boy just made a new discovery in Mathematics</h1>

      <p>A 12-year-old Nigerian has made history after making a new discovery in the field of Mathematics.</p>
      <p>Chika Ofili, who is based in the UK, was awarded over the weekend at the <a href="https://trulittlehero.com/">TruLittle Hero Awards</a> for discovering the new formula for divisibility by seven in mathematics.</p>
      <p>Ofili’s teacher, Miss Mary Ellis, who is also the head of the Mathematics department at Westminster Under School said he discovered the formula while solving a holiday assignment. Miss Ellis said in an educational journal that she gave a book called First Steps for Problem Solvers (published by the UKMT) to study during the holidays. </p>

      <p>The book had several divisibility tests that used to quickly work out whether a number is exactly divisible by either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 before you start dividing. The book had no memorable test listed for checking divisibility by 7.</p>
      <p>Ofili, however, discovered the formula and had an algebraic proof to back it up.</p>
      <p>The new formula involves taking the last digit of any whole number, multiply it by 5 and then add it to the remaining part of the number to get a new number. If this new number is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.</p>
