      <p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Abdul Hafeez Shaikh has drawn public ire for his recent comments on tomato prices in Karachi.</p>
      <p>In a video shared widely on social media platforms, Shaikh is seen dismissing reporters’ concerns over the rising prices of tomatoes in the port city.</p>
      <p>“Look, tomatoes are being sold for Rs17 per kilogramme at the <i>sabzi mandi</i>,” says the PM’s adviser.</p>
      <p>When reporters inform him that the fruit is being sold for Rs240 per kg by retailers in the city, Shaikh dismisses their assertion as a lie.</p>
