      <p>Although Lamar and Sabrina haven't been dating for very long, the 40-year-old shared that they were dating in August, he wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0qYxH1A9P3/"><b>Instagram</b></a>, "What we have is much more than they can see..." Shortly after the soon-to-be-married couple also spoke openly about their relationship on <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&amp;v=ucNmcc-XnMA"><b>Dish Nation</b></a></i>.</p>
      <p>Sabrina said, "You have to meet people where they are." When talking about Lamar's troubled past, touching on his relationship and very public split from Khloé Kardashian, she continued, "He was never in a position to be someone's husband, you know? He was sick, he needed to heal, he needed to grieve. He experienced a lot of losses. And he never had time to go through that."</p>
      <p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p>
