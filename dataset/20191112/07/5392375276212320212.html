      <p>Let’s kick things of with one of the latest and best all around devices to hit the market, the Redmi 8A. The latest entry-level device comes with a large 6.22-inch HD+ display and is powered by a super efficient Snapdragon 439 CPU.</p>

      <p>But the best selling feature of the device is the autonomy. The Redmi 8A does indeed come with a massive 5000mAh capacity battery. This paired with the efficient CPU could bring 2 days or more of use time.</p>
