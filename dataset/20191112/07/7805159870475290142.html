      <p>Disney, the juggernaut which is synonymous with cartoons, is also the world’s most valuable media company. And, it has long the <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/743376/disney-vs-netflix-great-media-battle-time">vision</a> of becoming the top online streaming service. For almost two years, the media giant has been vocal about its plans to launch three separate services dedicated to providing family-friendly TV entertainment, sports streaming, and adult-oriented content sharing on Hulu. The sports service, called ESPN+, was launched almost a year ago and now, the second service is hatching out of the egg – well, not instantly but it is. The media giant has announced “Disney+”, its premium video-on-demand service which will be launched later this year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The idea behind the new service is simple – Disney wants to eliminate mediators and reach viewers directly. Under the promised streaming service, users will have access to content such as movies or TV series from Disney, Pixar, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/download-playground-2-0-ar-stickers-marvel/">Marvel Studios</a>, National Geographic, and other franchises for a monthly subscription of $6.99 or for $69.99 a year. It will also host all episodes under the banners of the <i>Star Wars</i> saga and <i>The Simpsons</i>. Needless to say, most of this content will be exclusive to Disney+. At its annual investor’s day, the media behemoth announced that its streaming service will go live on November 12.</p>

      <p>Robert Iger, the chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company, told <i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/11/iger-says-disneys-brand-gives-new-streaming-service-an-edge-over-netflix.html">CNBC</a></i> that providing a direct service to the consumers is easier and more beneficial than licensing content to third-parties. He added that this is how, Disney’s original productions will have a higher value in the long term. The company grossed over <a href="https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-studios-hits-7-billion-in-global-box-office-for-2018/">$7 billion at the box office in 2018</a> and is confident about translating this success to Disney+.</p>

      <p>On the launch day, Disney+ will host 10 original movies and 25 original series besides 400 other movies and 7,500 episodes of TV shows – both airing and off-air. The list also includes 18 of Pixar’s 22 movies. While companies like Apple, Amazon, Hulu, etc. have been grappling to grab a large chunk of the online streaming business, Disney’s biggest competitor in the market is Netflix, with 140 million paid subscribers. This is where the pricing of Disney+ will play a pivotal role considering <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/netflix-testing-mobile-plan-india/">Netflix’s cheapest plan</a> costs $9 a month while the standard plan is available for $13 in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Since Disney owns 60% of Hulu, through its acquisition of Fox Studios, it also plans to expand Hulu in international markets. But the service will be separate from Disney+. Meanwhile, we wait to see if Netflix’s technology-first approach will help it sail through or sink its ship as the industry prepares for Disney’s disruptive pricing and global popularity.</p>
