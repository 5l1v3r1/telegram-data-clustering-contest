      <p>In an interview with an international news outlet, PSA CEO Carlos Tavares said that the combine had no plans to scrap any of the brands that fall under the groups. Groupe PSA owns the Peugeot, Citroen, DS, Opel and Vauxhall brands. FCA owns Abarth, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, SRT, among others.  He said that all the brands have a lot of history behind them. This gives each of them a unique strength and the new entity will have to work hard to make the most of these brands' heritage.</p>
      <p>Many of FCA-PSA's brands compete in similar segments. Case in point, the upcoming <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/citroen/c5-aircross-m818/">Citroen C5 Aircross</a> will compete with the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/jeep/compass-m569/">Jeep Compass</a> when it launches next year. Some of the brands also need to rejuvenated with new models and investments to keep them competitive.</p>
