      <p>The traditional ruler in his address said he prayed for the governor’s victory in the Saturday polls.</p>
      <p>The Ohinoyi thanked God for the existing peace and unity in the state, noting that the state’s Deputy Governor, Edward Onoja, was a worthy son of Ebira land, who has proven his critics wrong over time.</p>
      <p>The traditional ruler also conveyed to the governor best wishes from the Sultan of Sokoto, Emir of Zauzau, the Etsu Nupe and other well-meaning traditional rulers in the country.</p>
      <p>The Ohinoyi pointed out that “Governor Bello would come back wiser and well equipped with more experience in his second term to deliver suitable governance to the people of the state.”</p>
