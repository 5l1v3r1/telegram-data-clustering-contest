      </p>
      <p>On Monday, the Hawks issued a <a href="https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=23198">statement</a> in which the unit conveyed its deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Stemmet.</p>
      <p>"The untimely passing of our member, attached to Serious Corruption Investigation team, occurred [on Sunday] evening at her home in West Beach at Table View," the statement read.</p>
      <p>"It is alleged that two shots were fired and she was fatally wounded. The motive of the incident is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the local detectives; however, [a] preliminary investigation at this stage has ruled out any links to the Hawks' investigations that she was handling," said Nkwalase.</p>
      <p>"An inquest docket has been opened to explore circumstances surrounding the death of such a seasoned and dedicated officer."</p>
      <p>Western Cape police have been approached for comment on the investigation and their response will be included once received.</p>
