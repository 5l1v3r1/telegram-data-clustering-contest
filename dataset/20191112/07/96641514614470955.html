      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>This morning, we have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/engadget-2019-holiday-gift-guide/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">fresh holiday gift guide for you to flip through</a>, plus all the information you might need about Disney+ now it's actually available. In other news, there's a new rumor or two about Apple's augmented reality plans, plus we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/surface-laptop-3-review-15-inch/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">reviewed Microsoft's larger Surface Laptop 3</a>. Oh -- and the <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> movie is back with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-tries-again-with-a-new-trailer/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">new trailer showing off Sonic's de-creepified design</a>.</p>

      <p>After plenty of teasing, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/disney-plus-launch/">Disney's streaming service is live in the US</a>, Canada and the Netherlands. Some of us are already streaming the first episode of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/the-mandalorian/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, while others are checking out a few classics that are available for the first time in Ultra HD 4K, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/star-wars-movie-4K-disney-plus-dolby-vision-atmos/">several Star Wars movies and <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i></a></p>
      <p>Not satisfied? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/disney-plus-mcu/">16 of 23 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies</a> are included as part of the <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/bundle">$6.99 per month Disney+ package</a>, plus access to a massive archive of <i>The Simpsons</i>. If you're still on the fence, there is a seven-day trial period.</p>

      <p>The idea is to flag sites designed in a way that makes them slow, taking into account historical loading times. Eventually, Google might let you know if a page could take a while to display properly because of your device or connection, too. On the other hand,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/chrome-slow-loading-websites-speed-badging-label/"> it'll reward fast-loading sites with positive "speed badging."</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses"><i>The Information</i></a> sources claim Apple held an internal presentation in October relaying expectations to release its AR headset (really a mixed AR/VR headset) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/apple-ar-headset-2022/">in 2022 and AR glasses in 2023</a>.</p>

The rumored 3D sensor on iPhones would come later -- you might have to get the iPad Pro if you want Apple's first crack at the new augmented reality tech.</p>

      <p>After developing FlyEase shoes based on Lebron and Jordan models, Nike has adapted its technology for zip-up basketball sneakers for a whole new sport: football. These unique cleats are made for a (so far) one-of-a-kind athlete -- Seattle Seahawks linebacker Shaquem Griffin.</p>
      <p>To perform the way he needs them to, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/shaquem-griffin-flyease-cleat/">the cleats have what the company calls a "battle sock."</a> Instead of using laces to adapt the fit to its wearer's foot, it tightens with a three-strap system that secures both sides, and a knit cuff at the top that stretches so he can get his foot into it quickly.</p>

      <p>The 15-inch Surface Laptop 3 has a sleek, clean design on the outside and AMD Ryzen hardware inside, which is powerful enough to play games like Overwatch in 1080p. So what could be a problem? The port selection is skimpy (one USB-A and one USB-C) and even with nearly eight hours of battery life in our testing, it falls far short of the 16 hours we got from the Surface Laptop 2. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/surface-laptop-3-review-15-inch/">The high-end version we reviewed</a> costs $2,099, which makes it hard to recommend when a (slightly-heavier) XPS 15 offers more powerful graphics for about $1,500.</p>
