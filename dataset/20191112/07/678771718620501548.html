        <b>S&amp;P 500 3087,01 -6,07.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A quiet trading day in Wall Street with not much to report, the stock market has been climbing lately floor by floor, marking pauses, consolidating its advance before marking the next step. This kind of behaviour is fairly healthy although internal measures again paint a globally overbought picture. Breadth closed slightly negative: 1559 stocks advanced compared to 2115 that settled down, we observed a slight selling pressure, as measured by our buying/selling index ; daily sentiment indicators closed neutral.</p>
