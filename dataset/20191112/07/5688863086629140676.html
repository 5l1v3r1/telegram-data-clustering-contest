        <b>India's rookie all-rounder Shivam Dube, who sensationally turned the third T20I around in India's favour by scalping three wickets, has revealed that Rohit had told him beforehand to be prepared to bowl four overs. Dube also thanked the support staff for helping him settle into the Indian team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mumbai's Shivam Dube did not have the greatest of starts to his international career, scoring just one run whilst also going wicketless in the first two T20Is. And in the third T20I, skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> decided to gamble with the all-rounder, dropping <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/krunal_pandya">Krunal Pandya</a> from the XI, meaning Dube had to shoulder the responsibility of bowling all four overs. </p>
      <p>After leaking 23 runs off his first two overs, it looked like things were going to go from bad to worse for the 26-year-old, but the Mumbaikar bounced back in style, taking 3/7 off his last two overs, which included the prized scalps of both Mohammad Naim and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mushfiqur_rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a>. His contribution eventually helped India win the match and Dube has now revealed that skipper Rohit had informed him well beforehand to be mentally prepared to bowl out his full quota of four overs.</p>
      <p>“Rohit bhai (before the series) had told me to be ready to bowl all four overs in one of the coming games. So mentally I was ready," Dube told Indian Express.</p>
      <p>"Rohit bhai came and said, bindaas daal, kuchh soch mat (Don’t overthink, bowl freely), I’m there to back you. Just bowl to your strength," he added.</p>
      <p>Dube also revealed that his plan to was to keep things tight with the ball, one which initially went haywire, but then said that his delivery to dismiss Naim - a yorker which sneaked under the bat of the southpaw - was pre-planned and well thought out. </p>
      <p>“My main aim was to ensure I don’t give runs, but runs did leak initially. I backed myself and told myself that I will bowl to my strength. I was thinking if Mohammad Naim comes down the track, I will bowl a yorker. I had the intuition that he will charge. Once the game got over, everybody applauded and said I have the potential to be a good bowler, especially the way I used the yorker.</p>
      <p>The all-rounder also believes that nerves are a part and parcel of playing for your country and thanked the support staff, including coach <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ravi_shastri">Ravi Shastri</a>, for helping him seamlessly settle into the team. Dube also said that the series was a big learning curve for him, but acknowledged the fact that from an individual perspective, he could have done better. </p>
      <p>“I will call it as the pressure of playing for India. But the support staff made me relax and ensured that I don’t feel that pressure. I’m thankful to them. They backed me, Ravi (Shastri) came and said don’t take tension, just play your game. They told me, ‘We are there for you.,” Dube said.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy that we won the series, but I am not satisfied because I feel my performance could have been better. It’s a learning process, every game I have tried to do better from the last,” he signed off.</p>
