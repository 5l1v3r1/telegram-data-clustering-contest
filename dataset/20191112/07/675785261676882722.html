      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:21:20+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/myles-stephenson">Myles Stephenson</a> says he's planning to "embrace single life" during his time Down Under.</p>
      <p>The Rak-Su singer, 28, has landed in Australia for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>And the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner, who split from his girlfriend, Love Island's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> , earlier this year amid cheating claims, insists he's not looking for romance in the jungle.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am single. I have just got out of a relationship but I think I want to be single for a bit and embrace single life!"</p>
      <p>In August, Gabby confirmed hr split from Myles after reports she'd caught him sexting other women.</p>
      <p>The reality star was said to have dumped the singer after finding out he'd been exchanging flirty messages with other girls on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>As she confirmed it was over, Gabby begged fans to pass on any information they have about his unfaithful behaviour.</p>
      <p>She said in a statement on Instagram: "The news paper articles are true. I am no longer in a relationship. I hope youse have all had a better week than me!</p>
      <p>"If anyone else has anything they need to tell me, please do x"</p>
      <p>Her message seemed to suggest that someone has previously reached out to her on social media with information about her ex.</p>
      <p>Gabby and Myles started dating last September, and were inseparable at first.</p>

      <p>Myles moved into Gabby's North London flat earlier this year, but friends say she'd begun to grow suspicious of his behaviour in the last months of their relationship.</p>
      <p>It was a big blow to Gabby after her ex Marcel Somerville, who she met on Love Island, cheated on her.</p>
      <p>Gabby has made it clear she won't be watching Myles on the show.</p>
      <p>She told  <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7673427/Love-Islands-Gabby-Allen-admits-wont-watching-ex-Myles-Stephenson-Im-Celeb.html">The Daily Mail</a>  : "Hmmm. I don’t watch that show anyway."</p>

      <p>Gabby stressed people can't get over their exes while they remain in contact with one another.</p>
      <p>She added: "No [we don't talk]. I don’t wish him any harm though. I find it fascinating that people can be friends with their exes. You can’t get over someone when you’re still in contact."</p>
