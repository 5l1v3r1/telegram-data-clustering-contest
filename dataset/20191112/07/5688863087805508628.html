        <b>An Indian owner of a Caribbean Premier League (CPL) team has reportedly been sent back by the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) and an investigation has been embarked regarding the same. Reportedly, in the initial stages of the league, the alleged person made an approach to a Pakistani cricketer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The said team owner was new to the group and on being recognized with corruption, was abruptly sent back from the CPL and an inquiry into the same was begun immediately. While there were multiple versions of when exactly the alleged approach was made, obtained from inquiring several members of the league, it points out to the said Indian man being involved.</p>
      <p>This particular team owner hails from South India and his exile was informed to the other owners of the franchise. It was the Pakistan player, who got approached by the man, who informed the ACU. </p>
      <p>However, the CPL has refused to offer any inputs regarding any anti-corruption matter. But it wasn’t denied, by any means, that something of this nature occurred in the tournament.</p>
      <p>“We do not make comments with regard to any anti-corruption matters so will not be offering a comment here. For background and for your information, the CPL works very closely with the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a> and our own anti-corruption team and all reports from players and officials are investigated thoroughly,” a CPL spokesperson told Mumbai Mirror. </p>
