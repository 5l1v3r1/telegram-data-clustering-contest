      <h1>Inside Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez England bust-up as Man City star is dropped by Gareth Southgate</h1>
      <h2>England duo Sterling and Gomez rowed in the canteen at St George's Park following Liverpool's win over Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:42:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> and Joe Gomez had to be pulled apart by England teammates as more details emerge of the bust-up which has seen Sterling axed from the Three Lions' Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>The duo clashed in the canteen at St George's Park after Gomez offered a handshake to Sterling following Liverpool's victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez were involved in a heated exchange towards the end of City's defeat on Merseyside which saw them slip nine points off the title pace.</p>
      <p>They embraced after the game and the situation appeared to have cooled before they met up for international duty on Monday.</p>

      <p>But Sterling took issue with Gomez's handshake - which came from behind - asking the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender if he was "still the big man".</p>
      <p>It is understood Sterling then went to grab Gomez and England teammates realised shortly afterwards that the pair were not joking around as they had a verbal row.</p>
      <p>Some players then stepped in to separate the pair.</p>
      <p>Sterling is understood to be upset at being dropped for the Montenegro game as he thinks the situation with Gomez is resolved.</p>

      <p>The forward released a statement on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page on Monday night, saying: "First and foremost everyone knows what this game means to me!</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point, both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions get the better of me.</p>
      <p>"We move this is why we play this sport because of our love for it - me and @joegomez5 are good we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing it's done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's get focus on our game on Thursday."</p>
      <p>Sterling will come back into contention for England's match at Kosovo on Monday as he stays with the squad despite not being under consideration for the Montenegro clash at Wembley which will be England's 1000th men's senior international.</p>
      <p>Upon dropping Sterling, England boss Southgate said: "We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we’ve been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday’s game were still raw.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it’s important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night.”</p>
