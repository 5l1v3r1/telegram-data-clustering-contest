      <h1>New zipwire and giant trampoline as Mary Stevens Park gets £50k makeover</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:44:10+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Ashmore, https://www.facebook.com/dudleybclive/</a></address>
      <p>Youngsters will be able to jump on a huge trampoline and zoom down a zipwire when a Stourbridge park has a £55,000 makeover.</p>
      <p>A wheelchair accessible swing and a trim trail will also form part of the new children's play area at Mary Stevens Park, thanks to the fundraising efforts of dedicated volunteers.</p>
      <p>The Friends of Mary Stevens Park secured a £50,000 grant from Enovert Community Trust, an environmental body which supports community projects. It also committed £5,000 match funding and made another successful bid for cash through community forums.</p>
      <p>Work is expected to take place this winter and the play area will be out of action for a few weeks so that the new area can be ready for the busy spring and summer period.</p>
      <p>It is the first phase of planned improvement works for the play area. More swings and new multi-play units are expected to be installed at a later date, subject to funding being secured.</p>
      <p>Mark Gadd, chair of the Friends of Mary Stevens Park, said: "The local community has really banded together to bring this project forward.</p>
      <p>"The volunteers are made up of local people who are parents of or care for young children and they use the park regularly. They really care about meeting the play needs of a wider age range, providing an inclusive play space and listening to the priorities of park users.</p>
      <p>"We are thrilled to have secured the funding for the first stage of the play area improvements, and we are hopeful of future fundraising success to enable the completion of all the planned improvements."</p>

      <p>Alan Lunt, deputy chief executive at Dudley Council, added: "The play area at Mary Stevens Park is hugely popular with families, who I’m sure will welcome this investment to bring in some exciting new equipment for children in the borough.</p>
      <p>"Our parks and play areas are a great free way of helping children stay active and this investment will be beneficial to the whole community.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to the friends group volunteers for their countless hours of hard work to ensure this exciting play area development can happen."</p>
