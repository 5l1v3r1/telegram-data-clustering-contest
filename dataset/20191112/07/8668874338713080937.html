      <h1>Chiefs prepare for Retallick-less season under Gatland with rookie-packed squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T07:32:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>The next generation of the Gallagher <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> will join a formidable group of the Club’s established players.</p>
      <p>The Gallagher Chiefs squad for 2020 has been announced and will feature nine rookies, eight current <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a>, six Maori All Blacks, one Gallagher Chiefs centurion and one international.</p>
      <p>Gallagher Chiefs Head Coach Warren Gatland said he is confident he has a great group of talented players for the 2020 Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season.</p>

      <p>“I’m very excited about this group of young men we have assembled, which has a good spread of talented players from throughout our Chiefs region. Within the squad, we have a strong core group of leaders, despite losing the leadership and outstanding ability of 2019 Gallagher Chiefs co-captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs/players/brodie-retallick/">Brodie Retallick</a> we regain former co-captain Aaron Cruden.”</p>
      <p>“We have retained a large contingent of the squad for the season ahead, which will provide us with a good platform to build on. Adding in a great combination of young talent, we believe the squad we have assembled will thrive in the environment and collectively deliver for the Club as a unit,” said Gatland.</p>
      <p>There are four new additions to the forwards in 2020. Called into the 2019 Gallagher Chiefs as an injury replacement player, Taranaki hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs/players/bradley-slater/">Bradley Slater</a> has been named in the squad for the first time, although he has two Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> caps to his name. The intelligent, hardworking hooker will be joined by Tasman prop Ryan Coxon. The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> Under 20 representative debuted for the Gallagher Chiefs against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes">Hurricanes</a> in 2019 and has played four matches for the team.</p>

      <p>20-year-old athletic lock Naitoa Ah Kuoi has earned himself selection following an impressive <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup">Mitre 10 Cup</a> campaign for Wellington. The youngest Gallagher Chiefs squad member has shown his potential holding his own against experienced opposition. South African born loose forward <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/otago/players/dylan-nel/">Dylan Nel</a> has been named in the team for the first time. The oldest of the rookies at 26, Nel is a busy flanker with a solid work ethic. The skillful <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/otago">Otago</a> number eight is no stranger to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> environment called in as injury cover for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/crusaders">Crusaders</a> in 2017, however, is yet to make his Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> debut.</p>
      <p>Five exciting backs will also join the squad in 2019. Taranaki teammates halfback <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/taranaki-bulls/players/lisati-milo-harris/">Lisati Milo-Harris</a> and winger Kini Naholo will set out to make their Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> debuts in the Gallagher Chiefs jersey. Illusive <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/waikato">Waikato</a> back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/waikato/players/quinn-tupaea/">Quinn Tupaea</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/bay-of-plenty">Bay of Plenty</a> playmaker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/bay-of-plenty/players/kaleb-trask/">Kaleb Trask</a> will be aspiring to make their Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> debuts. Both have donned the black jersey for New Zealand Under 20s, Tupaea in 2019 and Trask in 2018.</p>
      <p>Counties Manukau midfielder <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs/players/orbyn-leger/">Orbyn Leger</a> is named in the team for the first time, although he has nine Investec <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> caps to his name. After a call-up into the 2019 Gallagher Chiefs squad as an injury replacement player, the midfielder debuted at first five-eighth in round one against the Highlanders.</p>
