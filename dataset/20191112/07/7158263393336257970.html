      <p>Crystals are little wonders of nature: naturally formed when atoms come together and become a uniformed cluster, often when liquids cool and start to harden. Certain molecules in the liquid collect together, in a uniform and repeating pattern, which (over anything from a few days to thousands of years) forms the emerging crystalâ€™s unique shape. Also, theyâ€™re pretty. The big blingâ€”you know, the good stuff, like emeralds, diamonds, and rubiesâ€”forms when liquid rock slowly cools.</p>
      <p>Even though youâ€™ve probs heard them described as a trend, crystals have actually been around and carried for healing and protection for centuries. (Crystal-heads believe their crystalline structures hold energy and vibrate at frequencies that our bodies and minds subliminally pick up. Who am I to argue with ancient wisdom??)</p>
      <p>Selecting a crystal to help steer you toward your goals is a step toward making your ambitions reality. And when it comes to attracting love, even if you donâ€™t believe the crystal itself is magic, just the fact that youâ€™re carrying one means youâ€™re opening up your heart to the possibility.</p>
      <p>Now that Iâ€™ve convinced you (youâ€™re welcome), here are jewelry designer Clare Gregoryâ€™sâ€”the founder of UK alternative jewelry brand <a href="https://bonearrow.com/">Bonearrow</a>, Clare uses crystals in her designsâ€”picks for the top seven (seven <i>is</i> a lucky number, you know) crystals for attracting love into your life.</p>
