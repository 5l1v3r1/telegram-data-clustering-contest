      <h1>IBM's 200,000 Macs Have Made a Happier and More Productive Workforce, Study Finds</h1>

      <p><a href="https://apple.slashdot.org/~sbinning">sbinning</a> shares a report from AppleInsider: <i>IBM has <a href="https://www.jamf.com/resources/press-releases/ibm-announces-research-showing-mac-enables-greater-productivity-and-employee-satisfaction-at-ibm/">published its latest study</a> focusing on the benefits of Apple products in enterprise, and has found that a fleet of over 200,000 Macs <a href="https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/213710/ibms-200-000-macs-have-made-a-happier-more-productive-workforce">leads to far lower support costs, smaller numbers of support staff, and happier employees versus a Windows deployment</a>. In the study presented on Tuesday, IBM says that employees that used Mac machines were 22 percent more likely to exceed expectations in performance reviews compared to Windows users. Mac-using employees generating sales deals have 16% larger proceeds as well. <br/><br/>Turning to employee satisfaction, the first-of-its-kind study shows that Mac users were 17 percent less likely to leave IBM compared to their Windows counterparts. Mac users also were happier with the software available, with 5 percent asking for additional software compared to 11 percent of Windows users. A team of seven engineers is needed to maintain 200,000 Macs whereas a team of 20 is needed for that number of Windows PCs. During setup, the migration process was simple for 98 percent of Mac users versus only 86 percent of those moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Windows users were also five times as likely to need on-site support.</i></p>
