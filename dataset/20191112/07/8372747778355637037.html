      <p>EL CENTRO, Calif. â€” <a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/4.0-earthquake-shakes-el-centro-in-imperial-county">Two earthquakes</a> shook the Imperial County city of El Centro Monday night.</p>
      <p>The first quake, which measured at 4.0 magnitude, struck about a half mile east-northeast of the city at 6:13 p.m. local time. The second quake was recorded as a 3.7 magnitude quake about 30 seconds later.</p>
      <p>A check of the U.S. Geological Survey's 'Did You Feel It' map showed shaking was reported in Calexico, about 12 miles away, and Yuma, Arizona.</p>
      <p>The quakes were "very quick," said an El Centro hotel clerk who did not wish to be identified.</p>
      <p>A server at a local Denny's said the shaking made his customers stand up out of concern, but no one was hurt.</p>
      <p>While no major damage has been reported, the quakes were strong enough to shake overhead lights and topple monitors on display at Staples, according to clerk Krosby Rider.</p>
