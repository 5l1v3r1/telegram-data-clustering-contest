      <p>INGLEWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- Opponents are ramping up the fight against the Los Angeles Clippers' proposed $1 billion arena in Inglewood.<br/><br/>Protesters say the project will escalate the city's two biggest problems - affordable housing and pollution.<br/><br/>Former Sen. Barbara Boxer joined the effort at a rally on Monday to highlight environmental issues.<br/><br/>The Inglewood residents, organized by the Uplift Inglewood Coalition, are mindful of the David vs. Goliath battle they face.<br/><br/>The Clippers, backed by billionaire owner Steve Ballmer, have picked out a 22-acre Inglewood site for the team's future home. The location is next door to the new planned NFL stadium, under the Los Angeles International Airport flight path.<br/><br/>In court, Ballmer has won key challenges. The city of Inglewood has endorsed the project.<br/><br/>Protesters are getting help from owners of The Forum. They don't want the competition from another arena a mile away.<br/><br/>Also helping is Boxer.<br/><br/>"We have to make sure they don't get off the hook," she said.<br/><br/>Boxer urged protesters to sign a letter to the California Air Resources Board.<br/><br/>Because of existing pollution in the neighborhood cause by jets, traffic, and soon-to-be football stadium, the Clippers made specific promises written into legislation - in exchange for fast-track environmental review.<br/><br/>"Before they can build, they have to make sure they are doing everything in their power to keep the air clean," Boxer said.<br/><br/>The coalition says the project will bring in an additional 4 million cars a year. They are calling on residents to petition the California Air Resources Board and oust local leaders who approved the project.<br/><br/>And their message to Ballmer:<br/><br/>"How much better would it be for him to go somewhere in this area that doesn't have these problems?" Boxer said.</p>
