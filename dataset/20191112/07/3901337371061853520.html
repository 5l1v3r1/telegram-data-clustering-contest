      <p>Ronaldo was infuriated after being substituted by manager Maurizio Sarri in the 55th minute of the Bianconeri's win over AC Milan on Sunday, and reportedly left the stadium before the match had even ended.</p>
      <p>According to former AS Roma forward Antonio Cassano, the Portugal international's reaction could earn him a serious ban from Italian authorities.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was speaking on Italian television show <i>Tiki-Taka</i>, as reported by <i>AS</i>, when he revealed that players were required to hang around after the game in case they were called for anti-doping tests.</p>

      <p>"Did he leave before the end of the game?" Cassano asked.</p>
      <p>"You can't do that because there is an anti-doping control."</p>
      <p>Cassano drew on his own experience in the matter after he had previously been summoned back after leaving a derby match against Lazio during his own playing career, and revealed that the consequences for failing to do so would have been massive.</p>
      <p>"I had to go back to the stadium urgently to avoid a two-year ban," he added.</p>
