      <p>News of the reunion was quickly followed by fan speculation over who would be drumming for <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/gerard-way">Gerard Way</a> and co. Now, representatives for the band have confirmed to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8542727/my-chemical-romance-reunion-fantasy-set-list"><i>Billboard</i></a> that their former sticksman Jarrod Alexander will be taking on the role once more.</p>
      <p>An Editor’s Note in one of the outlet’s recent MCR post states: “This article has been edited to note that Jarrod Alexander will be the drummer for My Chemical Romance’s reunion show.”</p>
      <p>The band also announced that <a href="http://nme.com/artists/thursday">Thursday</a> will support them at their hugely anticipated comeback gig at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on December 20.</p>
      <p>The group have <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/heres-all-the-evidence-of-that-mooted-my-chemical-romance-reunion-2508651">long been rumoured for a reunion</a> since <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/my-chemical-romance-12-1229324">their split in 2013</a>.

      <p>Anticipation grew around a reunion with the recent 15th and 13th anniversary of ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/an-obituary-for-my-chemical-romance-771314">Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge</a>‘ and ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-my-chemical-romance-8050">The Black Parade’</a>, respectively.</p>
