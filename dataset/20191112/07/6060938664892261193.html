      <p>Come January 2020, Ajay Devgn is going to give fans a history lesson unlike any other with his ambitious project, ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’. The periodic drama, also marks the actor’s milestone 100th film, since making his debut about 3 decades ago. To mark this special feat, the actor is calling on his closest friends from the industry to help in celebrating.</p>
      <p>This time around it was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> who launched his fiery new poster, featuring Ajay as the great Maratha warrior <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tanaji-Malusare">Tanaji Malusare</a>. Standing tall and fearless amidst a blazing backdrop, Akshay is seen ready to go to battle. One look at the poster and we can’t quite wait to see what the film has in store. However, it was Akshay’s heartfelt note to his dear friend that also deserved special mention.</p>
      <p>“We started our journey in this industry together...30 years ago. And I’ve seen your graph only grow from strength to strength. And as you are all set to mark your century with #TanhajiTheUnsungWarrior, I wish you nothing but lots of love and luck. Shine on my friend @ajaydevgn,” Akshay said as he did the honours of sharing the poster.</p>

      <p>This comes a day after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> shared a poster to mark Ajay’s 100 films.
