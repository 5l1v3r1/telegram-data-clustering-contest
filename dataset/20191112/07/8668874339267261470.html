      <p>Hurricanes prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes/players/toby-smith/">Toby Smith</a> has announced he is retiring from rugby following issues with concussion.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Smith, a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> centurion and former Australian international, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=12284542">has opted not to renew his contract with the </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes">Hurricanes</a> to preserve his long-term health by seeking out new opportunities.</p>
      <p>“I am making the difficult choice now to leave the game I love and that has given me so many amazing experiences and where I have made some life-long friendships,” Smith said.</p>

      <p>“I have had some on-going issues with concussion, and while I am currently symptom-free, I do not wish to put that at further risk.</p>
      <p>“I’m really grateful for the support and encouragement I have had from the Hurricanes and NZR and I now look forward to new challenges.”</p>
      <p>In addition to being a capped Wallaby, Smith played 108 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> games for the Chiefs, Rebels and Hurricanes. He debuted for the Hurricanes against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/bulls">Bulls</a> in Pretoria in 2018 and went on to play 21 times for the Wellington-based club over two seasons.</p>

      <p>Hurricanes coach John Plumtree praised Smith, highlighting his performance in this year’s <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> semifinal.</p>
      <p>“Despite injuries and concussion, Toby has been a fantastic Hurricane epitomised by his outstanding performance in his last match for us in the 2019 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> semifinal,” Plumtree said.</p>
      <p>“We will certainly miss him but player welfare must continue to be the number one priority.”</p>
      <p>NZ Rugby head of professional rugby Chris Lendrum commended Smith on a brave but exciting decision.</p>
      <p>“Toby can be proud of his achievements – he has represented a number of teams, and he is a capped Australian international,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The centurions club is an exclusive club and it is remarkable that across three different teams he has amassed 108 games in what is regarded as the world’s toughest inter-regional competition.”</p>
