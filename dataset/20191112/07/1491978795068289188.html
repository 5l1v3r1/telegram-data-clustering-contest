      <h3>Brooklyn, NY … (l to r) Badu, queer Ivorian; Amadi, queer Nigerian; Mai’Yah, queer Liberian and Yéwá, queer Nigerian</h3>
      <p>Mikael Owunna: Growing up, I was told that it was ‘un-African’ to be gay, and that homosexuality was foreign to our culture. After enduring years of severe alienation from my Nigerian heritage and a series of exorcisms in Nigeria, I started Limitless to reclaim my African-ness and queerness on my own terms. <b>© All photographs by Mikael Owunna</b></p>

      <h3>Aru, Brussels, Belgium 2017</h3>
      <p>My name is Aurélie. I am Congolese, Bandundu. I prefer to go by the pronouns of they and them. I am comfortable with identifying as queer or lesbian. People fear what they do not understand. And when someone doesn’t understand what it is to truly be themselves and love who they are, then I’m really not surprised that there is such resistance to having an open mind and understanding their history. To put Africans in a box of heteronormative western structures is to really deny their true history.</p>

      <h3>Yahya, Philadelphia, PA, US 2016</h3>
      <p>I am half-Moroccan and half-American, born in Casablanca. I identify as a second generation radical queer, pansexual, and the gender identity that feels comfortable is ‘boi’. I aspire towards a queered masculinity, with tenderness and self-awareness. I like they and them pronouns. Race and ethnicity are complicated in Morocco. Many Moroccans feel both Arab and African, but Arab comes first, Moroccan comes before both of those, and Muslim comes before everything else. There is a rich and diverse history of non-binary gender expression in African cultures.</p>

      <h3>Lahya, Berlin, Germany 2017</h3>
      <p>I’m originally from Namibia and now located in Berlin. My pronoun is she and I’m a queer, cis-femme person with polyamorous relationships and I’m pan. For me, as a disabled black and body non-conforming person, style is empowerment. I’m very influenced by my African heritage: I like big earrings, but also colours and I like to show my body as it is and to bring it out in the best way I can show it. As a black intersectional person, I always have to give myself a bit more love than other people in the world give me.</p>

      <h3>Brian, Montreal, Canada 2016</h3>
      <p>I am Rwandan by my parents, but I grew up in Tanzania, Niger, Kenya, Benin and the Central African Republic. I answer to him and her and I identify as queer. When I decided to embrace my LGBTQ identity, I pushed away my African identity. But I had already tried to push away my LGBTQ identity. It was complete denial. And then one day I thought to myself why not try embracing both identities, just for the sake of trying. I never felt so complete and comfortable in my skin.</p>

      <h3>Jihan, Brussels, Belgium 2017</h3>
      <p>I was born in France to Algerian parents. I’m a trans dude. My societal gender is masculine, but my psychic reality is two-spirit. I feel very strongly both female and male energies. I had a period of attraction to and aversion from the African community I’m originally from; all the way to a complete rejection. It’s a huge internal struggle, as we are educated in contradictions, tradition and modernity. In North African cultures there is honour and loyalty or guilt and shame. It’s a conditioning that is very difficult to escape.</p>

      <h3>Carol, Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2015</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in the US. I am Nigerian-American and biracial. I don’t really identify as anything in particular, but I feel most comfortable with the label ‘queer’. I have often felt pushed away from my blackness and African-ness in LGBTQ spaces in the US, which can be very white, sometimes racist, and erasing of QTPOC perspectives. I feel most at home among other queer folks of colour, especially black queer people, and that has helped me overcome any dissonance between my sexuality and my heritage.</p>

      <h3>Subira (l) and Wandia (r),</h3>
      <p><b>twins, Hamburg, Germany 2017</b> Subira: I am from the UK, using the pronouns they and them. I identify as a queer (bisexual/ pansexual/ whatever) nonbinary/+woman. It’s messy. I normally just say I’m queer. I dealt with a lot of racism in LGBTQ spaces during my undergraduate degree, which was exhausting and isolating. Wandia: <i/>For a while my queer identity was tied up in gay clubbing [but] gay clubs can be minefields of racism and ignorance. People assumed I was somebody’s straight friend, and white gay men were constantly grabbing my ass or my hair.</p>

      <h3>Terna, Boston, MA, US 2015</h3>
      <p>I am a Nigerian-Liberian American. I identify as black. I use queer most of the time, but I think it is important to say bisexual. Something else that’s important to me is that, as much as is possible, especially if I’m going to an event, I wear some sort of African clothing. It’s an ongoing struggle, having both my African identity and my identity as a queer person. It makes me feel sad that I have to be accepted by anyone. That feeling of being outside is not one that I enjoy or take pride in.</p>

      <h3>Wiilo, Arlington, VA, US 2015</h3>
      <p>Wiilo in Somali means ‘girl who dresses like boy’ … It’s something that comforted me when I was discovering my queerness and helped me to overcome the shame and the feeling of being pushed away from my Somali culture. Growing up, any deviation from the norm was stamped down. This has to do with living in a refugee community surrounded by whiteness, when holding on to your culture means defining it in very limiting ways.</p>

      <h3>Tobi and Gabrielle, Essex, UK 2017</h3>
      <p>My name is Tobi, I am a non-binary, Yoruba Nigerian, my pronouns are she and they. I identify as a queer, bisexual femme. There have been many times when I have felt pushed away from my African and queer identity. I am not fully out to all my family members, for a mixture of reasons: fear of rejection, worry about the upheaval it would cause. My relationship with my daughter has brought me into my strength in so many ways. Knowing that I have no choice but to cherish, protect and create a space in this world for another human is magic personified.</p>

      <h3>Gesiye, Port of Spain, Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2015</h3>
      <p>My name is Gesiye, which in Ijaw means ‘someone of truth’. I’m Nigerian-Trinidadian. My pronouns are she, her. I identify as bisexual and queer. In Trinidad, where I grew up, colour plays a huge role in structuring privilege in everyday life. Having lighter skin in my society meant that I was constantly being pushed away from my African heritage, told I was ‘too light to be Nigerian’.</p>

      <h3>Juliet and Samuel, Stockholm, Sweden 2016</h3>
      <p>Juliet: I am also called Jules, and I was born in Uganda and raised in Sweden. I also have roots in Rwanda as my grandmother was Rwandan. My ethnicity is Acholi, a minority ethnic group in northern Uganda. My pronoun is she/her and I identify as queer. Samuel: I am from the beautiful city of Gonder in northern Ethiopia. My preferred gender pronoun is he and I identify as a queer person. I love how the term gives me the freedom to be as I am, to express myself freely.</p>

      <h3>Netsie, Seattle, WA, US 2016</h3>
      <p>I am a queer Ethiopian Namibian. My full name translates as ‘our gift of freedom’. My ethnicity is black and I use the pronouns she and her. Within the gay community, I find that my identity as a queer, pansexual femme, and my perceived ability to ‘pass’ is often maligned. For years, I felt the need to prove how gay I was. Eventually, I began to realise that most generalisations about the gay community are steeped in misogyny and anti-blackness.</p>
