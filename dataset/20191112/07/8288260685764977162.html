      <p>A businessman has been told to pay £1,000 for double-yellow lines outside his vehicle rental.</p>
      <p>Josh Hall is locked in a council row after being told double-yellow lines are being installed outside his office.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall, from the Midlands, opened NVP Rental Vehicles after buying a block of 'drug den' public toilets from Stoke-on-Trent City Council.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old transformed them as part of a £40,000 investment, reports <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/im-not-paying-council-furious-3449321">StokeonTrentLive</a> , our sister title.</p>
      <p>The deal to buy the crumbling Keelings Road building, in Northwood, was completed in March, 2018.</p>
      <p>Now Josh is furious that the council wants him to pay for parking restrictions - and he does not even want them.</p>

      <p>Josh, from Milton, said: "I initially put in a planning application for a dropped kerb and it was refused.</p>
      <p>"There are no double-yellow lines there so I have a right to park outside the business - the council can't tell me where I can and can't park!</p>
      <p>"And why would I pay for them to put double-yellow lines in?"</p>

      <p>He added: "We have taken the building from being a drug den to a tidy office employing six people. I got rid of more than 2,000 needles from the building.</p>
      <p>"I feel like I've been going backwards and forwards with the council and now it wants double-yellow lines."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Council bosses say the double-yellow line demand is linked to the original planning application for the business.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: "We have been absolutely clear that in order for planning permission to be given for the business, new parking restrictions would also be required due to its position next to a very busy junction and the lack of any off-street parking for the vehicle hire business.</p>
      <p>"The need for yellow lines is a direct result of the business being there, and as such they need to pay for the costs associated with the installation."</p>
      <p>The council says it last heard from Josh in July.</p>

      <p>The spokesman added: "Despite being reminded a number of times by letters and site visits, nothing has been done and therefore the business does not have planning permission and remains unauthorised.</p>
      <p>"As a council, we are passionate about supporting businesses in the city and we want to see companies thrive and do well. However, they must follow rules around planning permission.</p>
      <p>"We want to get this situation sorted out as soon as possible but the ball remains in their court.</p>
      <p>"If nothing changes, we will have no choice but to take formal enforcement action to stop the unauthorised use of the premises.</p>
      <p>"We really don't want to go down this road but in the face of our requests and correspondence to the business being continually ignored, we will be left with no choice."</p>
