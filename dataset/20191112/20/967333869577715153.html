      <p>Evo Morales, the now-ousted President of Bolivia, has reached Mexico where he was granted political asylum, with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard welcoming him upon arrival.</p>
      <p>The former Bolivian head of state reached Mexico aboard a Mexican Air Force airplane which flew him from the town of Chimore where he initially retreated after his ouster.</p>

      <p>​Commenting on the current situation, Morales said that Mexico saved his life by providing him refuge, claiming that he was a target of an assassination plot and revealing that both his and his sisters' houses in Bolivia got ransacked.</p>
      <blockquote>Morales also mentioned that he has no intent to abandon politics.</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bolivian indigenous people who support Morales staged a rally in the country's capital of La Paz, in front of the National Congress at Plaza Murillo.</p>

      <p>​On 10 November, Bolivian President Evo Morales resigned after the national armed forces sided with demonstrators who opposed his serving a fourth term. The protests erupted after international observers found "grave irregularities" in the 20 October election.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterwards, Morales fled the country for Mexico, where he was granted political asylum, due to apparent concerns for his safety.</p>
      <p>His flight was fraught with complications as the plane he was traveling aboard was denied permission to fuel in Peru, making a stop in Paraguay instead.</p>
      <p>Several countries, including Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba, and Mexico described the events in Bolivia as a coup.</p>
      <p>Mexico's foreign minister also refused to reveal the names of any Bolivian officials and lawmakers who may have requested asylum, citing the threat they could face.</p>
