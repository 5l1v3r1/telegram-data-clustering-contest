      <p>A family in Alberta returned to their car on Monday to find a giant bison licking the road salt off of their car.</p>
      <p>"As we watched, the owners of the car returned from their hike, and were trying to figure out how to get in the car very respectfully," said the unidentified videographer.</p>
      <p>In the video, it appears the driver got into the car by going through the passenger-side door. The driver slowly pulled away, seemingly leaving the bison disappointed.</p>
      <p>The bison's horns left a number of large scratches on the car.</p>
