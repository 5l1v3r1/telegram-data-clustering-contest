      <p>In torrential rain on Sunday afternoon, Golden Arrows beat Mamelodi Sundowns 3-2 thanks to three goals in the final 30 minutes. Below are four key tactical factors behind the result.</p>
      <p>-          Sundowns lack threat between lines</p>
      <p>-          Arrows play narrow and with one striker</p>
      <p>-          Arrows keep Affonso away from goal</p>
      <p>-          Pitso’s changes lead to late onslaught </p>

        <b>Sundowns Lack Threat Between Lines</b>
      </p>
      <p>For this game, Masandawana were without their four most creative players at playing between the lines - behind the opposition’s midfield. Themba Zwane and Gaston Sirino were out injured, Sibusiso Vilakazi was left on the bench, and Lebohang Maboe was not in the squad.</p>
      <p>As a result, Arrows’ two defensive midfielders in Gladwin Shitolo and Danny Phiri could largely control the space in front of the defence and limit the impact that Sphelele Mkhulise and especially Lyle Lakay could have in their narrow number ten roles. The latter struggled in tight spaces and completed just 51% of his passes whilst the duo lost the ball 40 times between them. </p>

        <b>Arrows Play Narrow, With One Striker</b>
      </p>
      <p>For this tough game, Steve Komphela changed from his usual strategy of playing Knox Mutizwa and Michael Gumede as a strike pairing, and instead used Lindokuhle Mtshali as a number ten to beef up midfield and went with Mutizwa alone up front. With Seth Parusnath and Ntsako Makhubela tucking in from the flanks to compress the middle, it made life difficult for Rivaldo Coetzee and Andile Jali in terms of dictating the tempo.</p>
      <p>Sundowns often had to go around the outside and look for crosses towards Mauricio Affonso or for Thapelo Morena’s dangerous runs into the channels. Of the 16 crosses they delivered into the box, only one reached a teammate and none led to shot for Affonso.  </p>

        <b>Arrows Keep Affonso Away From Goal</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the start of the second period, Arrows defended much higher up the pitch, thereby keeping Affonso a long way from goal. With the Uruguayan not possessing much pace, he could not have much effect running in behind the high line in the second half. This change put greater pressure on Sundowns and allowed Divine Lunga to attack more from left back. It was his cross that was turned in by Mutizwa for the crucial second goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pitso’s Changes Lead to Late Onslaught</b>
      </p>
      <p>In trying to turn the game, Mosimane made effective changes, bringing Jose Ali Meza on for his pace in behind Arrows, and Sibusiso Vilakazi came on to influence the game between the lines. Even though Sundowns only scored their second goal in the 88<sup>th</sup> minute, they still had a chance as Meza opened space with a run and Lyle Lakay was free inside the box but took too long to shoot from a clear opening.  </p>

      </p>
      <p>This was a game where Komphela’s tactics aided his side greatly, but where the game was arguably decided by an error in goal by Denis Onyango, a penalty conceded and some loose Sundowns marking from a cross.</p>
