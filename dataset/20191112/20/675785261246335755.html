      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Labour leader, 70, brushed away concerns about the polls as he told the Mirror: "I’m fit and healthy and very happy"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:39:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has declared he'll stay as Prime Minister for the full five years if he wins a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>Labour's leader told the Mirror he was "fit and healthy and very happy" as he hit the campaign trail in Blackpool today.</p>
      <p>Bookies have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> on just 25/1 to win an overall majority, and a YouGov poll tonight put the Tories 14 points ahead.</p>
      <p>But asked if he believes Labour can win a majority, Mr Corbyn said: "I never comment on opinion polls, I only comment on the prospects of success, and they are very very good."</p>
      <p>Close ally John McDonnell recently indicated the Labour leader, 70, would stand down if he did not win the general election.</p>

      <p>If he wins however, Mr Corbyn said, he plans to stick it out until 2024.</p>
      <p>The Mirror asked him today: "If you win the election, will you commit to serve the full five years of a Parliament as Prime Minister?</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "Absolutely! I’m fit and healthy and very happy."</p>
      <p>Labour's leader made the comments during an interview in Blackpool after announcing an adult education shake-up.</p>
      <p>He confirmed plans to scrap tuition fees "no ifs no buts" and offer every adult six years' free education - with paid time off to study.</p>

      <p>A £3bn-a-year “cradle to grave” National Education Service would enshrine a legal right to take time off to focus on skills.</p>
      <p>And university tuition fees would be scrapped - renewing an £11bn-a-year promise in the 2017 Labour manifesto.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader spoke to the Mirror as dozens of party figures prepare to meet on Saturday to agree on this year's manifesto.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn would not confirm if Labour will renew its 2017 statement that free movement for EU citizens ends after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>He said "ask me after Saturday".</p>
      <p>But signalling a softer approach than the Tories, he said: "We depend on a lot of European workers in this country.</p>
      <p>"And a lot of British people depend on being able to work and travel in Europe. I don’t want to take those opportunities away from either group."</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn also said Ian Byrne - who shared expletive-filled online posts - had "changed".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-labour-backs-candidate-20869126">Labour's ruling NEC tonight kept the West Derby candidate</a> despite outcry from some members about the posts, which called bra tycoon Michelle Mone a "c***" and Tory Esther McVey a "b******".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said the remarks were "disgusting and disgraceful and totally unacceptable" - but the decision was for the NEC.</p>
      <p>He told the Mirror: "My personal view is that he’s explained what went on, explained in the context and the attitude he had at that time in his life, and I hope and believe that he has very much changed his personality and his approach.</p>
      <p>"And I want people to be educated to get away from that kind of disgusting misogynistic language that he’s put forward."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn spoke of his soap fandom <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-coronation-street-star-20869817">while meeting Blackpool-born Corrie actor Nicola Thorp.</a></p>

      <p>"I watch EastEnders and I find it so bizarre I actually enjoy it," he said. "There cannot be such a crime-ridden place in the country that hasn’t had a collective ASBO yet.</p>
      <p>He added: "Sometimes my wife gets quite annoyed with me.</p>
      <p>"I’ve EastEnders on repeat on my iPad, I have something on my computer screen and I have Radio 6 Music on the radio all at the same time.</p>
      <p>"She says ‘you can’t possibly concentrate on three things’.</p>
      <p>"I say no it’s four, because I’ve got the mobile phone as well!"</p>
