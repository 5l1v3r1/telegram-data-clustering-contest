      <p>Rising tides and rain in Venice are flooding the city, and hotels are giving guests knee-high rubber boots so they can slosh their way from one tourist attraction to another.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/photos-venice-flooded-from-rising-tides-and-rain-163315914.html">Yahoo News</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The high water, known locally as “acqua alta”, was amusing for tourists and a nuisance for residents going about their business, but levels were far lower than the 1.94 meters (6ft 4in) in the devastating November 1966 flood.<br/><br/>But even lower levels of the salty high water over the years take their toll on the city, eroding foundations of homes, businesses and city buildings.<br/><br/>Bad weather is continuing to dog Italy, with no real let-up forecast for several days.</blockquote>
