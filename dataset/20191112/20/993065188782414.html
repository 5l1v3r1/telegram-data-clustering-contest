      <p>Speaking at the ITV Palooza event in London, he said: “I represent the silent majority who are sick an tired of snowflake central and the PC culture that is now enveloping every part of our lives.”</p>
      <p>He added on the reaction to this: “I think you’re seeing it everywhere.</p>
      <p>“I think the rise of more populist kind of leaders, like Boris Johnson and Donald Trump, is a complete reaction to this PC culture we’re now being subjected to.</p>
      <p>“When you spend all your time telling people how to live their lives, the Brits that I know eventually go ‘enough’.”</p>
      <p>Morgan would not divulge whether he thought Mr Johnson would win in the upcoming General Election, but said he would reveal his predictions after the vote.</p>
      <p>The presenter attended the ITV Palooza event at the Royal Festival Hall in London, where he was joined by stars of the channel’s biggest shows.</p>
