      <p><b>Ham So Won</b> and<b> Jin Hua</b> are celebrating their daughter<b> Hyejung</b>'s first birthday!</p>
      <p>First birthdays are significant in Korean culture and celebrated with a huge party. Unfortunately, culture clashes between the two Korean and Chinese families marred the happy day with conflict over the food and many other issues. The two mother-in-laws both wanted to dress Hyejung in their respective culture's costume (Qipao and Hanbok), but Hyejung eventually went with a lovely hanbok. </p>
      <p>Netizens have been commenting at the ongoing drama in the family, stating: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"They fight every single week..."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Everyone follows the scripts that the writers write and it's really not entertaining anymore."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"How do you fight at an important celebration like this?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>What do you think?</p>
