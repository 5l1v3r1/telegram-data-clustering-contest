      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The state Assembly's top Republican says he doesn't see any problem with a resolution that recognizes Thanksgiving week as National Bible Week.</p>
      <p>The Assembly is set to vote Tuesday on a resolution that recognizes the week and declares that the reading the Bible has contributed to the moral fiber of society.</p>
      <p>Democratic Minority Leader Gordon Hintz told reporters it seems like GOP lawmakers are starting "holy wars" to distract from a lack of a real agenda.</p>
      <p>Speaker Robin Vos told reporters the Assembly traditionally recognizes different faiths' holidays and "many of us are Christians."</p>
      <p>The vote comes days after Democratic Gov. Tony Evers called the evergreen the state Department of Administration places in the state Capitol every December a holiday tree. Evers' predecessor, Republican Scott Walker, had declared it a Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>Vos says it's clearly a Christmas tree. He says Evers is going through "machinations" to please a tiny group of easily offended people.</p>
