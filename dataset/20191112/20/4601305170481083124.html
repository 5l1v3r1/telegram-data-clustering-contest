      <p>If you have a lot of books at home, a <a href="https://amzn.to/33IvRen">cheap book safe like this</a> is a good way to hide small things. The inside storage area is 2" x 5.625" x 9" and the book looks like a dictionary. (Crooks already know to scan bookshelves for The New English Dictionary, so you should put a jacket from another book on it.)</p>
      <p>It has a lock and two keys to discourage snooping if someone pulls the book off the shelf.</p>
