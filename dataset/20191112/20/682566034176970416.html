      <p>Cape Town - <b>India</b> batsman<b> Ajinkya Rahane</b> feels it is a "different ball game" when facing the pink ball for the first time.</p>
      <p>Rahane was part of a contingent of India's Test squad that has been training with the pink ball under lights as they prepare for their first ever day-night Test against Bangladesh that will take place in Kolkata from November 22.</p>
      <p>Not many India's players have ever played competitive cricket with the pink ball and Rahane spoke about the sessions to reporters.</p>
      <p>Rahane said: "We had two good practice sessions, actually three or four but two with the pink ball, one during the day and one under lights.</p>
      <p>"It was actually exciting. It was the first time I played with pink ball, and definitely it's a different ball game as compared to red ball."</p>
      <p>India batsmen Mayank Agarwal and Cheteshwar Pujara and bowlers Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja took part in the sessions, which were under the supervision of India legend and now NCA director of cricket, Rahul Dravid.</p>
      <p>Like many others before him, Rahane said the pink ball "does a lot more" than the red one in terms of swing and seam.</p>
      <p>The India Test vice-captain continued: "Our focus during the practice session was to look into the swing and seam, and also play close to our body.</p>
      <p>"What we found out after the practice session that the pink ball does a lot (more) than the red ball.</p>
      <p>"We have to play slightly late and close to your body. We had a very good practice session."</p>
      <p>India start their two-match against the Tigers with a red-ball Test in Indore on Thursday.</p>
