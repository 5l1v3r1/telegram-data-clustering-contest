      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 May Feature A New 'SAMOLED' Display</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:39:36+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/ADSoomeet</a></address>
      <p>The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S11 may feature a completely new display technology. The company is developing a new type of display called SAMOLED for next year's Galaxy S flagship, a recent trademark application suggests. The South Korean giant applied trademark for the "SAMOLED" moniker with the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) last week, <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s11-samoled-display/">LetsGoDigital</a> reports.</p>
      <p>In the application, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> describes SAMOLED as "OLED display panels; display for smartphones; television monitors; digital signage; computer screen". This display technology is likely to make its debut with the Galaxy S11 next year. The smartphone launches as early as February 2020, reports suggest. The Galaxy Fold 2 should also be making its way out around the same time, featuring the same SAMOLED display.</p>
      <h3>Samsung SAMOLED display</h3>
      <p>Samsung's recent flagships, the Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10, and the "premium" Galaxy Fold, all feature the first of its kind Dynamic AMOLED display. It is a Super AMOLED panel with HDR10+ support and a super high pixel density. The Galaxy S10's Dynamic AMOLED display was regarded as the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-s10-displaymate-review.html">"best-ever" smartphone display</a> by DisplayMate. Samsung now appears to be all set to up the game further with the Galaxy S11's SAMOLED display.</p>

      <p>It is not clear as to what SAMOLED stands for. The existing iterations of Active-Matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays carry the prefixes "Super" and "Dynamic". SAMOLED, meanwhile, is most likely a portmanteau of Samsung and OLED. Whatever it may be, it is certain to boast significant improvements over the existing smartphone display technology.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the display, the Galaxy S11 will reportedly come in <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/galaxy-s11-series-screen-sizes-revealed-coming-in-february.html">three screen sizes</a>, 6.2 or 6.4-inch, 6.7-inch, and 6.9-inch. The display panels will have a 20:9 aspect ratio, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. There are also talks of a higher 120Hz image refresh rate. As for the design, Samsung is likely to stick with an Infinity-O panel for the Galaxy S11 as well. So the Galaxy S11 will look like the Galaxy A70 or the Galaxy A80, both of which feature a 20:9 display, with a punch hole at the center.</p>
