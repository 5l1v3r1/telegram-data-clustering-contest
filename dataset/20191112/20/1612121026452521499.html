      <p>Google finally <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340645-googles-game-streaming-stadia-service-details-coming-on-june-6/">pulled the back the curtains</a> on Stadia, the hyped up game streaming service that <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338867-google-play-music-proves-why-google-stadia-is-going-to-fail/">everyone’s been wondering about for a few weeks</a>. Not only that, but they’ve given us a solid release date, and a “founder” pre-order package that comes with an exclusive controller and Chromecast Ultra.</p>
      <p>Let’s see what it’s all about.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Availability</h3>
      <p>Okay, so we know Stadia involves <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338444-meet-stadia-googles-platform-for-game-streaming-to-all-of-your-devices/">Google streaming video games</a> from their high-powered servers to any of your devices running Google Chrome. As evidenced by <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/project-stream/">Project Stream</a>, the experience is really good, and it works with several different controllers and peripherals. You do need a fast internet connection, though.</p>
      <p>Google detailed exactly how fast of a connection you’ll need, too.</p>

      <p>If you’re only wanting to stream at minimum settings, 10Mbps should do the trick. The base plan of Stadia (which we’ll get to in a minute) needs about twice that much, while the top-tier, 4K HDR streaming will require around 35Mbps. That’s not <i>too</i> demanding, but it is going to eliminate some people that aren’t around major population centers.</p>
      <p>It’s going live later this year in November, while the free version is delayed until sometime next year.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>So what can you play on Stadia? Well, since Google isn’t just spinning up some Windows servers somewhere, the games will need to be natively ported to Stadia. There are a few major publishers already on board, including heavy hitters like Bethesda with <i>Doom Eternal</i> and <i>Rage 2</i>, Ubisoft with some <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> games, <i>The Division 2</i>, and <i>The Crew 2</i>, and the highly-anticipated <i>Borderlands 3</i>.</p>
      <p>You do have to buy these, though. Google will be giving out some free games a la Xbox Live or Playstation Plus, the first of which will be <i>Destiny 2: The Collection</i>, but this isn’t a Gamepass or Netflix where you can play anything on the service anytime you want. The free tier is excluded from these free games as well.</p>

      <p>Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61153/Red-Dead-Redemption-2-Coming-to-PC-November-5th">confirmed</a> that its AAA title, <b>Red Dead Redemption 2</b>, will launch on Stadia in November. This means that users will be able to stream Arthur Morgan’s saga on Google Stadia to their phones and tablets.</p>

      <h3>Pricing</h3>
      <p>Okay, two tiers. What’s the difference?</p>
      <p>If you pay $9.99 per month, you get access to free games every month, 4K HDR streaming with 5.1 surround sound, and some Stadia-exclusive discounts on games and in-game purchases.</p>
      <p>If you don’t want to pay, you can just buy the games instead of paying the monthly sub. However, you’re limited to 1080p streaming, and it’ll only stream in stereo, not 5.1. That’s a painful downgrade, in my opinion.</p>
      <p>If you want to jump in early, Google is offering a $129 Founder’s Edition that includes three months of Stadia Pro, an exclusive Night Blue controller, a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/chromecast-ultra/">Chromecast Ultra</a>, and access to <i>Destiny 2: The Collection</i> when it arrives in November this year.</p>
      <p>If you figure a Chromecast Ultra is $60 bucks, and three months of Pro will run you $30, you’re getting a nifty controller for about $40. Honestly, not too bad, but it might not be the best deal if you <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/guides/cord-cutting-guides/best-video-streaming-services-2019/">don’t need another Chromecast</a>. I certainly don’t.</p>
