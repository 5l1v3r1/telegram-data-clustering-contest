      <h1>Petition to ‘bring back Don Cherry’ goes viral after immigrant poppy rant</h1>
      <h2>Cherry was fired from his co-hosting role for the Coach’s Corner segment on Nov. 11.</h2>

      <p>Don Cherry being axed from Hockey Night in Canada for a controversial rant over immigrants and Remembrance Day poppies has drawn the ire of thousands of his fans, according to an online petition gaining substantial steam.</p>
      <p>Just shy of 100,000 people had signed a Change.org petition as of noon on Tuesday and their intention is clear: Bring back Don Cherry.</p>
      <p>“Don Cherry is a Canadian icon and a symbol of the working class,” Western Standard said in its petition, which was launched Monday.</p>
      <p>“He may be politically incorrect, and may not have been as careful as he should have in his remarks, but his offence does not warrant firing,” the petition reads.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/sportsnet-and-the-cbc-bring-back-don-cherry?recruiter=468405298&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;utm_term=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;recruited_by_id=20148a10-bcce-11e5-a6da-03a5144585ad&amp;utm_content=fht-18938194-en-ca%3Av12">The petition</a> also takes aim at Sportsnet and CBC, criticizing the media companies for giving into “a mob of Liberals and Twitter activists.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>During Saturday’s Coach’s Corner segment, Cherry said that immigrants don’t wear poppies and don’t support veterans while referring to newcomers as “you people.”</p>
      <p>A number of organizations including the Canadian Legion, as well as Hockey Night in Canada sponsors such as Budweiser, were quick to condemn his comments. Co-host Ron MacLean apologized for staying silent – at one point flashing a thumbs-up – after Cherry’s rant.</p>

      <p>The Canadian Broadcast Standards Council was inundated with complaints over Cherry’s comments, it said on its website. The regulatory organization said it also received a large number of complaints about the firing, but noted that it does not overlook those kinds of matters.</p>
      <p>“The CBSC has no jurisdiction over the employment or operations matters of its member stations, nor can it require a station to remove an on-air host,” the <a href="https://www.cbsc.ca/make-a-complaint/">statement reads</a>.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet network president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry was being removed from his position on Monday.</p>
      <p>But as thousands of sports fans are calling for Cherry to be allowed back, others are already placing bets on <a href="https://www.nelsonstar.com/sports/brian-burke-considered-favourite-to-replace-don-cherry/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">who will replace him</a> in the popular first-intermission segment. SportsBettingDime.com has listed Brian Burke as the favourite.</p>
