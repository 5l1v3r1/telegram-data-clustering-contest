        <b>It’s good news for American gamers, as Minecraft Earth’s Early Access mode has finally landed in the United States.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US is the 10th country to get access to the game’s Early Access mode, along with the UK, Canada, South Korea, the Philippines, Sweden, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland.</p>
      <p>If you’re located in one of the above countries, you can pick up <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/minecraft-earth/id1467316099">Minecraft Earth on iOS here</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftearth">on Android here</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://mspoweruser.com/minecraft-earth-is-here-to-bring-blocks-to-life/">Minecraft Earth is Microsoft’s first mobile AR game</a> and, so far, people’s experiences with it have been pretty positive. In the current Early Access build, players can put down a buildplate and create an interactive Minecraft diorama.</p>
      <p>Players can also find tappables, unlock resources and unique mobs, craft and smelt resources, collaborate with other Early Access builders, and fight hostile mobs in adventures.</p>
      <p>Here are just some of the features that will be available in Minecraft Earth’s full build:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Collecting:</b> Minecraft Earth features many of the mobs that Minecraft players know and love (and potentially hate), along with new ones. The more you play, the higher the chance of discovering unique variants and using them to populate your builds.</li>
        <li><b>Exploring:</b> You can explore the world around you to gather resources, take on challenges, and experience a whole new blocky world.</li>
        <li><b>Collaborating:</b> You can team up with other Minecraft Earth players to craft together! You know what they say – it takes a village to craft a whole bunch of Minecraft creations, or something like that.</li>
        <li><b>Surviving:</b> You can battle Minecraft mobs in real life! Just make sure you don’t stand too close to the Creepers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you want to be one of the first to know which countries will get Early Access next, you can follow the <a href="https://twitter.com/minecraftearth">official Minecraft Earth Twitter accoun</a>t.</p>
      <p>If Minecraft Earth has yet to come to your country, don’t sweat it! Microsoft says that the game should be out globally by the end of 2019. The game will support all the same languages as regular vanilla Minecraft.</p>
      <p>To play Minecraft Earth, you’ll need a mobile device that runs at least Android 7 or iOS 10. You’ll also need a Microsoft or Xbox Live login account.</p>
