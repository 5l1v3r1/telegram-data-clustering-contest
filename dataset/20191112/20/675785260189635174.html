      <h1>Shane Sutton storms out of medical tribunal after extraordinary rant following "doper" claim</h1>
      <h2>The former British Cycling technical director and Team Sky head coach called Dr Richard Freeman "spineless" following allegations he ordered testosterone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:20:32+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Walters, https://www.facebook.com/Mike-Walters-Mirror</a></address>
      <p>Former Team Sky head coach and British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton stormed out of a medical tribunal, furiously denying he was a “doper.”</p>
      <p>Raging Sutton cut short his witness evidence, branding Dr Richard Freeman “spineless” for staying behind a screen, at the hearing to determine former Sky medic's fitness to practise medicine.</p>
      <p>Dr Freeman is alleged to have ordered a batch of 30 Testogel sachets at the national velodrome in Manchester eight years ago, knowing or believing it was to help an athlete enhance performance in breach of anti-doping laws – which he denies.</p>
      <p>In explosive exchanges between Sutton and Freeman's counsel Mary O'Rourke QC, the Aussie mentor had been sensationally branded a “serial liar” and a “doper with a doping history.”</p>

      <p>And Sutton furiously denied a suggestion that the Testogel was to treat his alleged erectile dysfunction, scowling: “My wife wants to come here and testify you're a liar.”</p>
      <p>Miss O'Rourke claimed witnesses had come forward in recent weeks to allege Sutton was “a liar, a doper and a bully.”</p>
      <p>Sutton responded by telling Freeman to “take down the screen,” “man up” and “look me in the eye.”</p>

      <p>After two hours of cross-examination by Miss O'Rourke, Sutton announced he was leaving the hearing and departed with an amazing rant: “He is hiding behind a screen, which is spineless. Richard, you're a spineless individual.</p>
      <p>“I don't need to be dragged through this s*** fight she is dragging me through personally. Am I the one on trial here? I feel like I'm the criminal. It wasn't for me and I never ordered it.”</p>
      <p>Sutton suggested he would be prepared to take a lie detector test to prove he did not order the Testogel sachets.</p>
