      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/superstore-women-amy-dina-pregnant-season-four.html"><i>Superstore</i></a><i>’</i>s Ben Feldman and America Ferrera came by our video studio at Vulture Festival to talk about some of the early roles we know and love them for. And it turns out America Ferrera’s memories of making the Disney Channel Original Movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299943/"><i>Gotta Kick It Up!</i></a><i> </i>are just as fond as the ones we have of watching it — specifically, how on her first day on set she saw Jennifer Aniston <i>and </i>Brad Pitt <i>and </i>George Clooney, together! As you may remember, in the ’90s this was basically every celebrity that existed at the time, so it was a pretty big deal.</p>
