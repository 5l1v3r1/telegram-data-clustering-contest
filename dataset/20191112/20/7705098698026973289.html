      <h1>James Gunn Praises Margot Robbie’s Performance in The Suicide Squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:05:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-suicide-squad"><b>The Suicide Squad</b></a> is currently filming with a number of returning favorites from the first <b>Suicide Squad </b>movie, along with many new faces. But the returning actress that stands out to director James Gunn is Margot Robbie. During a recent Q &amp; A session <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesgunn/?hl=en">on his Instagram account</a>, a fan asked Gunn if he had a chance to work with Robbie yet.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” responded Gunn. “She might be the best actor I’ve ever worked with.”</p>
      <p>That’s the extent of what he had to say about Robbie’s performance. He avoided sharing any kind of spoilers about her third time as Harley Quinn. Robbie will reprise her role for a second time in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/birds-of-prey"><b>Birds of Prey</b></a> early next year.</p>

      <p>Last month, Gunn said that working on the film is the most fun he’s had on a set.</p>
      <p>“They’re all challenging,” explained Gunn via <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482180/james-gunn-says-the-suicide-squad-is-the-most-fun-movie-hes-directed">Cinema Blend</a>. “<b>Super</b> was physically brutal – so much movie and so little time to shoot it. <b>[</b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy"><b>Guardians of the Galaxy</b></a><b>] Vol. 1</b> was scary because I didn’t know if people would get the vibe. <b>[Guardians of the Galaxy] Vol. 2 </b>was the hardest because of my mental state. <b>[The Suicide] Squad </b>is the most complex and biggest but also the most fun so far.”</p>
      <p>As soon as Gunn wraps up production on <b>The Suicide Squad</b>, he will <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/439443-disney-reinstates-james-gunn-for-guardians-of-the-galaxy-3">dive back into <b>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</b></a>.</p>
      <p><b>The Suicide Squad</b> will open on August 6, 2021. What do you think about Gunn working with Robbie on the film? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
