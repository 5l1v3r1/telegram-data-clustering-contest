      <h1>The Batman Just Added an Intriguing New Character</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:30:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Germain Lussier</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, news broke that newcomer Jayme Lawson was joining the cast of Matt Reeves’ <i>The Batman</i>. Who was she playing though? No one knew. Now we do.</p>
      <p>We've now learned Lawson is playing a character named Bella, “a grassroots political candidate running for office in Gotham.” And yes, Bella was the name of Batman actor Robert Pattinson’s love interest in the <i>Twilight</i> movies. We’re guessing that’s a coincidence.</p>
      <p>While there are no characters named “Bella” in the Batman comics, according to <a href="https://collider.com/jayme-lawson-joins-the-batman/">Collider</a> which initially broke the casting news, this is a substantial role. So it seems there’s some kind of political race subplot going on in the film, along with Batman facing off with The Riddler, Penguin, Catwoman and more.</p>
      <p>Lawson is a recent graduate of the Julliard School in New York, one of the most prestigious art, drama, and music schools in the world. So she’s obviously a talent, and she’ll have to be as she joins a cast with Pattinson, Paul Dano, Andy Serkis, Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz, and <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/matt-reeves-batman-has-officially-found-its-jim-gordon-1839399763?_ga=2.134461876.455907054.1573490587-1597414124.1522872342">Jeffery Wright</a>.</p>
      <p>The question everyone is wondering, though, is could Bella be Batgirl? Traditionally that character is Barbara Gordon and, last we heard, Barbara was getting her own movie, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/12/the-writer-of-birds-of-prey-and-batgirl-told-us-her-dc-origin-story/">written by Christina Hodson</a>. So if Bella is a superhero in disguise, she’s probably not her. But, these are comic book movies after all. Anything is possible and anything could change. (Plus, Barbara was briefly a senator in the comics, so a Bat-hero having political roots does have some precedent.)</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Matt Reeves, <i>The Batman</i> opens 25 June 2021.</p>
