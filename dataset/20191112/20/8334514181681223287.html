      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - A union representing Lebanese bank employees called for a strike to continue on Wednesday, its president said, extending industrial action that shut down banks across the country on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>George al-Hajj, president of the Federation of Syndicates of Bank Employees, told Reuters a decision had been taken to extend the strike and a statement would follow shortly.</p>
      <p>The strike has been called over concerns for the safety of bank staff from customers demanding access to their deposits and protesters demonstrating outside branches.</p>
