      <h2>Grandmother-of-four Lesley MacLennan, 85, shot to fame in the 50s while working in Paris with emerging designer Yves Saint Laurent - and has now been noticed for her "poise" by a top fashion photographer</h2>

      <p>A former catwalk model has posed for a fashion shoot in a care home aged 85 after being spotted by a top Vogue photographer.</p>
      <p>Lesley MacLennan, 85, shot to fame in the 50s while working in Paris with emerging designer Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
      <p>She later teamed up with Yves by doing catwalk shows and photo shoots at Dior.</p>
      <p>Grandmother-of-four Lesley now lives in care at Huntington House in Hindhead, Surrey.</p>
      <p>But she has completed one final shoot after high-end fashion photographer James Muller noticed her "poise" while visiting another resident.</p>
      <p>James, whose work has been featured in Vogue, said: "I met Lesley in passing and thought how amazing it would be to capture her beauty again.</p>

      <p>"When I asked her to look my way or turn her face, she did it with such grace – an absolute professional. She was very easy to direct.</p>
      <p>"Age to me is just a number. During our shoot, Lesley was 'that' model again. Age made no difference.</p>
      <p>"I think there aren't enough older models out there in the media. In many ways, social media is telling us that it's wrong to age, but it's such a natural thing.</p>
      <p>"There is so much beauty in ageing too - we've just been taught to look at it the wrong way."</p>
      <p>Lesley began modelling in her early 20s after her mum spotted her potential and emigrated to France to further her career.</p>
      <p>She met Yves around the time he enjoyed his big break - when the 21-year-old was named Dior's head designer.</p>

      <p>Stunning black and white photos taken 60 years ago show a young Lesley posing in glamorous coats and large, furry hats.</p>
      <p>And the mum-of-two has lost none of her passion for modelling despite being in a care home,</p>
      <p>After spending a day posing for James Lesley said: "I thoroughly enjoyed the photo shoot.</p>
      <p>"James made me feel perfectly at ease, he was the real McCoy. I would have said so if he wasn’t.</p>
      <p>"The red and black outfit was so vibrant, it was stunning. I just thought it was a dream.''</p>
      <p>James added: "I feel very honoured to have photographed Lesley, she has lived such a colourful life and to be a small part of it is magical.</p>
      <p>"She’s an absolute delight."</p>

      <p>Charlie Hoare, director of the Huntington and Langham Estate where Huntington House is based, added: "To see her back in front of the camera was just incredible - she’s never lost her sparkle.</p>
      <p>Sarah Chapman, another Huntington and Langham Director, said: "Age shouldn't matter.</p>
      <p>"With these experiences, they can really come out of themselves, and just enjoy the days, just like they were in their 20s and 30s."</p>
