      <p>Frenkie de Jong has looked back on his first few months with Barcelona in an interview with Fox Sports while back in the Netherlands on international duty.</p>
      <p>The Dutch midfielder is optimistic about the future and grateful for all the praise he has received since moving to Camp Nou for 75 million euros in the summer.</p>
      <p>De Jong laughed when it was suggested he's now the main midfielder, ahead of Sergio Busquets and Arthur Melo: "Haha. I don't know... the newspapers can exaggerate. To be honest I don't pay much attention to all that, but of course, I like that the analysis on me is positive."</p>
      <p>He added that playing in different midfield positions has accelerated his adaption to the team: "I am playing in all the positions in midfield. Sometimes as a No.6, other times on the left, sometimes on the right. The important thing is to play, the more games the better, because it accelerates the connection with the players around you."</p>
      <p>De Jong avoided making a controversial comment when it was suggested some of the Barça players are not in the best shape physically at the moment.</p>
      <p>"Maybe that's your impression," he said. "I am doing great at Barça and I want to keep improving. I hope at the end of the season we're able to look back on a great campaign."</p>
