      <p>One would think that the pressures of being the top spokesman for a president who has made more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/">13,000 false or misleading</a> since taking office would outweigh those of competing in a TV dance competition, but Sean Spicer insists it’s actually the other way around.</p>
      <p>The former White House press secretary was booted off “Dancing With the Stars” on Monday, and on Tuesday he dropped by <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/12/sean-spicer-dwts-harder-than-trump-exclusive-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i>‘s “DWTS” podcast “Eye on the Ball”</a> to share his experiences on the show.</p>
      <p>According to Spicer, not only did he lost more than 20 pounds during the show, he also surpassed his own expectations for how long he would last.</p>

      <p>“My goal going into this was to make at least one week of eliminations,” he explains. “It was my birthday on that first elimination, my family was here and all I wanted to do was not have to fly to New York that night. And then beyond that it’s just grown. It has exceeded my expectations in every way. And I’ve been so, so proud and honoured to be part of this season.”</p>
      <p>Asked to compare the stress of doing the show to his much-maligned tenure as press secretary, Spicer admitted that “the show was worse… And I don’t mean worse than a bad way. I mean…. How about this: it was greater.”</p>
      <p>He elaborated: “I think it’s a combination of two things. One, yes, it’s way out of my comfort zone. And two is, when you’re dealing with incoming questions, you can figure out how to punt the question, divert it. When you’re out on a dance floor for a minute-and-a-half, you have to go. And you can’t hide and you can’t defer to somebody else. And every step that you take, is going to be watched and viewed and judged.”</p>
