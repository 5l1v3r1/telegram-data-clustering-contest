      <h1>KZN rescue teams search for 7-year-old who was swept off bridge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Kaveel Singh</a></address>
      <p>The heavy rains in KwaZulu-Natal have struck again, this time claiming a seven-year-old boy who was swept away while walking home from school.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, IPSS spokesperson Dylan Meyrick said rescue teams were searching the Nonoti River in Darnell, Durban.</p>
      <p>"The [seven-year-old] was walking home from school and was washed off a low-level bridge. The river is in full flood."</p>
      <p>The search had to be called off at around 17:30 due to poor weather conditions and lightning, said IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst.</p>
      <p>"The search will continue at first light tomorrow [Wednesday] morning, weather dependent," he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the KwaZulu-Natal Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) department has activated councillors and volunteers to assist affected communities after a tornado formed in New Hanover, just outside Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The tornado, according to Cogta, "ripped through the area, injuring scores of people and damaging homes and public infrastructure".</p>
      <p>On Monday, an elderly Amaoti couple Nomathamsanqa Nyangule, 55, and Simangaliso Zondo, 69, died after the roof and wall of their house collapsed on them at around 21:00.</p>
