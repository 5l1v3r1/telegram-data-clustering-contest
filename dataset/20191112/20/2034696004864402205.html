      <p>In a statement, Yo La Tengo said: “When our old friend Randy Poster asked us to contribute to an album of Hanukkah songs he was putting together, we were kind of stumped. As non-practicing Jews (and non-Jews), truthfully the holiday has little meaning for us (that’s the meta joke behind Yo La Tengo’s Hanukkah shows), but we were open to inspiration.</p>
      <p>“We thought maybe another friend, Sam Elwitt, could crack the code, and we think he did a fantastic job with his composition ‘Eight Candles’.”</p>
      <p>Haim’s cover of ‘If It Be Your Will’ will follow on from <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/haim-now-im-in-it-single-2561926">‘Now I’m In It</a>‘, released last month. It marked the second single from the California trio this year, with ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/track/haim-summer-girl-track-review">Summer Girl</a>‘ arriving back in July.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/haim-interview-now-im-in-it-summer-big-read">Bassist Este Haim, meanwhile, has explained to <i>NME</i> that she’s grown tired of the ‘bass face’ meme</a>. “They wouldn’t say it to a dude, who’s feeling the music when he’s playing,” she said of the posts which highlight her onstage appearance.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-leonard-cohens-tranquil-new-video-happens-to-the-heart-2560818">new Leonard Cohen song, ‘Happens to the Heart’</a>, arrived last month.</p>
