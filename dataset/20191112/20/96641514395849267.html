      <h1>Disney+ cuts off 'Simpsons' jokes with widescreen episodes</h1>
      <h2>It may have learned nothing from FXX's initial disrespect for 4:3.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:17:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>The Disney+ launch didn't just have some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error.html">technical hiccups</a> -- it also irritated <i>The Simpsons</i> fans. Viewers have <a href="https://twitter.com/TristanACooper/status/1194298167824650240">discovered</a> that all classic <i>Simpsons</i> episodes are the cropped widescreen versions, not the 4:3 originals that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/02/14/simpsons-world-streams-in-4-3-ratio/">FXX brought back</a> in 2015. And just like four years ago, that decision wrecks some sight gags, such as the revelation that all of Duff's beers come from the same source. There are also instances where the picture has been stretched to fit the modern TV aspect ratio.</p>
      <p>We've asked Disney for comment, although sources talking to Engadget said the company will listen to feedback.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't be surprising if Disney had a change of heart. The 4:3 versions are clearly available for streaming given that Disney owns FXX. There's not much stopping the company from simply posting those editions instead of or alongside the widescreen variants. For now, though, you'll have to make do with watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCl-HXllGI0">Mr. Plow</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgqtBm_oUpc">nuclear plant strike</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAJHDiO8Fr0">Talkin' Softball</a> with some conspicuous black bars.</p>
