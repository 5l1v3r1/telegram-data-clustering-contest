      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Federal Interior Minister Ejaz Shah on Tuesday clarified that there is no deal or NRO in case of Nawaz’s removal from ECL.</p>
      <p>Talking exclusively in Dunya News program “On The Front,” he said Nawaz is being given health facilities on human grounds and Asif Zardari can also avail heath facilities if medical board recommends so.</p>
      <p>He said PM Imran Khan had barred ministers from doing politics on health on Nawaz Sharif and provided all possible facilities. He said PM Imran listens to his ministers, adding that a person is put or removed on ECL on the recommendation of institutes and cabinet approves it.</p>
      <p>Shah said PM has said that Nawaz can get his treatment abroad but it does not mean he stays there for whole life.</p>
      <p>Answering about JUI-F’s Azadi March, he said every one gave opinion on the sit-in and we never created hurdles in the path of March.</p>
