      <h1>Lewis Ferguson's Dad reacts to Rangers 'interest' as speculation over Aberdeen future continues</h1>
      <h2>Former Rangers midfielder Derek was asked after reports linking Rangers with a big money move.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T20:58:51+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>With a family that includes two former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> players, one a legendary, treble winning captain, speculation linking <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lewis-ferguson">Lewis Ferguson</a> with a move to Ibrox was always going to have a certain synergy to it.</p>
      <p>Reports surfaced yesterday that new Rangers Sporting Director Ross Wilson fancies the combative midfielder as a replacement for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> should English interest manifest itself in an offer that can't be refused.</p>
      <p>Kamara has been scouted by Fulham, Leeds and Brighton in recent weeks as news of the Finnish international's enviable ball-retention skills have spread.</p>
      <p>It was a topic of discussion on tonight's BBC Sportsound as host Kenny McIntyre grilled Lewis' father Derek, a regular BBC pundit, on the potential for a move to Govan.</p>
      <p>But Ferguson poured cold water on a deal, claiming that Aberdeen is the perfect place for the talented 20-year-old's development.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07tsgb1">Sportsound</a> : "I've heard nothing. All I can say is that he's really happy up there at the moment.</p>
      <p>"The coaching staff have been absolutely top drawer, not just <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes</a> but the guys in the background.</p>
      <p>"He's well looked after and if we are talking about development there's no better place than where he is."</p>
