      <p>SYDNEY: Former Australian all-rounder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shane-Watson">Shane Watson</a> has been appointed the President of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Australian-Cricketers'-Association">Australian Cricketers' Association</a> (ACA).</p>
      <p>The appointment was made at the ACA AGM which took place on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Watson is part of an extended 10-person board which includes three new appointments: current Australian players Pat Cummins and Kristen Beams, and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> commentator and former Australian cricketer, Lisa Sthalekar.</p>
      <p>"I am truly honoured to be elected as the President of the ACA as it evolves into the future. I have big shoes to fill with the people who have gone before me and I am super excited about this opportunity to continue to give back to the game that has given me so much," Watson tweeted following his appointment.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old further praised <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cricket-Australia">Cricket Australia</a>'s parental policy for women cricketers. "</p>
      <p>This policy, amid a host of other changes, assures Australian women that cricket is a sport which can now support you and your family. And for girls coming through who love sport, like my daughter, it says that cricket is a sport where you'll be able to have a career."</p>
      <p>The all-rounder had represented Australia in 59 Tests, 190 ODIs and 58 T20Is.</p>
      <p>The expanded board is part of a revised governance structure for the ACA, which now also manages the Australian Cricketers' Retirement Account, which benefits Australia's professional cricketers once their careers are over.</p>
      <p>The revised structure also splits the role of President and Chair, which will continue to be held by Greg Dyer.</p>
      <p>Last week, Cricket Australia had appointed former player Melanie Jones as their director.</p>
