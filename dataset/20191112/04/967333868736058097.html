        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Russian satellite grouping has 23 operational satellites, with two in maintenance, one spare and one in a flight test phase.

      <p>Russia is planning to launch about 30 global navigation satellites which will be added to its aging navigation satellite constellation, according to revealed documents.</p>
      <p>According to the documents, 20 carrier rockets will be used to launch 28 satellites in 2021-2030.</p>

      <p>Over the past five years, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201806171065481287-russian-military-launch-navy-satellite/">Russia has been launching</a> no more than two navigation satellites annually. At the same time, the majority of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201811301070263324-russia-glonassmoon-orbit-deployment/">the Russian satellites</a> in orbit had multiple problems in 2019 due to the expired warranty period. </p>

      <p>Next-generation satellites transmit more navigation signals and have a longer design life - up to 10 years - in comparison with <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201906201075970492-cutting-edge-russian-glonass-m-navigation-satellite-to-begin-operation-soon---statement/">old-generation devices</a>.</p>
      <p>The system provides 24-hour navigation services, including highly accurate location information and precise time to users.</p>
