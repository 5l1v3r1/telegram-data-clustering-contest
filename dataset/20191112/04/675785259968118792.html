      <p>A British couple were subjected to a brutal three-minute assault after they wre set upon by thugs while on a romantic break in Paris.</p>
      <p>Christopher Williams, 27, says he was dragged for 50 metres behind a car after confronting thugs who heckled girlfriend Rebecca Kevan's bunny outfit.</p>
      <p>The pair had been out for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> when a car suddenly pulled up beside them.</p>
      <p>Christopher, who was dressed a Grim Reaper, had asked the thugs to stop catcalling Rebecca, but was pulled through the front passenger-side window.</p>

      <p>Rebecca, 21, was herself punched in the face several times, suffering head trauma and a fractured finger.</p>
      <p>During the three-minute attack, both their noses were broken, Rebecca suffered heavy facial bruising and Christopher's tooth was chipped.</p>
      <p>Christopher, from Liverpool, described the attack as an "unexpected, aggressive assault on two innocents enjoying a night in Paris".</p>

      <p>He said: "It was without doubt the scariest moment of our lives to date - we've never experienced anything so horrifying in our lives.</p>
      <p>"The attack ruined our entire trip, which cost us thousands of pounds and left us with nasty injuries and a mixed bag of memories.</p>
      <p>"I suppose you just don't expect something like that to happen on the streets of the capital of a civilised country.</p>
      <p>"We were prey to a barbaric, vicious attack, and I thank God that pedestrians was passing by when it was happening.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how the whole thing would have ended if we weren't saved."</p>

      <p>Christopher and barmaid Rebecca spent around £3,000 to holiday in Paris for six days last October.</p>
      <p>Staying at the Grand H tel Nouvel Opra, they had visited popular sites including the Champs- lys es, the Eiffel Tower, and Montmartre.</p>
      <p>They decided to 'paint the town red' for Halloween, hitting trendy bars around the busy Place de la Bastille until 4am the next day.</p>
      <p>"As we slowly made our way back to the hotel, this small hatchback car pulled up alongside Rebecca and started heckling her," Christopher said.</p>
      <p>"I don't speak French, so I don't know what they were actually saying - but it was clear they took a shining to the way she was dressed.</p>

      <p>"Rebecca was in this small dress. To be honest, the way they were with her had the feel of sexual harassment or assault of a kind.</p>
      <p>"There's no way they'd have picked on a group of lads."</p>
      <p>Christopher then stood in between Rebecca and the vehicle, where he says he then asked them to stop heckling his nervous girlfriend.</p>
      <p>He explained: "I thought they'd just f*** off if I asked them to. I didn't expect what happened next to happen because of it."</p>
      <p>He said the front passenger suddenly reached out and yanked his arm, pulling it through the open window.</p>

      <p>He was then dragged up the road as the car accelerated away, leaving terrified Rebecca to chase them in high heels.</p>
      <p>Three minutes later the thugs fled after heroic passersby intervened and called emergency services.</p>
      <p>Christopher and Rebecca were rushed to Hospital Saint-Antoine Ap-Hp and treated for their injuries, before reporting the assault to police the next day.</p>
      <p>Now back in the UK, barmaid Rebecca has been forced to take time off work because she can't conceal her facial injuries with make-up.</p>

      <p>And Christopher is having dental surgery to fix his chipped front tooth.</p>
      <p>Battered and bruised, the pair have been left "shaken and scarred" by the assault, and "hope these b***ds can be brought to justice".</p>
      <p>Christopher added: "It's nasty enough me being attacked by a group of guys in a foreign city, but it's even worse thinking it happened to Rebecca.</p>
      <p>"Women shouldn't have to put up with men preying on them. They should be able to enjoy a night out in town on Halloween without worrying.</p>
      <p>"There's no excuse for what these men did, and I hope the police catch them. <br/>"It was a genuine Halloween nightmare."</p>
