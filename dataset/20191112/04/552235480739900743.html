      <h2>Marcus Miller was charged £250 to create a black stubble effect all over his head in a series of excruciatingly painful sittings.</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/family-kids/cancer-young-scot-nominee-students-20858916">cancer</a> survivor has been left with a blue scalp after a tattooist botched his fake hair cover up.</p>
      <p>Marcus Miller lost his thick locks after a series of gruelling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/cancer-patients-agony-claims-sick-20850518">chemotherapy treatments</a> three years ago.</p>
      <p>The brutal treatment cured his testicular cancer but it left the 48-year-old, from Harthill in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/mums-fury-treated-like-criminal-20847762">Lanarkshire</a>, with alopecia – or permanent hair loss.</p>
      <p>The dad of two suffered from depression and low self-esteem following his illness and turned to tattooist Jen Watkins for help.</p>
      <p>Watkins, who ran Jezebelle Ink, in Armadale, West Lothian, promised to improve his look but instead left him in an even worse state.</p>
      <p>She charged Marcus £250 to create a black stubble effect all over his head in a series of excruciatingly painful sittings.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately she botched the job and he was left with a dark blue, full-head tattoo that he says left him unable to leave the house.</p>
      <p>Marcus alleged that Watkins also tattooed the initial J at the back of his head – a claim that she denies.</p>
      <p>He told us: “It’s been a total nightmare from start to finish. First, I had to deal with the cancer, then I had to get used to my hair loss and to top it off, the terrible tattoo.</p>
      <p>“It has left me really low and depressed. I can’t go anywhere now without a hat and I am conscious of my blue head everywhere I go.</p>
      <p>“I even had to wear a tammy to some of my friends’ funerals. It’s been terrible.”</p>
      <p>And he added: “When someone pointed out her initial on the tattoo I was even more angry. It was like she has branded me.”</p>
      <p>In the past two years, desperate Marcus has spent £1500 on two specialist wigs to hide the tattoo.</p>

      <p>But earlier this year his luck changed when he met Stevie Barry, boss of Laser Tattoo Removal Scotland, who promised to help.</p>
      <p>Stevie has offered his services for free to try to remove or alter the tattoo and improve Marcus’s quality of life.</p>
      <p>Stevie told us: “When I heard Marcus’ story I knew I had to do something to help. He has been through so much – this is the last thing he needed. The tattoo is one of the worst we’ve ever seen.</p>
      <p>“Laser removal treatments can be pretty painful on the scalp, so we’re trying to treat his tattoo in stages.</p>
      <p>“We’re making a difference to it but it’s going to take a few more sessions.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Stevie has put Marcus in touch with award-winning company Skulltec in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Experts there use micro needles to layer pigment dots on a scalp in a process that resembles getting a tattoo.</p>
      <p>The treatment creates the illusion of a full head of shaved hair, similar to multiple tiny tattoos.</p>
      <p>Watkins refused to discuss the tattoo when approached by the Record.</p>
      <p>But her husband sent a series of text messages to us about the inking.</p>
      <p>He claimed Marcus has not contacted her to complain about his head tattoo and that she has now retired from her job due to ill health.</p>
      <p>He said: “If a client is unhappy with a tattoo they are able to make a claim via the insurance of the shop.</p>
      <p>“Also, when you consent to a tattoo, you give your written acknowledgment that ink can change and discolour and react.</p>
      <p>“And that being the case, all studios are required to have insurance to cover any such eventualities.</p>
      <p>“Jen’s studio had impeccable records from environmental health and from regular <br/>inspections. She retired from tattooing due to chronic illness.”</p>
