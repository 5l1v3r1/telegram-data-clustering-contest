      <h1>A US Federal Court Finds Suspicionless Searches of Phones at the Border is Illegal</h1>

      <p>A federal court in Boston has ruled that the government is not allowed to search travelers' phones or other electronic devices at the U.S. border <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/federal-court-suspicionless-searches-illegal/">without first having reasonable suspicion of a crime</a>. From a report:<i> That's a significant victory for civil liberties advocates, who say the government's own rules allowing its border agents to search electronic devices at the border without a warrant are unconstitutional. The court said that the government√¢(TM)s policies on warrantless searches of devices without reasonable suspicion "violate the Fourth Amendment," which provides constitutional protections against warrantless searches and seizures. The case was brought by 11 travelers -- ten of which are U.S. citizens -- with support from the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who said border agents searched their smartphones and laptops without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing or criminal activity. The border remains a bizarre legal grey area, where the government asserts powers that it cannot claim against citizens or residents within the United States but citizens and travelers are not afforded all of their rights as if they were on U.S. soil. The government has long said it doesn't need a warrant to search devices at the border.</i></p>
