      <p>NEW DELHI: Sports ministry and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-Olympic-Association">Indian Olympic Association</a> (IOA) are back to fighting over the 'Sports Code.' IOA has renewed its threat of Indian athletes participating at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Olympic-Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IOC">IOC</a>) flag if Indian government challenges its autonomy.</p>
      <p>The latest stand-off is the result of a letter sent by the ministry (on October 23, 2019), in which it sought the IOA's views and its acceptance of the 'Draft National Code for Good Governance in Sports 2017'.</p>
      <p>IOA president Narinder Batra has written back, saying that when the ministry had proposed to set-up a "small committee" during the October 11, 2019 meeting with the IOA/NSF officials here to discuss the draft Code, what had suddenly changed now.</p>
      <p>"The interference in autonomy will be taken seriously by the IOC and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Olympic-Council-of-Asia">Olympic Council of Asia</a> (OCA), as it can once again lead to suspension of IOA membership. We certainly hope that it is not the intention of the ministry to send the Indian contingent to Tokyo under IOC flag and not the Indian flag," Batra wrote to ministry in a letter which is in possession of TOI.</p>
      <p>These are the arguments put forward by Batra in the letter:</p>
      <p><b>Age, tenure and cooling-off period: </b>Remove the limitation of the cooling period, which has micro and macro level impact.</p>
      <p>It is proposed 75 years as the age limit as opposed to the existing 70 years.</p>
      <p><b>Governance and management: </b>IOA objects to including vice-president and two joint secretaries as office-bearers of the NOC. It also rejects any position for a government nominee on the Board of the NOC/NSFs or the government's move to nominate/appoint athletes commission in the NOC/NSFs.</p>
      <p>IOA will appoint an interim committee if an NSF is suspended.</p>
      <p><b>Politicians and government servants: </b>Rejects the restriction on politicians to be on the board of sports organisations and the provision, saying it is "discriminatory and unfair".</p>
      <p><b>Financial integrity: </b>IOA opposes the proposal of bringing in CAG audit of NOC/IOA as the IOA doesn't avail government funding for its administration.</p>
