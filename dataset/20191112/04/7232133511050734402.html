      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few hours, there was an increase in selling on ripple below the $0.2840 resistance area against the US Dollar. XRP/USD mostly followed a bearish path below $0.2800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the price moved below the last low and traded to a new weekly low near $0.2682. At the moment, the price is correcting higher above $0.2720. Moreover, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2852 high to $0.2682 low.</p>
      <p>However, there are many resistances for ripple on the upside near the $0.2765 and $0.2780 levels. Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2852 high to $0.2682 low is near the $0.2765 level.</p>
      <p>More importantly, yesterday’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/ripple-xrp-price-facing-hurdles-eth-btc-recovering-nicely/">major bearish trend line is active</a> with resistance near $0.2800 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The 100 hourly SMA is also positioned near the trend line and $0.2800 to act as a barrier for the bulls.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a clear break above the trend line, $0.2800, and the 100 hourly SMA could start a decent increase. The next key resistance is near the $0.2840 level, above which there are chances of more upsides towards the $0.3000 resistance area.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $0.2700 level. If there is another bearish break below the $0.2700 support, the price could even decline below the $0.2682 low. The next key supports on the downside are near the $0.2650 and $0.2640 levels.</p>
