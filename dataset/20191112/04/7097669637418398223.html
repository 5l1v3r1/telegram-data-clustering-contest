      <h1>Meet the B-21: America's Futuristic Long-Range Stealth Bomber</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T04:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Kris Osborn</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> America's new B-21 bomber will be very advanced and difficult to stop.</p>
      <p>The Air Force’s stealthy long-range bomber will have the endurance and next-generation stealth capability to elude the most advanced existing air defenses and attack anywhere in the world, if needed, senior service officials said.</p>
      <p>When the Air Force revealed its first artist rendering of what its new Long Range Strike – Bomber looks like, former Air Force Secretary Deborah James made reference to plans to engineer a bomber able elude detection from even the best, most cutting-edge enemy air defenses.</p>
      <p>"Our 5th generation global precision attack platform will give our country a networked sensor shooter capability enabling us to hold targets at risk anywhere in the world in a way that our adversaries have never seen," James said when revealing the image last year.</p>
      <p>However, while Air Force developers say the emerging B-21 will introduce new stealth technologies better suited to elude cutting-edge air defenses, Russian media reports have recently claimed that stealth technology is useless against their air defenses. Russian built S-300 and S-400 air defenses are believed to be among the best in the world; in addition, The <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/"><u>National Interest</u></a> has reported that Russia is now working on an S-500 system able to destroy even stealthy targets at distances up to 125 miles.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, James added that the new bomber will be able to “play against the real threats.”</p>
      <p>Although official details about the B-21 are, quite naturally, not available - some observers have pointed out that the early graphic rendering of the plane does not show exhaust pipes at all; this could mean that the Air Force has found a new method or releasing fumes or reducing the heat signature of the new stealth plane.</p>
      <p>The new bomber, called the B-21, was formally named the "Raider" through a formal naming competition involving members of the Air Force, their families and other participants.</p>
      <p>The Air Force has awarded a production contract to Northrop Grumman to engineer its new bomber. The LRS-B will be a next-generation stealth aircraft designed to introduce new stealth technology and fly alongside - and ultimately replace - the service’s existing B-2 bomber.</p>
