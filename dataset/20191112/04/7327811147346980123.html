      <p>ATLANTA -- Former president Jimmy Carter was hospitalized Monday night in Atlanta, his spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>The official Carter Foundation said in a tweet that the 95-year-old is at Emory University Hospital for a procedure "to relieve pressure on his brain, caused by bleeding due to his recent falls."</p>
      <p>The procedure is scheduled for Tuesday morning, the statement said. Carter's wife Rosalynn is with him at the hospital and he is resting comfortably, his spokesperson said.</p>

      <p>Carter is the oldest surviving president.</p>
      <p>He was hospitalized twice in October for falls, including one at his Georgia home in which he <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/society/former-pres-jimmy-carter-hospitalized-after-fall/5637644/">sustained a minor fracture to his pelvis</a>. In May he underwent surgery after falling and breaking his hip while leaving for a hunting trip. He also received a dire cancer diagnosis in 2015 but survived and has since said he is cancer-free.</p>
      <p>Nearly four decades after he left office and despite a body that's failing after 95 years, the nation's oldest-ever ex-president still teaches Sunday school roughly twice a month at Maranatha Baptist Church in his tiny hometown of Plains in southwest Georgia. His message is unfailingly about Jesus, not himself.</p>
      <p>Rev. Tony Lowden, Carter's pastor, said the ex-president was hospitalized Monday on what he called "a rough day."</p>
      <p>"We just need the whole country to be in prayer for him," Lowden said in a telephone interview.</p>
      <p>The church has announced that Carter will not be teaching his Sunday school class this week.</p>
