      <p>The 60-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> judge has been shedding the pounds recently and his new slimmer frame was in the spotlight as he arrived at Heart Radio.</p>
      <p>The music mogul has lost more than 20lb in weight and the TV talent judge has put it down to him turning to a vegan diet.</p>
      <p>Simon arrived at the Leicester Square studios in a chauffuer-driven Rolls Royce so that he could appear on the breakfast show with Jamie Theakston and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amanda-holden">Amanda Holden</a> , who sits with Simon on the Britain's Got Talent judges desk.</p>

      <p>Simon had previously revealed his new physique while stripping off in Barbados as he enjoyed a sunshine break.</p>
      <p>X Factor: Celebrity viewers were shocked to see Simon's toned body as they took to social media in their droves to pass comment on his slim legs, as he relaxed at his Malibu home during auditions.</p>
      <p>Simon's appearance in the capital yesterday was a rare chance for fans to get up close and personal and there was genuine shock as to slender her looked.</p>

      <p>After being rushed to hospital, Simon said that doctors advised that he should cut out the sausage rolls and hamburgers.</p>
      <p>He also had a penchant for jam tarts that were made especially by his own personal chefs.</p>
      <p>Doctors also warned Simon that his waking hours had to change after the Britiain's Got Talent supremo admitted to living "like a vampire."</p>

      <p>Simon revealed that he was not falling a asleep until 8am in the morning after staying up all night.</p>
      <p>He admitted to The Sun previously, in his usual modest manner: “If I was on a one to ten scale of being handsome, I was an eight and now I’ve gone to an 11.”</p>
      <p>Simon said that he changed his diet withing 24 hours of fall and "not looked back since." He added "you feel better, you look better.</p>
      <p>“I cut out a lot of the stuff I shouldn’t have been eating and that was primarily meat, dairy, wheat, sugar — those were the four main things.”</p>

      <p>“Once you get into a pattern I’ve found it quite enjoyable. It has helped me sleep and I wake up feeling less tired.</p>
      <p>"I noticed a massive difference in how I felt in about a week.</p>
      <p>“I have more energy and focus and it wasn’t difficult.</p>
      <p>"I don’t like to use the word diet because that’s the reason I never went on a diet before — the word diet makes me miserable.”</p>
      <p>What doesn't upset him any more is looking at his new figure in the mirror, which no doubt tells him he's the 'most handsome of them all'.</p>
