      <h1>Scottish Labour turmoil over probe into 'Israel is like a child abuser' candidate</h1>
      <h2>Senior Labour figures are unhappy about the probe into Kate Ramsden.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T04:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>The chair of Scottish Labour has criticised an internal party investigation into a former candidate who quit after comparing Israel to a child abuser.</p>
      <p>Cara Hilton said the probe into Kate Ramsden appeared to suggest it was a “problem” to support Palestine.</p>
      <p>Leaked emails also show that Simon Macfarlane, senior trade unionist who is a member of his party’s governing body, claimed his union supported Ramsden.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/labour-close-gap-tories-latest-20850430">Scottish Labour’s election campaign</a> suffered a twin blow last week after two candidates dropped out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Frances Hoole was removed in Edinburgh South West after sharing a social media post about SNP opponent Joanna Cherry.</p>
      <p>Ramsden, who was contesting Gordon, then withdrew over a blog post she wrote:</p>
      <p>“To me, the Israeli state is like an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.”</p>
      <p>She added: “Like child abuse, it has to stop...As we intervene with child abusers, the international community needs to intervene with Israel.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labour-rule-out-any-deal-20826795">Scottish Labour</a> intended to re-interview her, but Ramsden quit and issued a fulsome apology:</p>
      <p>“I can see that many Jewish people have been hurt by my words. That was never my intention and I apologise unreservedly.</p>
      <p>“I reflected on it and decided to delete the post. This was my decision. I was not directed to do so.”</p>

      <p>However, it can be revealed that figures on the Scottish party’s Executive privately criticised the internal probe which pulled together Ramsden’s comments on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/jeremy-corbyn-promises-probe-claim-20847226">Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>
      <p>Macfarlane, a regional organiser for Unison, informed colleagues:</p>
      <p>“Is this the normal format of a compliance report? Is there any contact made with Kate in its compilation? Is there no recommendations? I find the report very unsatisfactory.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Kate is a Social Worker (Children’s Rights Officer). It is understandable she would write in emotive terms about this. UNISON will support Kate one of our NEC members.”</p>
      <p>Hilton, who is also the Labour candidate for Dunfermline and West Fife, responded:</p>
      <p>“I’d echo Simon’s concerns about this report into Kate Ramsden.</p>
      <p>“It appears to suggest that any support for the Palestinian cause is a problem in a potential candidate.”</p>
      <p>Tory MSP Maurice Golden said: “Scotland’s Jewish community will be appalled at these exchanges. It’s right that the candidate for Gordon quit and, if Ms Hilton finds that so objectionable, perhaps she should consider her position too.”</p>
      <p>The row comes after Scottish Labour removed another candidate, Bill Curran, earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Curran wrote that he stood with controversial MP Chris Williamson, who was suspended after claiming Labour had been “too apologetic” over the row about anti-Jewish sentiment in the party.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Labour spokesperson said: "We don't comment on leaks."</p>
