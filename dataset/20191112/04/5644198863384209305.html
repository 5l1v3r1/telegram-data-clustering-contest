      <p>WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday (Nov 11) condemned "unjustified use of deadly force" in the latest Hong Kong violence and urged police and civilians alike to de-escalate the situation, a senior Trump administration official said.</p>
      <p>The US statement came after <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-police-shoot-protester-sai-wan-ho-12081540">Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester</a> and a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-man-set-on-fire-police-investigating-12082718">man was set on fire</a> in violence that prompted leader Carrie Lam to denounce "enemies of the people."</p>

      <p>"Hong Kong police and civilians alike have a responsibility to de-escalate and avoid violent confrontations," the US administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, after a weekend of stepped-up clashes in pro-democracy protests across the Chinese-ruled territory, a former British colony.</p>
