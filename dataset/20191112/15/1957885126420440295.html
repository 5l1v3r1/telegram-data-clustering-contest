      <p><b>News</b> by Imogen Beckhelling, Reporter Intern Updated on 12 November 2019</p>
      <p>Epic Games has acquired photogrammetry startup Quixel and made more than 10,000 Megascan assets free for Unreal Engine developers.</p>
      <p>For those that don't know, Megascans is an online library which holds high-resolution scans of real world things. These can then be used to create ultra-realistic imagery in films and games.</p>
      <p>"For the past decade, we have travelled to every corner of the world to build Megascans, and we have created tools that help artists focus on creativity," Quixel co-founder Teddy Bergsmen said. "Our mission is to scan the world and to build an ecosystem that unlocks triple-A level artistry for everyone."</p>

      <p>"I'm proud to say that we are joining forces with Epic Games, for what is the next step in democratising transformative technology and content."</p>
      <p>Thanks to the acquisition, Quixel is immediately halving the price of Megascans, as well as making them free to Unreal Engine 4 developers. On top of this, the 2020 versions of Quixel's tool sets, Bridge and Mixer, will be free when they release at some point later this year.</p>
