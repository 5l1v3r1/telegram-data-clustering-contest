      <h1>How brothers murdered by mum Sarah Barrass tried to use Nintendo Switch to warn pals</h1>
      <h2>Police found Tristan and Blake Barrass, aged 13 and 14, shortly after they sent the message from the Sheffield home where they were strangled by mum Sarah Barrass and her Brandon Machin, who is also her half brother</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:51:35+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, Amy Murphy, Henry Clare</a></address>
      <p>Two tragic brothers told a fellow video gamer they were "feeling sick" just minutes before they were <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> by their mum and dad, say neighbours.</p>
      <p>Tristan and Blake Barrass, aged 13 and 14, were playing a Nintendo Switch game at about 7am on May 24 and appeared to be looking forward to spending the Friday at home.</p>
      <p>The siblings - who had been poisoned by their mother - told a friend over the video game system: "We're not coming to school today because we're feeling sick."</p>
      <p>Mum Sarah Barrass, 35, had told friends the children were unwell before she and her partner, who is also her half brother, strangled them in the family home in Sheffield, believing they were "better off dead" than in care.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Police were called to the house about 30 minutes after the brothers sent a message to their friend, said shocked neighbours at the time as police tape surrounded the property and forensics officers combed the scene for evidence.</p>
      <p>Almost six months on, Barrass and Machin were jailed for life on Tuesday as a court heard distressing details about their crimes.</p>
      <p>The lifting of reporting restrictions also saw killer couple Machin and Barrass named as half siblings.</p>
      <p>Barrass feared her children would be taken into care and began plotting the murders at least 10 days before the brothers were strangled.</p>
      <p>On the morning of May 24, the mum strangled Tristan with her dressing gown cord as Blake looked on. Machin then strangled Blake with his bare hands.</p>

      <p>Bin bags were then placed over the boys' heads.</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin attempted to drown a younger child in the bath, but that child survived.</p>
      <p>The night before, the evil pair gathered up tablets from around the house and divided them between the four eldest children.</p>
      <p>None of the "terrified" children wanted to take the tablets, but they were forced to do so, the court heard.</p>

      <p>The court heard that Barrass sent messages and made social media posts overnight claiming that they were suffering from a sickness bug.</p>
      <p>However, the children survived the poisoning attempt and Barrass then began to search the internet for alternative methods of murdering her children, including suffocating, strangulation and drowning.</p>
      <p>Barrass called Machin and told him the plan had not worked and he needed to come to the house in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield.</p>
      <p>It is then that the pair strangled the brothers and attempted to drown one of the younger children.</p>

      <p>Sheffield Crown Court heard that all of the surviving children are under the age of 13.</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin pleaded guilty in September to murder, conspiracy to murder her six children and five counts of attempted murder relating to four of the children, including Tristan and Blake.</p>
      <p>In June, an inquest heard that the brothers died 12 minutes apart after they were taken to hospital from the home in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield.</p>
      <p>Tristan was pronounced dead at 9.14am and Blake died 12 minutes later.</p>
      <p>At one of her first court appearances, Barrass insisted that she was innocent, shouting from the dock: “I didn’t kill my boys. Swear to God.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t do it. You will see. Swear to God. You will all f****** see.”</p>
      <p>But she and Machin admitted murder just months later in September.</p>
      <p>The boys' grief-stricken uncle, Martyn Barrass, told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/evil-mum-tried-kill-kids-20808557">Sunday People</a> that the siblings' killers "have been evil since birth", describing them as "psychopaths" and claiming Machin had been abusive towards the children.</p>
      <p>He said Barrass and Machin had killed pet mice for fun when they were younger and were fascinated with horror films featuring vampires, blood and gore.</p>
      <p>A Nightmare on Elm Street was one of their favourites, he added.</p>
      <p>Months before the murders, Barrass quoted the Stephen King novel Under the Dome, writing on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>: "Murder is like potato chips; you can't stop with just one."</p>
      <p>She once posted a disturbing cartoon image of the Grim Reaper holding a bloody scythe with the caption: "Coming for you."</p>
      <p>Tristan and Blake were laid to rest together in one coffin during their funeral in August.</p>
      <p>The boys' names were on each side of the shared coffin.</p>
      <p>An honour guard of more than 300 motorcycles and two Lamborghini cars attended the service following an appeal after it emerged the teenagers both loved bikes and cars.</p>
