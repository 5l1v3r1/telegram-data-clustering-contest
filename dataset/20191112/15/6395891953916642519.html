      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Disney's brand-new streaming service Disney Plus may be a victim of its own success.</p>
      <p>The $7-a-month service offering an array of Disney classics and new shows suffered some technical difficulties hours after launching at 3 a.m. E.T. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The problems started a little before 7 a.m., according to downdetector.com, a website that tracks outages. It received more than 8,000 reports of difficulties, mostly with video streaming. Others reported problems logging in.</p>
      <p>Disney is working to resolve the issue after consumer demand exceeded its expectations, said spokeswoman Karen Hobson. The company did not say what caused the problem.</p>
