      <h1>Disney Plus Streamers Met With Error Message on Launch Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:23:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Coleman</a></address>
      <p>When Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, announced the entertainment giant’s bold venture into the streaming wars, he made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/business/media/disney-plus-streaming.html?module=inline">a lofty promise</a>: “We’re going to launch big, and we’re going to launch hot.”</p>
      <p>Two years later, the official debut of Disney Plus, the new streaming platform <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/business/media/Disney-Plus-streaming.html?module=inline">heralded as the future of Disney’s empire</a>, has gotten off to a bit of a chillier start than expected.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, nearly 500 films and 7,500 TV episodes — including widely anticipated new offerings like the live-action Star Wars series “The Mandalorian” — were set to start streaming on the service. Instead, many subscribers on Twitter reported a different visual on their screens: an error message, accompanied by a perplexed astronaut Mickey or a morose Wreck-It Ralph.</p>

      <p>The problem appeared to affect multiple platforms, with users on Twitter posting screenshots of the error image on iPhones and complaining of issues on Android and Amazon Fire devices.</p>
      <p>“The consumer demand for Disney Plus has exceeded our high expectations,” a Disney Plus spokeswoman said in an email. “We are pleased by this incredible response and are working to quickly resolve the current user issue. We appreciate your patience.”</p>
      <p>More than 8,000 Disney Plus subscribers appeared to be affected by the outage around 9 a.m. on Tuesday, according to <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/">downdetector.com</a>. For others, the platform appeared to be working just fine.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s launch in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/business/media/disney-plus-marketing.html?module=inline">heavily marketed</a> across most branches of the company, with buses at Disney World and live broadcasts on ABC singing the praises of the $7 a month service. The platform boasts new and old content from Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic, and 30 seasons of “The Simpsons.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear how or if Tuesday’s technical issues will affect the rest of the company’s rollout around the world: Disney Plus was set to debut in Australia, New Zealand and Puerto Rico on Nov. 19, with countries across Western Europe able to start streaming in March 2020.</p>
