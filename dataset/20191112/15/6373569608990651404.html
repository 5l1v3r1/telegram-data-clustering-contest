      <h1>Plymouth Argyle linked with January transfer window move for Scunthorpe United striker</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims' reported target, Olufela Olomola, is currently on loan to Carlisle United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:35:45+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle are among ‘a number of Football League sides’ interested in signing striker Olufela Olomola when the January transfer window opens, according to one report.</p>
      <p>Olomola has scored six goals in 14 starts and five substitute appearances for Carlisle United this season, on loan from Scunthorpe United.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was on target for Carlisle when they won 4-1 away to Dulwich Hamlet in the FA Cup first round last Friday.</p>
      <p>That ended a run of six games without a goal for Olomola, which included him playing for around an hour of the Cumbrians’ 2-0 League Two defeat by Argyle at Home Park last month.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s link to Olomola has come from journalist Pete O’Rourke, a regular source of transfer stories and with speculation starting to crank up ahead of the January window.</p>
      <p>According to his story on the Football Insider website, League One duo MK Dons and Tranmere Rovers, as well as Argyle and Exeter City, are ‘weighing up’ moves for Olomola.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke wrote: “A source at Scunthorpe has told Football Insider that the Iron could recall the attacker from his season-long loan at Carlisle and sell him during the winter window if they receive a suitable offer for his services.”</p>
      <p>Argyle manager Ryan Lowe currently has six strikers to select from in his squad.</p>
      <p>However, Billy Clarke is on a short-term contract until January while the loan spell of Zak Rudden from Glasgow Rangers will end the same month.</p>
      <p>So there is a possibility that Lowe could be in the market for attacking options in January.</p>
      <p>Whether Argyle would be able, or willing, to compete financially with the likes of MK Dons and Tranmere if there was truth about their interest in Olomola remains to be seen, though.</p>
      <p>Olomola, who started his career at Southampton, spent the first half of last season on loan to Yeovil Town from Scunthorpe.</p>
      <p>He netted seven times in a total of 22 starts and six appearances off the bench for the Glovers.</p>
      <p>Olomola has played just six times for Scunthorpe since signing from Southampton in 2018 and not scored.</p>
