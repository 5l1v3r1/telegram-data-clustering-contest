      <h1>Amazon To Open First Full-Service Grocery Store in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:43:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>Amazon is opening a <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/more-families-get-discounted-lyft-to-the-grocery-store-1784666/">grocery store</a> in Woodland Hills, Calif., next year.</p>
      <p>The news comes after the company published <a href="https://amazon.tal.net/vx/lang-en-GB/mobile-0/appcentre-ext/brand-4/xf-04912c710f5c/candidate/jobboard/vacancy/2/adv/">four job openings</a> for the future Los Angeles location.</p>
      <p>“Join us as we launch Amazon’s first grocery store,” the posts said.</p>
      <p>“We are passionate about creating a shopping experience that customers will love,” Amazon wrote. “If you are customer-obsessed, like learning new things, and want to contribute to end-to-end store operations for a new business, this is the place for you.”</p>
      <p>Folks can apply now for a position as zone leader (full-time; starts at $16.90/hour), or grocery associate or food service associate (full-, part-, and flex-time; starts at £15.35/hour).</p>
      <p>No further details were revealed.</p>
      <p>The tech titan did <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-will-launch-new-grocery-store-as-alternative-to-whole-foods/#ftag=CAD590a51e">tell CNET</a> its new store will be different from subsidiary Whole Foods; and, unlike its high-tech <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/amazon-eyes-cinemas-airports-for-cashierless-checkouts-1805779/">Amazon Go shopping experience</a>, the shop will use conventional checkouts.</p>
      <p>There is no word, though, on what sort of selection or pricing to expect, nor whether <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/return-amazon-orders-at-select-kohls-whole-foods-1717051/">Amazon</a> plans to expand its grocery options into more cities.</p>
      <p>In an email to Geek, an Amazon spokesperson provided no additional information.</p>
      <p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in March <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-grocery-store-plan-moves-ahead-with-los-angeles-leases-11569927601">reported</a> on plans to open a chain of Amazon grocery stores in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia. At the time, the company had signed more than a dozen leases across LA, including Woodland Hills, Studio City, and Irvine.</p>
      <p>Many of the proposed locations, the paper pointed out, are near urban cores and cater to middle-income consumers, stocking prepared foods and mainstream goodies like soda and Oreos.</p>
