      <h1>Volvo XC40 T4 petrol to be priced at Rs 39.9 lakh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:28:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">Rivan RS</a></address>
      <p>Expected to launch in the coming days, the XC40 petrol for India will come with a 190hp, 2.0-litre engine and in one mid-spec R-Design variant.</p>
      <p>Despite having launched just one new model this year – the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/volvo-xc90-excellence-lounge-console-launched-at-rs-142-crore-413997"><b>Volvo XC90 Excellence Lounge Console</b></a> – the Swedish carmaker’s sales haven’t been all that bad, considering the industry-wide slowdown. Before the year is out, Volvo will bring another new model to India – the petrol-powered XC40 T4 will be launched in the coming days, with bookings beginning sooner.</p>
      <p>Expected to be priced at Rs 39.9 lakh, the petrol XC40 will be available in T4-spec, which means that it will be powered by a 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that develops 190hp and 300Nm of peak torque and mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The smallest SUV in Volvo’s line-up was previously sold with a sole D4 2.0-litre diesel engine making 190hp and 400Nm of torque. However, the diesel variant has been sold out for now and will see a comeback, most likely sometime in mid 2020.</p>
      <p>Unlike the diesel, our sources say that AWD will not be offered on the petrol XC40. This means that the model will be a front-wheel-drive vehicle only. Interestingly, the petrol engine will be a BS4 unit at launch, with an upgrade to BS6 coming closer to the mandated April 2020 deadline. The XC40 T4 R-Design is expected to get features like paddleshifters, adaptive cruise control, automatic parking, heated seats, wireless phone charging and a hands-free boot-opening function.</p>
      <p>Besides the petrol-powered versions of the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/bmw/x1/"><b>BMW X1</b></a> (sDrive 20i xLine: Rs 38.30 lakh), <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gla"><b>Mercedes-Benz GLA</b></a> (GLA 200: Rs 34.38lakh) and <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/audi/q3"><b>Audi Q3</b></a> (30TFSI: Rs 34.75 lakh), the XC40 petrol will also rival the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/mini/countryman"><b>Mini Countryman</b></a> (Cooper S: Rs 34.90 lakh) in the Indian market.</p>
