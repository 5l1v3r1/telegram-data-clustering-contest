      <h2>Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez clashed in the England canteen after the Manchester City forward re-ignited a row from his side's defeat by Liverpool at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:55:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Ben Chilwell says Gareth Southgate held an emergency meeting after Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez clashed in the England canteen.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions boss wanted to clear the air after Sterling re-ignited a row on international duty following Liverpool's 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Gomez attempted to shake Sterling's hand in the canteen, with the Manchester City forward asking the defender if he is "still the big man".</p>
      <p>Sterling then went to grab his England team-mate before other players in the squad broke up the melee, preventing it from getting out of hand.</p>
      <p>The City star has now been axed from England's Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Tuesday's press conference ahead of the match, Chilwell opened up on the meeting Southgate held after the incident in a bid to settle things down.</p>

      <p>"Yesterday we had the meeting and that meeting was purely for Joe and Raheem to get their points across," said Chilwell.</p>
      <p>"Since then it hasn't been mentioned and focusing on the game Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Gareth just wanted to know that he comes to a decision that everyone was on board with. That is why he made the decision with the leadership group.</p>

      <p>"Meeting happened last night and Gareth spoke about the situation and spoke about what we thought. He also wanted to know what we thought.</p>
      <p>"Raheem wanted to apologise and Joe wanted to get stuff off his chest as well. It's not been spoken of since."</p>
      <p>"[Raheem] was apologetic, he said it's not in his nature, which it's not, but we all know as football players emotions can run high. No one's trying to make excuses for him."</p>

      <p>He added: "Raheem has come out and said what he thought. We are in the changing room this morning and everyone is fine.</p>
      <p>"Joe is OK. He's good. Himself. He's a great character and has done very well. It wasn't on anyone's mind this morning."</p>

      <p>"It is very important not to forget what Raheem has done for English football. Yes he has made a mistake but he's a very important character in the dressing room."</p>
      <p>On the incident itself, he concluded: "I didn't see no, I was one of the later ones to turn up so I actually missed it, so that's one of the easier questions to answer."</p>
