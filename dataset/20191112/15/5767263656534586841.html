      <p>Everyone has secrets that they keep to themselves, but every relationship should be based on trust. Sometimes it can be hard to know where to draw the line. Good communication is key, but if your partner wants to conceal something, you need to know when to get them to tell the truth. Being aware of the signs that they may be keeping secrets from you can really help in this case.</p>
      <p><b>Bright Side </b>took a look at the possible signs that your significant other may be trying to hide something from you.</p>
      <h3>1. Their voice changes.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157067-90450510-3e52c8daf843c4fa8773f528cca5f598148d837c-1573469447-2000-1-1573469447-728-32e9147584-1573485708.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If you detect a change in the pitch of your partner’s voice when they’re talking to you, they might be lying to you. They might even clear their throat more often than usual or breathe heavily. These are the natural reactions of their body when they get nervous about something.</p>
      <h3>2. They avoid eye contact.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Eyes can reveal a lot of emotions, so if your partner keeps avoiding your gaze, it could be because they don’t want you to see through them. You might find fear in their eyes and that’s why they try not to make eye contact with you.</p>
      <h3>3. When answering your questions, their answers are vague and their eyes get shifty.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157082-image-crop-773x499-1572773127-728-3646f430cd-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>When answering a question, a person’s eyes will shift toward the side they are accessing information from. Eyes that move to the right are searching for memories, whereas eyes that move to the left are creating lies. If your partner’s answers are vague or unusually detailed, this may be a sign that they are trying to cover something up. Another telltale sign is when they answer your question with a question, because they’re trying to get extra time to make up lies.</p>
      <h3>4. They are fidgety when you’re alone.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157072-take-this-waltz-1572671324-728-b476c5a5a9-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Having secrets might make your partner feel restless, especially when you 2 are alone together. They might feel the stress and this could make it hard for them to stay still when there is nothing else to distract you from them.</p>
      <h3>5. They make others feel self-conscious.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157087-image-crop-1209x1035-1572842167-728-056a286c4c-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>This happens when your partner wants to get the attention off of themselves, because they’re feeling guilty about something. They try to shift the attention on something you or your friends and family do wrong so that someone else will feel self-conscious about themselves instead.</p>
      <h3>6. Their body language shows that they are nervous around you.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157081-image-crop-674x530-1572779445-728-c495f18472-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>During a conversation, if your partner turns their body away from you, this might be a sign that they have some secrets and don’t want them to be found out. It is their subconscious way of shutting you out. Similarly, the act of biting fingernails is a sign of insecurity or anxiety and might be happening because they have something to hide. Another way to tell whether your partner is lying to you is by looking at what they do with their hands. If your partner doesn’t normally put their hands in their pockets but suddenly starts doing this, it could be that they are trying to comfort themselves because they know they’re doing something wrong.</p>
      <h3>7. They have their poker face on.</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Since facial expressions can tell you a lot about how someone is feeling, if your partner has something to hide, they might try to maintain a straight face. If they don’t show expressions, you will not be able to read them as easily.</p>
      <h3>8. They blink too much.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157076-20-117399-Baby-Boy-613x463-1572777031-728-9ce08c4618-1573485708.jpg"/>
        <figcaption><a href="http://sonypictures.com/">© Baby Boy / Columbia Pictures</a>  </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Blinking too much can be a sign of lying. It can be stressful to lie and, under stress, the blink rate of the eyes increases. So if you notice your partner blinking more than usual, they might be lying to you.</p>
      <h3>9. They lash out.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157074-notebook-1561067040-1572778708-728-ce25d39c1a-1573485708.jpg"/>
        <figcaption><a href="http://www.newline.com/">© The Notebook / New Line Cinema</a>  </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Keeping secrets from you might make your partner feel guilty because they are not being honest with you the way they should. So they might act out and try to make you feel bad or make you feel like you are the one who has done something wrong instead.</p>
      <h3>10. They’re involved with work more than usual.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157083-image-crop-571x433-1572842212-728-b126a1121b-1573485708.jpg"/>
        <figcaption><a href="https://www.cbs.com/">© The Good Wife / CBS</a>  </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Unless it can be explained by say, a recent promotion, if your partner has more reasons to stay late at work or has more business trips than usual, they might be using work as an excuse to hide something.</p>
      <h3>11. They’re no longer intimate with you.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157085-image-crop-1304x880-1572842233-728-70aa18517b-1573485708.jpg"/>
        <figcaption><a href="http://universalpictures.com/">© By The Sea / Universal Pictures</a>  </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If you sense that your partner is no longer interested in being intimate with you, it is time to have a serious talk with them. It could be that your partner already has someone else to fulfill their intimacy needs and they’re hiding the fact that they are cheating on you.</p>
      <h3>12. They’ve developed a sudden interest in their appearance.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157086-image-crop-1379x1044-1572836553-728-4b30203b95-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>If your significant other suddenly starts exercising and updating their closet, it’s likely that they are trying to appear more attractive to someone. If they look the same around you, but so much better for work or other social events, then they might be trying to catch someone else’s eye.</p>
      <h3>13. They are hard to reach.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157064-89581210-e35c571d94ac7d530a6468db0d878aad66b69cf9-1573205023-2000-1-1573205023-728-32e9147584-1573485708.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>If you find it hard to reach your partner or find that they are less likely to answer your calls or respond to your texts—this could also be a sign that it’s difficult to reach them on an emotional level. They could be in your arms, but you feel as though their heart and mind are with someone else.</p>
      <h3>14. They’re overly protective of their phone.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_79/794761/15157061-jexi-1572838269-728-0a127a624d-1573485708.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>While privacy is important, there should be no reason for your partner to be overly protective of their phone. If they keep receiving messages at odd times and they become defensive whenever you ask about them, they might have something to hide.</p>
      <p>Do you agree that these are signs you should be looking out for and have you seen them from your lover before? Can you identify other signs that someone is not being 100% honest with you?</p>
