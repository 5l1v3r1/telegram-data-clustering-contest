      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Dane County homeowners will see a small increase in their tax bills next year as a result of county supervisors approving the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>Homeowners will pay $25.47 more on the average Madison home, according to a release from Dane County.</p>
      <p>Dane County Executive Joe Parisi released his proposed budget on Oct, 1. County board committees have spent the last six weeks hearing from the public and making changes regarding staffing and funding levels, according to the release.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, they approved the county's total budget of $663 million for 2020.</p>
      <p>The proposed budget includes more money for mental health services in the county. It also prioritizes affordable housing and homeless prevention services, according to the release.</p>
      <p>"The 2020 budget is all about helping people in the community.  We recognize that Dane County plays an absolutely critical role in providing services to our most vulnerable," noted Supervisor Analiese Eicher (District 3), who serves as second vice chair of the county board.  </p>
      <p>In response to recent flooding, the proposed budget also includes millions to purchase land in flood-prone areas. </p>
      <p>The county board also set aside money to do a study for a community justice center and added social work positions in the district attorney's office, one for victim witness support for juvenile cases and one devoted to restorative justice case management. It also added a program leader position to the Human Services Department to keep pace with increased referrals to the Community Restorative Court, according to the release. </p>
