      <h1>Systems Failure: Labour Party Cyberattacked Yet Again</h1>
      <h2>The UK Labour party has claimed it’s been struck by a “sophisticated and large-scale cyber-attack” on its digital systems from an unknown source.</h2>

      <p>In an official statement, officials said the party was confident its “robust” security systems ensured there was no data breach, and had <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911121077287122-uk-labour-party-reportedly-experienced-sophisticated-and-large-scale-cyber-attack/">reported the attack</a> – which took place 11th November – to the National Cyber Security Centre.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear which digital platforms were targeted, but it is understood some of them were election and campaigning tools, which contained details about voters.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time the party has been subject to a hack by hostile actors. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/labour-twitter-account-hacked-tweet-says-party-institutionally-racist-10180427/">In July</a>, its Twitter account was illicitly accessed and posted a tweet stating Labour was “institutionally racist”, following the broadcast of a controversial BBC Panorama documentary that investigated the alleged ‘anti-Semitism crisis’ in Labour under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Before the hack, the account had ‘live-tweeted’ rebuttals to the program’s assorted allegations as the broadcast progressed.</p>

      <p>​Moreover, <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/news/107457/hitler-row-labour-councillor-readmitted-party">in October</a> Denbighshire councillor Bob Murray was reinstated to the party after a probe found "credible evidence" a controversial social media post connected to one of his social media accounts was the result of a hack.</p>
      <p>Murray was disciplined in April over a Facebook comment which said Adolf Hitler had "the right idea" about travellers, a post which drew condemnation from the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and the Holocaust Educational Trust, for his "vile and offensive remarks, directed at a minority group".</p>
      <p>However, an investigation by Labour found there was "credible evidence" another individual had access to the councillor's Facebook account and he didn’t post the material himself.</p>

      <p>​Murray said he was "pleased" the suspension had been lifted - Chris Ruane, Labour MP for Vale of Clwyd, said the comment were unrepresentative of Labour and had no place in our society.</p>
      <blockquote>"I know the last few months will have been difficult for Bob. I’m glad that following a full investigation by the Labour Party and the Ombudsman, Bob re-joins the Labour Group. He is a hard working local councillor and I look forward to campaigning alongside him again,” he added.</blockquote>
