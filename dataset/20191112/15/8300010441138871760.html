      <p>NEW YORK CITY -- <a href="https://zollipops.com/">Zolli Candy</a> was invented by 14-year-old Alina Morse. The line is an all-natural, gluten-free, dairy-free, vegan and non-GMO candy, and certified sugar-free by Sugarwise. <br/><br/>"I originally came up with the idea when I was 7-years-old and on a trip to the bank with my dad," said Alina.<br/><br/>The bank teller offered Alina a lollipop and her dad said "You shouldn't have candy because sugar is terrible for your teeth", so Alina asked him, "Why can't we make a healthy lollipop that's good for my teeth so I can have candy and it wouldn't be bad for me?"<br/><br/>Alina spent a lot of time researching competitors and online merchandising to see if there was any product like them already on the market... and there wasn't.<br/><br/>So, after two years of research and plant trials... <a href="https://zollipops.com/">Zollipops</a> were born!<br/><br/>"Our first prototypes were done in our kitchen," said Alina. "I replaced the sugar ingredient with healither substitutes."<br/><br/>Alina worked with a food scientist to perfect her formula before it hit the shelves.<br/><br/>Now, Alina's <a href="https://zollipops.com/">Zolli Candy</a> line includes many items, like Zollipops, Zolli Drops, Zaffi Taffy, Zolli Caramelz, Zolli Gumeez, Zolli Beanz, Zolli Ball Pops. Her products are sold at over 25,000 retailers across the country!<br/><br/>Alina also gives back by donating 10 percent of her profits to support an increase in oral health education in schools by giving 2 million products through her "Million Smiles Initiative" to help fight America's most chronic childhood disease - tooth decay. <br/><br/>In 2018, she became the youngest person to ever appear on the cover of Entrepreneur Magazine, all before she entered her freshman year of high school this fall. <br/><br/>Last month, Morse became the youngest INC Magazine 5000 CEO for 2019 as one of the fastest growing private companies, with a three-year revenue growth of 696%. <br/><br/>"I am definitely excited to see what the future holds," said Alina.</p>
