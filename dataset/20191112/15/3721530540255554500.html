      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/dungeons-dragons/593">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> turns 45 this year, and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/8/20/9172559/dungeons-dragons-dnd-4th-edition-one-year-later-twitch-youtube">best-selling fifth edition</a> turns five. To celebrate, publisher Wizards of the Coast is offering a wild set of dice. The $300 set of polyhedrals are made of bright aluminum, and the d20 includes a lab-grown sapphire. Only 1,974 sets will be ever be made. Manufactured by <a href="https://usa.levelupdice.net/collections">Level Up Dice</a>, they go on sale Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>“When the D&amp;D team realized the sapphire is the traditional anniversary stone for both five years and forty-five years, and that adding a laboratory-created sapphire to a twenty-sided die wouldn’t jeopardize the integrity of a roll, we couldn’t pass up the chance to make something really cool to celebrate the milestones” <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/sapphire-anniversary">said Nathan Stewart</a>, the vice president in charge of the D&amp;D franchise.</p>

      <p>The set includes two d20s — only one of which includes a sapphire — and four d6s, along with the usual assortment of d10s, d4s and the like. They even come in with a classy box and rolling tray combo, so as not to ding up the furniture.</p>
      <p>It’s been quite the week for dice. Dispel Dice’s Kickstarter, which features unique, handmade resin dice with brilliant inclusions, is closing in <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dispeldice/dispel-dice">on $2 million</a>. Delivery dates on those, however, are being pushed out into 2021 as additional backers sign on.</p>
