      <p>Labour has suffered a second cyber attack in two days, after hackers reportedly targeted the party’s web services this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Hackers tried to force its web services offline from around 1pm today, according to <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-labour-cyber-attacks/labour-party-undergoing-second-cyber-attack-source-idUKKBN1XM1ZG">Reuters</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes after the party revealed hackers tried to disrupt its digital platforms last night unsuccesfully.</p>
