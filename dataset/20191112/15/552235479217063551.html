      <p>A Scots heritage centre is putting on a festive winter wonderland with a difference this <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> .</p>
      <p>Almond Valley Heritage Centre, in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian">West Lothian</a> , is giving visitors the chance to bring their beloved <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">pets</a> to see Santa Paws.</p>
      <p>As always the family attraction is opening its doors to excited children to meet Santa Claus, but now dogs are invited too.</p>
      <p>This year, the whole family can get involved as guests can buy a ticket for their pet pooches.</p>
      <p>Each weekend in December, canine friends can enjoy meeting Mrs Santa Paws where they will receive a special <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas-gifts">festive treat</a> under the shelter of a giant festive kennel from only £4 per dog.</p>

      <p>Craig Holmes, Farm Manager of Almond Valley said: "We have lots of families that come to Almond Valley with their canine companions over the festive period, so this year we thought that we would offer something a little bit different.</p>
      <p>"‘Santa Paws’ invites visitors with their four legged friends to come and receive their own gift in the shape of a toy or a treat, as animal lovers ourselves, we felt it was only right to offer our dogs a special Christmas experience too."</p>
      <p>Visitors can also meet Santa in his magical winter cottage in Almond Valley’s famous <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> experiences.</p>
      <p>The West Lothian family attraction will also run a brand new after hours winter event, The Winter Realm of the Paraffin Pixie, where guests can experience an enchanting world of twinkling lights, woodland trails and festive delights.</p>
      <p>Tickets for Santa Paws can be bought on arrival at Almond Valley with daily admission.</p>
