      <p>Here’s one that’s bound to have the internet divided this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Reynold’s Wrap has rolled out their annual Thanksgiving recipes, including a recipe for a mac and cheese turkey.</p>
      <p>It’s a fairly simple <a href="https://www.reynoldskitchens.com/recipes/mac-and-cheese-turkey/">recipe</a> in which you coat the turkey with the powdered cheese mix prior to baking it. You then serve the cooked turkey on a bed of mac and cheese.</p>
      <p>Of course, the recipe calls for the turkey to be wrapped in Reynold’s Wrap in order to “hold in the juices.”</p>
      <p>If the mac and cheese turkey recipe isn’t up your alley, but you’re still feeling adventurous, check out their recipes for <a href="https://www.reynoldskitchens.com/recipes/cool-ranch-turkey-recipe/">cool ranch turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.reynoldskitchens.com/recipes/hot-cheese-puffs-turkey-recipe/">Flamin' Hot Cheetos turkey</a>, and <a href="https://www.reynoldskitchens.com/recipes/mountain-dew-turkey-recipe/">Mountain Dew turkey</a>.</p>
      <p>While there’s no guarantee you’ll score a hit with any of the turkeys, you’ll definitely get people talking.</p>
