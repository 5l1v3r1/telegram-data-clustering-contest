      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Tuesday a large-scale cyber attack on his party’s digital platforms just weeks before a national election had made him nervous about the rest of the campaign.</p>
      <p>“If this is a sign of things to come in this election, I feel very nervous about it all because a cyber attack against a political party in an election is suspicious and something one is very worried about,” he said when asked by a reporter about the attack during a campaign event.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said the party was looking into who might have been behind the attack.</p>
