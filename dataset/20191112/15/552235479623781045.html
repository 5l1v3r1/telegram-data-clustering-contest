      <h2>The hunt to replace Stuart Malcolm is underway as Kilby search for a gaffer who can lift the club from mid-table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:52:28+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>East Kilbride's hunt for a new manager is well underway after Stuart Malcolm departed for League One Forfar Athletic.</p>
      <p>There had been calls for Malcolm, who won the Lowland League with EK last season, to be sacked in recent weeks following a nightmare start to the season.</p>
      <p>But on Sunday Malcolm pulled off a surprise move to the club he captained as a player after convincing the Loons hierarchy he is the man to lead them off the bottom of the league.</p>
      <p>Malcolm’s replacement at K-Park will now have to pick up the pieces with EK sitting eighth in the table and 16 points off the pace set by leaders Kelty Hearts.</p>
      <p>So who is in the frame to become Kilby's eighth manager in seven seasons?</p>
      <p>Among the names being tipped as possible successors to Malcolm is current Civil Service Strollers boss Gary Jardine, who led Edinburgh City out of the Lowland League in 2015/16 and won two Lowland League titles.</p>
      <p>Jardine has enjoyed a good start to the season with Strollers, who sit fifth on a smidgen of Kilby’s budget, and is highly thought of at K-Park.</p>

      <p>Former Dumbarton boss Stevie Aitken has been out of the game for over a year and a move to K-Park could provide a way back.</p>
      <p>He teamed up with Rangers hero Ian Durrant at the Rock and Durrant could either throw his hat into the ring or try to rekindle his partnership with Aitken.</p>
      <p>However, Durrant, a familiar face around K-Park at home matches, is close friends with the Kilby owners and that may put both parties off a working relationship.</p>

      <p>A favourite among the fans for the role is Brian Kerr, who managed the club briefly at the start of last season before joining Gary Caldwell’s backroom team for an ill-fated spell at Partick Thistle.</p>
      <p>But Kerr has distanced himself from the position this week.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old was in charge of EK for eight league games at the start of the 2018/19 season and since leaving Partick, he has been coaching Motherwell’s under-15s.</p>
      <p>Asked if a return to K-Park would interest him, he told the East Kilbride News: “It’s a difficult one.</p>
      <p>“If East Kilbride felt they wanted to ask the question that’s up to them, but I wouldn’t be putting my name forward as such.</p>
      <p>“When you go full-time like I did at Partick, you stop all the things you had before it when you were part-time. When the full-time stuff stops, you then go from that to pretty much nothing.</p>
      <p>“So now it’s about piecing things together and seeing what opportunities are out there because I’ve got family and bills to pay. Right now it’s about making sure I take the time out and be fully prepared for the next move.</p>

      <p>“If I go down the part-time route again I need to look at that being my mid-to-short term future.”</p>
      <p>Kerr left EK in a strong position and Stuart Malcolm went and finished the job by claiming the league title. However EK came up short in their dream of promotion.</p>
      <p>Kerr added: “There is potentially a bit of unfinished business there.</p>
      <p>“I did see the long term planning being getting EK into the SPFL.</p>

      <p>“I felt I put a good group in place when I took over and things seemed to be heading very much in the right direction. Then the lure of full-time football came along and I couldn’t turn that down.”</p>
      <p>Coaches Dean Shanks and Jim Paterson will take charge of Kilby for tonight’s East of Scotland Cup clash at home to Tynecastle, but the club could not confirm who would take the team for Saturday’s Lowland League visit of Gretna.</p>
      <p>Next weekend Kilby face a trip to Aberdeenshire when they take on Formartine United in round three of the Scottish Cup and the club would look to have an appointment, interim or otherwise, by then.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for East Kilbride said: “East Kilbride FC can confirm that manager Stuart Malcolm has left the club to take over as manager of SPFL League 1 side Forfar Athletic.</p>

      <p>“Stuart, who guided the club to the 2018/19 Lowland League title, is a former Forfar player and the club would like to wholeheartedly thank him for his dedication and service to East Kilbride, with everyone wishing him well for the future.</p>
      <p>“East Kilbride will now commence the search for a new manager at K-Park, with more details to follow.”</p>
