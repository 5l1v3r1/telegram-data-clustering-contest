The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.<br/>Egypt often acts as a mediator between Israel and Gaza militants, and brokered a cease-fire deal in May.<br/>That deal appeared threatened Tuesday after a pre-dawn Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander.<br/>Militants in Gaza have responded with rockets fired into Israel, and the Israeli military has carried out a number of airstrikes in Gaza.</p>
