      <h1>Chelsea fine list leaked - including huge £20k for being late to training</h1>
      <h2>Players also receive punishments for offences such as phones ringing, not turning up for community events and reporting for duty in the wrong kit</h2>

      <p>Frank Lampard appears to have firmly laid down the law with his young <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> side judging by the list of club rules and fines from the club that have been leaked online.</p>
      <p>The list, which was published on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/dva05g/the_list_of_player_fines_set_by_the_gaffer_this/">Reddit</a>, sets out the amount of money the players will be deducted should they break any of the agreed rules, and is signed at the bottom by Lampard and dated August 27.</p>
      <p>It has been made clear to the squad that lateness to any event will not be tolerated, with fines of up to £2,500 if they are tardy for match days and treatment, which rises to an eye-watering £20,000 if they are late for the start of training.</p>
      <p>Other fines include a maximum of £10,000 for not reporting illness or injury before a day off or 90 minutes ahead of training, and £5,000 for not turning up for corporate or community duties.</p>

      <p>And if a phone rings during a team meal or meeting the guilty player will face a fine of £1,000.</p>
      <p>There is also a list of further internal rules which the squad are expected to adhere to. These include body composition targets needing to be met, family or guests needing to be authorised by the manager if they wish to watch training and agents not being allowed on the training ground.</p>
      <p>So far this season discipline does not seem to be an issue at Stamford Bridge, and the team spirit that Lampard has created around the club has been praised by many.</p>

      <p>Chelsea have now won their last six Premier League games and sit third in the table, and also look in a good position to qualify from their group in the Champions League after two wins, one draw and one defeat.</p>
      <p>They face a huge test after the international break, however, when they travel to champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on November 23.</p>
