      <p>SRINAGAR, Nov 12 — Kashmir today marked 100 days since India stripped the restive Himalayan valley of its autonomy and imposed a strict communications blackout, with local journalists protesting the internet blackout.</p>
      <p>Tensions have been high since August 5 when the national government moved to bring the region under direct rule, cut telecommunications and detained thousands to quell any unrest.</p>
      <p>Shops and businesses have remained shut to protest against the controversial decision, and children have not been going to school.</p>
      <p>Dozens of journalists held a silent demonstration against the internet ban, holding their laptops with open with blank screens or held placards with the words “100 days no internet” and “stop humiliating Kashmir journalists”.</p>
      <p>“The authorities have treated journalists too as potential trouble-makers and choked journalism in the process,” a freelance journalist reported AFP.</p>
      <p>“Internet is so fundamental to journalism in this day and age. The authorities have choked our practices instead of enabling free press here,” said another journalist, Naseer Ganai.</p>
      <p>Authorities have justified the ban as necessary to stop militants from neighbouring Pakistan from using the internet to fan radicalisation in the territory.</p>
      <p>They instead set up an office with 10 internet-enabled stations for around 200 working journalists, who queue up to use the computers for 15 minutes each.</p>
      <p>The protest came as reports said three militants died in two separate gunfights with government forces this week.</p>
      <p>Kashmir has been split between India and Pakistan since 1947 and has sparked two wars and numerous flare-ups between the two nuclear-armed foes, most recently in February when they conducted tit-for-tat air strikes.</p>
