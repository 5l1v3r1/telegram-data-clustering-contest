      <p>JUI-F chief asserted that the government vowed to resign if even 15,000 people chant “Go Imran Go”. He went on to say that the no one trusts the current government while the incumbent leadership is hiding behind the courts. “Inflation is causing problem to every class of Pakistan and the country is suffering from chaos”, he added.</p>
      <p>He said that Pakistan has been made a slave of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. He continued expressing that IMF prepares the country’s budget today. “We want to free our economy from the international pressure”, he said adding that they will support the government if they work within the limits.  </p>
      <p>Earlier, Leadership of JUI-F under Maulana Fazlur Rehman is deliberating to shift to plan B of Azadi March. As per details, a meeting of JUI-F held in Islamabad to ponder over plan B of Azadi March.</p>
      <p>Sources said it is expected that important roads would be blocked and there would be a shutter down strike in second phase of Azadi March. Maulana Fazlur Rehman has asked party leadership to give suggestions in this regard.</p>
