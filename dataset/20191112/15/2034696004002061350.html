      <p>The new book – <i>Fleabag: The Scriptures</i> – features scripts from the show, previously unseen stage directions and new writing by the show’s creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
      <p>After <i>Fleabag</i>‘s second and final season came to TV earlier this year, Waller-Bridge took the show back to its origins on the stage through this summer, hosting a residency in London’s West End.</p>
      <p>Since the show’s conclusion, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/phoebe-waller-bridge-has-fantasy-of-reviving-fleabag-in-later-life-2535757">Waller-Bridge has said that it’s a “fantasy” of hers to revive it</a> later in life, something <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/fleabag-star-andrew-scott-is-up-for-phoebe-waller-bridges-season-3-plan-2543972">Andrew Scott – aka the ‘Hot Priest’ from season 2 of the show – is on board with</a>.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/fleabag-grief-love-comedy-show-decade-final-2474388">a review of the show</a>, NME’s El Hunt called Fleabag “the best comedy show of the decade,” writing: “With an ability for cramming layers and layers into episodes that barely pass the twenty-minute mark, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s writing is like the puff-pastry canapés Fleabag hands around at Claire’s doomed work event; run through the plot alone, and it barely scratches the surface.”</p>
