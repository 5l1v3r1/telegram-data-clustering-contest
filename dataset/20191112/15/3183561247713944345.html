      <p>Apple's newest iPad Pro, rumoured for release as early as 2020, is set to feature a new 3-D sensor system that could enable compatibility with Apple-developed AR and VR headsets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">According to Bloomberg</a>, the new iPad Pro system will feature a new module with two camera sensors, and a "small hole" for a new 3-D system that enables reconstructions of rooms, objects and people, according to the report, with the technology also planned for the late-2020 iPhone release.</p>
      <p>VR and AR are technologies that have <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/04/im-struggling-to-believe-this-report-of-an-apple-ar-vr-headset-coming-in-2020/">long been rumoured for Apple's product line-up</a>, but thus far, the technology has failed to materialise. In fact, these rumours have been around since 2018, when <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-augmented-reality-vr-virtual-reality-headset-powered-by-a-wireless-wigig-hub/">CNET</a> reported that Apple would start to focus on VR and AR in 2020.</p>

      <p>Now it looks like it will finally become a reality. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">Bloomberg report</a> claims that Apple is planning to release a combined AR and VR headset that focuses on gaming, watching videos and virtual meetings in either 2021 or 2022 â€” which would align with Apple's current <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/10/the-20-apple-arcade-games-that-make-it-worth-the-money/">gaming push</a>.</p>
      <p>The report also indicates that Apple will roll out a separate, lightweight pair of AR glasses by 2023, much later than <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/apples-rumored-ar-glasses-could-arrive-in-early-2020-analyst-report-claims/">originally rumoured</a>. This confirms a similar report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses">The Information</a>, which identified a 2022 release date for Apple's rumoured VR/AR headset and a 2023 release date for Apple's AR glasses.</p>

      <p>These advances will be supported by the introduction of the new 3-D sensor system that is said to be arriving first on the updated 2020 iPad Pro, with the technology becoming the "centerpiece" of Apple's next big hardware push.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg's source indicated that an engineering team of around 1,000 have already begun work on connecting applications and software features to a new operating system, codenamed "rOS" that will allow compatibility with the future VR headset and AR glasses. The team is said to be made up of ex-NASA engineers, former game developers and graphics experts, all working out of Sunnyvale, California.</p>
      <p>While not much else is known about the long-rumoured devices, Apple's planned foray into AR and VR appears to be picking up steam, and it'll be interesting to see what their product line-up looks like heading into the early 2020s.</p>
