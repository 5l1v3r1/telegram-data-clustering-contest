      <h1>Emmanuel Petit picks ideal candidate to replace Unai Emery as Arsenal boss</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish manager is under increasing pressure at the Emirates Stadium after Arsenal suffered another disappointing loss to Leicester and Petit wants a change</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:55:40+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal legend Emmanuel Petit thinks the ideal man to replace Unai Emery at his ex-club is a former Gunners great following another lacklustre Premier League defeat.</p>
      <p>After losing 2-0 to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> are now without a win in their last four Premier League games, and lie eight points off the top four.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-chiefs-release-statement-over-20861422">Despite the board at Arsenal insisting they are still behind Emery</a> , Petit has lost faith in the manager, and thinks his time may be up in north London.</p>
      <p>"I believe it's time for Unai Emery to leave Arsenal," Petit told <a href="https://news.paddypower.com/">Paddy Power</a> . "The results are not good at all. I don't recognise this team any more and I don't recognise this club any more.</p>

      <p>"My opinion is that most of the players have given up on Emery, so it's time for him to go. I watched the game against Leicester and Arsenal looked terrible. They had no spirit, no hunger, nothing at all."</p>
      <p>Petit believes Arsenal should look towards one of their former legends to come in and bring back the feel-good factor at the club.</p>
      <p>He added: "People may laugh at me but I wouldn't mind seeing a former player on the bench. Is there a former Arsenal great you can call, like Thierry Henry or Patrick Vieira? Pick one: there are so many. You even have Freddie Ljungberg already in the dugout.</p>

      <p>"Arsenal needs a great leader now. Someone who can bring back the passion, someone respected by the players, someone who can fill the team with energy and the winning mentality.</p>
      <p>"I want to see passion, emotion. Someone who, when he takes your hand, you can feel the electricity. I want someone who can bring that to the Arsenal dressing room, because they need to wake up."</p>
