      <h2>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier is the first MCU show to hit Disney Plus. But what's in store for this team-up, and when will we see it hit our screens?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:40:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>With the global launch of Disney Plus, we can’t help but turn our heads towards Marvel and what they have in store for their TV programmes. The first to kick off will be The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, following the flying ex-soldier Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Cap’s best friend and former foe, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).</p>
      <p>This will be the first of many shows to play an integral part of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/marvel-phase-4-3701501/">phase four of the MCU</a>, with seven other titles confirmed for 2020 and beyond. But what exactly will The Falcon and the Winter Soldier be about, and when will it kick off? We’ve drilled the internet for all the details you need.</p>
      <h3>When does The Falcon and the Winter Soldier start?</h3>
      <p>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is so far the only Marvel show on Disney+ scheduled for next year, with a penned release date of <b>Fall 2020</b>. No specific date has been given yet - but keep checking back here for more news as we get it.</p>
      <p>The actors confirmed that filming kicked off at the start of November, so it looks like they're all on schedule.</p>

      <h3>How to watch The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</h3>
      <p>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier will be exclusive to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776189-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Ffalcon-winter-soldier-3776189%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com">Disney+</a>, so you’ll need to sign up for an account with the streaming service if you want to watch it. At the moment, Disney+ only has launch dates for five countries: the USA, Canada, The Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The service <b>costs $6.99 a month in the US</b>, undercutting other streaming rivals by quite a bit. Take a look at <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/entertainment/disney-plus-3695971/">everything you need to know about Disney Plus</a> for more information. </p>
      <p>By the time The Falcon and the Winter Soldier launches, the UK should have access to Disney Plus, as its slated to launch in March 2020. In the unlikely case that the show is not released in the UK at the same time - or that you’re based elsewhere in the world - you can take a look at our article on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">how to watch Disney+ from abroad</a>. </p>
      <h3>Posters and trailers</h3>
      <p>As the show is so far away, we have no trailers just yet. However, we do have a teaser poster, giving us a glimpse at what the two characters look like:</p>

      <p>There was also a short clip shown at San Diego Comic Con of the villain of Captain America: Civil War, Baron Zemo (Daniel Brühl). In the video he teased joining the cast of the show, and also showed off the notorious purple mask as seen in the comics - so no doubt that he will be the big bad of the series. </p>

      <h3>What do we know about the plot of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier?</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Spoilers for past films in the MCU, including Avengers: Endgame from here on out.</i>
      </p>
      <p>As of yet, not a whole lot unfortunately. The appearance of the shield in the title image for the show indicates that both Sam and Bucky will be dealing with the aftermath of the absence of Cap now that he’s loving life in retirement; especially considering that the shield was passed on to Sam Wilson.</p>
      <p>This is actually a plot from one of the comics, in which Falcon takes up the mantle of Cap, wearing his own red, white and blue getup, combining the all-American shield and his mechanical wings into a new style of superhero.</p>
      <p>Writer <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776189-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Ffalcon-winter-soldier-3776189%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomicbook.com%2Fmarvel%2F2019%2F07%2F28%2Fthe-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-sam-wilson-captain-america%2F">Marc Bernadin claimed in a podcast</a> that the show may explore the government's disapproval of Wilson becoming the new Captain America, which would make sense considering their aversion to superheroes in previous films. If this storyline is pursued, we imagine that the show will also plant the seeds for Falcon to act as Cap in the big future MCU team-up movies - AKA, the fifth Avengers.</p>
      <p>Concept art for the show has also revealed that the government will have plans to replace Captain America with their own equivalent: John Walker/US Agent (Wyatt Russell). We won't spoil his role from the comics, but we have a feeling that he's bad news. </p>

      <p>As for Bucky? Well, as we’re seeing the return of Zemo, we can’t help but wonder if Bucky will be dragged back into his PTSD phase of The Winter Soldier using the mind techniques that were brought to fruition in Civil War. Or perhaps we’ll see Bucky actually acclimatising to the world a little bit. After all, he’s spent the majority of his time on the run and in hiding on Wakanda. </p>
      <p>Another character confirmed for the series is Sharon Carter (Emily Van Camp), who will likely be the point of contact in S.H.I.E.L.D that Barnes and Wilson report to for their missions. Hopefully these antics will make us all forget about the sort of incestuous plot line between her and Steve... *shudders*. </p>
