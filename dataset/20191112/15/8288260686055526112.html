      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:44:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United are the latest club to show an interest in Rangers midfielder Glen Kamara, according to reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> have been linked with the Finnish international, who moved to Ibrox for just £50,000 last January.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/leeds-united-in-hunt-to-sign-rangers-player-valued-at-10m/">Football Insider,</a> Leeds are now in the hunt for the Gers midfielder and were in attendance for his side’s 2-0 Europa League win over Porto.</p>

      <p>The report suggests that Leeds are looking at making a move for Kamara next summer as opposed to January, with Marcelo Bielsa only planning to make signings if some of their loanees leave the club.</p>
      <p>Rangers boss Steven Gerrard recently admitted that he expects a lot of interest in Kamara when the window opens on January 1.</p>

      <p>Asked about his value in the current market, Gerrard said: “I don’t put numbers on my players. But we know he is getting watched now.</p>
      <p>“We know that, and Glen can play at any level with the right players and style around him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The style we play is perfect for him — the system and the people around him. He is in a good place at a magnificent club.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone from Arsenal to get playing and is back at a fantastic club. If he keeps posting performances like that, a lot more people are going to sit up and take notice.</p>
      <p>“How do I know he’s being watched? Because I get a list of teams who are coming to our directors’ box!”</p>
