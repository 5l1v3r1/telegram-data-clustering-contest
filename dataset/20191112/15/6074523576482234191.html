      <h1>Tunisia’s Central Bank Denies Reports Claiming It Issued an E-Dinar</h1>

      <p>The Central Bank of Tunisia is denying reports that it has launched a digital currency.</p>
      <p>In a sweeping <a href="https://www.bct.gov.tn/bct/siteprod/actualites.jsp?id=638">rejection published this week</a> the central bank quashed “unfounded” rumors that it had become the first monetary authority to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC), asserting instead that an unaffiliated “proof of concept” project was taken “out of context:”</p>
      <blockquote>“The [Central Bank of Tunisia] has not engaged any relationship, of any kind, with any national or foreign provider with the aim of creating any digital currency.”</blockquote>
      <p>The bank did admit that it is considering a CBDC, as it says it is studying “all existing alternatives.” But there are no immediate plans for an E-Dinar to go live: “The bank is studying the opportunities and risks inherent in these new technologies, particularly in terms of cyber security and financial stability.”</p>
      <p>Last week, Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency <a href="https://tass.ru/nacionalnye-proekty/7090822">reported</a> the Central Bank was partnering with the Universa Blockchain to develop and issue a digital currency. The announcement was claimed to have come at a FOREX Club Tunisia event.</p>
      <p>But the Central Bank said that no announcement was ever made. Instead, it pointed to a CBDC test project demonstration at the FOREX event at the root of the misunderstanding:</p>
      <blockquote>“This test of POC (Proof of concept) was taken out of context becoming a marketing operation where the name of the BCT was improperly used.”</blockquote>
      <p>Universa’s CEO Alexander Borodich also presented the project at the Malta AI &amp; Blockchain Summit in Malta last week. Borodich hadn’t responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.</p>
      <p>Universa, which raised $28.8 million during an ICO in 2017, has been mired in a scandal in Russia. In March 2018, Universa community manager Artur Lipatov wrote a Facebook post saying that Universa’s blockchain could not power smart contracts, the company’s operations were in trouble, and that he was leaving – that post is now unavailable.</p>
      <p>The statement dropped Universa’s token value by 20 percent from $0.037 to $0.03 and Borodich <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/07/26/776644-universa">sued</a> his former employee for $15,500 for defamation.</p>
      <p>Tunisia earlier showed some mild interest to the blockchain tech. In 2015, the country’s Ministry of Communication Technologies <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tunisias-tech-ministry-seeks-blockchain-intern">posted a job opening</a> for an intern with blockchain knowledge. The same year, Tunisia’s postal service <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tunisias-post-office-trials-crypto-powered-payments-app">reported</a> trialing a crypto-powered payment app.</p>
      <p>The country remains open to experiments with the tech, according to today’s statement.</p>
