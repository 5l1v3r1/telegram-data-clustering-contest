      <p>An evil mum and dad who murdered their two children and tried to kill their other four are brother and sister, it can now be revelaed.</p>
      <p>Sarah Barrass, 35, plotted with Brandon Machin, 39, to kill their six children in May.</p>
      <p>It can now be reported that Machin is Barrass's half-brother and the father of the six children.</p>
      <p>Teenagers Tristan, 13, and Blake Barrass, 14, died after being strangled by the pair at a property in the Shiregreen area of Sheffield, and having bin bags placed over their heads.</p>
      <p>Sheffield Crown Court heard on Tuesday how, prior to the killings, Barrass and Machin had given four of her children - including Tristan and Blake - tablets against their will.</p>

      <p>The pair also tried to kill one of Barrass' children by attempting to drown them in a bath.</p>
      <p>A judge ruled that Barrass and Machin should both be jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors told how Barrass had requested help with the children from the local authority with the children, texting a friend to say: "I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. Mass murder, putting them all in care, checking in to the local nut house.</p>
      <p>"I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."</p>
      <p>Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, said that visitors to the children's home would hear Barrass tell her children: "I gave you life, I can take it away."</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin had been conspiring to kill the children for at least 10 days before they were found by police and paramedics on the morning of May 24.</p>

      <p>All the surviving children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are under the age of 13. </p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin had each admitted two counts of murder, conspiracy to murder six children and five counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The night before police were called to the home, Barrass and Machin forced the four eldest children, including Tristan and Blake, to swallow tablets.</p>
      <p>The evil killers had gathered up tablets from around the home and divided them among the children, expecting them to die. </p>
      <p>Miss Melly said: "None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so."</p>
      <p>Barrass then sent messages and and wrote posts on social media claiming that the youngsters were suffering from a sickness bug.</p>
      <p>Just minutes before they were strangled, the brothers told a friend on the Nintendo Switch gaming system that they weren't going to school that Friday (May 24) because they were "feeling sick", neighbours said at the time.</p>

      <p>After the tablets failed to kill the children, Barrass scoured the internet for details on how to murder her children, including suffocating, strangulation and drowning.</p>
      <p>She then called Machin to tell him that their sick plot had failed and he came over to the house, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly went on: "They decided the children were better off dead than in care and he said he would help Sarah Barrass to the best of his ability. </p>
      <p>"Barrass and Machin first strangled Blake, then Tristan, then placed bin bags over their heads to ensure their certain death."</p>
      <p>The court heard that Barrass had strangled Tristan by wrapping her dressing gown cord around his neck and pulling on it for around three minutes, while Machin strangled Blake with his hands.</p>
      <p>The pair also tried to kill one of the younger children by attempting to drown them in a bath, but that child survived.</p>
      <p>Following the murders and the attempted murder of the younger child who was placed in a bath, the mother took the surviving children to the bedroom and phoned the police.</p>

      <p>Miss Melly said the mother-of-six sent a message to a friend, in which she said: "I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. Mass murder, putting them all in care, checking in to the local nut house.</p>
