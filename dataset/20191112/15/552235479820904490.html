      <p>A Moodiesburn thug left his girlfriend gasping for air during a brutal attack.</p>
      <p>Despite choking his now ex-partner and repeatedly punching her on the head, 19-year-old Robbie Robinson has avoided a prison sentence for the August incident as it was his first offence.</p>
      <p>The Bridgeburn Drive teen, who has a son with his victim, will now have to organise visits to his child through a solicitor after a non-harassment order was granted at court.</p>
      <p>The procurator fiscal said: “The witness and the accused were in the locus.</p>
      <p>“The witness was woken by the accused and an argument started. He choked her for around 10 seconds and she struggled to breathe.</p>
      <p>“The argument continued and he punched her on the head on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>“He then stopped and went downstairs. She contacted police and they observed injuries to her head, neck, arm and shoulder.</p>
      <p>“During his interview he made admissions to the charge and was cautioned and charged.”</p>

      <p>“He’s a first offender with no previous convictions. He’s not employed at the moment and receives money on universal credit.</p>
      <p>“He’s described his behaviour as ‘appalling’ and is regretful and devastated by his actions. He understands the distress he put her under.</p>
      <p>“He recognises alcohol played a part in this but knows that’s not an excuse for the way he acted.</p>
      <p>“He’s assessed as a minimum risk reoffender but knows custody is an option for the court.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Petra Collins said: “You’re right that this was an appalling incident and I hope you never repeat it.</p>
      <p>“You’re a first offender so I’ll deal with this with a community payback order. You’ll be under supervision for 12 months and carry out 120 hours of unpaid work in the next six.</p>
      <p>“This is a direct alternative to custody. I’m also making a non-harassment order prohibiting you from contacting the witness.</p>
      <p>“You must go through your solicitor to sort out contact with your son.</p>
      <p>“This will last for 12 months.”</p>
