      <p>BURBANK, Calif. -- What do Mickey Mouse, Homer Simpson and Cinderella have in common? They're all settling into their new streaming home: <a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-DisneyPlus-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVDPlusLaunchDayMainStory-NA">Disney+, The Walt Disney Company's new streaming service</a> that launched Tuesday in the United States.</p>
      <p>A countdown clock running on several Disney-owned websites suggested that the streamer would launch at 6 a.m. ET, but Disney+ appeared to go live earlier than expected just after midnight Eastern time. Disney <a href="https://twitter.com/DisneyPlusHelp/status/1194268462283018241">tweeted</a> later Tuesday morning that "consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our high expectations" and added that the company is "working to quickly resolve the current user issue."</p>
      <p>
        <b>What can you watch on Disney+?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The hotly anticipated streamer is home to Disney's vast library of decades of entertainment content, primarily featuring films and television series from five of the company's core brands: Walt Disney Studios, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar and National Geographic. A testament to the size of the company's programming library, Disney flaunted "basically everything" available on Disney+ back in October with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=395415931130066">three-hour video</a> that featured excerpts of the trailers for nearly all of the content it planned to offer.</p>
      <p>"A Bug's Life," "Finding Nemo," "Free Solo," "Frozen," "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back," "The Incredibles," "The Little Mermaid" and "The Princess Diaries" are among the hundreds of library film titles available on Disney+. Disney's slate of theatrical releases, beginning with 2019's "Captain Marvel," will make their exclusive streaming debut on Disney+ after their run in theaters.</p>
      <p>On the television side, Disney+ will house the first 30 seasons of "The Simpsons" at launch thanks to a deal with recently acquired 20th Century Fox Television. Other library series available include "Boy Meets World," "Brain Games," "Kim Possible," "Mickey Mouse Clubhouse," "That's So Raven," and "Wicked Tuna." <a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/disney-lists-basically-everything-you-can-watch-on-disney-plus/5608593/">Click here to learn more about the list of content available on Disney+ at launch</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to library content offered on Disney+, Disney has spent years developing original films and series that will make their debut on the streamer. The slate of originals includes a live-action version of "Lady and the Tramp," the "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series" television series and "The Mandalorian," a Star Wars live-action series. Disney CFO Christine McCarthy told investors in April that the company expects to invest over $1 billion in cash in original content development in 2020.</p>
      <p>Some of the content buckets on Disney+ at launch include blockbuster "Hit Movies," Disney classics that are "Out of the Vault," brand-defining "Disney Channel Favorites," and decades of "Nostalgic Movies" from yesteryear in addition to the orignal content.</p>
      <p>"The launch of Disney+ is a historic moment for our company that marks a new era of innovation and creativity," Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said in a news release. "Disney+ provides an exceptional entertainment experience, showcasing our library of beloved movies, TV series and exclusive original content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic."</p>
      <p>
