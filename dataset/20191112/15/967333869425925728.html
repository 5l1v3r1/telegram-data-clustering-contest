      <p>The Russian-developed humanoid robot known as Skybot F-850 or FEDOR (Final Experimental Demonstration Object Research) may be deployed on an extravehicular activity during its next space mission which could take place a few years from now.</p>
      <p>The news was delivered by Yevgeny Dudorov, executive director of the company called Androidnaya Tekhnika which developed the robot, who said that such space deployment might take place in 2022.</p>
      <blockquote>"Our future plans involve several such missions. In 2022-2023, it’ll be the robot working on ISS’s hull," he said.</blockquote>
      <p>As Dudorov explained, Fedor would first be launched into space aboard the Orel (Eagle) spacecraft which won’t dock with the space station during its first flight.</p>
      <blockquote>And eventually, such robots could even be used during missions to the moon, replacing their lower “limbs” with wheeled chassis similar to that of a lunar rover, he added.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier this year, Fedor was sent on its first space mission, arriving on the International Space Station on 27 August aboard the Soyuz MS-14 spacecraft and returning back to Earth on 7 September via the same vessel.</p>
      <p>During its stay aboard the ISS, the robot performed a variety of activities which included simulated repairs of the station’s hull, joining electrical connectors, and working with various tools.</p>
      <p>Fedor is capable of operating in so called “avatar mode” i.e. guided by a human operator, and of carrying out pre-programmed tasks.</p>
