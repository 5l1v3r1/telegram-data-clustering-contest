      <p>The body of a middle aged woman has been found in a car in Mwingi Town Kitui County, in a bad state sending a shocker to the residents.</p>
      <p>The woman identified as Eunice Kiema was a lecturer at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) in Mwingi Town.</p>
      <p>According to Alex Mutemi, the Mwingi Central Sub-County administrator, the body of the lecturer was discovered in a bad state with eyes gouged out, legs burnt and other body parts stabbed, and left in her car, a Toyota Raum, KCJ 451B.</p>
      <p>She was identified to be married to a man that hailed from Kyuso in Mwingi North.</p>

      <p>The area sub-County police commander Peter Mutuma explained that the preliminary investigations into the murder indicated that it was premeditated, although with an unclear motive.</p>
      <p>“It appears that the suspects had even planned to set Kiema’s car alight after killing her. We found a matchbox in the vehicle. We pledge to get to the bottom of this and bring to book the killers,” said Mutuma.</p>
      <p>Residents, close friends and family to the deceased termed her as a very loving person who was very peaceful. They expressed their misery adding that her murder was a very big loss to family and friends.</p>
      <p>“Eunice loved peace. How I pray those behind her killing to be arrested and punished. In a similar incident, a man was killed in the same area last year. Police need to enhance their patrols in Mwingi Market as insecurity is on the rise,”said Joe Nyange, a close friend.</p>

      <p>This incident comes a few weeks after a lecturer from the University of Nairobi from the Nursing department was arrested in connection to the death of her son.</p>
      <p>Hannah Inyama, was arrested after the decomposing body of her son, Emmanuel Solomon, aged 13 years that was found in their house.</p>
      <p>The body was discovered after the caretaker alerted the police over a pungent smell that emanated from the house.</p>
      <p>The postmortem results indicated that Solomon died from severe bleeding in the stomach with severe stomach ulcers that led to hemorrhage.</p>
      <p>Hannah underwent a mental test and was found unfit to stand trial, with Makadara Chief Magistrate Heston Nyaga releasing her to her parents, to be kept under medication with a directive that she reports to the court every Friday for assessment.</p>
