      <p>The Royal Canadian Legion has marked this year's Remembrance Day by creating a custom level in Fortnite.</p>
      <p>Remembrance Island is a short, peaceful map made using Fortnite's Creative mode.</p>
      <p>It gives players a selection of areas to walk through, each themed around a military campaign in which Canadian soldiers have fought.</p>
      <p>There's no combat. You simply explore the level's poppy-lined pathways and read snippets of history, before coming to a final memorial - a recreation of the Vimy Ridge cenotaph - where the game suggests you salute to remember the fallen.</p>

      <p>It's a nice idea, if an unusual one to see within Fortnite - a game I'm currently playing as a half-man/half-tree character, and where the closest I have to a salute emote is a mournful slow dance.</p>
      <p>In a press release announcing the island, the Royal Canadian Legion explained the idea was "an effort to reach this younger audience on their native turf".</p>

      <p>"It's our hope that young Canadians will take a few moments to visit this unique environment and learn about the men and women who gave their lives to protect our freedom," said Royal Canadian Legion spokesman Freeman D. Chute.</p>
      <p>"As time goes on, we have to find new ways to reach young people and tell the story of Canadian veterans. This is a fantastic example of how to do just that."</p>
      <p>The level itself was put together by 19-year-old Texas-based creator Jadan "JXDVN" Allen, who worked on it free of charge.</p>
      <p>If you want to explore Remembrance Island yourself, you'll just need the following Fortnite island code: <a href="https://epicgames.com/fn/5053-3302-4847">5053-3302-4847</a>.</p>
