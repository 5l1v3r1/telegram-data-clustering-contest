      <p>A woman’s night out on the town ended in a life-changing event when she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/reproductive-health/pregnancy">gave birth</a> on the dance floor. The woman, who was only identified as a 19-year-old, was visiting the O’Club in Toulouse, France, when she suddenly went into labor, according to CEN.</p>

      <p>At around 5:30 a.m. on Monday, which is near the club’s closing time, a bouncer approached the club’s manager after seeing the woman lie down on the floor to alert her of the emergency, according to the report.</p>
      <p>“There were not many people and a bouncer came to see me,” Marie-Helene, who was identified as the manager, told CEN. “He said ‘It’s urgent.’ I then saw that she was giving birth.”</p>

      <p>The baby, whose gender was not revealed, was reportedly born in good health, and has been offered “free entry for life.” Marie-Helene said the baby's mother had been at the club with a friend for a "change of scene."</p>
