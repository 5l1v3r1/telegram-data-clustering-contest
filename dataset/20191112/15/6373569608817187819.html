      <p>Plymouth's conservation charity, the Ocean Conservation Trust, is launching a new campaign to get people across the whole of the UK to think more about the ocean.</p>
      <p>The Trust, which runs the National Marine Aquarium, wants the ocean to be at the forefront of people’s minds and is going to work with some influencers across the country to make sure this becomes the case.</p>
      <p>‘Think Ocean’ is the campaign and it has been launched in Britain’s Ocean City and elsewhere as visits to meet ocean advocates in Bristol, Manchester and London took place.</p>
      <p>David Attenborough has brought attention on the amount of pollution that is in our oceans with documentary programmes such as Blue Planet.</p>
      <p>Plymouth Live has also done its bit to try and help deal with climate change by launching a major campaign to take immediate action against it, asking people to make small changes to their daily lives. Read all about it <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/change-plymouth">here</a>.</p>
      <p>From recycling more to using public transport and reducing food waste, small things can have big impacts.</p>
      <p>Even though many individuals have taken steps to reduce their own consumption of single-use plastic, the Ocean Conservation Trust says that important conversations about the future of our planet as a whole often fail to acknowledge the vital role that is played by the Ocean.</p>

      <p>Roger Maslin, CEO of the Ocean Conservation Trust, said: “The Ocean drives the climate, makes the Earth habitable and sustains all life.</p>
      <p>“Yet despite being vitally important in so many ways, its presence in the mainstream media and on the political stage is lacking.</p>
      <p>“At the Ocean Conservation Trust, we want to change this and get as many people thinking about the Ocean, in positive ways, as we can.</p>
      <p>“Many of us have happy memories of the Ocean, whether that’s a childhood day at the beach building sandcastles or a more recent adventure surfing with friends. But some of us have less obvious ones, too.</p>
      <p>“If you don’t live near the beach, you might have gone for a swim in a river or lake, taken a walk beside a canal, visited an aquarium or tuned into calming Ocean sounds as part of meditation practice – so whether directly or indirectly, it means something to us all.”</p>
      <p>Nicola Bridge, head of conservation education and communications, said it was about more than just happy memories.</p>
      <p>She believes that many don’t realise just how much of a role the ocean plays in our day-to-day lives.</p>
      <p>“The Ocean is a part of all of our daily routines, sometimes in ways that might surprise you.</p>
      <p>“When you turn on your tap in the morning to brush your teeth, the water you use, as well as the algae in your toothpaste, comes from the Ocean.</p>
      <p>“When you watch TV or use the internet, some of the materials used to make that happen have come from the ocean.</p>

        <figcaption>The aim of the campaign is to inspire positive behaviour change to create a healthy ocean for the future</figcaption>

      <p>“And when you buy your favourite foods at the supermarket, many of those have been shipped over to the UK, via the ocean.</p>
      <p>“Most importantly perhaps, though, is the fact that every time you breathe, half of the oxygen you take in has come from the ocean – so we literally need it to survive.”</p>
      <p>The idea of ‘Think Ocean’ is to get people to think more deeply about how day-to-day activity can impact the ocean.</p>
      <p>Nicola added: “Telling people facts and science isn’t enough to make them want to make changes in their lives to benefit the ocean – but experiencing and connecting with it, which makes people love and value it, is.</p>
      <p>“Once they love it, they will want to take care of it – and only then will they be ready to change.</p>
      <p>“Our approach, as a progressive ocean conservation charity, is to be optimistic, putting people at the centre of conservation and helping them to have these great experiences with the ocean and to appreciate it for all that it is.</p>
      <p>“It’s then that we can begin helping them to understand how they can be a part of the solution. We can all do our bit to help if we Think Ocean.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, our aim is to inspire positive behaviour change to create a healthy Ocean for our futures – and for the benefit and enjoyment of all.”</p>
