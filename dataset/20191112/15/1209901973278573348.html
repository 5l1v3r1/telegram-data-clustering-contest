      <p>Police in Toronto say a two-and-a-half year old girl is dead after she was struck by an air conditioner that fell from an eighth-floor apartment.</p>
      <p>Const. Caroline de Kloet, a police spokeswoman, said the child died in hospital after she was hit Monday outside an east-end apartment building.</p>
      <p>“It’s a terrible tragedy,” she said. “From the interviews that investigators have done, they’ve come to the conclusion that there won’t be any criminal charges.”</p>
      <p>De Kloet said the youngster was with other people at the time, but investigators have not yet confirmed who they were, or if the girl’s family lives in the same area.</p>
      <p>She also said there was information that a stroller was seen at the site, but it’s not yet known if the girl was in it.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman also said the air conditioner was in a window before it fell.</p>
      <p>Police received a call for help in the city’s east end around 3:30 p.m, and upon arrival discovered that an air conditioner had fallen from a suite and struck the child.</p>
      <p>She was taken to hospital with very serious injuries.</p>
