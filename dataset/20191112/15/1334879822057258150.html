      <h1>How to Organize Information and Tidy up Your Thoughts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:00:32+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leon Ho</a></address>
      <p>Over 4 million blog posts are published every day.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/854926/how-to-organize-information#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> That is a lot of information and it’s only getting bigger. While the vast majority of people won’t be reading that many blog posts, people still consume a lot of information.</p>
      <p>Maybe not through blog posts, but through social media, and the news. But that doesn’t change the fact that our intake of information is larger now. And some people have been calling the issues that we face with this larger intake of info as <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-fight-information-overload.html">information overload</a>. There are all kinds of strategies to help us mitigate but, what is we’re going at this the wrong way? What if the problem is because we don’t know how to organize information?</p>
      <p>I believe that is the case when we consider our own behavior around information. This, in turn, explains why we need to organize information and find methods to do so effectively.</p>
      <p>While there is nothing wrong with the amount of information available, it is up to us to determine how we use it. In so many cases, people have had no self-control or that they haven’t bothered to learn how to organize information. This fact amongst a few other reasons is why this is important.</p>
      <h3>We’ve Grown Addicted To Consuming Information</h3>
      <p>As Karol Krol put simply in an <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-fight-information-overload.html">article at Lifehack</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“The sole fact that there’s more and more information published online every single day is not the actual problem. Only the quality information becomes the problem. The amount of epic content on the Internet these days is so big that it’s virtually impossible for us to digest it all. But we try anyway.”</blockquote>
      <p>This creates a situation where we are constantly digesting information mainly because “<i>we have got to know this</i>.” Even if we never apply that information in our own lives.</p>
      <p>All of this behavior is similar to the idea of attending seminars hosted by motivational speakers or thought leaders. People walk out of those seminars and most never practice what they learned.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/854926/how-to-organize-information#footnote_plugin_tooltip_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
      <p>Consuming information on your own is not that different.</p>
      <h3>Too Much Information Creates Clutter</h3>
      <p>A while ago, I<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/614685/how-clutter-drains-your-brain-and-what-you-can-do-about-it"> explained a scenario</a> where you are reading and focusing on a book on the bus. Suddenly, someone sits near you and is in the middle of a loud personal conversation about their friend’s love life.</p>
      <p>Even though you are a bystander in that conversation, that’s still information and can create a lot of clutter. It’s similar to having other distractions on your desk that pull you away from work or some other productive activity.</p>
      <p>But one other aspect I failed to bring up is that, clutter can exist from build-up too. In the case of information, reading several articles on the same topic can create a lot of clutter.</p>
      <p>
        <i>What sort of information is important?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>This post said this is important while another post said it wasn’t important. What information is relevant here?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>What information should you internalize and apply?</i>
      </p>
      <p>In the end, the information creates noise and it can be tough for us to organize that information based on our feelings and current devices.</p>
      <h3>How to Organize Information Effectively</h3>
      <p>How to organize information can be simple once you have a plan. There are also a variety of tactics to consider using to best organize information.</p>
      <p>But the most important thing about information is how much we consume is up to us. We have complete control over our information diet and how we distribute it.</p>
      <h4>1. The LATCH Principle</h4>
      <p>An effective method is one that Richard Saul Wurman developed in 1996. In his book<i> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3857094583?tag=s7621-20">Information Architect</a></i>, he took a previous existing theory – the Five Hat Racks – and formulated what is known as the LATCH principle.</p>
      <p>Now, what does that mean? Wurman explained:</p>
      <blockquote>“Information may be infinite, however…The organization of information is finite as it can only be organized by LATCH: Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, or Hierarchy.”</blockquote>
      <p>Indeed, this method is all about organizing information in a broader sense. You’re not focusing so much on your own priorities but better organizing your information diet.</p>
      <p>According to Wurman, this is the best method to organize information mainly because he tested the principle a thousand times. Every time he tried something different, he went directly to one of those five methods.</p>
      <p>He may have a bias since he is the creator of this principle but, it does work wonders. I argue this because of two key reasons:</p>
      <p>First, to organize anything, you must first remove a lot of things you don’t need. Going back to clutter, it creates a lot of noise and it distracts us from our current goals and priorities in life.</p>
      <p>Second is that, organizing alleviates a lot of anxiety. And in order to organize properly, there has to be some kind of method or system. It’s not really organizing if there is no method to how you’re sorting things.</p>
      <p>This is where LATCH comes in. LATCH provides five methods that we can choose from to organize anything in our lives:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Location</b> can be used in a variety of situations. It’s akin to giving directions. We focus on the most relevant things to be within reach. Similarly, we also use it to show how things are connected to one another.</li>
        <li><b>Alphabet</b> is organizing the information alphabetically. This can be helpful when organizing a list of people and statistics. Or maybe a dictionary of industry lingo or official documents.</li>
        <li><b>Time</b> works great with communication. Information revolving around scheduling appointments, or organizing projects. It’s good to use this method when providing step by step instructions or when things have to be in chronological order.</li>
        <li><b>Category</b> is the method to organize information by similarity or relatedness. Think back to the collection lists I mentioned earlier.</li>
        <li><b>Hierarchy</b> is about organizing information that is used collectively to compare things. Think t-shirt sizes or how you’d rate food or a product or service. Everyone uses that same metric to organize information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While in most situations, people would wear multiple hats, the fact still remains that we instinctively use at least one of these methods. Whether we’re organizing information or collecting it, the LATCH method is the way to go.</p>
      <h4>2. Mind Mapping</h4>
      <p>Mind mapping is a method of capturing thoughts and organizing them in a visual way. In the industry, it’s been a sort of buzzword despite few people actually explaining what it means or how to make one.</p>
      <p>The overall idea with mind mapping is to create a detailed to-do list. You have daily tasks that you want to accomplish, but it goes a step farther.</p>
      <p>Mind mapping encourages you to think longer term such as what you wish to do in five years with anything in your life. It doesn’t largely address the intake of daily information, however, this is an extremely effective tool to organize what matters most to you.</p>
      <p>This combats information overload as it gives you another way to evaluate information. If it’s relevant to your goals and desires, jot it down. If not, remove it from your mind.</p>
      <p>Here’s a guide to help you start mind mapping: <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-use-mind-map-organize-your-life.html">How to Use a Mind Map to Organize Your Life</a></p>
      <h4>3. Create Lists</h4>
      <p>Besides using the above frameworks, you can start a simple habit of using post-it notes or big notepad to create a series of lists. Make a to-do list every day and use that to organize the most important tasks for you to complete that day.</p>
      <p>If you feel the need to add routine items, make a separate list with those. Either way, lists help to organize what must be done and give you a sense of time management as well. After all, you’ll know roughly how long something ought to take you to complete.</p>
      <h4>4. Create Collections</h4>
      <p>Similar to the lists, make collections too. What I mean by this is put the notes that you make into specific groups of information. For example, if you have a lot of information on business ideas, or opportunities, write them in a book or place them in a digital document. Keep it separate from your list of self-improvement and mindset tips.</p>
      <p>Also, consolidate those collections. Toss out the information you no longer need or have tried before.</p>
      <h4>5. Place Priority on Key Information</h4>
      <p>Most times, blog posts will contain a lot of essential information. If you’re the type to consume a lot, it’s going to be tough to manage it all. This particular strategy takes the idea of making lists to the next level.</p>
      <p>The idea is summarizing the information or placing the key points in a list you can consult later. It doesn’t have to be organized in a collection or anything. The idea is that it’ll be easier to digest and process later when your brain has energy.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
      <p>In a world where we are addicted to hoarding information in ourselves, we risk getting distracted and move further away from our true priorities.</p>
      <p>By learning how to organize information better, we can remove the things we don’t need. Better yet, we can learn to place a higher priority on things that are more important to our lives.</p>
      <p>When we begin to organize information and our behaviour, we become more in control over our lives and what we let in.</p>
