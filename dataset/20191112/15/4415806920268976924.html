      <h1>Airbnb guests to spend estimated €212m in Irish restaurants and cafes this year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:48:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Guests on Airbnb are projected to spend an estimated €212 million in Irish restaurants and cafes in 2019, according to new figures from the booking website.</p>
      <p>The projected spend is an increase of 31% from 2018 when estimated spending totaled €170 million.</p>
      <p>Airbnb offers guests the chance to experience local foods and flavours by learning to cook a traditional recipe or discovering neighbourhood restaurants and cafes, through its Airbnb Experiences.</p>
      <p>Guests on the platform are projected to spend €86 million in Dublin in 2019, an increase from €75 million in 2018.</p>
      <p>Almost 60% of total guest spending in restaurants and cafes in Ireland this year is spent outside of Dublin.</p>
      <p>According to the data, guests spent almost a third (32%) of their total trip budget on food when visiting Ireland and nearly half (45%) of all guest spending occurred in the neighbourhood in which they were staying.</p>
      <p>According to the survey, 93% of Irish hosts said that they recommend local restaurants and cafes to guests, driving more people to visit places they might not otherwise discover.</p>
      <p>Airbnb’s guest community spent at least an estimated €21 billion at restaurants and cafes in 2018 globally, based on data for 46 countries and regions.</p>
      <p>If spending levels remain the same, Airbnb guests are estimated to spend over €27 billion at restaurants and cafes in these same locations in 2019.</p>
