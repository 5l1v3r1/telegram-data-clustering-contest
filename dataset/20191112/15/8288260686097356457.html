      <h1>'Shine for us' Birmingham City fans react to star's four-word message</h1>
      <h2>For the second time this season Birmingham City's Jefferson Montero came off the bench in the closing stages of a match and terrorised the visitors’ defence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T15:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Jefferson Montero reminded Birmingham City fans what they had been missing with a thrilling cameo at the end of Saturday’s loss to Fulham.</p>
      <p>The on-loan winger ended a spell of more than two months on the sidelines to make just his third appearance since his summer move from Swansea.</p>
      <p>For the second time this season he came on in the closing stages and terrorised the visitors’ defence, setting up a chance for Lukas Jutkiewicz and sending over a series of crosses from the bye-line that suggested a way back for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> .</p>

      <p>The equaliser didn’t come but Montero was still pleased to be back in contention having been carried off with a thigh injury at the end of August.</p>
      <p>On his official Twitter account he posted a 40-second video of him pulling at the Fulham defence with the message ‘Glad to come back’.</p>
      <p>The supporters who reacted shared that sentiment.</p>
