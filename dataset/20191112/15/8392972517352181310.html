      <p>Scary Spice Mel B waged war with supermarket giant Tesco this week after the store used her image on an advert.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of the ad to her Instagram page, Mel urged Tesco – who <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/tescos-christmas-2019-food-range-includes-turkey-and-stuffing-crisps/">recently unveiled its Christmas food</a> range – to get in touch.</p>
      <p>"Can the CEO OF @tescofood DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you," she raged.</p>

      <p>The ad featured a picture of Mel being used to sell the store's new Clubcard Plus.</p>
      <p>A speech bubble coming from the singer's mouth made a play on the lyrics to the band's hit Stop.</p>

      <p>It said: "Stop right now. You get 10% off two big shops a month for £7.99."</p>
      <p>A further speech bubble read: "Thank you very much."</p>

      <p>Mel's fans were quick to back the singer. One said: "Guess what they want, really really want is a lawsuit."</p>

      <p>"The wrath of Scary is about to be unleashed I think!" said another.</p>
      <p>Since Mel's post, Tesco has pulled the ad. However, the store insists it had permission to use the singer's image.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson said: "Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign."</p>
      <p>They added: "We had authorisation to use this image, but we’re sorry Mel B is unhappy so we’ve stopped using it."</p>

      <p>Small-print at the bottom of the advert read: "Mel B is a patron for Women’s Aid and Tesco is making a donation to the charity."</p>
      <p>Back in 2007, all the Spice Girls – including Victoria Beckham, who decided against taking part in this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/spice-girls-tour-off-to-a-horrific-start-as-fans-left-sobbing/">reunion tour</a> – appeared in the Tesco Christmas ad.</p>
