      <p>There has been a couple of information regarding next year’s iPhone 12. According to the latest concept renders of this device, the square frame appearance is consistent and it includes a ToF lens. There are rumors that Apple will return to the classic design of the iPhone 4 in the 2020 model. If so, the iPhone 12 will abandon the popular arc border for a sharper square border. This will be more like the 2018 iPhone Pro.</p>

      <p>As a result, the overall line of the iPhone 12 tougher and unified with the iPad Pro and MacBook Pro styles. Although it seems a bit thick from the side, according to the iPad Pro experience, its thickness control will not be worse than the current smooth curved frame. There have been rumors that Apple may be experimenting with prototypes that have no screen gaps or smaller screen gaps. It may try to accommodate the TrueDepth Face ID camera, handset, and front camera into the top of the phone.</p>
      <p>iPhone 12 may be Apple’s first four-camera phone. ARKit has become a powerful platform, and Apple AR glasses work slowly, but at least it seems to be smooth. In order for the iPhone to do a better AR job, it is necessary to add a ToF (Time of Flight) lens to the rear camera system.</p>
