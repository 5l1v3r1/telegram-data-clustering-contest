      <p>The film was originally set to hit theaters this past weekend but after very negative reviews from audiences surrounding the design of the iconic character, Paramount delayed the release to February 14, 2020 with the goal of redesigning Sonic to better fit his look from the video games.</p>
      <p>Written by Patrick Casey (<b>Golan the Insatiable</b>), Josh Miller (<b>Golan the Insatiable</b>) and Oren Uziel (<b>The Cloverfield Paradox</b>), the film follows Tom Wachowski, a cop in the rural town of Green Hills, who decides to help Sonic escape from the government looking to capture him. The film is directed by Jeff Fowler and executive produced by Tim Miller (<b>Terminator: Dark Fate</b>).</p>
