      <p>Private equity group Cerberus, which controls a three per cent stake in the lender, is understood to be keen for change at the top in the wake of Deutsche’s collapsed merger talks with Commerzbank.</p>
      <p>Speculation of worsening relations between the two sides comes after a torrid period for Deutsche Bank, which has suffered steepening losses in the last 12 months amid industry challenges, botched tie-up plans with Commerzbank and high-profile financial probes.</p>

      <p>Deutsche has vowed to cut 18,000 jobs and shut its loss-making equities business, where revenues over the quarter plummeted 32 per cent, as it calls time on its 20-year attempt to rival Wall Street’s investment banking giants.</p>

      <p>Sources also told the FT that Deutsche Bank’s other big investors have had an increasingly negative view of Achleitner’s performance.</p>
      <p>Achleitner, who is set to end his term in 2022, took over as Deutsche’s chair in 2012.</p>
