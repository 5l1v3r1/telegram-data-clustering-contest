      <p>Two restaurants in Bangkok have earned a pair of coveted Michelin stars, the first time the leading guide has awarded the accolade to local establishments offering Thai cuisine.</p>
      <p>The restaurants - Sorn and R-Haan - were upgraded from their previous one-star rating in the third edition of the Michelin guide in Thailand, unveiled on Tuesday in the capital.</p>
      <p>Sorn celebrates traditional techniques and recipes from southern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/thailand.html">Thailand</a>, where it sources from a network of small producers.</p>
      <p>At the helm of R-Haan, Chef Chumpol offers food inspired by products from all regions of the kingdom.</p>
      <p>No establishment won three stars in this 2020 edition, but three others retain two stars - the French restaurants Le Normandie and Mezzaluna, as well as Suhring, a restuarant owned by German twin brothers.</p>
      <p>This year, some 29 establishments in Thailand received stars.</p>
      <p>Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Michelin Guides, said the ratings showcased "Thailand's rich diversity and high quality of local produce".Â </p>
      <h3>Allegations of Eurocentrism</h3>
      <p>Thailand is already famed for its street food and Bangkok's curbside crab omelette standout Jay Fai retained its one star.</p>
      <p>Despite criticism over its alleged Eurocentrism and focus on pricey restaurants, the red guide, created in 1900, remains a key reference in the world of the gastronomy.</p>
      <p>Out of some 20,000 restaurants listed worldwide, only about 100 have achieved the highest distinction of "three stars".</p>
