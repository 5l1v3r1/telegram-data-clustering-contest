        <i>Today’s fluff is the only bee in your bonnet</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Liverpool</b> are monitoring Bournemouth’s 25-year-old mobile assist factory <b>Ryan Fraser</b>, whose contract runs out at the end of the season, and might even be able to snag him in January, reports the Sun. “Liverpool loaned winger <b>Harry Wilson</b> to <b>Bournemouth</b> in the summer and the south coast side may be keen to make the move permanent with a swap,” it trills. The Liverpool Echo, however, insists that Jürgen Klopp is “more than happy with the attacking options at his disposal” and has no plans for a mid-season move for Fraser or anyone else. It continues its joyless rumour-busting by adding that a previously trailed move for Borussia Mönchengladbach’s <b>Denis Zakaria </b>will also not happen, as Klopp “will continue to work with the wealth of options available to him in midfield”. Bah.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester United</b> are keeping an eye on the Ajax goalkeeper <b>André Onana</b>, with their interest in a potential summer move for the 23-year-old suggesting that David de Gea’s time at Old Trafford might finally be creeping towards a conclusion. In further goalkeeping news, <b>Crystal Palace</b> and <b>Brighton</b> are both monitoring the Slovan Bratislava gloveman <b>Dominik Greif</b>, insists the Mail, with both clubs sending their goalkeeping coaches to watch the Slovakian in action <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/07/wolves-slovan-bratislava-europa-league-match-report">against Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> in the Europa League last week. Apparently the 22-year-old impressed them both, and they will “continue to monitor” him over the next couple of months before deciding on a potential swoop.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester City</b> plan to “flex their <b>financial muscle</b>” in January as they seek to replace the departing David Silva, the gently ageing Sergio Agüero and the long-gone Vincent Kompany. Their budget for this spree is anyone’s guess, but the Mail surmises that the moves “would likely cost City a total of at least £100m”. They are not the only Premier League club pondering a mid-season spree, with Ralph Hasenhüttl having “warned <b>Southampton</b>’s top brass” that they need to go on a wild relegation-dodging January transfer binge, says the Mirror. “Hasenhüttl’s priorities are a <b>new right-back</b> and a top-quality <b>central defender</b>,” it says.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s <b>Olivier Giroud</b> is linked to <b>Internazionale</b> yet again in Tuesday’s <i>Tuttosport</i>, who reveals the three names that top Antonio Conte’s January wish list: Chelsea’s 33-year-old Frenchman, the 21-year-old Genoa forward <b>Christian Kouamé</b>, and the 24-year-old SPAL striker <b>Andrea Petagna</b>. Meanwhile Juventus are planning a clearout, with <b>Mario Mandzukic</b>,<b> Mattia Perin</b> and <b>Marko Pjaca</b> all deemed disposable – the latter two likely to leave on loan – and <b>Emre Can</b>, Daniele Rugani and Merih Demiral also potentially available in January.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid haven’t exactly left <b>Vinicius Junior</b> out in the cold, but his record of four league starts and none in Europe indicates that he is perhaps just a little chilly, his Brazilian compatriot Rodrygo having arrived in the summer and snaffled his starting spot. Eagle-eyed <b>Paris Saint-Germain</b> have spotted this, and according to the Spanish paper Sport are considering a move. The Brazilian is seen as a criticism-deflecting human shield should either Neymar or Kylian Mbappé move away from Paris, with the Parisians’ sporting director, Leonardo, apparently wanting “to shield himself with a crack” should either of the team’s two top superstars get lured away.</p>
      <p>Managerless <b>Cardiff</b> will target either <b>Chris Hughton</b> or <b>Lee Bowyer</b> after Neil Warnock <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/11/neil-warnock-leaves-cardiff-city-by-mutual-consent">left the club by mutual consent</a> on Monday, writes the Times, though other names are apparently under consideration, including Newport County’s Michael Flynn and the former Middlesbrough bosses Aitor Karanka and the dreaded Tony Pulis.</p>
