      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim has dismissed an allegation that Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad interfered in the court case of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak.</p>
      <p>Anwar said the allegation was unfounded as the country’s legal process was conducted in a transparent and an independent manner and should be respected.</p>
      <p>“I do not want to get involved...the judge has ordered Najib to enter his defence, so the legal process is ongoing.</p>
      <p>“I don't think we should entertain such allegations unless they can give some facts or evidence to support; otherwise we should allow the due process to proceed,” he told reporters at the Parliament lobby today.</p>
      <p>Media reports had quoted Umno supreme council member Datuk Lokman Noor Adam as alleging that the prime minister had interfered in Najib’s case.</p>
      <p>This was following the High Court’s decision yesterday ordering Najib to enter his defence on all seven charges of misappropriating RM42 million belonging to SRC International Sdn Bhd.</p>
