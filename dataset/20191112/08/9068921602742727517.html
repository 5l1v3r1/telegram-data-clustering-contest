      <h1>Disney+ Likely to Cost £6.99 Per Month in UK, €7.49 in France</h1>

      <p>Last week, Disney CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/08/disney-to-launch-in-europe-march-31-2020/">revealed</a> that Disney+ will launch in the United Kingdom and other select European countries on March 31, 2020.</p>

      <p>Iger didn't mention how much European customers would have to pay to access its 500 feature films and over 7,500 shows, including the entire Pixar library and a raft of original content. <br/><br/>However, one MacRumors reader appears to have discovered the British and French pricing plans ahead of time, simply by switching between Apple accounts on his iPhone. <br/><br/>Jean-Marc first downloaded the Disney+ app from the US <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/">App Store</a> using his US Apple ID, and then switched to his French Apple ID, followed by his British Apple ID. The Disney+ subscription screen subsequently presented him with the following monthly and yearly pricing plans.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>France: €7.49 per month or €75.99 per year.</li>
        <li>UK: £6.99 per month or £68.99 per year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, these prices haven't been officially announced by Disney and could be subject to change before the service launches in Europe next year. <br/><br/>However, given that Disney+ costs $6.99 per month in the U.S. (or $69.99 per year), it was pretty much expected that the dollar price would be mirrored in pound sterling. <br/><br/>As for the price in Euros, it's unclear if this applies only to France or to other Euro-using countries as well. We do know that Disney+ costs €6.99 in the Netherlands (€69.99 per year) because of its early trial there, so perhaps we can expect some variation between EU territories. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the annual prices given are equal to 12 months at €6.33/month and £5.75/month, respectively, offering a 16 percent saving over the monthly plan. <br/><br/><i>(Thanks, Jean-Marc!)</i></p>
