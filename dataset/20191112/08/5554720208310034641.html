      <p>Republic TV’s Arnab Goswami recently welcomed controversial <i>guru </i>and founder of Patanjali Ayurved, Ramdev, in his studio on the day the Supreme Court delivered its much-awaited verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute case. With a favourable Supreme Court ruling, Ramdev was unable to hide his excitement and decided to hug and lift Goswami in the air. The video of Ramdev hugging and lifting the Republic TV founder in the air has now triggered a wave of memes on social media,</p>

      <p>Ramdev lifting Goswami in the air may have gone unnoticed had Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera not tweet the photo asking his followers to write a suitable caption. He wrote, “Caption contest. Intelligent captions will get RTd/liked.”</p>

      <p>Goswami had founded Republic TV with the help of BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar in 2017. As for Ramdev, he’s been a fierce supporter of the BJP and its Hindutva ideology. He had played a key role in leading a public agitation with Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal against the then Manmohan Singh government at the Centre in 2011 and 2012. This led to the creation of the Aam Aadmi Party, which is now in government in Delhi.</p>
