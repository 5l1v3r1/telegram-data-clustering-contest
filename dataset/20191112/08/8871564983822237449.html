      <h1>Son of official in West Java allegedly shoots contractor over IDR500 million project payment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:52:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Police in the Majalengka regency of West Java are currently investigating the alleged shooting of a contractor by a civil servant on Sunday night. The alleged shooter, who authorities identified by his initials IN, has also been confirmed as the second son of incumbent Majalengka Regent, Karna Sobahi. </p>
      <p>Deputy Chief of Majalengka Police Hidayatullah said the incident took place when the contractor, identified as Panji Pamungkasandi, demanded the payment for a project from IN. The project itself was reportedly concluded earlier this year in April, and the two had agreed to meet at a shophouse located in the Cigasong area.</p>
      <p>“Panji demanded the payment for his project, approximately at IDR500 million (US$35,600). We didn’t know how it went, maybe there was a heated row, [but] IN took out his gun. During the meeting, the payment had been made. As to why the shooting had occurred, that’s what we are investigating,” Hidayatullah said today, <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-barat/d-4781261/detik-detik-anak-bupati-majalengka-tembak-kontraktor-yang-tagih-utang">as quoted by </a><i><a href="https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-barat/d-4781261/detik-detik-anak-bupati-majalengka-tembak-kontraktor-yang-tagih-utang">Detik</a>.</i></p>
      <p>Panji was reportedly shot in the arm, for which he received treatment at a local hospital. He has since returned home.</p>
      <p>Hidayatullah said the 9mm caliber gun IN had used <a href="https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-barat/d-4781474/anak-bupati-majalengka-tembak-kontraktor-pakai-pistol-kaliber-9-mm">has a permit from Indonesian Shooting Association (Perbakin)</a>, which is valid until next year. </p>
      <p>At the time of writing, Majalengka Police has yet to officially name IN as a suspect.</p>
