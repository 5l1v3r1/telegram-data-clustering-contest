      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14680"/>Acer announced the 43-inch Predator CG437K P large format gaming display (LFGD) is now available. Featuring a trifecta of the best technologies, including a giant 4K screen, up to 144Hz overclocking and VESA-Certified DisplayHDR 1000 certification.</p>
      <p>The ultra-high definition (3840 x 2160) 4K VA panel delivers sharp images, while a 1ms response time and up to a 144Hz refresh rate (120Hz native) via overclocking helps gamers respond quickly to gain an advantage over opponents. Leveraging AdaptiveSync and NVIDIA® G-Sync® compatible, it syncs to the frame rate of the system’s graphics card to eliminate stuttering, resulting in uninterrupted game play, so gamers can best focus on the task at hand. In addition, the CG437K also supports a variable refresh rate (VRR) via HDMI to provide smooth gaming on Xbox One consoles. With a wide color gamut of 90 percent of the DCI-P3 color space, low Delta E&lt;1 color accuracy and VESA-Certified DisplayHDR™ 1000 certification, colors are richer and blacks deeper, creating more vibrant images that pop with supreme contrast and color accuracy. The Predator CG437K P not only packs a giant display, but carries dual 10-watt speakers that deliver immersive and lifelike audio.</p>
      <p><b>Futuristic, Flexible Design</b><br/>The Predator CG437K P was designed with sleek angular details and refined panels for a futuristic, yet understated look and feel. It comes with four magnetic LED light strips offering 9 different modes with special lighting effects that can be attached to the back and programmed to gameplay, music or video. The solid metal stand is sleekly sculpted, yet strong and rigid to support the large panel, while the detachable base has concave areas for conveniently storing game controllers. A bundled remote control and VESA mount compatibility affords the enjoyment of gameplay, movies and more from the comfort of the couch. Excellent connectivity includes a variety of ports, including Type-C, three HDMI, two DisplayPort 1.4, two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0. With USB Type-C, gamers can view their favorite mobile games on this huge display with any guru using joysticks and smartphones via Bluetooth.</p>
      <p><b>Power-Saving Technologies</b><br/>A light sensor detects the room’s light level and automatically adjusts brightness to optimize visual comfort. With its built-in proximity sensor, the Predator CG437K P is able to detect if someone is within range. It wakes up when a person is close and enters a power-saving mode when they leave the area. If no one is detected for an extended length of time, the display enters standby mode.</p>
      <p><b>Pricing and Warranty</b><br/>The Predator CG437K P gaming monitor is available in the United States for $1,499.99 MSRP.</p>
