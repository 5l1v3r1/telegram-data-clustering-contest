      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd expects Malaysia's economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), to weaken to 4.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in 2019's third quarter (3Q19) from 4.9% in 2Q19 after taking into account the country's mining drag and waning industrial momentum.</p>
      <p>CGS-CIMB economists Michelle Chia and Lim Yee Ping wrote in a note today the 1.7% y-o-y rise in Malaysia's industrial production index (IPI) in September 2019 was in line with consensus forecast but below CGS-CIMB's expectation of a 2.5% gain.</p>
      <p>"Cumulatively, the IPI rose 1.6% y-o-y in 3Q19, the most subdued pace since 1Q13. More worryingly, the manufacturing sector expanded just 3.3% y-o-y in 3Q19, registering the weakest growth since 2013. The mining drag and waning industrial momentum will weigh on the economy in 3Q19. We project Malaysia's GDP growth to moderate from 4.9% y-o-y in 2Q19 to 4.6% y-o-y in 3Q19.</p>
      <p>"On a seasonally-adjusted basis, the IPI fell 0.3% m-o-m (month-on-month) in September (+0.8% m-o-m in Aug)," the economists said.</p>
      <p>Bank Negara Malaysia is scheduled to announce the nation's 3Q19 GDP numbers on Friday (Nov 15), according to the central bank's website.</p>
