      <h1>Disney won’t share ratings for original Disney+ titles despite industry push to do so</h1>
      <h2>Netflix has started being more transparent, but Disney won’t</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:01:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Disney won’t publicly share viewership numbers for its original series and movies, despite fellow streaming giants like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18412309/netflix-transparency-data-viewers-ratings-subscribers-bird-box-numbers">Netflix being more transparent in the wake of industry-wide criticism.</a></p>
      <p>The content and development teams overseeing Disney+ have spoken about how they’re approaching sharing metrics in internal conversations, according to multiple Disney executives. The company currently doesn’t see a reason to share metrics with the public, although creative talent who partner with Disney on Disney+ titles will receive some form of ratings.</p>
      <p>Since Disney+ doesn’t run with ads, there’s no pressure to partner with a company like Nielsen, the foremost ratings agency, to show advertisers how well a show or movie is performing. Releasing numbers to the public would just put more focus on each individual performance, which the company doesn’t want to do at this time.</p>
      <aside>Since Disney+ doesn’t run with ads, there’s no pressure to partner with a company like Nielsen</aside>
      <p>Streaming companies like Netflix have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/media/netflix-viewership-numbers/index.html">faced backlash from reporters and the public for years for not being more transparent</a> about viewership. This includes data like how many accounts finished a TV show or a movie, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924954/netflix-viewers-numbers-metrics-data-stranger-things-tuca-bertie-oa-renew-cancel">versus how many simply started a title</a>. Netflix has become slightly more forthcoming in recent months, sharing more information on social media and in earnings reports about its metrics.</p>
      <p>Transparency is central to conversations about whether Netflix executives decide to renew a season. Netflix teams <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20860801/netflix-canceled-shows-tuca-bertie-the-oa-streaming-wars-disney-apple-warnermedia-amazon">use an “efficiency metric” to internally determine</a> whether a show is worth renewing. The ratio breaks down whether a show is likely to retain customers at risk of canceling their subscriptions, or bring in new subscribers. <i>Stranger Things</i>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/stranger-things">Netflix’s most popular show to date</a>, is likely to do both, while a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14548698/netflix-renewed-the-oa-second-season">cult-beloved show like <i>The OA </i>isn’t</a>. Nielsen ratings are considered public interest because they help reiterate that a show is successful (<i>The Walking Dead, The Big Bang Theory, Grey’s Anatomy</i>), or that it isn’t (<i>Firefly, Undeclared</i>).</p>
      <p>Numbers don’t translate to quality, but the data helps people visualize what a “successful” show looks like. Ratings might seem like something the general public doesn’t care about, but conversations do arise when beloved shows get canceled. <i>Tuca and Bertie </i>is a perfect example. The animated series from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20936440/bojack-horseman-season-6-netflix-final"><i>BoJack Horseman</i></a><i> </i>artist Lisa Hanawalt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/25/netflix-cancels-tuca-and-bertie/">only ran one season before it was canceled</a> — a move that <a href="https://screenrant.com/tuca-bertie-netflix-algorithm-recommend-creator/">Hanawalt blamed on Netflix’s algorithm</a>. The algorithm, which could affect how many people stream a show, plays into the efficiency metric and whether a show gets canceled or renewed. It all bleeds down into what’s available for subscribers to watch.</p>
      <aside>Transparency is central to conversations about whether Netflix executives decide to renew a season</aside>
      <p>It also makes dealing with cancellations easier. If Disney starts to can shows, releasing those metrics could become a more prominent conversation. Disney has already renewed a few of its shows, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17934746/star-wars-jon-favreau-live-action-disney-show-the-mandalorian">live-action Star Wars program <i>The Mandalorian</i></a><i>.</i> It’s set for a second season that’s currently in development.</p>
      <p>Investors probably want to know how many people are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/budget-of-disney-plus-star-wars-series-the-mandalorian-2019-10">watching Disney’s $15-million-an-episode show</a>, and executives might share those numbers. For now, the public and reporters will be kept in the dark.</p>
