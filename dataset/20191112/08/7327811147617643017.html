We follow the travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic."<br/>"Mandalorian" stars Pedro Pascal as the title character, a lone gunfighter who has been compared to a Western or samurai hero. It co-stars Gina Carano as a character named Cara Dune and Carl Weathers as a bounty hunter named Greef. Werner Herzog and Giancarlo Esposito also co-star. Emily Swallow, Omid Abtahi and Nick Nolte will also appear in the series.</p>
