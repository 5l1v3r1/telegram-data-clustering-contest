      <h1>51 children injured in chemical attack at China kindergarten</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:18:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BEIJING: </b>More than 50 people, mostly children, were injured by a man who broke into a kindergarten in southwest China and sprayed them with corrosive liquid, local authorities said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The suspect, a 23-year-old surnamed Kong, entered the kindergarten by climbing a wall before spraying victims with sodium hydroxide, said local authorities in Kaiyuan city, Yunnan province.</p>
      <p>The attack took place on Monday at 3:35 pm (0735 GMT), authorities said on their Twitter-like Weibo account.</p>
      <p>Some 51 children and three teachers were admitted to hospital for treatment, two with “severe symptoms”.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Kong less than an hour after the attack.</p>
      <p>“Because his parents divorced during his childhood, the lack of family warmth resulted in psychological distortion,” said local authorities, adding that Zhang’s work and life were unsatisfactory as well.</p>

      <p>All this created a “pessimistic mentality and thoughts about retaliating against society”, they said.</p>
      <p>Violent attacks targeting schoolchildren are not uncommon in China, which has seen a slew of deadly incidents over the past few years – usually involving knives.</p>
      <p>In April last year, a 28-year-old man killed nine middle-school students as they were returning home in one of the country’s deadliest knife attacks in recent years.</p>
      <p>The killer, who said he had been bullied when he attended the school in northern China’s Shaanxi province, was executed in September last year.</p>
      <p>Later in 2018, a knife-wielding woman injured 14 children at a kindergarten in Sichuan province.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old assailant slashed students while they were returning to the classroom after morning exercises.</p>
