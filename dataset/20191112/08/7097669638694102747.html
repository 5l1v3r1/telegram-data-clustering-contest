      <h1>Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers skewer Bloomberg's illusion that Democrats want another billionaire candidate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T08:56:54+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>"Right now, the Democratic Party has an option for everyone," Trevor Noah said on Monday's <i>Daily Show</i>. "There's moderates, there's progressives, there's X-Men, and there's even a guy who's worth $1.6 billion. But what if $1.6 billion just isn't rich enough for some voters? Well then, those people might be in luck." That's because billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg "is <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877208/michael-bloomberg-reportedly-planning-enter-democratic-presidential-primary">on the verge of jumping into the Democratic primary</a>, because he doesn't think any of the current candidates can beat Trump," he said. "And you have to admit, that's such a billionaire thing to do."</p>
      <p>"Bloomberg may be making a fashionably late entrance into the presidential race, and his fellow Democrats aren't exactly giving him <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877611/michael-bloomberg-garners-highest-democratic-unfavorable-rating-new-poll">a warm welcome</a>," Noah said, with a special laugh for <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/877599/bernie-sanders-michael-bloomberg-aint-going-buy-election">Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) reaction</a>. So why is Bloomberg running? Reportedly, "Jeff Bezos told Bloomberg to run," he said. "You know you're rich when the Amazon guy orders something from you! That's money."</p>

      <p>"Wow, he just ordered up a presidential candidate â€” what level of Amazon Prime is that?" Seth Meyers echoed at <i>Late Night</i>. "Bloomberg's interest in running and Bezos' prodding come after weeks of billionaires freakouts over the possibility that someone who's critical of big banks and Wall Street like [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren or Bernie could get the Democratic nomination. In fact, last week even Bill Gates expressed concern about how much he personally would have to pay in taxes and joked that he might not have that much left over." Warren trolled Bloomberg and Gates with their own internet calculators for billionaires.</p>
      <p>"In reality, the vast majority of Democratic primary voters say in polls that they're actually satisfied with the choices they already have," Meyers said. "People aren't just mad at billionaires out of jealousy or because candidates demonize them. There are real-world examples that are informing people's doubts that the wealthy can solve everything," or anything. Watch below.</p>
