      <p>Microsoft has a released an optional Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 update that let's customers who have signed up for extended security update test if their devices are ready.</p>
      <p>With the end of support looming for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Microsoft allows business customers <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-offer-windows-7-extended-security-updates-to-smbs/">to pay for</a>, and in <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-7-voting-systems-to-get-free-security-updates-through-2020-elections/">some cases get for free</a>, continued security updates after the operating system stops being supported.</p>
      <p>This Extended Security Updates (ESU) program goes into effect on January 14, 2020 and to make sure that customers devices are properly configured, Microsoft has released the optional <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=4528069">KB4528069</a> test update.</p>
      <p>If a user has properly signed up for and <a href="http://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-IT-Pro-Blog/How-to-get-Extended-Security-Updates-for-eligible-Windows/ba-p/917807">activated their extended security updates license</a>, this update will install successfully.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if there an issue installing the update, then the customer needs to make sure that they have all the ESU prerequisites completed before trying again.</p>
      <p>According to Microsoft the required actions that must be taken before extended security updates are ready to be installed, including this test update, are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Install the following SHA-2 code signing support update and servicing stack update (SSU) or a later SSU update: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4474419">4474419</a> SHA-2 code signing support update for Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008: September 23, 2019 4490628 Servicing stack update for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1: March 12, 2019</li>
        <li>Install the following servicing stack update (SSU) and monthly rollup: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4516655">4516655</a> Servicing stack update for Windows 7 SP1 and Server 2008 R2 SP1: September 10, 2019 <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4519976">4519976</a> October 8, 2019—KB4519976 (Monthly Rollup)</li>
