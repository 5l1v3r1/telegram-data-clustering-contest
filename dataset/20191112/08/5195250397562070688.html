      <h3>Maruti Suzuki Swift and Dzire along with recently launched models have helped in posting YoY sales growth in October 2019</h3>
      <p>Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) did use the Diwali season to full effect by offering huge discounts across the domestic portfolio in October 2019. It resulted in the largest carmaker in the country ensuring positive sales growth for the first time in a long while.</p>
      <p>With a total of 1,39,121 units last month, Maruti Suzuki managed to post 2.3% Year-on-Year sales growth while garnering 49% market share – up by 0.6%. Five models played an integral role in an appreciable showing in October 2019 as Wagon R, Eeco, Ertiga, Swift and its sedan sibling Dzire posted YoY growth.</p>
      <p>They were supported by the recently launched models such as the S-Presso that registered just over 10,600 units in its first full month in the market and the XL6, the more premium take on the Ertiga sold through Nexa dealerships, with just over 4,300 units.</p>
