      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:37:03+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/steven-messner/" target="_blank">Steven Messner</a></address>
      <p>Teamfight Tactics <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/teamfight-tactics-patch-922-notes">patch 9.22</a> is the first update of what Riot calls "set 2" and officially marks the end of TFT's beta period. Ranked play is sitting on the bench during this update. The ladder will return for you to climb in patch 9.23 after Riot determines that the first update of Set 2 doesn't introduce any catastrophic bugs or balance issues. You can read on <a href="https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2019/10/dev-tft-set-1-learnings/">Riot's blog</a> a more in-depth look at what it learned from the TFT beta set and its goals for set 2.</p>

      <p><b>If you don't want to look at the full notes</b>, (but you really should this time) what you need to know is that champion origins have been swapped out for elements and classes that function similarly providing bonuses for multiple champions in play. It's time to re-think all of your strategies.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at what's changed in this patch.</p>
      <h3>Rise of Elements: The Elements</h3>
      <p>This season champions represent elements rather than origins, but the rules are the same. Deploy multiple unique champions with the same element to unlock powerful trait bonuses! Copies of the same champion all benefit from their elemental bonus, but only the first counts for determining how many unique champions you have deployed, even if your copies are different star levels.</p>
      <p><b>Steel</b><br/>(Rek’Sai, Nocturne)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Steel champions causes them to briefly become immune to damage when they drop below 50% health.</p>
      <p><b>Mountain<br/></b>(Taliyah, Qiyana, Malphite)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Mountain champions grants a massive shield to a random ally at the start of combat.</p>
      <p><b>Ocean<br/></b>(Vladimir, Thresh, Syndra, Qiyana, Nautilus, Nami)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Ocean champions periodically grants allies mana. The amount increases with more Ocean champions.</p>
      <p><b>Poison<br/></b>(Kog’Maw, Dr. Mundo, Twitch, Singed)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Poison champions causes their damaging attacks and abilities to increase the mana costs of their targets’ abilities.</p>
      <p><b>Shadow<br/></b>(Malzahar, Kindred, Veigar, Sion, Master Yi)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Shadow champions causes them to deal increased damage for the first few seconds of combat, as well as for a few seconds when they score a takedown. Deploying more Shadow champions causes all of them to deal increased damage when any of them score a takedown.</p>
      <p><b>Wind<br/></b>(Yasuo, Qiyana, Janna)</p>
      <p>Deploying both Wind champions grants your team dodge chance.</p>
      <p><b>Woodland<br/></b>(Maokai, Ivern, Neeko, LeBlanc)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Woodland champions causes one of them to randomly create a clone of themselves (including items) at the start of combat.</p>
      <h3>Rise of Elements: The Classes</h3>
      <p>A champion’s class describes how they fight and functions similarly to their element, conferring additional trait bonuses based on how many unique members of that class you have on your team.</p>
      <p><b>Alchemist<br/></b>(Singed)</p>
      <p>Alchemists can move through other units and never stop moving.</p>
      <p><b>Assassin<br/></b>(Diana, LeBlanc, Qiyana, Nocturne, Kha’Zix, Zed)</p>
      <p>Assassins sneak across the battlefield at the start of combat, placing themselves opposite from where they started.</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Assassins grants them critical strike chance and increased critical strike damage, increasing with more Assassins.</p>
      <p><b>Avatar<br/></b>(Lux)</p>
      <p>An Avatar’s element is counted twice for trait bonuses.</p>
      <p><b>Berserker<br/></b>(Renekton, Jax, Volibear, Dr. Mundo, Sion, Olaf)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Berserkers grants their attacks a chance to deal damage in a cone behind the target. The chance increases with more Berserkers.</p>
      <p><b>Blademaster<br/></b>(Yasuo, Sivir, Aatrox, Master Yi)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Blademasters grants their attacks a chance to hit extra times, increasing with more Blademasters.</p>
      <p><b>Summoner<br/></b>(Zyra, Malzahar, Azir, Annie, Yorick, Zed)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Summoners increases the health and duration of their spawned allies, increasing with more Summoners.</p>
      <p>Summoners’ pets benefit from Element and Class bonuses, but don’t count as additional units toward activating higher levels of those bonuses.</p>
      <p><b>Druid<br/></b>(Ivern, Maokai, Neeko)</p>
      <p>Deploying two Druids grants all Druids health regeneration.</p>
      <p><b>Mage<br/></b>(Vladimir, Taliyah, Syndra, LeBlanc, Veigar, Brand)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Mages grants them a chance after casting an ability to cast it again. This chance increases with more mages.</p>
      <p><b>Mystic<br/></b>(Soraka, Janna, Master Yi, Nami)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Mystics grants all allies magic resist, increasing with more Mystics.</p>
      <p><b>Predator<br/></b>(Warwick, Kog’Maw, Skarner, Rek’Sai)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Predators causes their attacks and abilities to immediately kill low-health enemies.</p>
      <p><b>Ranger<br/></b>(Vayne, Varus, Ezreal, Kindred, Ashe, Twitch)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Rangers periodically grants them a chance to gain a burst of attack speed, increasing with more Rangers.</p>
      <p><b>Warden<br/></b>(Ornn, Nasus, Thresh, Braum, Nautilus, Malphite, Taric)</p>
      <p>Deploying multiple Wardens grants them armor, increasing with more Wardens.</p>

      <h3>Items</h3>
      <p>Items increase your champions’ base stats and can upgrade into stronger items that provide unique effects. In PvE rounds, each monster you defeat has a chance of dropping an item. In Draft rounds, every draftable champion comes with an item equipped. You’ll always see basic items early on, but as the game progresses, you’ll have a shot at upgraded items.</p>
      <p>There are nine basic items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>BF Sword: </b>Attacks deal more damage</li>
        <li><b>Recurve Bow: </b>Attack more often</li>
        <li><b>Needlessly Large Rod: </b>Abilities are stronger</li>
        <li><b>Tear of the Goddess:</b> Begin combat with some mana</li>
        <li><b>Giant’s Belt:</b> Gain health</li>
        <li><b>Chain Vest: </b>Take less damage from basic attacks</li>
        <li><b>Negatron Cloak: </b>Take less damage from abilities</li>
        <li><b>Sparring Gloves: </b>Gain dodge chance and critical strike chance</li>
        <li><b>Spatula: </b>Provides no stats, but upgrades into various rule-breaking items!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Equip items by dragging and dropping them onto your champions (be careful, this can’t be undone). If you equip a champion with two basic items, those items automatically combine into an upgraded item, sharing the same combination of stats as its components. Every pair of basic items creates a different upgraded item!</p>
      <p>Upgraded items can buff your attacks and abilities, grant unique effects, and even change the properties of your champions! New classes and origins means new spatula items, here’s what’s new:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spatula + BF Sword:</b> Assassin</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Recurve Bow:</b> Blademaster</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Needlessly Large Rod:</b> Inferno</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Tear of the Goddess:</b> Mage</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Giant’s Belt:</b> Glacial</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Chain Vest:</b> Warden</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Negatron Cloak:</b> Light</li>
        <li><b>Spatula + Sparring Gloves:</b> Berserker</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Element of the game</h3>
      <p>Each Rise of the Elements game will randomly feature one element: Inferno, Ocean, Mountain, or Wind. The element of the game can be tracked in the center of the carousel, and has a few effects. </p>
      <p>Elemental Hexes grant the following effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Inferno:</b> Gain attack speed for the duration of combat</li>
        <li><b>Ocean:</b> Start combat with additional mana</li>
        <li><b>Mountain:</b> Gain <b>permanent </b>health that stacks between rounds and remains even if the champion is moved off the Elemental Hex</li>
        <li><b>Wind: </b>Gain dodge chance for the duration of combat</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>General Game Changes</h3>
      <p><b>Board size:</b> 3 rows of 7 hexes ⇒ 4 rows of 7 hexes.</p>
      <p><b>Player Damage:</b> 3/3/3/4/5/6 ⇒ 2/3/4/5/6/7</p>
