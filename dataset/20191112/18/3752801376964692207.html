      <p>A man posing as a passenger fired three shots at a bus driver in Redcliffe, KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday, killing him instantly.</p>
      <p>Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the 31-year-old driver had been driving on Buffelsdraai Road when an unknown man shot him.</p>
      <p>The gunman fled in a getaway car.</p>
      <p>Gwala said the motive for the shooting had not yet been established.</p>
      <p>Reaction Unit South Africa spokesperson Prem Balram said the private security company responded to the scene just after 07:00 where its officers found the man slumped in the driver's seat with three gunshot wounds to his head.</p>
      <p>According to witnesses on the bus, a passenger entered the vehicle, drew a handgun and shot the driver in the head, Balram said.</p>
      <p>"The suspect had been picked up as a passenger a short distance from the scene.</p>
      <p>"Witnesses informed reaction officers that the bus was in motion when the driver was attacked. The vehicle then rolled back for a short distance before coming to a standstill in the centre of the road."</p>
      <p>Unconfirmed reports from a witness indicated the man had fled on foot and was picked up by a white VW Polo, Balram said.</p>
      <p>Three spent 9mm cartridges were found inside the bus.</p>
      <p>Attempts to reach the bus company were unsuccessful.</p>
