      <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner today did what one does on Twitter, whether you're a billionaire, a president, a billionaire president — or just one of the peasants. He trolled. And it was a decent troll, at that, taking aim at the quality of content on Apple TV+ thus far on the same day that Disney+ launched..</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1194307230994227205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>"Have seen all the original shows on @AppleTV's new streaming service," Eisner tweeted. "One of them is great, two good, and one forget; and I'm not saying which. Good start for #Apple"</p>
      <p>And he's not wrong. That's about how I'd rate things as well. At first blush his tweet could well be taken as a trolling attempt. Apple's definitely had a mixed bag of content — some good, some not so good. And adding insult to injury was the news that the head of scripted content for Apple TV+ <a href="https://www.cordcutters.com/apple-tv-head-current-scripted-programming-leaves-role-amidst-executive-reshuffle">has been "realigned."</a> (His job, anyway. Presuably he's still in fine shape.)</p>
      <p>But is he trolling Apple? Or praising Apple? Three out of four shows are more-than watchable. That's a great batting average, to say nothing about success in the land of television, which is anything but a foregone conclusion.</p>
      <p>There's just one other additional problem: Apple TV+ launched just fine on Nov. 1. If you wanted to watch any of the four original series Apple had ready to go — <i>The Morning Show</i>, <i>See</i>, <i>Dickinson</i> and <i>For All Mankind</i> — you could.</p>
      <p>Disney+, on the other hand, has something like a million shows and movies and series, some new originals, and many old favorites. But it also has <a href="https://www.cordcutters.com/disney-appears-be-down-some-users">had some serious issues</a> when it comes not just to sign-ups, but also being able to stream shows if you'd preordered before launch day.</p>
      <p>That's no good, especially when you consider that Disney has spent the months since it announced Disney+ crowing about the technology behind the service. It purchased Bamtech, which also has sucessfully powered ESPN+ through a number of large live sporting events, and it now is the exclusive home to UFC PPV events.</p>

      <p>So maybe we just take Eisner's tweet for what it was: A reminder that good content is hard to create. But so, too, is the ability to push it out digitially to even just a few countries at one time in 2019.</p>
