      <p>Disney’s live-action remake of its beloved animated hit “Lady and the Tramp” debuted on Tuesday via Disney+ as the long-awaited streaming service finally launched.</p>
      <p>Along with the new movie comes a whole new soundtrack, with modern artists recording the songs from the 1955 classic.</p>
      <p>Among these is the film’s signature song “He’s a Tramp”, which has been rerecorded by Janelle Monae, putting her own spin on the track originally recorded by Peggy Lee.</p>
