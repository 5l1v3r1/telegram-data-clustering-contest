      <h1>Ryan Porteous answers Scotland call as Hibs defender the latest addition to Steve Clarke's squad</h1>
      <h2>The stopper has joined Lewis Morgan and Graeme Shinnie to replace the four players who pulled out through injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:26:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Porteous has earned his first <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> call-up for the upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> defender will link up with Steve Clarke's squad alongside Lewis Morgan and Graeme Shinnie after four players pulled out through injury earlier today.</p>
      <p>Skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> , Ryan Fraser, Scott McTominay and Liam Cooper were forced to withdraw from the squad.</p>
      <p>Porteous has starred for Scot Gemmill's U-21s and has impressively came through the ranks at Easter Road.</p>

      <p>Liverpool left-back Robertson was the biggest name among the call-offs and will be a huge miss for Clarke's men, especially with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> 's absence.</p>
      <p>Robertson aggravated an ankle injury in his side's win over Man City but was adamant to join up with his Scotland team-mates despite not being to feature in the double header.</p>
      <p>Robbo was pictured at training at The Oriam as he spends a few days at Scotland's HQ before the team fly out to Nicosia.</p>
