      <h1>Sage Northcutt reacts to Dana White saying he should retire: ‘I don’t understand the exact logic’</h1>

      <p>UFC president Dana White was a big supporter of Sage Northcutt and the latter does not get why that has changed.</p>
      <p>White has publicly recommended Northcutt retire. Northcutt was surprised by White’s lack of faith in a new interview with <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/10/20953339/sage-northcutt-responds-dana-white-needs-retire-not-the-sport-for-him-remarks-ufc-one"><i>MMA Fighting</i></a>.</p>

      <p>“For him to say something like that, after that injury, I don’t understand the exact logic of why he would say something like that,” Northcutt said. “Before, he was wishing me to do great in everything I happened to do in the future, and (to) say something like that is totally different.”</p>
      <p>Northcutt, 23, lost his ONE Championship debut via first-round knockout in 29-seconds at the hands of Cosmo Alexandre. “Super” Sage subsequently underwent a nine-hour surgery to fix <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/5/18/18631097/photos-sage-northcutt-suffered-eight-fractures-in-29-second-ko-loss-shows-terminator-face-mma">eight fractures</a> in his face and was unable to train for six months.</p>

      <p>“I would really like to see Sage Northcutt retire,” White later told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/6/8/18657554/dana-white-believes-sage-northcutt-needs-to-retire"><i>TSN</i></a><i>.</i> “I hope he does. Good looking, charismatic kid, smart. He was (going to) college to be an engineer. He’s got a lot going on in his life. This isn’t the sport for him... I don’t want to sound like I’m shitting all over the guy, because I really like the kid a lot. But this isn’t the sport for him. I would love to see him retire before he seriously gets hurt.”</p>
      <p>Northcutt was coming off of three consecutive UFC wins prior to his loss to Alexandre.</p>
