      <p><a href="http://gizchina.com/category/phones/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> is well-known for accessories apart from their smartphones. One of their most popular products is the wireless mouse which was introduced back in 2017 for a mere 69 Yuan(~$10). And now, after two years, the company has finally <a href="https://item.mi.com/product/11255.html?cfrom=search&amp;selected=1194500061&amp;pClass=c">released</a> its successor, the Xiaomi Wireless Mouse 2 at a price tag of 59 Yuan(~$8), 10 Yuan cheaper than its predecessor.</p>
      <p>Like any other Xioami product, the Wireless Mouse 2 features a minimalistic design, literally resembling a mouse. It comes in black and white color paint jobs and both of them look cute as well as cool. The new mouse from Xiaomi comes equipped with a 1000 dpi photoelectric sensor for accurate positioning while moving it across the surface. The body of the mouse is sandblasted and anodised with subtle texture for better grip, plus the roller is also made of aluminium alloy.</p>
