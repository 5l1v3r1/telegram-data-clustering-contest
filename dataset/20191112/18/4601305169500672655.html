      <h1>New 5G vulnerabilities could put phone users at risk</h1>

      <p>Security researchers at Purdue and U. of Iowa confirm what many security experts have long feared: there are serious security weaknesses in 5G that undermine the promised security and privacy protections.</p>
      <p>About a dozen vulnerabilities have been identified by the researchers, who report that the bugs can allow a bad guy to track your actual real-time location, send large numbers of people fake emergency alerts to trigger public panic or disconnect a 5G-connected phone from the network altogether.</p>
      <p>5G was promised to be a more secure standard than 4G, able even to keep your data and voice safe from “stingrays” that present themselves as cell towers and spy on you.</p>
      <p>But, nope. Also researchers say some of the attacks they've newly identified can also be exploited on existing 4G networks.</p>
      <p>Worst of all, it's pretty cheap and easy to pull off the new exploits.</p>
      <p>“All of the new attacks can be exploited by anyone with practical knowledge of 4G and 5G networks and a low-cost software-defined radio,” reports Zack Whittaker [@zackwhittaker] of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/12/5g-flaws-locations-spoof-alerts/">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The researchers expanded on their previous findings to build a new tool, dubbed 5GReasoner, which was used to find 11 new 5G vulnerabilities. By creating a malicious radio base station, an attacker can carry out several attacks against a target’s connected phone used for both surveillance and disruption.<br/><br/>In one attack, the researchers said they were able to obtain both old and new temporary network identifiers of a victim’s phone, allowing them to discover the paging occasion, which can be used to track the phone’s location — or even hijack the paging channel to broadcast fake emergency alerts. This could lead to “artificial chaos,” the researcher said, similar to when a mistakenly sent emergency alert claimed Hawaii was about to be hit by a ballistic missile amid heightened nuclear tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. (A similar vulnerability was found in the 4G protocol by University of Colorado Boulder researchers in June.)<br/><br/>Another attack could be used to create a “prolonged” denial-of-service condition against a target’s phone from the cellular network. In some cases, the flaws could be used to downgrade a cellular connection to a less-secure standard, which makes it possible for law enforcement — and capable hackers — to launch surveillance attacks against their targets using specialist “stingray” equipment.</blockquote>
