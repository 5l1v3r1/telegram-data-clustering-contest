      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Disney+ just released today.</li>
        <li>Fans have found a new edit in Star Wars: A New Hope, slightly altering the famous Han Solo and Greedo scene.</li>
        <li>This edit was apparently made by George Lucas himself.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you've already finished the first episode of The Mandalorian on Disney+ and have gone back to watch some classic Star Wars, you may have noticed a small change in A New Hope. Star Wars alterations are nothing new, but they are intensely debated and scorned by many. This one in particular is... weird.</p>
      <p>In the famous scene where Greedo confronts Han Solo in the cantina on Tatooine, he appears to shout out a word before his untimely demise. What sounds like "maclunkey," or however we're deciding to spell it, has taken the internet by storm, and we don't even know what it means.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/greedo-han-solo-star-wars-edit">Vanity Fair</a>, Lucasfilm confirmed that this was a change that George Lucas made prior to selling the franchise to Disney in 2012. Why it's just seeing the light of day now and why Disney decided to recut the movie ever so slightly for its debut on the company's streaming platform is unknown.</p>
      <p>As you can imagine, people are already making memes out of it.</p>

      <p>This definitely isn't the first change to A New Hope, and it may not even be the last. But at least for now it can be one of the funniest thanks to the internet, even if most of us hate it.</p>
