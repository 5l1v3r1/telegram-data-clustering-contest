      <p>The soccer coach of a 13-year-old boy who was hit with a brick on Guy Fawkes Day, shared his relief on Tuesday at him coming out of a coma and saying a few words.</p>
      <p>The boy, whose name is known to News24, had been playing in a street in Heinz Park, Cape Town a week ago when a man came out of a yard and threw a brick at him, hitting him in the head, his mother said at the time.</p>
      <p>While the boy's mom did not have a chance to speak on Tuesday, Heinz Park Football Club coach Quinton Abrahams shared his delight at seeing his talented player responsive during a recent visit.</p>
      <p>Club members have visited the hospital almost every day, sitting around his bed to keep him company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'A really joyful moment'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The boy was apparently very emotional when he saw all his friends and had to be calmed down after crying.</p>
      <p>Abrahams said the boy told him his name and that he played soccer for the club.</p>
      <p>"It was really a joyful moment... to hear him speak for the first time," he said.</p>
      <p>"He's a real fighter. He was still very confused and drowsy, but he reacted to what was asked and said."</p>
      <p>The boy had been on life support and in a coma last week.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy, because I have to work and put bread on the table. Through God, I will survive," his mother told News24 previously.</p>
