      <h2>Disney Plus is out now, along with exclusive new Star Wars show The Mandalorian - but not in the UK. Here's what you need to know about the Disney streaming service including how much it costs and when it comes to the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:12:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:12</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston and Hannah Cowton</a></address>
      <p>Disney is the latest company to wade into the film and TV streaming game with Disney+ - or Disney Plus if you prefer - a new streaming service that will let you watch all of the Mouse House's best and brightest in one place.</p>
      <p>It's out now in some countries, and with movies ranging from cartoon classics and Pixar's finest through to Star Wars and Marvel - not to mention a bevy of exclusive new TV shows - Disney+ looks set to seriously shake up streaming. Here's what you need to know.</p>
      <h3>When does Disney+ launch in the UK?</h3>
      <p>Disney Plus is out now in the US, Canada and the Netherlands<b>,</b> with Australia and New Zealand launching on 19 November, and other major markets to follow within the first two years. </p>
      <p>The UK gets the Disney streaming service from <b>31 March 2020</b>. Germany, France, Italy, Spain will also gain access on this date as well - though if you think that's bad, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3695971-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-3695971%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Fdisney-amazon-prime-video-latin-america-1203355032%2F">Variety</a> confirmed that Latin America won't get the service until Q1 2021.</p>
      <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
      <p>We don't yet know UK pricing, but we do have pricing for some other markets to go off.</p>
      <p>The pricing undercuts major rival <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/free-netflix-3668431/">Netflix</a> - which makes sense, given that Disney+ offers a more specific, focussed selection of content. With that in mind it costs <b>USD$6.99 per month </b>(around £5.50) in the US, with the option of saving a little by paying <b>$69.99 per year</b> - which works out at $5.83 each month. This gives access to 4K content and up to four simultaneous streams for each account, which is a blow to Netflix as they only offer the same package on their most expensive subscription, priced at $15.99 per month.</p>
      <p>There's an even better deal if you don't mind spending a little more. Disney also bundles in <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-hulu-outside-us-3672619/">Hulu</a> with ads and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-espn-in-uk-3701046/">ESPN+</a> into one single package for just <b>$12.99 per month</b>. Since Disney+ is normally $6.99, ESPN+ is $4.99, and Hulu is $5.99 on its ad-supported plan, that's a minimum saving of $5 each month. Don't expect this bundle in every market though, as Hulu and ESPN aren't widely available outside the US.</p>
      <p>With Netflix's standard plan now $10.99 per month, and its cheapest still $8.99, Disney's pricing seriously undercuts the streaming giant - which should help it both lure Netflix subscribers into switching, and tempt others into picking up the Disney service on top of their existing streaming subscriptions.</p>
      <p>For the other four markets that have been announced, Disney+ will costs CAD$8.99 per month, and $89.99 for the year. In the Netherlands, the price is €6.99 per month, and €69.99 per year. For Australia, it costs AUD$8.99 per month, and $89.99 per year. Finally, in New Zealand the monthly cost is NZD$9.99 per month and $99.99 per year. </p>
      <p>As of yet, pricing for the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain haven't yet been announced, but we'll update this article as soon as they're confirmed - and it's a fair bet that the rest of Europe will be priced the same as the Netherlands at least.</p>
      <p>If you're looking to save some money, then we've also rounded up the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/disney-plus-discount-3701386/">best Disney Plus discounts</a> so far, so that you can make the most of the Disney streaming service for less.</p>
      <p>Here's <a href="http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/disney-vs-netflix-3777747/">how the service compares to Netflix</a>.</p>
      <h3>How to watch Disney+ from the UK </h3>
      <p>It is of course a shame to be four months behind the States, especially with <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/star-wars-the-mandalorian-3684366/">The Mandalorian</a> available now across the pond. Fortunately, UK fans can still use a VPN to watch the Disney streaming service - but it's difficult.</p>
      <p>VPNs allow you to browse the internet anonymously, blocking your IP address. This means that you can appear as if you're browsing from another country, allowing you to bypass any geo-blocking. We personally recommend trying out <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=350&amp;aff_id=980&amp;url_id=2154&amp;aff_sub=06-3695971-11-0000000">NordVPN</a> first, but you can also try out <a href="https://www.linkev.com/idg?offer=3monthsfree&amp;a_fid=idgcomms&amp;data1=06-3695971-11-0000000">ExpressVPN</a> as another option. </p>
      <p>In theory you should be able to simply choose a VPN server from the USA or another country with Disney+, open the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3695971-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-3695971%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fsign-up">sign up page</a> and get cracking, but there's one complication: you need a payment card for the appropriate country to create an account in the first place.</p>
      <p>Luckily we've found a workaround, and in our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-disney-plus-uk-3777628/">guide to watching Disney+ from the UK</a> we run through how you can sign up to the streaming service in the UK using the same method we have to watch The Mandalorian and the other new shows.</p>
      <p>If all you want from Disney+ is the classic Disney content, then the UK is one of the few markets that already has another Disney streaming service: <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/internet/what-is-disneylife-3628961/">DisneyLife</a>, which costs just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3695971-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-3695971%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneylife.com%2Fuk">£4.99 per month</a>. However, it doesn't feature the latest Star Wars and Marvel movies, or the new Disney+ exclusives. We're expecting the company to fold DisneyLife into the new global Disney+ brand eventually, but we're not sure when that might happen. </p>
      <h3>Which devices does Disney+ work on? </h3>
      <p>Whatever you're looking to watch Disney Plus on - be it through a computer, smartphone, or tablet - you should be able to make it work. </p>
      <p>You're able to watch Disney+ on Roku, Chromecasts, Fire TV, laptops, smart TVs, iPads, Android, iPhone and game consoles - even including the Nintendo Switch, though this one won't be available until after launch. </p>
      <p>Up to four users are able to watch simultaneously, and on some versions of the app you're able to download content to watch offline.</p>
      <h3>What classic movies and shows are on Disney+?</h3>
      <p>Loads. Loads and loads and loads and loads.</p>
      <p>First up, the service launched with "around 500 films from the Disney library," as well as "around 7,000 episodes of Disney TV." Those include the 13-film 'Signature Collection' of cartoons including Bambi, The Lion King, and The Jungle Book, along with 18 Pixar films.</p>
      <p>Every Star Wars movie so far will appear (though The Last Jedi and Solo won't be available until after launch), along with films from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with both <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/captain-marvel-3683263/">Captain Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/avengers-endgame-3677831/">Avengers: Endgame</a> making their streaming service debuts exclusively on the platform. There won't be any of the Spider-Man movies though, even the Tom Holland ones - Sony has those rights - and there's no Deadpool either, for reasons outlined below.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Disney's merger with Fox there is also a variety of Fox movies and shows - including the exclusive streaming rights to the entirety of The Simpsons.</p>
      <p>One thing you shouldn't expect to see: anything R-rated. While Disney's never made much itself, its subsidiaries have, as has Fox. None of that will make its way onto Disney+ though, so you won't see Alien rubbing shoulders with Bambi any time soon. Instead expect those films to appear on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/entertainment/watch-hulu-outside-us-3672619/">Hulu</a>, which Disney has a financial stake in.</p>
      <p>Just over a month before the launch, Disney Plus tweeted a monster thread that detailed the biggest classic titles that are available on the streaming platform, including Bambi, Treasure Island, Big Hero 6 and more. Read the full list over on the <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1183715553057239040">Disney Plus Twitter page</a>. </p>
      <h3>What are the new exclusives?</h3>
      <p>Arguably more exciting than all those old movies and shows are all the new things being made just for Disney+, including new shows set in the main <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/marvel-phase-4-3701501/">Marvel</a> and Star Wars Universes. Here's some of the biggest new titles confirmed for the streaming platform so far:</p>

It will follow the duo's adventures post <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/entertainment/avengers-endgame-post-credits-3695678/">Avengers: Endgame</a>, and also feature Emily VanCamp and Wyatt Russell, who will portray Sharon Carter and John Walker respectively. </li>
        <li><b>Loki, Spring 2021 </b>- Another series following the events of Endgame, Loki will explore the life of the god of mischief/brother of Thor. Karen Herron will be directing, and Michael Waldron will serve as the head writer. </li>

        <li><b>Hawkeye, Fall 2021 </b>- Jeremy Renner will be coming back in his original Avenger role, and he will be joined by the Marvel Comics character Kate Bishop, who will likely become his successor. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3695971-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-3695971%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fhawkeye-series-hailee-steinfeld-disney-plus-1203318859%2F">Variety has reported</a> that Hailee Steinfeld is in line for the role. </li>

        <li><b>She-Hulk, Date TBC </b>- Attorney Jennifer Walters (and cousin of Bruce Banner) will look to balance her own gamma radiation powers with her legal career. </li>
        <li><b>Moon Knight, Date TBC </b>- The final MCU show in the lineup will follow Marc Spector, yet another billionaire superhero. But if the series follows the comics, we expect his story will be slightly darker than the likes of Tony Stark. </li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Forky Asks a Question </b>- The bizarre cutlery implement from Toy Story 4 will explore life's greatest questions in a short animated series. Voice actor Tony Hale will be reprising his role as the title character. </li>

      <ul>
        <li><b>The Lady and the Tramp</b> - The latest Disney live action remake, this time recreating the two dogs united by their love of spaghetti and meatballs. At least, we think that's what it's about, it's been a while.</li>
        <li><b>The World According To Jeff Goldblum </b>- Think of 'An Idiot Abroad', but instead of Karl Pilkington travelling the world and sharing his thoughts and opinions, its Jeff Goldblum. Yep, we're sold too.  </li>
        <li><b>Encore! </b>- Kristen Bell executive produces this show which brings together former cast mates of real high school musical shows to recreate their productions. </li>
        <li><b>The Imagineering Story</b> - If you're a big fan of the Disney theme parks, then this documentary series is a must, following the story and achievements of Walt Disney and the staff who brought the Disney brand to life for travellers around the world. </li>
        <li><b>Marvel's Hero Project</b> - Instead of comic book superheroes, this documentary shines a light on some of the real-life young heroes who are making a difference in their communities. </li>

        <li><b>Be Our Chef, 2020 </b>- You've heard of Bake Off and MasterChef, but this Disney cooking show has its own spin. Families from different cultures will compete against one another (in the setting of Disney World, naturally) in a series of themed challenges, Disney style. </li>
        <li><b>Earth to Ned, 2020</b> - This puppet talk show from the Jim Henson Company will see real celebrities interviewed by alien puppets in a twist on the talk show formula that's nothing if not novel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Disney will also be remaking a few classic 20th Century Fox franchises with the aim to launch them on the streaming service. Home Alone, Night at the Museum, Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Cheaper By the Dozen all in line for "reimaginations" for the platform <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3695971-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fentertainment%2Fdisney-plus-3695971%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fnewsbeat-49260934">according to Disney CEO Bog Iger</a>.</p>
