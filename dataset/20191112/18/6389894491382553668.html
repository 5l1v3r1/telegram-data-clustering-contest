      <h1>Newsquest outbids Reach in race for local publisher JPI Media</h1>

      <p>Regional publisher Newsquest is said to have tabled a surprise bid for i newspaper owner JPI Media, threatening to derail the takeover efforts of rival Reach. </p>
      <p>Newsquest, which owns a string of titles including the Oxford Mail and Brighton’s Argus, is now thought to be the frontrunner in the bidding war, the Guardian reported, citing three sources.</p>

      <p>Reach, which publishes the Daily Mirror, confirmed in July that it was in talks to buy assets from JPI, the company formed to buy Johnston Press out of administration last year.</p>
      <p>Reach has tabled a bid worth roughly £50m, but this offer has now been usurped by Newsquest, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Newsquest was among bidders for JPI’s stable of regional titles last year, although it did not put in an offer for the i newspaper. JPI rejected all offers and instead secured a rescue plan with a consortium of lenders.</p>
      <p>It comes three months after Newsquest’s parent company Gannett, which also owns USA Today, was acquired by New Media Investment Group in a $1.4bn (£1.1bn) takeover deal.</p>
      <p>While Newsquest was previously considered an unlikely candidate in the JPI bidding war, the takeover means it may now be in a position to expand.</p>
      <p>However, any deal could be hampered by competition concerns, and the Competition and Markets Authority is likely to open an investigation into a merger.</p>
      <p>Newsquest’s biggest concern may lie in Scotland, as it owns titles such as the National, the Herald and the Evening Times, while JPI’s portfolio includes the Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.</p>
      <p>One source told <i>City A.M. </i>that navigating competition concerns could a “tricky ask” for Newsquest. </p>
      <p>A potential solution could be a so-called hold separate agreement, under which independent management is employed to oversee the business on a temporary basis.</p>
      <p>A similar arrangement occurred after Reach’s takeover of the Daily Express last year. However, one publishing executive said this was like “buying a car and then having the keys taken away”.</p>
      <p>Daily Mail and General Trust, which owns the Daily Mail, is also circling JPI’s assets, and has reportedly tabled a £50m bid for the i newspaper.</p>

      <p>Fleet Street veteran David Montgomery, who has formed a new listed company designed to carry out a newspaper takeover spree and has expressed interest in the Telegraph titles, is also said to be circling JPI.</p>
      <p>JPI Media declined to comment. Newsquest could not be reached for comment.</p>
