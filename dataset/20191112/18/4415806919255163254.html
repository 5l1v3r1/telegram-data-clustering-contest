      <p>A couple’s unusual promise rings — made from a poodle and wolf tooth — have caused a social media storm after they were posted in a ring shaming group.</p>
      <p>Helenka Fabianska posted pictures of the rings he had made for his boyfriend Scott Reason in the group “That’s it, I’m ring shaming”.</p>
      <p>Members of the group regularly post pictures of their and others rings, with people encouraged to shame them.</p>
      <p>Mr Fabianska told the PA news agency he has a love for the macabre and also has a bracelet with his boyfriend’s teeth, which he created after they were surgically removed.</p>

      <p>He said: “When he had his teeth removed, I said send me these so I have a piece of him always near me — like the Victorians used to do with locks of hair. And then I made them into a bracelet.</p>
      <p>“Then I thought, teeth jewellery looks good, and I’d like to keep a theme. It just happens I collect skulls, so I dug out teeth from my poodle and wolf skulls and attached them to empty ring bands.”</p>
      <p>The poodle ring came from a veterinary cadaver surrendered to a hobby taxidermist in Germany that Mr Fabianska bought. The wolf skull was one he found by the river.</p>
      <p>He said the rings break a lot because they are attached with superglue.</p>
