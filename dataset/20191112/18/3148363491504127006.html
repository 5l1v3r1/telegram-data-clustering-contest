      <p>Durbin, who criticized the president for calling people from DACA “hardened criminals,” said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that Trump “has been so cruel when it comes to immigration,” especially when it comes to children and younger people.</p>
      <p>“Willie, it’s a pathetic charge to think that each and every one of these [780,000 or 790,000] have gone through a thorough criminal background check to qualify for this protection,” Durbin told MSNBC’s Willie Geist. “And for the president to call them toughened, hardened criminals is just pathetic.</p>
      <p>He continued, “[Trump] has been so cruel when it comes to immigration, particularly when it comes to children and young people.”</p>
