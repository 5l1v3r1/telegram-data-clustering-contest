      <p>Microsoft has officially released the November 2019 Update for Windows 10 and is in the process of rolling out to users. This update will upgrade the operating system to Windows 10 1909 and is an optional feature update that will not be installed automatically for users running newer versions of Windows.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, Windows 10 November 2019 Update is not a big release and it doesn't come with any major improvements.  Instead this should be considered a service pack that includes bug fixes and mostly feature improvements.</p>
      <p>The main improvements from this build include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can now create an event directly from the Calendar flyout on the Taskbar.</li>
        <li>Action Center is getting a new button at the top and Microsoft is also updating notifications settings with a new option that will help you sort notifications by most recently shown. The notification toast has been updated with a new button to quickly mute notifications from that particular app.</li>
        <li>File Explorer updated with new Search experience and OneDrive integration.</li>
        <li>The navigation pane on the Start menu now expands when you hover over it with your mouse</li>
        <li>Third-party digital assistants like Alexa will work from the Lock screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Microsoft says it's rolling out the update now and it will show up on PCs gradually. For users who wish to install it right now, they need to open the Settings app and navigate to Update &amp; Security page &gt; Windows Update, and then click on 'Check for updates'.</p>
      <p>If the update is available for your PC, you will see a new 'Download and install now' option underneath the check for updates button. November 2019 Update will be labeled as an optional update, so it won't be installed automatically.</p>
      <p>Microsoft says you cannot download the Windows 10 version 1909 with the Update Assistant tool until November 18. Instead you can use one of the following two methods.</p>
      <h3>Getting the November 2019 Update via Windows Update</h3>
      <p>To get the November 2019 Update using Windows Update, please follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Start menu and click on Settings icons.</li>
        <li>Navigate to Update &amp; Security.</li>
        <li>Open Windows Update page.</li>
        <li>Click 'Check for updates'.</li>
        <li>A new section "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1909" will appear.</li>
        <li>Click 'Download and install now' to begin the download.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Downloading the November 2019 Update ISO files</h3>
      <p>If you don't want to wait until the update is released for your device, you can also grab ISO images and manually force the update.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO">Windows 10 download page</a> in Chrome or Firefox.</li>
        <li>Open the <b>Developer tools</b>.</li>
        <li>Toggle device bar and select <b>iPhone</b>, <b>iPad </b>or a <b>Pixel </b>phone. It can be any platform other than Windows.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page and you have the direct download links on your screen.</li>
        <li>Select the language and system version (32 or 64-bit) and download the file. Remember that the link will expire in 24 hours.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Automatic update for older versions</h3>
      <p>Microsoft plans to automatically initiate Windows 10 feature update download on PCs running a version of Windows 10 that will be reaching the end of service in a few weeks or months. Users will still have the ability to choose a convenient time.</p>
      <p>Today, Windows 10 April 2018 Update has reached end of service for Home and Pro editions, and such devices should receive the latest feature update.</p>
