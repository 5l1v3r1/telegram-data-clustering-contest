      <p>Samsung Galaxy A51 Renders Leak with Punch-hole Display and Four Cameras<br/>2.5 (50%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>Renown leakster <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks">@OnLeaks</a> just published some very interesting images of what’s supposedly Samsung’s upcoming mid-ranger – the Samsung Galaxy A51.</p>
      <p>The handset portrayed in the renders appears to have married the new camera madness trend with a whopping four camera setup on the back. Meanwhile on the front we find a design we know very well, with a hole punch camera in the middle of the screen. The Galaxy A51 does indeed seem very similar to Samsung’s latest flagship – the Note 10.</p>

      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A51 is also expected to pack a 6.2-inch AMOLED display on a more rounded frame. Beneath the display we’ll probably find an UD fingerprint scanner. This is mostly confirmed by the lack of a fingerprint scanner on the back.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s Galaxy A51 will also be equipping the home-developed Exynos 9611 processor, which includes a four 2.3GHz A73 big cores and four 1.7GHz A53 small core combo plus a G72 MP3 GPU. The CPU will then be paired with 4GB of storage and either 64GB or 128GB of internal storage.</p>

      <p>As far as the camera hardware is concerned, the Samsung Galaxy A51 will be packing a 48MP primary sensor coupled with a 12MP ultra wide angle lens, a 12MP telephoto and a 5MP depth sensor to snap photos with the bokeh effect. In the front we’ll instead find a 32MP single snapper for high res selfies.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s mid-ranger dimensions are already known and they are 158.4 x 73.7 x 7.9 mm. Meanwhile, regarding it’s color variants, the smartphone will be available in silver, black and blue.</p>

      <p>Finally, pricing should be just over $250 or 250€. Similar to the price of the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/18/samsung-galaxy-m30s-launched-with-48mp-camera-and-6000mah-battery/">Galaxy M30s</a> which comes with the same CPU.</p>
