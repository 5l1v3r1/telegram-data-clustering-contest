      <p>After appearing to have fallen behind Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are reportedly preparing a £100 million (R1.9 billion) spending spree to keep up with the Premier League leaders, but who is on their radar?</p>

      <p>Following their 3-1 loss at Anfield on Sunday, which saw City drop nine points behind Liverpool, <i>Sportsmail</i> has reported that Guardiola will be given £100 million to spend on reinforcements.</p>
      <p>The Manchester club's board are determined to keep City among Europe's elite, and want to ensure the squad does not fall behind, especially once the likes of veterans David Silva and Sergio Aguero eventually move on.</p>
      <p>While Silva will leave the league champions at the end of the season, the Argentine striker has been tipped to part ways with the club when his contract expires in 2021.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen who Guardiola will target in the coming transfer windows, but various publications have linked the Citizens with a number of top talents in recent months.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mirror</i> has reported that City are interested in signing Real Madrid's Martin Odegaard, who has been in incredible form on loan at Real Sociedad this season. The Norwegian could potentially be seen as a long-term replacement for Silva, despite Phil Foden's presence at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>It has also been claimed Guardiola could be looking at FC Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele as an attacking option. The Frenchman has been in and out of the Blaugrana's starting XI since his arrival at the Camp Nou, but would command a massive transfer fee.</p>
