        <i>National executive says Ian Byrne can contest West Derby after supportive letter says he has ‘changed his ways’</i>
      </p>
      <p>A controversial Labour councillor who sparked a row over online comments has been allowed to stand as the party’s general election candidate in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>Ian Byrne made “unacceptable” and “sexist” posts on social media aimed at public figures including businesswoman Michelle Mone, the former Tory minister Esther McVey and Prince William.</p>
      <p>He has also been accused of appearing to make light of domestic violence against women online after Everton lost an FA Cup match 3-0 to Wigan. “Everton wives are getting the suitcases out of the loft,” he wrote after the match, which has been perceived as making light of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Byrne has apologised for making and sharing “unacceptable” social media posts. He said he was a “very different person now”.</p>
      <p>His selection for the West Derby seat sparked a row within the constituency <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> party. After a formal complaint by more than 50 members, representatives on the national executive committee met to decide whether he should continue as a candidate. He received their endorsement.</p>
      <p>One member of the West Derby constituency Labour party wrote a letter to the NEC to ask them to ensure Byrne stood down: “I joined the party to fight against those who make comments like these,” referring to people who “joke about rape” and “make sexist remarks”. “I am now in a position where not only am I expected to campaign for the man, but I am expected to vote for him. It’s an absolute disgrace.”</p>
      <p>Byrne has worked for Labour’s acting shadow international development secretary, Dan Carden, who is also a candidate in the general election in Liverpool Walton, and set up the Fans Supporting Foodbanks initiative.</p>
      <p>An open letter sent to the NEC and signed by hundreds of people including dozens of constituency Labour party candidates said Byrne had changed his ways and opposition to him was coming from the right of the party.</p>
      <p>It said: “Ian’s selection was a hard won, member-led campaign that had to overcome dirty tricks and attacks at all stages. To think that after all this his candidacy might be at risk is unfathomable. Not least because the members who worked so hard to get a real, working class, socialist candidate elected are the very same members who will be campaigning door to door in nearby marginal constituencies.</p>
      <p>“Ian is our preferred candidate, he is also a success story for redemption – a working class man gaining political education through trade union activism and going on to represent his class.”<br/><br/>Stephen Twigg is standing down from the seat, which had a Labour majority of 32,000 at the 2017 election. <br/><br/>The backing for Byrne comes as the Labour party is under increasing pressure to ditch other candidates before it finalises nominees on 14 November.</p>
      <p>The NEC has been asked to reconsider the candidature of Kate Osborne, who has been selected to fight the safe Labourseat of Jarrow. She was forced to apologise after it emerged she shared an image of former Conservative prime minister Theresa May with a gun pointed at her head. She admitted that posting the image had “caused offence”.</p>
