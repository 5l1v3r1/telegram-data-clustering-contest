      <p>Inscribed with the words “The Only One” on a rose gold face, a one-of-a-kind Patek Philippe watch sold for a record CAD$41 million at a charity auction earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The watch features 18K solid gold dial plates and an alligator leather bracelet with square scales.</p>
      <p>“Ladies and gentlemen, once in a lifetime, only at Christie’s,” said an auctioneer to cheers and applause as he banged the gavel to announce the final price in Swiss francs.</p>
      <p>The Grandmaster Chime 600A-010 was made exclusively for the charity auction by the Swiss luxury watch brand, which has adorned the wrists of queens and popes since its founding in 1839.</p>
      <p>The watch is the “<a href="https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/watches/patek-philippe-patek-philippe-grandmaster-chime-6227458-details.aspx?from=salesummery&amp;intobjectid=6227458&amp;sid=0d13f631-f0d8-4042-a64d-edbeff4d39a9">first and only</a>” version of its kind ever made in stainless steel, Christie’s wrote online.</p>
      <p>The “<a href="https://www.onlywatch.com/">Only Watch</a>” charity auction, hosted by Christie’s in Switzerland on Saturday, benefitted research into Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
      <p>More than CAD$53 million has been raised over seven editions of the auction.</p>
