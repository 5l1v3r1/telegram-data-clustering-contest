      <p>Six civilians were killed on Monday in three simultaneous bombings in the predominantly Kurdish northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli.<br/><br/>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks, which came after the ISIS group said it was responsible for the killing of a priest from the city.<br/><br/>Two car bombs and an explosives-rigged motorcycle blew up in a busy market and near a school and several churches, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.<br/><br/>Six civilians were killed and 22 wounded in the attacks, said the war monitor group, which relies on sources inside Syria for its reports.<br/><br/>An AFP correspondent saw charred cars and smoke rise from the site of the blasts which also destroyed shops and shattered windows in a three-storey building.<br/><br/>Syria's state news agency SANA confirmed the explosions were triggered by car bombs. It said two blasts went off in a commercial street while the third was near a hotel.<br/><br/>Firefighters tried to put out the flames caused by the explosions, as ambulances rushed to the scene and rescue workers carried away the victims.<br/><br/>Tow trucks removed the mangled remains of vehicles from the scene as security forces tried to keep passersby at bay.<br/><br/>The blasts came after ISIS claimed to have killed an Armenian Catholic priest from Qamishli.<br/><br/>The France-based association L'Oeuvre d'Orient which supports Christian minority communities in the region identified the priest as Father Joseph Hanna Ibrahim.<br/><br/>It denounced his killing along with that of his father as a "terrorist attack" and also condemned the three blasts that rocked Qamishli saying they took place "near churches".<br/><br/>The Observatory said the priest and his father were killed by gunfire as they made their way to the eastern province of Deir Ezzor to inspect the restoration of a church there.<br/><br/>Kurdish fighters led the US-backed battle against ISIS in Syria, expelling the extremists from the last scrap of their proto-state in March.<br/><br/>But the terrorists have continued to claim deadly attacks in northeastern and eastern Syria since then.<br/><br/>Qamishli has been hit by several car bombs in recent months, usually claimed by ISIS sleeper cells who continue to operate in the region.<br/><br/>On October 11, ISIS claimed responsibility for a bomb attack that killed at least six people in Qamishli. The victims included civilians and security forces, according to Kurdish officials.<br/><br/>In July, ISIS said it was responsible for a massive truck bomb that killed at least 44 people in Qamishli.<br/><br/>A Turkish cross-border attack against Kurdish fighters on October 9 heightened fears that ISIS fighters could break out in mass from Kurdish jails.<br/><br/>But a fragile Turkish-Russian ceasefire deal has more or less halted that offensive, and seen Kurdish forces withdraw from areas along the Turkish border, except Qamishli.</p>
