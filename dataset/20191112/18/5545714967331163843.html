      <p><i>We've got some retail Switch copies of </i>My Friend Pedro<i> up for grabs in today's contest!</i></p>
      <p>If you're anything like me, you don't have any friends. Um, wait, that sounded bad -- let's start over, here.</p>
      <p>If you're anything like me, you could always use more friends. Good thing Pedro is such a nice guy! He's got lots of friends, and wants you to be one of them. Get a head start by winning this physical edition of <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-my-friend-pedro-557760.phtml">My Friend Pedro</a></i> for Switch, and expand your social network!</p>

      <p>Like any Devolver joint, <i>My Friend Pedro</i> is pretty nuts. A talking banana convinces you that shit is about to get real, so you get on a balletic killing spree, jumping over rails, sliding over crates, and straight capping fools like an acrobatic madman. It's pretty hectic and chaotic and violent, and that's ok with me. Just don't tell my mom I'm playing it, or she'll ground me until Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Since the game just got a brand-spankin' new physical release, Devolver decided to throw some at us to give away! Scope some deets on it.</p>

They'll twist and turn through the air while aiming both hands at priority threats, or line up a perfect bullet ricochet to drop an unsuspecting gangster from behind. <b>Mix It Up -</b> To break up the high octane running and gunning, dynamic sequences are introduced to offer new challenges, such as thrilling motorcycle chases and slower paced physics-based puzzles. <b>Slow Motion Braggadocio -</b> When the action amps up to a frenzy, players bring it all into focus by shifting into slow motion to calm the nerves and steady the aim. <b>Parkour! -</b> While battling through each level, the number of points earned can be increased by incorporating acrobatic flips, wall jumps and rolls into enemy takedowns. <b>Race to the Top -</b> A global leaderboard is primed and ready for everyone to rack up points landing hits, kills and elaborate acrobatics.</blockquote>

      <p>While you're waiting, comment below telling us what the banana talks to you about. He told me I have pretty eyes, but someone was trying to steal them. So I sealed my eyelids in quick-dry cement so no one could have them. That'll show 'em!</p>

The odds of being selected as a potential winner depend on the number of eligible entries received during the Entry Period. Potential winners will be contacted via email and will be asked to provide their full name, age and mailing address within a specified time period.

General Conditions:</b> In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Contest is impaired in any way for any reason, including, but not limited to fraud, virus, or other technical problem, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either: (a) suspend the Contest to address the impairment and then resume the Contest in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official Rules; or (b) award the prizes at random from among the eligible entries received up to the time of the impairment. The Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. In case of a dispute as to the owner of an entry, entry will be deemed to have been submitted by the authorized account holder of the screen name from which the entry is made. The authorized account holder is defined as the natural person who is assigned to an e-mail address by an Internet access provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning e-mail addresses for the domain associated with the submitted e-mail address.<br/><br/><b>9.Release and Limitations of Liability:</b> By participating in the Contest, entrants agree to release and hold harmless the Contest Entities from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Contest or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Contest; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone or network lines; © printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Contest or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Contest or receipt of any prize.

All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, entrant’s rights and obligations, or the rights and obligations of the Sponsors in connection with the Contest, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the Commonwealth of Virginia or any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the Commonwealth of Virginia.<br/><br/><b>11.
