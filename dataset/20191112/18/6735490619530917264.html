      <p>Turns out singing isn’t Rod Stewart’s only talent.</p>
      <p>In a new spread <i>Railway Modeller</i> magazine, the music icon showed off his 124-foot model railroad of an American city in the 1940s that took 23 years to make.</p>

      <p>“It’s the landscape I like,” he told the mag, revealing he “winged” the layout. “Attention to detail, extreme detail, is paramount. There shouldn’t be any unsightly gaps, or pavements that are too clean.”</p>

      <p>According to Stewart, travels with his wife Penny Lancaster inspired his hard work on the railroad, “I remember seeing a marvellous railway layout in a model railway shop window and thinking if only I could get paid to build a model railway like that.”</p>

      <p>While the model railroad is finished now, touring made it a little more difficult to work on. But thankfully, hotels made the challenge a little easier.</p>
      <p>“We would tell them in advance and they were really accommodating, taking out the beds and providing fans to improve air circulation and ventilation,” he said.</p>
      <p>He later added, “If I’d have realized at the start it would have taken so long, I’d have probably said ‘No! No! Nah!’”</p>
