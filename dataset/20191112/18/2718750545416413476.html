      <p>We’re still <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/what-is-cats-about.html">not totally sure</a> what the live-action <i>Cats </i>movie is going to look like (what exactly is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/cats-movie-cast-mocap.html">digital fur technology</a>, anyway?), but at least Jason Derulo has been taking his acting lessons <i>very </i>seriously. As he explained during a recent trip to <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show, </i>every <i>Cats </i>actor was subjected to a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/cats-movie-cast-mocap.html">rigorous feline school</a>, as they’ll all be portraying — and we can’t stress this enough — normal-sized cats. (Jeez, we’re saying “cats” so much that this could be a Frank Sinatra song during his Capitol years.) “She tells you everything you need to know about cats,” Derulo earnestly said about his teacher. “Cats walk in a different way. We got from two feet to four feet. We’re not just regular cats, we’re cat people.” What ensues is what can only be described as the sexiest animal impersonation in recent talk-show history, so much so that Clarkson gets all hot and bothered. We get it!</p>
