        <b>U23 Africa Cup of Nations</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> South Africa 1-0 Ivory Coast</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 12 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Al Salam Stadium</p>
      <p>South Africa registered their first win at the U23 Africa Cup of Nations, after a stunning strike from Teboho Mokoena secured victory over Ivory Coast.</p>
      <p>Following the goalless draw with Zambia, the overseas-based and Absa Premiership players joined up with the squad as Lyle Foster, Luther Singh, Sipho Mbule and Teboho Mokoena were drafted straight into the line-up.</p>
      <p>Foster had a chance to mark his first start of the tournament with a goal after just 16 minutes, but Cercle Brugge forward was unable to fire home from close range.</p>
      <p>Chances continued to fall for the South Africans, and in particular Foster, who saw a header glanced wide on 20 minutes while he was denied by Ivory Coast shot-stopper Ira Tape on 38 minutes after some good work by Singh and Mokoena.</p>
      <p>At the other end, South Africa goalkeeper Darren Johnson had a relatively opening 45 minutes as the Ivorians failed to register a single effort on target.</p>
      <p>It was more of the same in the second stanza for the South Africans, which prompted coach David Notoane to introduce Kobamelo Kodisang and Athenkosi Dlala for Mbule and Grant Margeman after the hour mark.</p>
      <p>The deadlock was eventually broken with 11 minutes remaining as Mokoena found the back of the net with a venomous free-kick from distance to seal South Africa's first win in Group B.</p>
      <p>Notoane' charges will now turn their attention to Friday's final Group B encounter against Nigeria.</p>
