      <p>There are a lot of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-playstation-4-controllers">amazing PlayStation 4 controllers</a> on the market, and the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dualshock-controllers-are-absolute-trash">DualShock 4 is not one of them</a> — even if some of my colleagues would disagree. Still, I know premium controllers a hard sell to people when they reach upwards of $200. I completely agree. I don't have $200 to spare on a controller all the time, which is why I use <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Black Friday</a> to upgrade.</p>
      <p>Black Friday gives me the perfect excuse to spend a bit more money than I usually would have while still getting a great deal. Even if the specific controller isn't discounted, you can generally pick up a free gift card or another offer with your purchase to make it that much more enticing.</p>
      <p>Anyone who knows me knows how stingy I am. I don't spend money frivolously. However, when it comes to game controllers, I can't settle for anything less than the best. One of the reasons I upgraded to an Xbox One over a PlayStation 4 at the start of the generation was because of its controller.</p>
      <blockquote>When it comes to game controllers, I can't settle for anything less than the best.</blockquote>
      <p>I'm fortunate enough to have an <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/astro-c40-tr-controller-review-best-controller-playstation-4">Astro C40 TR</a>,<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/scuf-vantage-playstation-4-review"> Scuf Vantage</a>, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/razer-raiju-ultimate-controller-review">Razer Raiju Ultimate</a> thanks to my job. What I'd like to get next is the Razer Raiju Tournament Edition. This might seem like a slight downgrade from what I'm currently using, but I think it suits me perfectly.</p>
      <p>I've been using the Astro C40 TR as my main PS4 controller lately because I could swap the D-pad and left thumbstick modules to create an asymmetrical layout seen on Xbox controllers. As wonderful as that Astro controller is, I find myself missing the feel of my Razer Raiju Ultimate. My biggest issue with the Ultimate: It only has a symmetrical thumbstick layout. This is rectified in the Tournament Edition. The fact that the Tournament Edition also happens to be cheaper is just a bonus.</p>
      <p>And if you aren't as picky as me, there are still other great options that you can upgrade to. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Onyx-Bluetooth-Controller-Sony-PlayStation-4/dp/B0787BPRN4?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82105YYw">Hori's officially licensed Onyx controller</a> can be brought for less than half the price of what Astro or Scuf offer.</p>

      <p>For anyone looking for an <i>extra</i> controller in addition to the main one they use, that's when I'd recommend picking up a DualShock 4. It's one of the cheapest options available, and it comes in some pretty cool colors that a lot of people like to collect. I have the blue Days of Play DualShock 4 controller, and I definitely recommend getting a controller other than matte black.</p>
      <p>I'm not going to lie, I have mixed feelings about <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> — and capitalism — but I digress. It will always be scummy to me, but I'm also admittedly a hypocrite and will shop on it when I can save money.</p>
