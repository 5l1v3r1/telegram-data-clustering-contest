      <h2>The older devices run Windows Media DRM, which was replaced in 2010</h2>

      <p>Netflix has explained why its apps will <a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-why-netflix-is-leaving-some-roku-and-samsung-devi-1839782970">no longer work</a> on some older Samsung smart TVs, Roku players and Vizio devices.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the streaming service told <a href="https://gizmodo.com/heres-why-netflix-is-leaving-some-roku-and-samsung-devi-1839782970"><i>Gizmodo</i></a> that the older devices run Windows Media DRM, which has since been replaced by Microsoft PlayReady in 2010.</p>
      <p>The devices that are unable to upgrade to PlayReady will no longer be able to support Netflix.</p>
      <p>The impacted devices include: Roku SD (N1050), Roku HD-XR (N1101), Roku HD (N1100, 2000C), and Roku XD (2050X, 2050N, 2100X, 2100N). Additionally, some Samsung Smart TV models from 2010 and 2011 will be impacted.</p>
      <p>Most of the impacted devices are nearly a decade old so it’s no surprise that they will be losing support.</p>
