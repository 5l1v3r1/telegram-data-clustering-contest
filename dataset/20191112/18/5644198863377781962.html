      <p>MEDAN: More than 1,000 cholera-stricken pigs have been buried in Indonesia after their decaying carcasses were plucked from local waterways, a government official said Tuesday (Nov 12).</p>
      <p>Hundreds more swines are still floating in rivers and a lake near Medan, the capital of North Sumatra province, as police search for suspects who discarded their bodies.</p>

      <p>"They were abandoned about eight days ago so they're decaying and it smelled very bad," local official Muhammad Yunus told AFP.</p>
      <p>"We will keep cleaning them up and burying the carcasses until they're gone because people have been complaining about it," he added.</p>
      <p>Some 6,000 pigs have died across North Sumatra since September with many dumped into local waterways.</p>
      <p>Lab tests found that the animals died of hog cholera but officials said they are also <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-suspects-outbreak-african-swine-fever-pork-production-12076224">testing to see if any were stricken with African swine fever</a>. Neither are believed to pose a risk to humans.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a hog cholera outbreak in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province killed more than 10,000 pigs, causing severe financial losses for local farmers.</p>
