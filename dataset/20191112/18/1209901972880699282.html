      <h1>Brian Burke considered favourite to replace Don Cherry</h1>
      <h2>Brian Burke is the 5-4 pick to be the full-time replacement next season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:20:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Former NHL executive Brian Burke is listed as the heavy favourite to be Don Cherry’s successor on “Hockey Night in Canada” on one sports betting site.</p>
      <p>SportsBettingDime.com has released odds on candidates to replace Cherry after the commentator was sacked by Sportsnet yesterday for a rant about immigrants not wearing poppies on his “Coach’s Corner” segment on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Burke, who currently works as an analyst at Sportsnet, is listed as the 3-2 favourite (must bet $2 to win $3) to appear on Cherry’s longtime “Coach’s Corner” segment on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Burke is the 5-4 pick to be the full-time replacement next season.</p>
      <p>Sportsnet has not said whether it plans to keep the “Coach’s Corner” segment, which has been a first-intermission staple on HNIC.</p>

      <p>Sportsnet hockey commentators Kelly Hrudey, Colby Armstrong and Craig Simpson are among the other betting favourites for Cherry’s job.</p>
      <p>The site also is taking odds on what Cherry does next, with working for another media organization the favourite.</p>
      <p>If he goes into politics, the odds consider Cherry’s most likely destination to be under Ontario Premier Doug Ford and the Conservative party.</p>
      <p>Cherry is listed as a 2,000-1 pick to join the NDP.</p>
