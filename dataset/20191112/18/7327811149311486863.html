      <p>ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Flying can be especially stressful during the holidays, but a four-legged furball is helping put travelers at ease.</p>
      <p>Stitches is the new therapy cat at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. She's an 11-year-old tabico, a mixture of tabby and calico.</p>
      <p>Stitches rides around in a stroller that has a sign that says "pet me."</p>

      <p>She's the first comfort cat at the airport. She will join about 100 therapy dogs that go around helping soothe the nerves of frazzled travelers.</p>
      <p>When she's not working, Stitches enjoys relaxing at home and loves to watch "Law and Order: SVU." "She loves Ice-T's voice," Stitches' owner told The Twin Cities Pioneer Press.</p>
