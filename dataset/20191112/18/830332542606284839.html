      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Sean Duffy has taken a job for a Washington lobbying firm after resigning from Congress two months ago, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family and newborn who has a heart defect and Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>BGR Group announced Tuesday that the Republican Duffy would be working for the firm as a senior counsel heading up its financial services practice. Duffy is the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee's housing subcommittee.</p>
      <p>Duffy starred in the MTV reality series "The Real World" in 1997. He was elected to Congress in 2010 and emerged as one of President Donald Trump's most vocal supporters.</p>
      <p>Duffy resigned in September just before his wife gave birth to their ninth child. He joined CNN as a paid contributor after resigning. He was criticized after appearing to question the patriotism of an Army officer who twice raised concerns over the Trump administration's push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats.</p>
