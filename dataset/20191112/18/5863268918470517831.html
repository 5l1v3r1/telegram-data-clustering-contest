      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – NAB has questioned who would be responsible if former premier does not return back to the country after his bail expires.</p>
      <p>NAB sources said Nawaz is accused in 3 cases while convicted in one case. Sources added that government must ensure return of Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>NAB did not object to his bail on human grounds and its discretion of government to send him abroad.</p>
      <p>Earlier, it surfaced that federal cabinet is likely to approve conditional removal of former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL).</p>
      <p>Sources said that the former prime minister will have to provide guarantee to travel abroad. The federal cabinet is considering the option of submitting bonds as surety.</p>
      <p>Sources said that Nawaz Sharif’s name would be removed from the ECL if he fulfills the conditions of the Sub-Committee.</p>
      <p>The Sub-Committee has also demanded the lawyers of the PML-N supremo to handover some assets.</p>
      <p>The subcommittee will send a summary to the federal cabinet after approval of conditions from Nawaz Sharif and the committee will take final decision till 9pm.</p>
