      <h1>New Disney+ Concept Art of Falcon, Winter Soldier, Hawkeye and More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:29:56+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It seems like comic book fans will better appreciate Zemo’s look in the upcoming <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b></a> series. Thanks to the <b>Expanding the Universe</b> documentary which is available from today on Disney+, we got some concept art from the upcoming Marvel series. The art offers the fans a better look at Falcon’s new costume. Bucky Barnes, Sharon Carter, and U.S. Agent make appearances, as well as Baron Zemo. The villain’s mask, which initially looked dark in Comic-Con footage, appears now to be comics-accurate purple. On top of that, we also got a look at the upcoming <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/hawkeye">Hawkeye</a> </b>series featuring the titular hero and Kate Bishop.</p>
      <p>You can take a look at the new artwork in the gallery below (via <a href="https://marvelousnews.com/286-25994">Marvelous News</a>).</p>

      <p><b>John Wick</b> creator Derek Kolstad joined the writing/creative team of <b>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b>. Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan will reprise their roles as Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes in the Disney+ original series. Although details are still under wraps, the story seems likely to follow up on Falcon’s new status quo after <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Mackie and Stan are not the only MCU veterans coming back for the miniseries. Daniel Bruhl reprises Helmut Zemo, a vengeful Sokovian operative in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/captain-america-civil-war"><b>Captain America: Civil War</b></a>. Emily VanCamp will also return as of Sharon Carter, a role she played in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/captain-america-the-winter-soldier"><b>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</b></a> and <b>Civil War</b>. Neither character has appeared onscreen since 2016.</p>
      <p><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b> may only run for six episodes, but it will connect with the larger MCU.</p>
      <p><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </b>will likely hit Disney+ in August 2020. What do you think about the new concepts for <b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </b>and for <b>Hawkeye</b>? Let us know your impressions in the comments section below.</p>
