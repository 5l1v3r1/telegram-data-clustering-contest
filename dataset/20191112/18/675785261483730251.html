      <p>Prince Harry has sparked rumours that he and Meghan could be thinking about having a second child after he asked a military wife what it is like to have two children.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Sussex and his wife made a surprise visit to an Army wives coffee morning at a Remembrance event in Windsor last week.</p>
      <p>The Royal couple attended the event to show their support for families whose partners are deployed overseas.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/prince-harry-and-meghan-surprise-army-wives">Forces Network</a> , mother-of-two Susie Stringellow said <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> asked her what it is like to have a second baby.</p>
      <p>She said: "Harry was really quite interested in how things were with second children as well, because we both have older children.</p>

      <p>“We were trying to encourage him to have a second baby,” she added.</p>
      <p>Some royal commentators have noted the questions might be a hint that Harry and Meghan are ready to have a second child.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Sussex has previously spoken about how the couple want to have maximum two children in order to minimise their family's environmental impact.</p>

      <p>She said: "They were talking about Army life, being away for Christmas...they can compare with us.</p>
      <p>"They didn't want to miss anything, with their little boy now, just how our husbands miss their children."</p>
