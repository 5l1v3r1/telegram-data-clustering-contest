      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/spain.html">Spain</a>'s Socialists and the far-left Unidas Podemos ("United We Can") party have on Tuesday agreed to form a coalition government, just two days after a parliamentary election delivered a highly fragmented parliament.</p>
      <p>The swift deal - albeit a preliminary agreement - still needs cabinet positions to be divided up between the two parties, who recently refused to work together, and also still needs the support of smaller parties.</p>
      <p>Sunday's election, the country's fourth in four years, left Spain's parliament with even less direction than a previous ballot in April, with the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) retaining its lead, but drifting even further away from a majority.</p>
      <p>"It's a deal for four years," Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, who is currently acting prime minister, said after signing the pact, alongside Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias.</p>
      <p>The Socialists' 120 seats, combined with the 35 won by Unidas Podemos, still leave them short of a majority in the 350-seat parliament.</p>
      <p>"Spain needs a stable government, a solid government," Sanchez said, adding they would call on other parties to join the deal.</p>
      <p>If they succeed, it would be Spain's first coalition government since the country's return to democracy in the late 1970s.</p>
      <h3>Not the market's choice</h3>
      <p>Spain's Ibex-35 index slipped by around 0.76 percent at 16:00 GMT, having previously traded 0.3 percent higher on the day.</p>
      <p>Nuria Alvarez, an analyst at Madrid-based brokerage Renta 4, said scepticism remains over whether the preliminary agreement would amount to a working government.</p>
      <p>The market has always looked less favourably on a coalition between the Socialists and Podemos than a centre-right coalition, she added.</p>
      <p>During its campaign, Podemos opposed the privatisation of state-controlled lender Bankia, whose shares were trading 4.3 percent lower.</p>
      <p>The Socialists and Podemos had tried and failed to form a coalition government after the April election, prompting Sanchez to call the repeat ballot.</p>
      <p>The two have been at odds for months, with party leaders exchanging harsh words as the acrimonious talks collapsed.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, they were all smiles, hugging after they signed the pact.</p>
      <p>"We've reached a preliminary agreement to create a progressive coalition government in Spain, which combines the experience of PSOE with the courage of Unidas Podemos," Iglesias said.</p>
      <h3>Minority government?</h3>
      <p>Pablo Casado, leader of Spain's conservative People's Party (PP) criticised the agreement and called for Sanchez's resignation.</p>
      <p>"A radical government is exactly the opposite of what Spain needs right now," he said.</p>
      <p>Centre-right party Citizens Party (Ciudadanos), which saw its support collapse to win just 10 seats, said it would not back the deal, calling instead for a grand coalition between itself, the Socialists and PP.</p>
      <p>The small leftist Mas Pais ("More Country") party won three seats, so the two bigger leftist parties would have to draw others in to boost their combined 155-seat tally.</p>
      <p>They would need the Catalan left-wing separatist Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) to at least agree to abstain, and all other non-separatist regional parties to vote in favour.</p>
      <p>But ERC has said it was not ready, at this stage, to back the coalition government deal.</p>
      <p>"Right now our position is no," ERC spokeswoman Marta Vilalta told journalists, according to a translation from Catalan to Spanish by broadcaster TVE.</p>
      <p>"If they want something from us they have to sit down and talk to solve a political conflict," in reference to the Catalan separatist independence movement.</p>
      <p>Local media, including news website eldiario.es, said that Iglesias would be deputy prime minister, something which Sanchez had rejected in the post-April election talks. Sanchez had also at the time opposed a coalition government. The two leaders said details would come later and did not comment further.</p>
