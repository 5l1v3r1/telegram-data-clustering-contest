      <p>The promise of a disruptive, emerging technology that could entirely replace money as we know it, caused a digital age gold rush of investors hoping to strike it rich by buying <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/crypto">crypto</a> assets.</p>
      <p>One shining example of this was an investor who went on to earn $13 million from an early investment in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethereum">Ethereum</a>. But although the story had a happy ending, it could have all gone wrong and there were many ups and downs along the way.</p>
      <h3>Dan Conway Risks it All on Crypto, Turns $300,000 into $13 Million</h3>
      <p><a href="https://thehustle.co/how-i-made-13-million-cryptocurrency-ethereum/">Dan Conway</a> was a former middle-manager at a multimedia corporation located in San Francisco, who first became interested in cryptocurrencies in mid-2015, just as Bitcoin started to come out of a bear market.</p>
      <p>While he had heard about the cryptocurrency earlier, at first he decided that spending “real currency” on “some digital token” was “complete bullshit.” But because <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> had crashed from a high of around $1,200 to $300, Conway had a change of tune and thought about what might happen if the first-ever cryptocurrency rebounded once again.</p>
      <blockquote>“What if it goes up again? What if I put everything I had into this? I could get rich and never work another day in corporate America,” Conway thought to himself.</blockquote>
      <p>Conway was still leery, his all-in attitude could be viewed as destructive, and his self-proclaimed addictive personality had already brought him plenty of hardships throughout his life.</p>

      <p>But later, Conway convinced his wife Eileen to allow him to invest a sizable chunk of their life savings into <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethereum">Ethereum</a>, which was only $14 at the time. Conway walked himself to a local Wells Fargo and wired enough funds to Gemini to buy 6,993 ETH.</p>
      <p>Following the DAO hack, Ethereum’s price tanked, and Conway’s $100,000 investment quickly became worth less than $40,000, losing 60% of his life savings in what felt like an instant.</p>
      <p>Then what Conway did next was an incredible risk, and while it paid off for the early Ethereum adopter, it could have gone terribly wrong.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/ethereum">Ethereum</a> prices at a then low, Conway borrowed $200,000 against his home’s equity and used it to buy another almost 20,000 Ethereum, taking his buy-in price to just $11.21 per ETH.</p>
      <p>After the hack, Ethereum’s price went on a parabolic run fueled largely in part by the ICO boom and crypto hype bubble, and of course, with some help from Bitcoin bringing attention to the young market.</p>
      <p>In just four months’ time, that $300,000 investment rocketed to a valuation of over $6 million. Conway recounts how some days he’d check his portfolio tracking app, to see his overall holdings rise or fall by $1 million in a single day.</p>
      <p>Conway says he felt orgasmic-like euphoria at times when viewing his holdings, comparing it to “a narcotic, shooting up my brain with boosts of dopamine and serotonin.”</p>
      <p>But when prices fell, he recalled snapping at his children, donning a hoodie, and suffered from panic attacks. Conway was even fired from his job of over six years.</p>

      <p>Conway eventually cashed out for a total of $13 million, paid off his home, took a trip to Africa that he and his wife had always dreamt of, and even bought a second home in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Conway’s story is uncommon and chalks it all up to a lot of luck. But there’s no denying that Conway took a major gamble on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/crypto">crypto</a>, and while it paid off handsomely, it could have resulted in complete loss of not only his investment, but his home, his job, and possibly his family.</p>
      <p>Conway says that while he has returned to normal life since he often lies awake “thinking back on the rush of the market”. He says he misses it “like hell.”</p>
