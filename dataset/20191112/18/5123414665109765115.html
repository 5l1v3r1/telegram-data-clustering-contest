      <p>A Finnish radio station is going to play <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/ta/darude">Darude’s</a> iconic track “Sandstorm” on repeat all day and night Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>To celebrate 20 years since its release, HitMix Radio in Finland will play the anthem for 24 hours straight. I mean if they wanted to copy my listening habits, they could have just asked…. </p>
      <p>“Sandtorm” was released on October 26, 1999 and became one of the biggest EDM tracks ever. Now it is time to worship the song for 24 hours on Friday. Listen this Friday <a href="https://www.supla.fi/hitmix">here</a>.</p>
