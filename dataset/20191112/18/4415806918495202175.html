      <h1>Sterling’s bust-up with Gomez like a family row – England boss Southgate</h1>

      <p>Gareth Southgate likened Raheem Sterling’s bust-up with Joe Gomez to a family row as the England manager defended the decision to sideline the Manchester City forward when Montenegro visit.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s qualifier can see the Three Lions seal qualification for Euro 2020 on the evening of their 1,000th international – a special occasion overshadowed by a fracas on the first day of camp.</p>
      <p>Having clashed towards the end of Liverpool’s 3-1 win against fellow Premier League title challengers Manchester City on Sunday, a still simmering Sterling was involved in a fracas with Gomez at St George’s Park the following day.</p>
      <p>The incident took onlookers aback and the 24-year-old Sterling admitted “emotions got the better of me” in a late night social media post that followed the Football Association confirming the forward would sit out the Montenegro qualifier.</p>
      <p>Sterling stayed with the group and apologised to team-mates at a meeting on Monday night, then trained as usual the following morning. Gomez appeared to be sporting a cut close to his right eye in the session but Southgate remained tight-lipped on that – one of numerous queries he batted away at the hastily-organised press conference.</p>
      <p>“Raheem in his post last night explained for a very brief moment his emotions ran over,” he said. “It would be correct to say that’s not the same for Joe.</p>
      <p>“We are dealing with a very young squad in a sport where emotions often run high. These things happen in football. My priority is always the care and wellbeing of all my players. All my players.</p>

      <p>“Then you have a decision to make as to whether there needs to be something further, which is my reasoning for not selecting Raheem for the game on Thursday.”</p>
      <p>Southgate said the whole squad is now interacting as normal and the punishment would be the “end of the matter”, while the England boss took a conciliatory tone when asked if he was disappointed in the forward’s conduct.</p>
      <p>“I love all of my players,” he said. “We are like a family and all family have disagreements.</p>
      <p>“Most important for any family is to come through those disagreements and work through them. I don’t expect as a manager to never have to deal with things that are unexpected or difficult.</p>
      <p>“It’s part and parcel of the job and part and parcel of working with elite players. Our focus now is to move forward.</p>
      <p>“The reality is I’m not prepared to go into details. There is enough conjecture and opinion and talk out there and we don’t need to add to it.</p>
      <p>“As a group we’ve decided the best way forward and we’re in agreement on that. We move on from there.”</p>
      <p>Southgate repeatedly refused to go into details about either the incident or fallout, but it is believed that some England players found the response a bit heavy-handed – something that contradicts the initial statement made on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It’s not for me to discuss the details of the incident, so I think there’s nothing to be gained from any further discussion on that,” said the England manager, who spoke to his leadership group and staff about a suitable punishment.</p>

      <p>“In the end, I always have to find the right solution for the group and for how we will work moving forward.</p>
      <p>“That’s a very difficult line. You try to be fair at all times, like with all the players. I won’t always get that right, but in the end I’m the manager.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made a decision and I think it was appropriate for how we want to work moving forward.</p>
      <p>“For me it was important that, of course Raheem is a very important player for us, but I felt it was the right thing.”</p>

      <p>Southgate offered little up during an unusually defensive media appearance, although it was clear that leaks are beginning to rankle.</p>
      <p>“There seems to be all sorts of info being passed from so many different areas,” he added.</p>
      <p>“This is a consequence of the England football team now and that is a very difficult situation, one we have to think about moving forward.</p>
      <p>“The team getting out, information getting out, there seem to be so many voices in the background. It’s something I have to accept and something I have to deal with.</p>
      <p>“Every player has had an opportunity to speak to me if they want to and my view is that the group is ready to move forward.”</p>
