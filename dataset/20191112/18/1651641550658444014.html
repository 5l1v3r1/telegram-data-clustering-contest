      <p>Microsoft is now rolling out a new Office Insider build Version 1910 (Build 12130.20344) to Slow Ring users. With this new build, Microsoft is replacing the annoying Upload Center in Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Publisher and Visio with the new the Files Needing Attention experience. The new Files Needing Attention is a less intrusive experience when compared to the Upload Center. To access this experience, you can go to File &gt; Open.</p>
      <p>This new build also comes with two other improvements for Outlook and Excel, read about them below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lead your organization in inclusion! When enabled, sending an email to a user within your organization may prompt you to investigate and resolve accessibility gaps. For example, if a recipient has the MailTip enabled, you may receive a suggestion to enable ALT text for images to benefit users with screen readers.</li>
        <li>Create high-quality Visio flowcharts, cross-functional flowcharts and organization charts from your Excel data with the Visio Data Visualizer Add-in. Choose a sample diagram, modify the linked data, and Refresh the add-in to see your data visualized into a polished Visio diagram in Excel.</li>
      </ul>
