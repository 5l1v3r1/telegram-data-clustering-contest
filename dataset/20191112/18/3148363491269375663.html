      <p>A source familiar with the situation said MSNBC is barring Rocah from participating because the network has exclusive rights over her on-camera appearances. Mediaite and Law &amp; Crime News, a law-focused website also owned by Abrams, is slated to live-stream the debate.</p>
      <p>Pollak is a Harvard Law School graduate and co-host of <i>Breitbart News Tonight</i> on Sirius XM Patriot 125, which airs weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. EST.</p>
      <p>Robach is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York and currently Pace Law School’s Distinguished Fellow in Criminal Justice.</p>
      <p>Representatives for MSNBC, SiriusXM, and Abrams did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
