      <p>Deutsche Bank's DWS asset management subsidiary is doing away with most titles as of next year, according to an internal memo on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The abolition of positions like managing directors and vice presidents "will build a collaborative work environment with flat hierarchies based on functional roles, skills and capabilities as well as a clear performance culture", said the memo, seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>As a result, there will be no corporate title promotions in 2019, the memo said. DWS will still have a chief executive and chief financial officer.</p>
      <p>A spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the memo.</p>
