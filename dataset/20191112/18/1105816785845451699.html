      <h1>First Arab astronaut urges climate protection on Earth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T18:41:29+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>DUBAI: </b>Wearing a blue space suit with a United Arab Emirates (UAE) flag on one sleeve and a spaceship on the other, the first Emirati astronaut said on Tuesday his mission highlighted a crucial issue – climate change.</p>
      <p>Witnessing Earth and its beauty from space made him realise the importance of preserving it, said Hazzaa al-Mansoori, a 35-year-old former military pilot, who reached the International Space Station in September.</p>
      <p>“We have to appreciate the planet and make sure that we save it for the next generations,” said the father-of-four, urging efforts to address “the reasons behind climate change”.</p>
      <p>Mansoori became the first Arab astronaut to visit the ISS and returned home to a hero’s welcome after an eight-day mission, during which he participated in scientific experiments including a time-perception study.</p>
      <p>His space trip has become a source of great pride in the UAE, a newcomer with ambitions to send an unmanned probe to orbit Mars by 2021.</p>
      <p>In a Dubai hall swarming with journalists, Mansoori recounted the magic of his trip.</p>

      <p>“When you see our planet from space… it’s really something amazing and a spectacular view,” he said. “I spent a lot of time looking out that window, I didn’t even want to sleep.”</p>
      <p>Mansoori said living in space showed him that life on Earth was “a blessing”.</p>
      <p>“It is really difficult to live in space, we have to provide a lot of oxygen, air and food… and we have all of this here for free,” he said.</p>
      <p>The five-year period ending 2019 is set to be the hottest ever, said a UN report published in September, scientists’ latest grim reminder that climate change is already a reality.</p>
      <p>Last month was the hottest October ever recorded worldwide, according to data released by the European Union’s satellite monitoring service.</p>
      <p>“We are lucky to live here — let us protect the Earth and its atmosphere,” said Mansoori.</p>

      <p>On board the ISS, Mansoori, who was selected from more than 4,000 UAE candidates, donned Emirati dress and treated crew members to his country’s snacks.</p>
      <p>He flew to the station after the UAE signed a contract with Russian space agency Roscosmos to make him a “spaceflight participant”, a term used for people from outside the main space agencies who take short trips to the ISS.</p>
      <p>As part of its space plans, the UAE has announced its aim to become the first Arab country to send an unmanned probe to orbit Mars by 2021, naming it “Hope”.</p>
      <p>“It’s the golden age for space exploration in the UAE,” said Salem al-Marri, of the UAE’s Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre.</p>
