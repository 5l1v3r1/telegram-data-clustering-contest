      <h1>Plymouth two-year-old's 'virus' turns out to be rare form of cancer</h1>
      <h2>Isla has been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:57:05+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author">Rom Preston-Ellis</a></address>
      <p>An appeal has been launched to help a two-year-old girl and her family after she was diagnosed with an extremely rare form of cancer.</p>
      <p>The family from Plymouth were rocked when young Isla was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia - a cancer of the white blood cells which only affects a handful of children every year.</p>
      <p>After initially being told that Isla had probably contracted a viral infection, the youngster's parents Amanda and Dale Chapman were then shocked to discover that she in fact had leukaemia.</p>
      <p>Isla was transferred to Bristol Children's Hospital where she is still being treated and will need a bone marrow transplant after Christmas.</p>
      <p>Her aunt and uncle Maxine Walters and Aaron Chapman - Dale's twin brother - have now <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/7k9uvt-a-little-helping-hand?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_56my+7k9uvt-a-little-helping-hand">launched a fundraising campaign</a> to support the family who are living in Bristol while Isla is being treated.</p>
      <p>"They took Isla to Derriford Hospital because her face kept swelling up and were told at the time that it was probably an allergic reaction to something she had eaten or had been in contact with," said Maxine.</p>
      <p>"They were then told it was just a viral infection and it will go down in a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>"But Amanda insisted that Isla had blood tests and they came back saying she had a low red blood count leading to the doctors discovering she had acute myeloid leukaemia.</p>
      <p>"Isla has already undergone weeks of intensive chemotherapy and there will be more to come.</p>
      <p>"She needs to have a bone marrow transplant which will probably be after Christmas.</p>

      <p>"Her mum, dad and brother Caben are being tested at the moment to see if they can be donors."</p>
      <p>The people of Plymouth have rallied round the Chapmans - so far raising over £9,000 to support them.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/7k9uvt-a-little-helping-hand?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unknown&amp;utm_campaign=comms_56my+7k9uvt-a-little-helping-hand">GoFundMe page</a> set up by Maxine initially had a target of £1,500 but that was surpassed in a matter of days.</p>
      <p>Fundraising events have already taken place with a five-a-side tournament arranged on November 30 at Goals Plymouth in Central Park.</p>
      <p>"Isla's going through a lot but she has been her usual bright and lovely self, she is still so excited to see people," added Maxine.</p>
      <p>"The family need support as both parents are off work and Isla's brother is only aged one himself.</p>
      <p>"Staying in Bristol is very expensive and the whole thing is obviously very difficult for them so they appreciate everyone's help so much."</p>
      <p>The fundraiser gets underway at Goals Plymouth at 2pm on November 30. Visit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/396076137940119/">Facebook page to find out more.</a></p>
