      <h2>The global music sensation has vowed to ditch the social media app if they stop showing how many users have liked her pictures</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:17:35+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicki-minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> has threatened to stop using Instagram if bosses start hiding how many users have ‘liked’ her photos.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Instagram's CEO announced the company would begin testing a new feature that stops likes from showing up on certain accounts.</p>
      <p>Users will reportedly no longer be able to see how many users have liked a photo, unless they are the ones posting it themselves.</p>
      <p>Global rapping sensation Nicki, 36, who currently has 107 million followers on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to voice her frustration on the news.</p>
      <p>She told her 20.6 million followers that she would boycott the app following the new trial, writing: "I’m not posting on IG after this week cuz they removing the likes.</p>

      <p>"Hmmmm what should I get into now? Think of all the time I’ll have with my new life."</p>
      <p>Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri recently opened up about the initiative with Wired, saying that "it’s about young people."</p>
      <p>He said: "The idea is to try to 'depressurize' Instagram, make it less of a competition and give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them."</p>
      <p>Yet Nicki doesn’t appear to think this will makes the app any "better".</p>

      <p>Nicki went on to blast the social media service's decision online.</p>
      <p>She shared: "They took away your engagements in the first place by disrupting the algorithm. Then they boost it to show you how much better this new iPhone is.</p>
      <p>"I mean how much better this new IG feature is... Lemme guess, u don’t believe your iPhone messes up when the new iPhone comes out…"</p>

      <p>The Superbass hitmaker slammed the company's intentions and insisted situations like this are why "musicians make no money".</p>
      <p>She also hinted at a conspiracy as she believed the "labels and streaming services knew what to say to pacify us."</p>
      <p>Rival US rapper <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> also hit back at Instagram following the announcement.</p>
      <p>The rapper posted a video on Instagram, explaining how she thinks the comments section is more toxic to users than seeing likes.</p>
