      <p>The planned journey comes as Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/01/apple-tariff-waivers-iphone-apple-watch-airpods/">seeking tariff waivers</a> on imports from China that include iPhone components, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, and more. <br/><br/>Apple in September said that its newest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> will be manufactured in Texas at the same Austin facility where the existing ‌Mac Pro‌ has been made since 2013. <br/><br/>According to Apple, the new ‌Mac Pro‌ includes components designed, developed, and manufactured by more than a dozen American companies. Suppliers span states that include Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont. <br/><br/>Apple has pledged to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/01/17/apple-350-billion-us-economy-boost/">invest $350 billion</a> in the United States economy by 2023, and last year, spent more than $60 billion with 9,000 domestic suppliers across the country. <br/><br/>Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forumdisplay.php?f=47">Politics, Religion, Social Issues</a> forum.
