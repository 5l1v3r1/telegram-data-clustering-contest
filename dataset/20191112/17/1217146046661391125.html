      <p>A cloud infrastructure provider in Iran found itself at the receiving end of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack through MTProxy servers that Telegram users in the country rely on to avoid government-enforced internet restrictions.</p>
      <p>As Telegram continues to be banned in Iran, users in this country route their messenger communication through <a href="https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/MTProxy">MTProxy</a> servers, which make the traffic look random through encryption. This makes restricting it difficult, allowing servers to fulfill their anti-censorship purpose.</p>
      <h3>Using Telegram users for the attack</h3>
      <p>The method works against any target, be it a website or an online service. Last week, engineers from Arvan Cloud noticed a lot of traffic hitting their edge servers from IP addresses in Iran.</p>
      <p>The attack started on the morning of November 6 and subsided towards the end of the week. Its peak was at 5,000 requests per second, a force that a cloud provider or a DDoS protection service can easily defeat but can disrupt the activity of many websites in Iran.</p>

      <p>The company notes that these distributed attacks are different from what was seen before. They targeted Arvan Cloud edge servers, had no domain defined in the requests, traffic was recorded at layer two (data link) and did not use a common protocol.</p>
      <p>The company says in a <a href="https://circle.arvancloud.com/%D9%87%D8%B4%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-ddos-%D8%AA%D9%84%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-mtproxy-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/">blog post</a> that they were able to determine the source of the bad traffic by guessing it. The popularity of MTProxy servers in Iran along with them being free and easy to use was in tone with the large distribution of the attack.</p>
      <p>Leveraging these servers would not be too difficult, either, as the attacker would just have to replace the address for one proxy server with the IP of the target machine.</p>
      <p>Proxy domains can have several IP addresses and Telegram sends requests to all of them. Using just one address for the attack would just slow down the service.</p>
      <p>Arvan Cloud's security team was able to test their theory in a simulation that generated traffic similar to what they recorded in the DDoS attack.</p>
      <p>Telegram is very popular in Iran, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43907246">figures from last year</a> estimating that more than 50 million users in the country. Banning led to free MTProxies springing up to bypass government restrictions.</p>
      <p>Arvan Cloud warns that this context is detrimental to Iranian users, as proxy server admins can abuse their position for DDoS purposes.</p>
