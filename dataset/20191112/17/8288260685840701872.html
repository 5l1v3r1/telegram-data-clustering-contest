      <h1>'Outrageous' - Birmingham City fans pick their player of the season so far</h1>
      <h2>Who has stood out the most for you in a Blues shirt during the 2019-20 campaign to date?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:45:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Watson</a></address>
      <p>There have been both highs and lows for Birmingham City so far this season.</p>
      <p>With just over a third of the campaign gone, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> sit 13th in the Sky Bet Championship table.</p>
      <p>They are six points adrift of a play-off spot and nine points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>We asked <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham</a> fans to pick their player of the season up to this point - and there were some interesting responses.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunjic-colin-camp-how-birmingham-17243303">Maxime Colin</a> and Ivan Sunjic received plenty of votes, with the likes of Dan Crowley, Jude Bellingham, Kristian Pedersen, Fran Villalba and Marc Roberts also getting an honourable mention.</p>

      <p>Here's what the Blues faithful had to say on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/birminghamcitynews/">Facebook</a> page...</p>
      <p><b>Alan Hipkiss:</b> Colin is the best right back in the league imo.</p>
      <p><b>Jord Fisher:</b> Colin is absolutely solid, but starting to love Dan Crowley aswell. Two massive players for us.</p>
      <p><b>Mike Curtin:</b> Pedersen being solid at the back, rocket header against Brentford and always in the right space at the right time.</p>
      <p><b>Reece Wood:</b> Colin has been outrageous but Sunjic the way he’s come in and just bossed every game, make him captain for the next couple of games, the bloke's class above everyone else in the league.</p>

      <p>Maxime Colin Dan Crowley Ivan Sunjic Jude Bellingham Kristian Pedersen Fran Villalba Marc Roberts Other</p>
      <p><b>Simon Hickson:</b> For complete consistency Colin for me.</p>
      <p><b>Stuart Bravington:</b> Colin closely followed by Sunjic.</p>
      <p><b>Corey Gibb:</b> Colin, Sunjic and Bellingham.</p>
      <p><b>Russell Beckett:</b> Colin. Pederson. Sunjic and Villalba soon as he get on form he will be on fire. U can see his passion.</p>
      <p><b>Ashley Steele:</b> Can’t believe Villalba is hardly getting a shout!!! He’s been awesome IMO.</p>
      <p><b>Carl Woods:</b> Colin for me! Sunjic is a class act and best to come from Crowley.</p>
