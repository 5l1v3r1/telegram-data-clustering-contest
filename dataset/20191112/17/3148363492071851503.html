      <p>Pierce Pennaz, 19, was <a href="https://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/I-Did-It-I-Did-It-Young-Hunter-With-Down-Syndrome-Bags-His-1st-Buck-564795261.html">excited</a> about participating in opening weekend for deer rifle hunters with his father, Steve.</p>
      <p>“We got up Saturday morning, early, 5 a.m. We got Pierce roused out of bed, got him dressed for the weather,” his dad commented.</p>
      <p>The two men waited in the woods for hours until a deer walked into view.</p>
      <p>“I had no idea where it came from. All I know is I said, ‘Pierce, there’s a buck,'” Steve recalled. “He had about a 120-yard shot, which is a long shot for a 20-gauge, and he made a perfect hit on the deer.”</p>
      <p>The young man <a href="https://www.rfdtv.com/story/41308521/teenager-with-down-syndrome-bags-first-buck-in-minnesota">aimed</a> and made the perfect hit, taking the six-point buck down with one bullet. It was his first ever.</p>
      <p>“Pierce was screaming, ‘I got him! I got him! I did it! I did it!'” Steve <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/11/11/i-did-it-i-did-it-young-hunter-with-down-syndrome-bags-his-1st-buck/">said</a> of his son’s reaction.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, Pierce enrolled in an apprentice program with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources that allowed young people to hunt with a parent or guardian for two years.</p>
      <p>However, once that time was up the department said he would need to pass a firearms safety course in order to continue hunting.</p>
      <p>That was when Steve asked for help in finding a way to keep him in the program.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, a bill by Rep. Jim Nash of Waconia and fellow lawmakers became law in the spring, making it possible for the young man to continue hunting with his dad.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to extend the apprentice period so that when we hunt, he’s right here,” Steve said.</p>
      <p>Video of Pierce’s memorable <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/11/11/i-did-it-i-did-it-young-hunter-with-down-syndrome-bags-his-1st-buck/?fbclid=IwAR0tR7uwS0ewO7_xreH31IHxqZaqtudb3iDQ6k2-iQ0TZTa2Fxfaun5FDFk">moment</a> has since spread all over social media.</p>
      <p>“I woke up Sunday morning and I admit I was crying,” his dad said of the special event. “I just said what an amazing experience, and what an amazing young man.”</p>
