      <h1>Former Thomas Cook travel agents reopen their doors in East Kilbride</h1>
      <h2>The stores in the Plaza and Princes Square have been taken over by independent operator Hays Travel who came to the rescue of staff when Thomas Cook went bust.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:15:12+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> travel agents has opened its doors once again – and staff can’t wait to welcome back their loyal customers.</p>
      <p>Dedicated staff at Thomas Cook feared the worst when the travel giant collapsed with the loss of 9000 jobs in the UK.</p>
      <p>Among them were staff at the Plaza and Princes Square stores.</p>
      <p>And so distraught and keen to help were staff that, despite being out of a job, they organised a session in the shopping centre where customers could go along to get help with ATOL refunds.</p>
      <p>However, independent group Hays Travel has now bought over all 555 Thomas Cook shops giving a festive lifeline to staff.</p>
      <p>Manager at the Plaza store, Lee Chalmers, along with staff who have nearly 25 years in the industry, said the reprieve was more than they could have hoped for.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She said: “I am sure I speak on behalf of everyone when I say it feels amazing to be back open.</p>
      <p>“The shop has been so busy with customers wanting to book holidays with us and even just popping in to wish us well. We got to know our customers so well over the years they became more like friends.</p>
      <p>“Some of them we haven’t seen in a while have also come back to us.”</p>
      <p>Lee said the collapse of Thomas Cook came as a shock to staff, who were left bereft.</p>
      <p>“I know there had been talk for a while but in all honesty none of us expected it to go under – it was a total shock,” she said.</p>
      <p>“For our customers, overnight we were gone.</p>
      <p>“It was a great company to work for and one we truly loved being a part of. It was so sad that such an iconic company has just left the high street.</p>
      <p>“We though that was it and all were looking for new jobs.”</p>
      <p>But being able to stay in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> with the same team has been a real boost.</p>

      <p>Lee went on: “It came out of the blue when Hays took us over but was a lovely surprise.</p>
      <p>“A lot of cabin crew have also been redeployed in stores as well.</p>
      <p>“To be back in the town where many of the girls actually come from is so nice.</p>
      <p>“For the town centre as well it’s a good think as the last thing they want is two units lying empty.</p>
      <p>“We have only been part of Hays for a few weeks but already feel part of the family.</p>
      <p>“While we all loved Thomas Cook I think in some ways this will be better for our customers.</p>
      <p>“It is a good old-fashioned travel agency where we sell every type of holiday, there will be something for everyone and we aren’t restricted to selling one brand.</p>
      <p>“The training has been phenomenal as well as the support from head office.”</p>
      <p>And Lee also praised the founders of Hays Travel.</p>
      <p>“The company was set up nearly 40 years ago in the north east of England by John and Irene Hays and the biggest thanks goes to them ,” Lee added.</p>
      <p>“It really is the best Christmas present we could have wished for and thanks also goes to all of out customers for coming back to us, supporting us and we are so delighted to see them all again.”</p>
