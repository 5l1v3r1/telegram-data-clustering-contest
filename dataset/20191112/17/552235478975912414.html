      <h1>Scottish Tory gaffe over inclusion of ex-MP accused of sexual assault on election leaflet</h1>
      <h2>Ross Thomson has mistakenly appeared on the party's Aberdeen South leaflet.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:31:50+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>Blundering <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/farage-pact-tories-killer-20863229">Tories</a> have mistakenly promoted a former MP accused of sexual assault on a party leaflet in a battleground seat.</p>
      <p>Douglas Lumsden replaced scandal-hit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tory-mp-ross-thomsons-ex-20804743">Ross Thomson</a> to contest Aberdeen South, but his leaflet on indyref2 refers to “Ross says”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snp-accuse-boris-johnson-shafting-20851094">SNP</a> candidate Stephen Flynn said:“The Tories have stumbled from one calamity to the next in Aberdeen, but they’ve really outdone themselves this time.</p>

      <p>“For a campaign that is trying so hard to distance itself from Ross Thomson this is beyond embarrassing and shows that their new candidate can’t even get the basics right.”</p>
      <p>Thomson, who ran Boris Johnson’s Tory leadership campaign in Scotland, won the seat in 2017 and was expected to stand again next month.</p>
      <p>However, his political career was ended after Labour’s Paul Sweeney accused him of sexually assaulting him in a Westminster bar.</p>

      <p>Sweeney, who was with friends from Glasgow University, claimed a drunken Thomson tried to thrust his hand down his trousers:</p>
      <p>‘I felt paralysed. It was just such a shocking thing. I was in a cold sweat, it was mortifying.’</p>
      <p>‘In the back of my mind, I was thinking that if I just punched the guy, who knows where that could end up when there’s a bar full of journalists.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t fight, so I took flight.’</p>
      <p>Thomson, who denies the allegations, quit as a candidate on the same day the claims were published.</p>
      <p>Johnson distanced himself from his erstwhile ally by welcoming the resignation and declining to say whether Thomson had been a good MP.</p>
      <p>Lumsden, the co-leader of Aberdeen council, was announced as Thomson’s successor.</p>

      <p>His leaflet to voters includes his picture and words in his own name, but the section on Labour ditching their total opposition to indyref2 contains a howling error.</p>
      <p>It states: “Ross says, ‘This is a total betrayal of Labour voters who support Scotland staying in the UK and who thought that their party would stand by that position’.”</p>
      <p>It was reported recently that Lumsden’s Twitter page had been deleted hours after he was selected.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen South is considered to be a two horse race between the SNP and the Tories, who won with a majority of 4,752 two years ago.</p>
      <p>Flynn added: “It’s no surprise the Tories have taken their eye off the ball. To them, Aberdeen South is just another pawn in Boris Johnson’s bid to force another right-wing, extreme Brexiteer, Westminster government on Scotland.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Tory spokesman said: “This is a simple production error.”</p>
