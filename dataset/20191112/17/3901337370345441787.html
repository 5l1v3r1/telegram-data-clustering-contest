      <p>The Juventus superstar has won five Ballon d'Or titles, a record he shares with rival Lionel Messi, and has been nominated for the 2019 edition of the prestigious prize.</p>
      <p>As reported by the <i>Evening Standard</i>, Ronaldo has now revealed how much winning the title means to him, and compared the accolade to a Nobel Prize.</p>
      <p>"I have learned from (Michael) Jordan like I have learned from all of those who have excelled," he said.</p>
      <p>"I am not just talking about sport either. I like to read things on the Nobel Prize – who has invented, generated, created or developed something.</p>
      <p>"The Nobel Prize for these guys is like the Ballon d'Or for me. I like to know why they invented something and how they did it – it is important, and it helps me to get even better."</p>

      <p>Ronaldo also revealed that he has no plans to retire any time soon, and feels he still has a lot to offer.</p>
      <p>"My aim is to keep myself young as I get older… to remain competitive," he added.</p>
      <p>"Approximately 70% of my life is football. You have to be intelligent to last. I call it the education of a player. You have to look after your life, nutrition and sleep.</p>
      <p>"I have been sacrificing myself for 15 years. After (I retire), I will admire what I have done. More than that, though, what I will do is enjoy my friends, my family, see my children grow up and study.</p>
      <p>"I savour the present. I want to transmit my life experience. Not now, though, I still have a lot to give."</p>
