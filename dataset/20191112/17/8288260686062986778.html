      <h1>High-rise homeowners could face huge bills in Dudley after Grenfell disaster</h1>
      <h2>Leaseholders are normally required to pay towards maintenance and improvements costs to the buildings their homes are part of.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:13:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">George Makin, https://www.facebook.com/George-Makin-332667963925439/?modal=admin_todo_tour&amp;ref=admin_to_do_step_controller</a></address>
      <p>People who bought their homes in high-rise flats could face huge bills in the wake of the Grenfell disaster, a Dudley councillor fears.</p>
      <p>Cllr Cathy Bayton says occupiers who have leaseholds in the council-owned buildings face uncertainty over how much they will have to pay following safety improvements, such as fitting sprinklers.</p>

      <p>Explaining she represents the St James Ward which has three high rise tower blocks, she said: "When tenants were encouraged to take up the Right To Buy, they did not know that in subsequent years high rise blocks would be treated as second class accommodation and experience the sort of neglect and underinvestment that led to the Grenfell tragedy."</p>
      <p>An enquiry into the disaster in 2017, when 72 died <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/london-tower-block-fire-fire-13181961">during a fire in the Kensington council-owned block</a> , is now entering its second stage.</p>
      <p>It is expected to make recommendations on how to avoid a repeat of the tragedy including the retrofit of sprinklers, smoke alarms and upgrading of fire doors.</p>
      <p>Unlike tenants, leaseholders are normally required to pay towards maintenance and improvements costs to the buildings their homes are part of.</p>

      <p>Cllr Bayton added that although these costs could be funded by the government or by the council on behalf of tenants, it is currently unclear where owner occupiers stand.</p>
      <p>She added: “Tenants made their purchase in good faith but may now be hit in the pocket by the recommendations. I will be working with council tenants, owner occupiers and the council to consider the recommendations and to ensure that no resident or tenant loses out from any expenditure or investment that then must be committed to implement them.”</p>
      <p>In response, a spokesperson for Dudley Council said: "We have 23 leaseholders in our 21 blocks that currently house residents. We have around 1,200 flats in total so it is not a large percentage, less than two per cent.</p>
      <p>"The council has not made a specific decision on what costs will be passed on to leaseholders with regard to any safety improvement costs.</p>
      <p>"We currently charge leaseholders a fair share in accordance with the conditions contained within their lease, but we will consult on any future proposals, giving leaseholders the opportunity to make observations and discuss the plans with us."</p>
