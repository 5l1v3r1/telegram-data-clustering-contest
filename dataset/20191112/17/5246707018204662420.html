      <p>If you've been having a grand old time on our homepage today, you'll have spotted that Paramount Pictures has shared a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/video_oh_boy_sonics_movie_redesign_is_revealed_in_brand_new_trailer">first official trailer depicting Sonic's movie redesign</a>. It seems to have gone down very well indeed with fans who were repulsed by the original, and now Sonic's creator Yuji Naka has also shared an opinion.</p>
      <p>Back in May, Naka-san expressed that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/sonics_co-creator_feels_responsible_for_movie_trailer_backlash">he felt "responsible"</a> for the backlash received by the original movie trailer and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/yuji_naka_thanks_sonic_fans_for_encouraging_movie_director_to_change_controversial_design">thanked fans</a> for encouraging the film's director to make changes. It seems he, too, is mostly happy with the new design; he shared the following message to Twitter alongside the new trailer (translations by <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/yuji-naka-comments-new-sonic-movie-redesign/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">DualShockers</a>):</p>
      <blockquote>"This is the new trailer with Sonic’s new design. The design is much more Sonic-like now that he’s wearing gloves. However, his eyes still aren’t joined together, as expected. I can’t help but feel weird about that one point. But I’m looking forward to the movie’s release."</blockquote>
      <p>Interestingly, just before that tweet, Naka revealed that he still wants to be able to see how the original film would've looked. <i>We're not sure we agree, but there you are</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>"Sonic’s new design for the movie is out. However, it seems they’re making it as if the old design didn’t exist, as the movie official account’s old tweets were deleted. I wanted to see a special DVD version of the movie which used the old design. Too bad."</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier today, we took a closer look at the new trailer and the original to create <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/gallery_sonic_movie_trailer_comparison_pics_-_check_out_before_and_after_sonics_redesign">a gallery of side-by-side comparisons</a>.
