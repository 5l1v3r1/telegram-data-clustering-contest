      <p>"Two are lawyers another one is the shooter," he said, adding that they are still investigating why the courtroom feud turned deadly.</p>
      <p>The identities of the victims were not released.</p>
      <p>Gruesome images of the bloody courtroom scene, some 250km southeast of Bangkok, circulated on social media.</p>
      <p>Thailand has high rates of gun ownership and petty personal disputes, romantic and business rivalries are often resolved with bullets.</p>

      <p>But the incident is the latest in a series of high-profile courthouse shootings that have exposed flaws in the legal system's security.</p>
      <p>A week ago three drug suspects - including an American - <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/drug-suspects-shoot-way-out-of-thai-court-12065748">shot and stabbed</a> their way out of a court in the seaside town of Pattaya before being <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/thailand-american-man-wife-shot-way-out-of-court-12069874">tracked down by police</a>.</p>
