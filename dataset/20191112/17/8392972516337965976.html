      <p>It's been a trying time for the Barlows following Sinead's death and it looks like the stressful months have finally taken their toll on Ken.</p>
      <p>At 80 years old, pneumonia can be potentially fatal - will Ken be okay?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Peter is also trying to deal with his grieving brother Daniel, who's struggling to cope without Sinead.</p>
      <p>Sinead was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year when she was pregnant with her son Bertie.</p>
      <p>Although she was told earlier this year her tumour had shrunk and showed no signs of spreading, she found a lump at her wedding to Daniel.</p>

      <p>After going to the doctors, she was told she only had months to live, which was soon cut down to weeks as the doctors could do no more for her.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-heartbroken-as-sinead-dies/">passed away as Daniel read their son Bertie a story.</a></p>
      <p>Since her death, Daniel has been struggling with his loss and decided to take a trip with Bertie, but Peter and Ken have been concerned for him since he told them he didn't want to attend Sinead's funeral.</p>
