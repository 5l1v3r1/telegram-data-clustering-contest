      <h1>Branded location pins will appear when getting directions in Google Maps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:20:59+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>In recent years, Google has increasingly monetized Maps through ads and other subtle methods. One of those ways is by allowing location pins to feature a store’s logo, with that branding <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/ads/local-ads">soon appearing</a> when people get directions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://9to5google.com/2016/05/24/google-maps-ads/">Introduced in 2016,</a> promoted pins allow businesses to display their logo right in the map view. They usually appear if you’re zoomed in closely at the street-level. This full-color branding stands out compared to generic location markers, and you’re more likely to tap as a result.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the holiday season, those branded location pins will appear when you’re getting directions. Previously, that promotional content would disappear as you enter the navigation interface to input a destination, select a mode of travel, and browse routes.</p>
      <p>They will now remain, with Google positioning pins when getting directions in Maps as a way for people to add another destination to their route. When you tap on the branded location, there will be a prominent “Add stop” button just underneath the text and image ad encouraging you to “Visit Today.”</p>

      <p>Google Maps will then reroute as appropriate. This feature is officially rolling out “in the coming weeks.”</p>
      <blockquote>In the coming weeks, you’ll be able to feature your locations as users get directions to a destination. In just a few taps, they can add you as a convenient stop along their route to grab lunch, stop in for shopping, and more.</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, this holiday season, stores can create a curated visual catalog of available products.</p>
