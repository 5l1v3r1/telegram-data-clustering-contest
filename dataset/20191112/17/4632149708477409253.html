      <p><b>Hyderabad</b>: In a shocking incident, a 42-year-old man was burnt alive allegedly by his parents who were unable to bear his harassment after he came home drunk every day. <br/><br/>The offence took place in Mutyalapalli village of Telanganaâ€™s Warangal district late on Tuesday evening. <br/><br/>The deceased was identified as Kadari Mahesh Chandra, elder of two sons of K Prabhakar and Vimala. <br/><br/>Damera police sub-inspector U Bhaskar Reddy said Mahesh Chandra was addicted to alcohol and used to physically and mentally harass his parents. He was demanding for distribution of the joint property. He was also expecting a share of 400 square yards. <br/><br/><br/>Mahesh was also subjecting his wife and two teenage children to physical torture. His wife dumped him and moved to her parents' place along with her daughter and son a few months ago. <br/><br/>On Tuesday evening, Mahesh came home drunk and picked up a quarrel with his parents. Vexed, the parents tied his hands behind his back, doused him with petrol and set him ablaze. He died instantly. <br/><br/><br/>The police detained Prabhakar and Vimala and are interrogating them.
