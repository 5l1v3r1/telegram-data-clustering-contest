      <h1>OnePlus 7 Pro 5G users won't get Android 10 until 2020 because 5G is new and hard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:30:12+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>While the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/23/heres-how-to-update-the-oneplus-7-and-7-pro-to-android-10-right-now/">received Android 10 in September</a>, the company has been very quiet about when the latest major release would hit its first 5G phone, the 7 Pro 5G. CEO Pete Lau finally took to the OnePlus forums with information on the update, but he's bearing bad news. Due to "more rigorous tests, debugging and optimizations" than anticipated, the manufacturer is expecting to launch Android 10 in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>It seems that OnePlus has underestimated the challenges that come with the new networking standard and has to make some substantial changes in Oxygen OS on Android 10 to get 5G to play with it nicely. Pete Lau nebulously says that the company "had to make system optimizations from the fundamental system architecture, in order to deliver a truly fantastic 5G experience." Hopefully, it manages to fix the <a href="https://www.valuewalk.com/2019/06/oneplus-7-pro-5g-connectivity-issues/">data connectivity issues and unreliable fallback to 4G</a> many customers are complaining about while it's at it.</p>
      <p>The severity of the issues surrounding the 5G version become even more apparent considering the 7T series launched without a 5G variant. Let's still hope OnePlus can overcome its problems with the new standard soon and hit that early 2020 target.</p>
