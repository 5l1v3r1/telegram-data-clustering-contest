      <p>Indlovu Gin is a new spirit infused with elephant dung. Gives new meaning to the term "shit-faced." It sells for about $32 per bottle. Creators Les and Paula Ansley of Mossel Bay, South Africa, came up with the concept on safari after learning that elephants have a varied diet of plants, fruits, and vegetables but less than half of it is actually digested.</p>
      <p>“As a consequence, in the elephant dung, you get the most amazing variety of these botanicals,” Les Ansley told the <a href="https://apnews.com/1cae3f3eac884e318ea50796d9681015?utm_source=fark&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=link&amp;ICID=ref_fark">Associated Press</a>. “(I recall my wife saying) Why don’t we let the elephants do the hard work of collecting all these botanicals and we will make gin from it?"</p>
      <p>From the AP:</p>
      <blockquote>After about five sizeable bags of dung are collected for a batch of 3,000 to 4,000 bottles of the gin, the droppings are dried and crumbled, then washed to remove dirt and sand. Eventually only the remains of the fruits, flowers, leaves and bark eaten by the elephants are left behind. <br/><br/>Those botanicals are then sterilized and dried again and placed in an airing cupboard. Think of it like a “spice cupboard,” Ansley said. Eventually, the remains are infused in the gin.</blockquote>
