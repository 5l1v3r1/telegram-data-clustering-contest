      <p>Korean netizens are angry at recent videos released by <b>Studio NNG</b>.</p>
      <p>The YouTube channel is a joint collaboration between <b>EXO</b>'s <b>Chanyeol</b> and SM director <b>MQ</b>. Many Korean fans were angry about MQ's tone towards others in the first video published by the channel, stating: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"MQ... If you're going to leave videos up for the public know when to speak and when not to speak."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"MQ doesn't think of the people he's speaking to and makes them flustered."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"How does a grown adult still speak like that?"</i>

      <p>
        <i>"MQ was the one who was rude and he made the entire staff apologize with him?"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"What kind of apology is this? You made a video that no one understands and isn't sincere at all."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"You mess up and make Chanyeol apologize?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Korean people are angry but they purposefully made everything in English. Is this a joke?"</i>
