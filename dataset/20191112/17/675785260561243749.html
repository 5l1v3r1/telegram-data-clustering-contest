      <p>A child victim of evil and incestuous killers Sarah Barrass and Brandon Machin has said they are now too scared to take baths after an attempted drowning.</p>
      <p>A judge ruled that Barrass and Machin, half brother and sister, should both be jailed for life with a minimum term of 35 years for the murders of Tristan, 13, and Blake, 14.</p>
      <p>The teenagers were found on their bedroom bunks with black bin liners over their heads after a bid to ensure they were both dead, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Barrass had previously tried to kill four of her children by feeding them prescription drugs and had tried to drown one in a bath.</p>
      <p>In a victim impact statement, the child almost killed in the bath described how both defendants tried to drown them and how they had to "fight them off".</p>

      <p>The child doesn't like "baths anymore", a court heard.</p>
      <p>Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, also told the court that the two older surviving children feared they would become murderers after hearing what Barrass and Machin had been charged with.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly said: "When (the older two children) were told Sarah and Brandon had pleaded guilty to the murders of their brothers and the attempted murders of them, (one of them) said they were worried they would become a murderer when they were older because that's what their mum and Brandon did. They said they didn't want to be like that."</p>
      <p>The court heard that the children did not know that Machin - who is Barrass's half brother - was their father and had been told their father was dead.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly added: "Both (the older children) are emotionally broken and don't know why this happened. They repeatedly ask why and how. We don't have the answers."</p>
      <p>The barrister added: "Both (the older children) keep saying they just want a nice family home."</p>

      <p>"Both say they want their brothers back because it's too hard without them."</p>
      <p>The court heard that the two youngest children, who are aged under three, never asked for their mother or Machin, even when they are upset.</p>
      <p>Miss Melly said the older two were "really struggling knowing they will not see their big brothers again and not seeing their (other siblings) every day.</p>
      <p>"They have lost everything," she said.</p>
      <p>She continued: "There's no doubt that all four children will need ongoing psychological support.</p>
      <p>"There's no way of knowing the long-term effect and impact on their lives at this stage."</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Goss said: "The statement from their social worker on their behalf describes their inevitable confusion, the effect of the loss of their brothers.</p>
      <p>"Inevitably they will require a considerable amount of support. The long-term consequences to them and (the younger children) as they grow older cannot be known."</p>
      <p>Prosecutors told how Barrass had requested help with the children from the local authority with the children, texting a friend to say: "I've thought of every possible solution to this mess. Mass murder, putting them all in care, checking in to the local nut house.</p>

      <p>"I love my kids too much to kill them, I can't put them into care for the same reason."</p>
      <p>Kama Melly QC, prosecuting, said that visitors to the children's home would hear Barrass tell her children: "I gave you life, I can take it away."</p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin had been conspiring to kill the children for at least 10 days before they were found by police and paramedics on the morning of May 24.</p>
      <p>All the surviving children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are under the age of 13. </p>
      <p>Barrass and Machin had each admitted two counts of murder, conspiracy to murder six children and five counts of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The night before police were called to the home, Barrass and Machin forced the four eldest children, including Tristan and Blake, to swallow tablets.</p>
      <p>The evil killers had gathered up tablets from around the home and divided them among the children, expecting them to die. </p>
      <p>Miss Melly said: "None of the children wanted to take the tablets but were forced to do so."</p>
      <p>Barrass then sent messages and and wrote posts on social media claiming that the youngsters were suffering from a sickness bug.</p>
      <p>Just minutes before they were strangled, the brothers told a friend on the Nintendo Switch gaming system that they weren't going to school that Friday (May 24) because they were "feeling sick", neighbours said at the time.</p>
