      <h1>UK weather forecast: Flood-hit farm completely stranded with more downpours on way</h1>
      <h2>A farmhouse has been cut off by rising waters after a river in Lincolnshire burst its banks as Britain is sodden by torrential downpours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:33:57+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>Dramatic pictures show a farmhouse cut off by floodwaters after a nearby river burst its banks.</p>
      <p>The Lincolnshire farm was surrounded by water after days of downpours, which have seen villages around the UK forced to evacuate in the deluges.</p>
      <p>Forecasters are warning the worst could be yet to come- as the UK is set to be drenched in another two weeks of heavy rain and the risk of more floods.</p>
      <p>Henry Ward's farmhouse and outbuildings were an island amid the floodwaters this morning after the Barlings Eau, a river near Lincoln, burst its banks.</p>
      <p>His farm was among around 1,000 acres of farmland in Lincolnshire underwater today, after five days of heavy rains gave little sign of mercy for the sodden North and Midlands.</p>

      <p>Almost 40 flood warnings remain in place across the country, as more heavy rains are forecast for South Yorkshire and the East Midlands on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency by this afternoon still had five severe 'danger to life' flood warnings in place for five areas of Doncaster alongside the river Don.</p>
      <p>The Doncaster village of Fishlake is one of the worst-hit areas. It has been submerged in muddy waters after hundreds were forced to flee their homes.</p>
      <p>The EA is in the village pumping water, as residents navigate the water-logged streets in boats and tractors.</p>
      <p>The severe warnings still in place affect Fishlake, Bentley, Kirk Bramwith, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge Caravan Site.</p>

      <p>And a further 29 flood warnings remain in place for parts of the North and east Midlands.</p>
      <p>Opposition leaders have branded the Government's response to the severe flooding hitting parts of the country as "woeful."</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson's Government has been accused of not taking the flooding seriously enough and being slow to initiate emergency COBRA talks, after entire villages were swamped in the last five day's floods.</p>
      <p>Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> claimed if the flooding had happened in Surrey, in the south-east rather than the North and Midlands <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-slams-tories-response-20866581">"it would have been a very very different response."</a></p>
      <p>He said the frontline flood response and EA staff have been slashed by a fifth â€“ and fire and rescue staff by nearly a quarter.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn urged the government to make sure money for local authorities to address the flooding problem was quickly distributed, calling it a "climate and environment emergency."</p>
      <p>Since the flooding began last Thursday, around 13,500 properties have been protected by flood defences, including nearly 5,000 in South Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Flood storage areas are also being operated to protect 7,000 homes in parts of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, the EA added.</p>
      <p>But it warned the flood risk remained high, with heavier bands of rainfall expected on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>The EA said it had more than 200 staff on the ground in south Yorkshire supporting communities affected by the "devastating flooding".</p>

      <p>But it warned the flood risk remained high, with heavier bands of rainfall expected on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>Its flood duty manager Doug Wilson said teams were working around the clock to install temporary barriers and deliver sandbags to areas expecting further rainfall.</p>
      <p>He added: "More heavy rain could bring further and severe surface water and river flooding to parts of South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>"Areas of South Yorkshire will remain affected by ongoing high river levels today through to Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Elsewhere, frequent showers today will fall on saturated river catchments across the Yorkshire Pennines, Peak District, Staffordshire and Derbyshire which could also bring more localised river flooding to these areas."</p>

      <p>The forecaster has issued yellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings for rain in south Wales and parts of the south west on Wednesday and the Midlands, parts of Wales and the south east on Thursday.</p>
