      <p>I had been looking for an excuse to cover <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062140/Garden_Story/"><i>Garden Story</i></a>, a ripe little adventure RPG coming to Steam next year, and today I've got a great one: there's a limited-time demo from November 12 to December 21.</p>

      <p>The Autumn Town demo runs about half an hour, offering a glimpse of <i>Garden Story</i>'s produce-themed world and inhabitants, some basic hand-to-hand combat against the encroaching Rot, and fishin' for items in a sewer. It's essentially just the tutorial section, but I'm glad to get a peek either way.</p>
      <p>The final version will go deeper into gardening and "fostering new friendships," with developer Picogram going so far as to call <i>Garden Story </i>a "social sim." The adventuring aspect feels well-trodden – you can dodge-roll and charge your attacks – but the characters are super cute. I want to see more of them.</p>
      <p>I'll be keeping an eye on this one leading up to its spring PC launch.</p>
