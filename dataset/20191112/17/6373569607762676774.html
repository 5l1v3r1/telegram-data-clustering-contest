      <h2>Man collapsed in foyer of Plymouth rail station in front of shocked travellers</h2>

      <p>Paramedics and rail staff revived a man at Plymouth rail station as he suffered a suspected drugs overdose.</p>
      <p>The man, described by staff at the station as 'thin', collapsed shortly before 2.45pm last Friday in the main entrance foyer. Staff came to his aid and began CPR until paramedics from South Western Ambulance Service arrived where they took over care of the man.</p>
      <p>Witnesses described how they saw paramedics use a defibrillator and and a syringe, believed to be Naloxone - an antidote drug that temporarily reverses the effects of heroin and other opioid drugs.</p>
      <p>Naloxone is used in hospitals and carried routinely on ambulances to treat patients suffering from severe respiratory depression following an opioid overdose. If it is administered within 15 minutes of an accidental overdose there is a greater chance the userâ€™s life can be saved.</p>

      <p>Witnesses said the man's reaction was instantaneous and the man regained consciousness. However, they said he refused the paramedics' attempts to take him to Derriford Hospital.</p>
      <p>They said the man collapsed again and on this occasion paramedics placed him in the ambulance and took him to A&amp;E for further treatment.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the service said: "South Western Ambulance Service was called on Friday 8 November at 2.45pm to attend an incident at Plymouth Railway Station.</p>
      <p>"The caller told us that someone had collapsed at this location.</p>
      <p>"We sent a senior paramedic and an ambulance crew to attend the incident. They treated a male patient at the scene and transported him to hospital for further care."</p>
