      <h1>Get Into The Virtual World With $30 Off Oculus Go</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:00:03+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/gstaff/" target="_blank">Geek Staff</a></address>
      <p>If you’ve been looking to a VR headset for yourself or as a gift for someone for Christmas then you are in luck! For a limited time you can get Oculus’s innovative new <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc6n">Oculus Go</a> HMD with a $30 discount.</p>
      <p>The Oculus Go HMD lets you break out of your home and away from your computer. The VR system is entirely contained inside of the headset, which means you can use it anywhere at any time without the need of a computer or any other equipment.</p>
      <p>As a mobile friendly VR headset, the Oculus Go differs significantly from Oculus’s other VR headsets. Without the extra processing power of a computer the Oculus Go is incapable of playing the cutting edge VR games that were developed for the Oculus Rift. The Oculus Go is able to play some games, but these games are necessarily less graphically advanced and closer to the sort of games you would expect to see on your smartphone, but with VR.</p>
      <p>The Oculus Go is also able to display VR video content, giving you the feeling of being inside of your favorite shows. You can also use it enter VR chatrooms and talk to people from all over the world. There are also several other VR experiences you can partake in.</p>
      <p>The headset and VR content can be controlled using either a series of hand gestures or with a small controller that is included with the HMD. Currently there are two versions of the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc6n">Oculus Go</a> available. The basic version comes with 32GB of internal storage space and an MSRP of $199, whereas the premium version features 64GB of storage space and a $249 price tag.</p>
      <p>Purchasing either headset <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc6n">from Oculus</a> with promo code <i><b>GO32TAKE30</b></i> will drop the price by $30, making your final cost $169 for 32GB version or $229 for the 64GB model. This offer is valid until the end of the day on Veterans Day, which means it will expire after 11:59PM on November 12.</p>
