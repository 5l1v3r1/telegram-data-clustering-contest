      <p>Burglars have also attempted break-ins in Windyridge Road and Penns Lane in Walmley and Clarendon Road and Blackroot Road in Four Oaks.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police PCSO Rachel French, from the New Hall Neighbourhood Team, said: “We have recently seen an increase in burglary in the Sutton Coldfield area, these offences have been happening day and night.</p>
      <p>“We recently received some great intelligence from a vigilant member of the public which resulted in two prolific offenders being stopped and subsequently arrested.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We are appealing for other members of the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour or activity.</p>
      <p>“This can be done calling 999 if the crime is in progress, calling 101 or live chat on the West Midlands Police website: <a href="http://www.west-midlands.police.uk/">www.west-midlands.police.uk</a></p>
      <p>In addition the West Midlands force has also urged householders to secure ladders – having seen an increase in burglars using them to gain access to homes via upstairs windows.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Rachel Darby for the Birmingham East area said: “Across the West Midlands we have recently seen a rise in burglaries where offenders are using ladders belonging to the homeowner to access upstairs windows.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Although this type of offence is not commonplace in Sutton Coldfield, I would recommend that your ladders are stored away where possible. If this isn't possible, you could put a bike lock, or similar, around the rungs of the ladder to prevent it from being extended.</p>
      <p>“Please also look out for your neighbours, and pass this advice on if needed.”</p>
