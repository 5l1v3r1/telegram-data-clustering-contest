      <h1>Peter Andre forbids son Junior, 14, from ever going on Love Island</h1>
      <h2>Peter wants his eldest lad to focus on his studies and would only back him going onto Love Island if he were presenting it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:41:51+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/peter-andre">Peter Andre</a> has admitted to banning eldest son Junior from ever going on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> .</p>
      <p>The 14 year old's currently in school and, according to his dad, doing very well - he's got a drama scholarship, and dad Peter wants him to stay focused.</p>
      <p>Speaking to new! magazine, he revealed that Junior had asked him if he'd ever allow him to take part in the ITV2 dating hit.</p>
      <p>Peter, 46, said his response was: "Yeah, but only to present it."</p>
      <p>He shares Junior, as well as Princess, 12, with former glamour model <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> .</p>
      <p>The pair met in the Aussie jungle on I'm A Celebrity and tied the knot not long after - but they called it quits on their marriage in 2009.</p>

      <p>Peter's now with new wife Emily, and has Amelia, 5, and Theodore, 2.</p>
      <p>Later he added: "I've told him, 'You're 14, work as hard as you can to get the grades to go to university.'</p>
      <p>"If he chooses to go, great, but if he wants to move into entertainment, I'll back him.</p>

      <p>"I want him to concentrate on schooling and so far, he's doing well. He's got a drama scholarship so he's heading the right way. He wants to do acting and I love that because it's a great focus for him."</p>
      <p>He's also got some strict rules for daughter Princess - specifically about dating.</p>
      <p>In his column for new! Peter discussed the news that Gordon Ramsay's daughter Tilly is dating Gion D'Acampo's son Luciano."</p>

      <p>He wrote: "As someone on the outside, I think it's brilliant., but if I found myself in a similar position to Gordon and we were talking about Princess, I'm not sure I'd be laughing.</p>
      <p>"Unless that lad's dad was a priest, the mum a nun and the boyfriend was in the church choir, in which case I'd fully support the relationship."</p>
      <p>The hunk went on to say that he's issued some stark warnings about social media: "I said to her and Junior they'll need to be extra careful when they're older because whatever they get up to, it will always get back to the parents because of social media.</p>
      <p>"So they advice I give them before they do anything is, 'Would dad like it if he saw it?'"</p>
