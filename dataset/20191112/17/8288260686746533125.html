      <p>Birmingham City great Geoff Horsfield has described how disparaging comments from Aston Villa’s Olof Mellberg inspired Blues to a legendary derby victory over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>In a superb interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/UndrTheCosh">Undr The Cosh</a> podcast the ex-Blues and West Brom striker discusses his relationship with Trevor Francis, the celebrations after winning promotion at the Millennium Stadium - and the first Second City clash in 16 years.</p>
      <p>Horsfield, who scored in two games against Villa, was part of the team which won 3-0 at St Andrew’s in September 2002 and he has recalled how then boss Steve Bruce motivated his men following an interview given by the Villa defender.</p>

      <p>“Mellberg put in the paper on the Thursday ‘I have never even heard of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> and I have never heard of their players - that was it,” Horsfield told Undr The Cosh.</p>
      <p>“We tore them to bits in the tunnel, and I mean frightened them to death.”</p>
