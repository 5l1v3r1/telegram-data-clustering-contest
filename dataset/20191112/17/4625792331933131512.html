      <p>Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer has been eliminated from <i>Dancing with the Stars</i> and shared his "mixed" reaction to getting cut.</p>
      <p>Spicer was eliminated from the contest Monday after enjoying support from President Trump, who urged viewers to keep voting for him to remain on the show. He later <a href="https://people.com/tv/sean-spicer-admits-hes-somewhat-relieved-to-be-eliminated-from-dancing-with-the-stars/">told</a> <i>People</i> that he had “mixed” feelings about his elimination.</p>
      <p>Although Spicer, 48, said he was “somewhat disappointed” with the decision, he also said he was “relieved in a way.”</p>
      <p>“The judges made the right decision on a night where you had two dances,” Spicer said. “The scores were going to be very difficult to overcome.”</p>
      <p>Trump and other current and former administration officials had tweeted out support for Spicer’s run throughout the contest. Although he later deleted the tweet, Trump had called on supporters to vote for Spicer, writing, “Vote for Sean Spicer on <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>. He is a great and very loyal guy who is working very hard. He is in the quarterfinals — all the way with Sean! #MAGA #KAG.”</p>
      <p>He later tweeted Monday, "A great try by @seanspicer. We are all proud of you!”</p>

      <p>Spicer said he was grateful for the presidential encouragement.</p>
      <p>“It means a lot,” Spicer said. “I appreciate his support and his continued friendship. It means a tremendous amount to me to know that he’s taking time to put his support out there. I thank him for that.”</p>
      <p>Spicer ended his run in the bottom two after he performed a foxtrot dance with partner Jenna Johnson to the song <i>Story of My Life</i> by One Direction. The pair also performed an Argentine tango to Destiny’s Child’s <i>Bills, Bills, Bills</i>. He received a score of 26 out of 40 for the performance.</p>
