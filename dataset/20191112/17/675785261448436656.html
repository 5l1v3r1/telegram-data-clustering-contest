      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:13:27+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Routledge, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/paul-routledge/</a></address>
      <p>If there was a prize for political vanity, there is no doubt who would win it.</p>
      <p>Step forward Richard Tice, the wealthy, supremely-confident, motormouth southerner slumming it for Brexit in Hartlepool.</p>
      <p>After yesterday’s dirty little deal with the Tories, Nigel Farage’s little helper believes he is heading for stardom as the party’s first MP at Westminster.</p>
      <p>Publicity-hungry Tice, 55, scion of the Sunley construction firm is now CEO of property investors Quidnet Capital Partners, which has been described as a “vulture capitalism.”</p>
      <p>He was a member and big donor of the Conservative Party member.</p>
      <p>But he now revels in the title of “one of the bad boys of Brexit” - the party that’s a company, of which he is a director.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Not-so-nice Tice is already an MEP for East Anglia, many miles from Hartlepool, so he’ll have his work cut out serving two electorates – if he can overturn Labour’s 7,650 majority in Peter Mandelson’s former constituency.</p>
      <p>He has a busy private life, too. Father of three children, he began a relationship last year with political journalist Isabel Oakeshott.</p>
      <p>Tice was the first to coin the slogan “No deal is better than a bad deal”, a phrase foolishly taken up by Theresa May.</p>
      <p>Like Farage, he wants No Deal, whatever the cost to jobs and the economy.</p>
      <p>Hartlepudlians, hard-hit by the bankers’ recession, need him like a hole below the water-line in one of the ships for which the town was famous for manufacturing.</p>
