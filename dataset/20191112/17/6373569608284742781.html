      <p>A 48 hour DJ set is taking place in Plymouth this weekend to raise money for Thinking Autism.</p>
      <p>DJ Aldo Vanucci is hosting the event, which will be held at Switch from 6am on Friday, November 15 until 6am, Sunday, November 17 and is thought to be the first of its kind in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Donations are being collected from now in the run up to the event, and Aldo has even managed to get some celebrity backing from none other than Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim, who has donated to the Just Giving page.</p>
      <p>Aldo said: "I've been doing these events now for a number of years. First, a 24-hour one and then a 36-hour. I've been lucky enough to make a living from DJing and feel this is one way I can give a little back.</p>

      <p>"Thinking Autism is a great charity that is close to my heart and gets very little support. My son is severely autistic and when he was first diagnosed there wasn't as much support or information around and the charity is trying to remedy that.</p>
      <p>"I've been in Plymouth almost 20 years now and in that time I've pretty much always played at Switch.</p>
      <p>"I run their Monday nights which is Wonkeylegs where I play Drum N Bass and Dubstep all night long.</p>
      <p>"I also played at the venue when it was Bang Bang, Firefly and Ride. It's a great venue and as they are open late it will be busy for the hardest part which will be the last six hours."</p>

      <p>During the event, Aldo will be trying not to play the same song twice, and no mixes will be pre-recorded.</p>
      <p>"I will be covering most genres," he said.</p>
      <p>"Naturally, when the venue is busy I'll be playing to the crowd so lots of R'n'B, House, some Drum n Bass but during the day when it's less busy you'll also hear lots of soul, funk, disco and reggae too."</p>
