        <b>Britain's Sophie Hahn broke her own world record to win her fourth consecutive T38 100m title at the World Para-Athletics Championships in Dubai.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Paralympic champion, 22, clocked 12.38 seconds to win her sixth world gold medal across the sprint distances.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Rich Chiassaro and Vanessa Wallace won bronze medals in the T54 400m and F34 shot put respectively.</p>
      <p>"I've worked so hard for this," Hahn said. "It's been a long season and I'm happy to see the work has paid off."</p>
      <p>Asked if she expected to break her record, set in Loughborough in May, she told BBC Sport: "Absolutely not. I just wanted to win, to get the gold. If it was a world record, it would be a bonus."</p>
      <p>Hungary's Luca Ekler took silver, more than half a second behind Hahn, while Australia's Rhiannon Clarke won bronze.</p>
      <p>Hahn's British team-mates, Olivia Breen and Ali Smith, finished fourth and sixth respectively.</p>

      <h3>Bronzes for Chiassaro and Wallace</h3>
      <p>Former European champion Chiassaro had already competed over 100m, 800m and 1500m in Dubai, finishing fifth in the 800m final.</p>
      <p>But he left the best to last, winning bronze over 400m in a time of 47.58 seconds behind gold medallist Yassine Gharbi of Tunisia and China's Zhang Yong.</p>
      <p>"I'm feeling really good. I knew the 400 would be my best bet," he told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"I've missed quite a lot of training through illness and I just didn't have the endurance at the end of the 800m to kick past anybody.</p>
      <p>"If I'd just had maybe a bit more in me I could have got silver."</p>
      <p>Earlier on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/50386072">Wallace won her first world medal with bronze</a> in the F34 shot put.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old threw a personal best of 7.66m, with China's Zou Lijuan winning gold with a championship record of 8.76m.</p>
      <p>"I'm a little bit shocked. It's been a long time coming but it feels so good. I'm really proud of myself," she said.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, London 2012 silver medallist Ola Abidogun placed sixth in the T47 100m final while defending champion Sophie Kamlish finished sixth in the T64 100m final.</p>
      <p>Libby Clegg, making her return to the international stage following the caesarean birth of her son, Edward, in April, qualified for the T11 200m semi-finals after finishing second in her heat alongside guide Thomas Somers.</p>
      <p>In Tuesday's morning session in Dubai, Zak Skinner was fifth in the T13 long jump. The visually impaired 21-year-old, who won European silver last year, recorded a best jump of 6.86m.</p>
