      <h1>China Central Bank Official: Digital Yuan Should Have ‘Controllable Anonymity’</h1>

      <p>China’s proposed new stablecoin project should strike a balance between protecting privacy and regulatory enforcement, China’s Digital Currency Research Institute said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Within the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), the Digital Currency Research Institute is part of the central bank’s payments division.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a conference in Singapore, Changchun Mu said the central bank will not seek full control of users’ personal details, while fulfilling authorities’ need for information, according to <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/china-markets-digital-currency/chinas-digital-currency-not-seeking-full-control-of-individuals-details-central-bank-official-idINKBN1XM0JA">a report by Reuters</a>.</p>
      <p>“We know the demand from the general public is to keep anonymity by using paper money and coins … we will give those people who demand it anonymity in their transactions,” Mu said at the conference.</p>
      <p>“But at the same time we will keep the balance between the ‘controllable anonymity’ and anti-money laundering, CTF (counter-terrorist financing), and also tax issues, online gambling and any electronic criminal activities,” he said.</p>
      <p>China’s digital currency has divided opinion in crypto and blockchain circles. While some observers see <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-jumps-12-as-chinas-xi-embraces-blockchain-boosting-crypto-sentiment">useful validation</a> in the world’s most populous nation adopting a bitcoin-adjacent currency system, others worry about authoritarian surveillance and control. The central bank has said it will guarantee cash-like levels of privacy but admits it will retain the ability to track down crypto users if it suspects illegal activity, like money laundering.</p>
      <p>“That is a balance we have to keep, and that is our goal. We are not seeking full control of the information of the general public,” Mu said.</p>
