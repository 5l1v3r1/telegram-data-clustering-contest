      <p>Apple's upcoming 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> is set to replace the current 15-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌, which is priced starting at $2,399, according to a new report from <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints">Bloomberg</a></i>. <br/><br/>The new 16-inch machine, which will be the largest laptop Apple has offered for sale since the 17-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ was discontinued, will "cost about the same" as the current 15-inch model.</p>

      <p>Prior reports suggested the 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ would be sold alongside the 15-inch model as a higher-end, more expensive option, but it sounds like it won't be quite as pricey as first expected. <br/><br/>The new ‌MacBook Pro‌ is said to feature a revamped keyboard that's designed to be "more reliable," and previous rumors have indicated that it will abandon the butterfly switch mechanism Apple has been using for a new scissor switch mechanism. <br/><br/>The display of the upcoming machine will be brighter, and <i>Bloomberg</i> suggests it will appeal to video and photo editors, gamers, and software developers. <br/><br/>As for launch timing, <i>Bloomberg</i> believes that the new ‌MacBook Pro‌ will come out as soon as Wednesday, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> to then follow at some point in December. <br/><br/>Apple this week has been holding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/12/16-inch-macbook-pro-expected-by-tomorrow/">private press briefings</a> at its luxury loft mansion in New York City, likely providing media sites with review units for first impressions. Apple will announce the new 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ via press release, as there are no more Apple events expected this year.</p>
