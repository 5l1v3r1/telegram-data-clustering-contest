      <p>The next episode of HotHardware's 2.5 Geeks is coming up Thursday, November 14<sup>th </sup> at 5:30 PM ET, and we'll have a special guest on the line: AMD's Robert Hallock. Robert is a Senior Technical Marketing Manager at AMD, responsible for AMD's CPU and APU product lines, so he's is the perfect person to give us some inside details on the company's latest many-core <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-threadripper-3960x-3970x-zen-2-hedt">Zen 2-based CPU products</a>.</p>

      <p>We'll try to pick Robert's brain on both the new <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-9-3950x-november-25">Ryzen 9 3950X</a> flagship enthusiast processor along with the new 24-core Threadripper 3960X and 32-core Threadripper 3970X. Maybe we might be able to get a hint of what else is in store for the Threadripper family... perhaps the rumored <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/msi-ryzen-threadripper-3990x-amd-zen-2">64-core/128-thread Threadripper 3990X</a>.</p>
      <p>Be sure to tune in Thursday at 5:30pm ET, where <b>we'll also be fielding questions from YOU</b> to pose to Robert during the show. You can join us here on this page, or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzibnkUvPg&amp;feature=emb_title">our YouTube channel here</a>. </p>
