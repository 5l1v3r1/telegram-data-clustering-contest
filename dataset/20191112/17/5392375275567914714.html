      <p>After a long wait, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/facebook">Facebook</a> finally reacts to criticism from users. There is now very pleasing news for the users of the mobile app. With the latest version, users now have more customization options. The new update ensures that users can customize the main menu bar of the Facebook app to their needs. In addition, the red notification points for individual tabs can finally be completely switched off. </p>
      <blockquote>“We’re introducing controls for the navigation bar to make it easier for users to connect to the things they like and to control the notifications they receive in the Facebook app.”</blockquote>

      <p>As the screenshots show, you can hide unwanted menu items completely. If you do not use the Marketplace, you can not only turn off the annoying notifications but can completely expunge the key from the main menu. This is truly amazing from Facebook. </p>
      <p>Facebook, Google and Co. have recently noticed that you have to give users more freedom. Before now, companies like to impose new things on users. However, this is not working so well in recent times. The backlashes are so enormous to contain. Facebook will probably provide the new update soon. You can find the new tools in the settings of the Facebook app.</p>
