      <h1>The Disney+ Lineup Will Give You Bizarre Nostalgia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T17:43:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author">R. Eric Thomas</a></address>
      <p>This morning, Disney launched its brand-new streaming platform Disney+. There are some brand-new shows, as well as a massive archive of films stretching back to the beginning of the company. The unveiling reaffirmed a couple of well-established facts: 1) Uh, Disney owns everything. Like everything. Should we do something about this? Elizabeth Warren, any advice? 2) I, personally, am not sure where to find Disney+ and I, personally, am not sure I'll ever know. I'm just going to scream "Show me the movie with the hot Robin Hood fox!" into my remote and hope for the best. 3) Wow, there were a lot of truly deranged films that have lodged themselves inside our hearts and minds and are now coming back to haunt us on some digital platform that I, again, personally, do not understand how to find. [<i>Editor's note: You can find it <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">right here</a>.</i>]</p>
      <p>The list of properties stretches back to 1940's <i>Snow White </i>and ends with 2020's Star Wars universe series <i>The Mandalorian, </i>which is a buddy comedy duo I'd like to see. I was struck by how many films from the 1960s and 1970s that I'd not only seen but vividly remembered. "Am I actually a septuagenarian?" I asked myself. Only Disney knows for sure. Much like the ABC series <i>The Wonderful World of Disney, </i>where I first encountered these films, Disney+ aims to introduce a new generation to such classic characters as Herbie, the talking Volkswagen Beetle, and the dog that is also the District Attorney. Let's take a look at some of the more curious items in the collection.</p>
      <h3>The Reluctant Dragon (1941)</h3>

      <p>I, actually, have not seen this movie but, nevertheless, I have never related to a fictional character more. So sorry Gerri from <i>Succession</i>:<i> </i>I have a new avatar. This dragon is a <i>dragon </i>but also? Very shy. Reticent. I would even say, yes, reluctant. The dragon is like "True, I am a massive reptilian magical creature. Do I breathe fire? It has been said. I took a DNA test and it turns out I'm 100% Targaryen. But I feel <i>weird </i>about it. Know me."</p>

      <h3>Million Dollar Duck (1971)</h3>

      <p>Finally, a biopic on the Aflac duck. Why is it so invested in insurance for humans? From whence comes its desire to interrupt people things with its loud exhortations that all should be prepared for accidents and illnesses? What does it know that we don't?!</p>

      <h3>Pollyanna (1960)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>This is one of the best Disney movies! The basic premise: so, there's this very cheerful girl and everyone in her town is like "What's her deal? Sheesh." A classic!</p>

      <h3>The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1969)</h3>

      <p>Kurt Russell was a bonafide Disney star back in the day. Justin Timberlake who? Hannah Montana where? In addition to 1969's <i>The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes</i>, he also starred in 1971's <i>The Barefoot Executive</i>, and 1975's <i>The Strongest Man in the World</i>. One question for Michael J. Mouse: what's with the fixation on Kurt Russell's feet? When he is a computer? Sneakers! When he is an executive? TOES OUT. (Actually, the titular role is played by an orangutan, one of the many Disney films in which executives basically said "Get me a talented monkey and we'll just roll the cameras and see how it goes.")</p>

      <h3>Herbie Goes Bananas (1980)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Only real ones remember this classic! Part of the Herbie Cinematic Universe, this film features Herbie, a sentient car (unexplained) who also sort of has an attitude problem? In this installment, Herbie goes on a cruise ship to South America and wreaks havoc, a spiritual prequel to <i>Speed II.</i></p>

      <h3>The Ghosts of Buxley Hall (1980)</h3>

      <p>I haven't seen this movie but based on the image I am <i>very nervous </i>about how this is going to go. I <i>think </i>these are Union ghosts based on their uniforms, but in general, as a life philosophy, I try to avoid antebellum phantasms of all sorts. I'm just trying to avoid politics this year, y'know? Love to all, though. Hope it works out!</p>

      <h3>The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975)</h3>

      <p>Now <i>this </i>is a classic! First of all, a movie title that evokes baked goods?! Chef's kiss! Second of all, Tim Conway and Don Knotts playing bumbling criminals? Pump it into my veins! Third of all, a huge set piece involving trying to break into an Old West bank to get some gold?! Why isn't every movie about this? There is no better plot line. Someone call Marty Scorsese: real cinema has arrived!</p>

      <h3>Robin Hood (1973)</h3>

        <i>OO-DE-LALLY DADDY. </i>
        <i>RESPECT MUST BE PAID!</i>

      <h3>The Ugly Dachshund (1966)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>This title feels unnecessarily cruel. The dachshund is trying its best!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Flight of the Navigator (1986)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/flight-of-the-navigator-1986-1571070872.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>
          <cite>Twitter</cite>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A triumph! A kid gets picked up by a space ship with a cool talking robot and a sort of gross little pet alien creature and zooms around the galaxy, singing the Beach Boys. But then! (Spoiler alert) When he gets back to Earth many years have passed! His parents have mourned him! It is deeply sad! So, then he flies back to space (another traumatic moment!) and tries to get back to the past. Emotionally scarring to me and also a very fun movie!</p>

      <h3>Return to Oz (1986)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/return-to-oz-1985-1571071157.jpg"/>

      <p>Speaking of emotional scarring, let's close out with one of the most bizarre items in the Disney collection: a sequel to <i>The Wizard of Oz </i>that hews much closer to L. Frank Baum's dark original. It's sort of steampunk-y but also the sort of general creepy vibe that defined a lot of 1980s live-action family fantasy movies (I'm looking at you <i>Scary Alice in Wonderland </i>miniseries.) Also, not for nothing, but why did they photoshop the illustration of a Victorian child on to Fairuza Balk's face on this poster? Michael J. Mouse, answer for yourself!</p>
