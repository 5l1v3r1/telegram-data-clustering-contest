      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/modest-mouse">Modest Mouse</a> appear to be teasing something new with a mysterious countdown clock.</p>
      <p>The Portland band returned with their first new material in four years back in March,<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-poison-well-the-first-song-from-modest-mouse-in-four-years-2468986"> releasing ‘Poison The Well’ and ‘I’m Still Here’ for Record Store Day 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>After recently confirming US dates for next month, it now looks like the group could be set to release another single or share news on an upcoming album.</p>

      <p>Over on <a href="http://www.mmicecreamparty.com/">the new ‘Ice Cream Party’ page</a>, Modest Mouse are counting down to this coming Friday (November 15). The clock, which at time of publication has two days and 12 hours remaining, is accompanied by a number of animated ice-cream cones and a colourful backdrop – the same aesthetic used on their previous RSD releases.</p>
      <p>No further information on the potential project has been shared at this time.</p>
      <p>Modest Mouse’s December tour will see them take to the stage in Santa Rosa, Las Vegas, Aspen and more cities. These dates follow a run of gigs with <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-black-keys">The Black Keys</a> in September.</p>
      <p>See the full list of upcoming shows in the tweet below.</p>

      <p>Modest Mouse’s last full-length studio effort, ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-modest-mouse-15974">Strangers To Ourselves</a>‘, arrived in 2015. In a three-and-a-half-star review, <i>NME</i> said: “‘Strangers…’ doesn’t pack the emotional punch of their classic albums, but there’s something laudable about its genre-hopping loopiness.”</p>
      <p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/johnny-marr-former-bands-love-reunite-modest-mouse-the-the-pet-shop-boys-2341549">Johnny Marr revealed that he would most like to reunite with The The and Modest Mouse</a> out of all his former bands.</p>
      <p>“I never really think the door is shut on The The, and I’ve got a feeling that Modest Mouse is a chapter that’s yet to be finished,” he said. “Those are the two people I’d like to work with again.”</p>
