      <h1>Crash Team Racing update quietly adds new Ring Rally mode</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:40:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Hargreaves</a></address>
      <p>With Crash Team Racing’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/06/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-next-grand-prix-november-8-new-kart-character/">Neon Circus Grand Prix event</a> well underway, developer Beenox has added a new racing mode some fans may have completely missed.</p>
      <p>Amidst the game’s new wave of themed unlock (which include Pasadena O’Possum, Ebenezer Von Clutch and Koala Kong as playable racers) the developer has added Ring Rally to the list of events available in local play.</p>

      <p>Ring Rally is perhaps as close to a proper score chasing mode Crash Team Racing has. Compatible with all in game tracks (including the new Koala Carnival), you’ll race through a series of rings, bagging points for each one as a timer counts down.</p>
      <p>While not exactly ground-breaking, it’s more friendlier than the existing Relic Race mode which has you smashing precariously placed crates. Ring Rally is also a great learning tool for those who want to get competitive about CTR. The rings are positioned in a way that often indicate shortcuts so it’s definitely worth trying this mode on those courses you find particularly bothersome.</p>
      <p>When Activision first announced its Crash Team Racing remake last year, we wouldn’t have guessed the game’s launch would be followed up with quite so much bonus content. Since its release back in June, Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fuelled has already held four “Grand Prix” events, each one adding new (and completely original) tracks, as well as additional characters and a boatload of unlockable cosmetics.</p>
      <p>There have been revisions to the core game, too. Last month’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/02/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-spooky-grand-prix-update/">Halloween themed Spooky Grand event</a> also introduced a way of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/03/crash-team-racing-update-nitro-fueled-characters/">selecting a race style</a> instead of being locked into the default configuration of each character.</p>
