      <p>A shallow depth of field focused on the tips of the swimmer’s toes; a flurry of bubbles rising upwards; an unidentifiable torso powering serenely into the distance … sometimes a picture only needs a few simple ingredients to make it magical. This shot by Gerry Cranham is a classic example of his ability to craft timeless images. It depicts the Scottish swimmer Bobby McGregor, who would go on to win a silver medal in the 100m freestyle at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics (although arguably it’s not so important now whom the picture is of). For those wondering how it was shot … isn’t there magic in the mystery, too? Let’s just say that while the early 1960s had seen a boom in underwater photography with the release of the Calypso camera, which was conceived by the famed oceanographer and film-maker Jacques-Yves Cousteau, there were other options. Competitive swimming pools began to install special viewing windows at their perimeters, allowing photographers seeking “underwater-style” images to remain dry while capturing the beauty of a tumble-turn.</p>
