      <h1>Mexican state oil firm Pemex hit by ransomware attack (Updated)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:12:33+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/ravie/" target="_blank">Ravie Lakshmanan</a></address>
      <p>Mexican state-owned oil firm <a href="https://www.pemex.com/en/Paginas/default.aspx">Pemex</a> has been hit by a <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/09/09/texas-says-no-to-ransom-demand-as-it-recovers-from-a-coordinated-ransomware-attack/">ransomware attack</a> that halted critical operations, prompting the company to disconnect its network from the internet and back up critical information from hard drives.</p>
      <p>According to multiple reports from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-pemex/ransomware-attack-at-mexicos-pemex-halts-work-threatens-to-cripple-computers-idUSKBN1XM041">Reuters</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/pemex-workers-barred-from-computers-after-unexpected-shutdown">Bloomberg</a>, Pemex (short for “Petróleos Mexicanos”) servers were infected by <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/big-game-hunting-with-ryuk-another-lucrative-targeted-ransomware/">Ryuk</a>, a <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/ryuk-ransomware-targeted-campaign-break/">ransomware strain</a> that’s typically distributed via email phishing campaigns or botnets like Emotet.</p>
      <p>“We are taking measures at the national level to fight Ryuk ransomware, which is affecting various Pemex servers in the country,” Pemex told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Ryuk — believed to be operated by cybercrime group Grim Spider — primarly targets large organizations, and has been involved in a number of <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34335/ransomware-statistics-for-2019-q2-to-q3-report/">high-profile ransomware cases</a> just this year, including those in Riviera Beach and Lake City, leading city officials to pay up a collective ransom of $1.06 million to restore access.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Monday night, the state oil company said the attempted cyberattacks were neutralized quickly and affected less than 5 percent of its computers.</p>

      <p>We’ve reached out Pemex for more specifics, and we’ll update the story accordingly if we hear back.</p>
      <p>The development comes as criminals have been increasingly targeting businesses, especially <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/11/05/spanish-it-firm-infected-with-ransomware-in-continued-attacks-on-supply-chains/">those part of supply chains</a>, to cripple systems with ransomware in an attempt to extort money from victims.</p>
      <p>If anything, the ever-evolving sophistication of cyberattacks underscores the need for preparedness and practicing good security hygiene. Watching out for <a href="https://thenextweb.com/security/2019/11/08/scammers-favor-malicious-urls-over-attachments-in-email-phishing/">phishing emails</a>, hardening the IT infrastructure, removing administrator rights, and adding multi-factor authentication can go a long way towards improving security.</p>
      <p><i><b>Update on Nov. 13 9:00 AM IST:</b></i> While initial reports suggested Pemex was affected by the Ryuk Ransomware, a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/">report by Bleeping Computer</a> states that it was a case of <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/doppelpaymer-ransomware-and-dridex-2/">DoppelPaymer infection</a>, a variant of BitPaymer ransomware. It also reported that the DoppelPaymer group demanded a ransom of 565 bitcoins, or $4.9 million.</p>
