      <p>Nadine Coyle has said she hopes that appearing on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! will help her conquer her fears and grow in confidence.</p>
      <p>The former Girls Aloud star said that she has become more fearful and less gutsy since becoming a mother to daughter Anaiya nearly six years ago.</p>
      <p>Coyle, 34, is one of the 10 stars on the line-up for this year’s series of I’m A Celebrity, along with the likes of Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Kate Garraway and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <blockquote>I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid</blockquote>
      <p>She said: “I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave.</p>
      <p>“In the past, I’ve opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these.</p>
      <p>“Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid.”</p>
      <p>Coyle said she hopes that the jungle-based series, which will include having to live on food rations with very few luxuries in a camp in Australia, as well as undertaking tricky challenges which often involve creepy crawlies, will have a positive impact on her.</p>
      <p>“I really hope that by doing this, it pushes me so far out the comfort zone and that I learn to be comfortable, feel relaxed and do the things that I didn’t used to be afraid of,” she said.</p>
      <p>Derry singer Coyle said she is scared of “heights, rats, snakes – everything”, and that her loved ones have had mixed emotions about her new TV challenge.</p>
      <p>“Some of my friends and family were really shocked,” she said.</p>
      <p>“They asked me what I was doing and pointed out I was afraid of my own shadow! But I am just hoping my jungle lady will come out!”</p>
      <p>The reality of living in the jungle camp, Coyle said, will be a learning curve, as she has not done anything like it before.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve never boiled water on a fire, chopped firewood, slept outside – I do hope I learn stuff about me and it’s the next phase.”</p>

      <p>Coyle has also said that being separated from Anaiya, five, is going to be one of the most difficult challenges of all.</p>
      <p>If she is not the first celebrity to be voted out by the public, it will be the longest they have ever been apart, and she said: “I have been away for 10 days for work before but not longer.</p>
      <p>“I am dreading being away from everybody and not being able to phone and say ‘how are you doing? How is my daughter?’”</p>
      <p>Coyle had Anaiya with former American football star Jason Bell, in February 2014. She recently split from Bell following an 11-year relationship.</p>
      <p>Coyle found fame on the TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002 along with Girls Aloud band-mates Cheryl, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh, and the band went on to have a successful career, with four number one singles and four number one albums.</p>
      <p>The band went on hiatus in 2009 and split in 2013, and Coyle has since gone on to have a solo music career, releasing her debut solo album Insatiable in 2010 and an EP last year.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! starts on Sunday November 17 at 9pm on ITV.</p>
