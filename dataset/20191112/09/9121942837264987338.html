      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Marie Osmond says she’s ready perform the final week of an 11-year run with her brother, Donny, at the Flamingo Las Vegas, after telling the audience on her television talk show that she chipped her knee late last week.</p>
      <p>Osmond talked about her injury during an appearance Monday on CBS’ “The Talk.”</p>
      <p>Osmond. 60, was forced to back out of a performance last Saturday night, but is promising audiences she will be back for this week’s final shows.</p>
      <p>She and Donny Osmond, who is 62, each have had hits with songs such as “Puppy Love,” and “Paper Roses.”</p>
      <p>Front-row seats for the last concert Saturday were going for $4,000 or more, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.</p>
      <p>They are from a family of performers that enjoyed huge popularity in the 1970s.</p>
