      <p>The uncertainty over the government formation in Maharashtra took a new twist on Tuesday after the country’s public service broadcaster Prasar Bharati reported that Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had recommended ‘President’s rule’ in the state. However, the government-owned broadcaster deleted the tweet before posting another tweet attributing the news to unnamed ‘sources.’</p>

      <p>The news of Maharashtra Governor recommending President’s rule in the state came a s a shock to many including the Nationalist Congress Party, which was asked to indicate its willingness to form government in the state by 8.30 PM on Tuesday night. Priyanka Chaturvedi of the Shiv Sena asked, “How can the honourable governor recommend President rule till the time given to NCP doesn’t lapse?”</p>
      <p>Many journalists took to Twitter to claim that the Governor had denied the claim made by Prasar Bharati in its news flash. What left journalists infuriated that Prasar Bharati had first tweeted claiming that Governor had recommended President’s rule in Maharashtra. However, it soon deleted the original tweet and posted a fresh tweet attributing the news to sources.</p>

      <p>Koshyari had first asked the Shiv Sena to inform him about its willingness to form the government by 7.30 PM on Monday. He asked the NCP to do the same after the Shiv Sena asked for an extension of 48 hours.</p>
      <p>Prasar Bharati was recently in the news after it issued a chilling warning to London-based Guardian newspaper <a href="https://twitter.com/PBNS_India/status/1193019470324719616">to desist from</a> ‘slanted reportage’ ahead of the Ayodhya verdict. The newspaper had merely reported that India was tense ahead of the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Babri Masjid-Ram Temple case.</p>
