      <h1>Michael Hussey feels Babar Azam has potential to be compared to Virat Kohli, Steve Smith</h1>

      <p>PERTH: Having managed to end as the highest run-getter for Pakistan in the just concluded T20I series against Australia, it will be important for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Babar-Azam">Babar Azam</a> to turn on the screws in the longer format as his team gets ready to take on the Aussies in a two-match Test series, which also includes a Day-Night game at Adelaide.</p>
      <p>And former Australia batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Michael-Hussey">Michael Hussey</a> believes that the talented batsman can be spoken of in the same sentence as that which has stalwarts like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Steve-Smith">Steve Smith</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kane-Williamson">Kane Williamson</a> if he improves his Test record.</p>
      <p>"I honestly believe this guy can be in the same conversation when we start talking about the best players in the world," Hussey was quoted as saying by Fox Sports. "We start talking about (Virat) Kohli, Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Joe Root gets floated around.</p>
      <p>"I think if he can start putting together some big hundreds like this in the Test arena, he's that good ... he's a brilliant, brilliant player," he added.</p>
      <p>Babar made a brilliant start to the preparation for the two-Test series as he hit a masterful 157 in the practice game against Australia 'A'. This after scoring two fifties in the three-match T20I series that saw the hosts win the series 2-0 as the first game saw no result thanks to rain.</p>
