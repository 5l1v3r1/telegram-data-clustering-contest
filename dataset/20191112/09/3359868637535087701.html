      <p>After dominating its smartphone industry with its iPhone for a decade, tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/">Apple</a> is exploring a new product line for the next phase of the technological revolution. Over the last decade, Apple scaled tremendous heights with billion-dollar sales of its iPhone flagship handsets. Earlier this year, the Cupertino-based tech giant also became the first company to touch a trillion-dollar valuation.</p>
      <p>Known for getting breakthrough innovation in the tech space, people have been eagerly waiting for its next line of products. A recent <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses">report</a> from The Information shows that Apple is seriously working on its plans to launch its augmented reality headsets by 2022.</p>
      <p>Apple has been closely monitoring the developments in the AR space for long. After mobile, many experts believe that AR and VR will be the next big platforms. Tech giants and smartphone manufacturers like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/facebook/">Facebook</a> and HTC have already stepped up the game.</p>
      <p>Even Apple has been building up its AR resources over the last few years, but yet to launch its product in the market.</p>
      <h3>Apple’s AR Headsets</h3>
      <p>The publication reports that Apple is currently working on its AR glasses codenamed N301. Furthermore, it states that the headset will have both – AR and VR capabilities embedded in a slim profile. Apple’s AR Glasses will feature a high-resolution display for information broadcasting as well as blending virtual objects with the real world.</p>
      <p>As per the existing plans, Apple developers with start full-fledged software development in 2021. Reportedly, there will also be a smaller pair of AR glasses from Apple designed for users to wear it for longer periods. The publication stated that the “current prototypes look like high-priced sunglasses with thick frames that house the battery and chips,” citing a person familiar with this development.</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">report</a> from Bloomberg mentions that Apple decided to delay its release from its earlier schedule of 2020 launch. Bloomberg’s Mark Gunman adds that Apple’s combined AR/VR headset will focus majorly on “gaming, watching videos and virtual meetings”.</p>
      <p>Apple’s AR/VR glasses will also feature a 3D sensor system that is more advanced than its existing Face ID system. Apple CEO Tim Cook has been earlier vocal about the company’s ambition in the AR space. Speaking to The Independent in 2017, Cook said that he saw huge potential in augmented reality calling it a “big idea” like a smartphone. He <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/tim-cook-i-regard-augmented-reality-as-a-big-idea-like-the-smartphone-3697549.html">added</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“The smartphone is for everyone, we don’t have to think the iPhone is about a certain demographic, or country or vertical market: it’s for everyone. I think AR is that big, it’s huge.”</blockquote>
      <p>However, when asked about how Apple would compete with existing players, he said that Apple is not concerned about being the first but rather about being the best.</p>
