      <p><b>News</b> by Wesley Yin-Poole, Deputy Editor Updated on 12 November 2019</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward has issued a new update for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and it tackles the game's worst map.</p>
      <p>Piccadilly is a 6v6 map set in Piccadilly Circus in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. It's widely considered to be the game's worst map because of the way the spawns work and the placement of the flags in Domination mode. Pre-patch, the spawns in team deathmatch and Domination meant you could easily find yourself spawn camped, and there was no cover for those trying to cap B flag in the center fountain.</p>
      <p>I mentioned the glaring issue with Piccadilly in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-30-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-review-punchy-gunplay-in-a-campers-paradise">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare review</a>: "Piccadilly just doesn't seem well thought-out at all, its gaggle of abandoned London buses providing powerful protection for those lucky enough to control the left-hand side of the map. Most of my matches on Piccadilly have descended into spawn camping. It's not fun."</p>
      <p>In the update released overnight, Infinity Ward has made two key changes to Piccadilly:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spawn tuning while playing TDM and Domination</li>
        <li>Domination flag adjustments; B Flag is now near the busses instead of the center fountain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hope here is spawn camping will be a lot harder on Piccadilly, and Domination will be fun.</p>

      <p>The update doesn't stop there. Key changes have been made to footstep sounds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted to always play walk footstep sounds when in ADS and crouch independent of speed</li>
        <li>Increased the speed in which you can remain using the walk footstep sounds by slightly pressing on the movement stick</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Modern Warfare has different sounds for crouch walk, walk, jog and sprint - and for a game that has a lot of camping in it, the sound of soldier movement is crucial.</p>
      <p>Before this latest patch, ADS used the walk sound, while crouch used crouch. But if the player moved faster than a certain speed, the ADS walk could change to a jog sound. The same was true for crouch where moving fast in crouch with say an SMG and some light weight attachments could push you into walk sounds from crouch sounds.</p>
      <p>With this patch, crouch will always play crouch sounds, aka creep sounds, and ADS will also play creep sounds. "In this way it's consistent for the user," Joe Cecot, co-design director of multiplayer, said in a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dv5h1d/111219_update_details_and_patch_notes/">Reddit</a>. "Fictionally the player is stealthily moving around in these two states." The upshot is all players should be able to creep around more quietly with crouch and ADS movement.</p>
      <p>And finally, there's more weapon tuning, including another nerf to the dreaded 725, and a tweak to the popular FAL.</p>
