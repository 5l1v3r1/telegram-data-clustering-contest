      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:29:34+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:29</time> by <a rel="author">David Coleman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-coleman/</a></address>
      <p>A 15-year-old girl has died after she went to bed without telling her parents she had been stabbed in a mass brawl.</p>
      <p>Schoolgirl Elizabeth Kindsfater suffered knife wounds to the chest after she reportedly insulted a boy in her class in Yekaterinburg, Russia.</p>
      <p>Local media reports a youngster plunged a blade into her during a huge fight between three groups of male and female friends.</p>
      <p>The boys had been drinking alcohol before the fight, although it is unclear if any of the girls were drunk at the time, reports say.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth managed to make it home by herself despite her stab wound and went straight to bed without telling her parents what had happened.</p>

      <p>Later that night, her condition worsened and she was taken to hospital where doctors were tragically unable to save her life.</p>
      <p>According to local media, the police have arrested a 16-year-old boy who is suspected of using a sharp blade to stab the victim.</p>
      <p>Officers reportedly found a blade that appears to match the murder weapon at his home and forensics experts are currently analysing it.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson said: "For now, we have reason to believe that the schoolgirl was killed because of animosity between the victim and the suspect after she insulted him."</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>

      <p>The horrifying death comes a day after macabre CCTV footage showing the moment a leading military professor allegedly threw body parts of his murdered student lover into a river was released in Russia.</p>
      <p>Historian Oleg Sokolov, 63, has been detained on suspicion of shooting then dismembering Anastasia Yeschenko, 24.</p>
      <p>The footage, recorded at 4am, highlights the respected academic, Russia’s leading expert on Napoleon, disposing of the woman’s severed legs and other body parts into the Moyka River in St Petersburg, according to law enforcement.</p>
      <p>In the clip, a man is seen chucking three packages into the icy waters close to his home as an unsuspecting cyclist rides past.</p>
      <p>A custody hearing is due to be held with Sokolov facing a criminal investigation for murder with a 15-year maximum sentence.</p>
