      <p>The name Andrey Arshavin is well known. The former Russian footballer was in fashion after starring at Euro 2008 and he later signed for Arsenal in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Prior to moving to England he had drawn interest from a number of other clubs, including Barcelona. He even featured on the cover of SPORT on more than one occasion.</p>
      <p>Arshavin, 38, is now retired. He left the game one year ago but everything suggests the name Arshavin may have life in it yet... in the form of his son.</p>
      <p>Arseny Arshavin has been at the Barça Academy in Moscow, Russia, since 2018. The academy is directed by Jordi Gratacó. And it seems the young Arshavin is quite good.</p>
      <p>For example, he was recently chosen as the player of the week, a competition within the Russian academy. Curiously, each team is given the name of a player or ex-player and Arseny's team is called... Messi.</p>
      <p>Many offspring of famous footballers are embedded or have been embedded in the Barça Academy scheme. Gerard Pique, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez's kids are all involved.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, former Real Madrid player Robinho's son was playing for the Barça Academy in Istanbul, while former goalkeepers Rustu and Kameni also have children at the academy.</p>
