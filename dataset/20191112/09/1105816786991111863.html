      <p><b>MUSCAT: </b>Six South Asian labourers died in Oman during heavy rains when they were buried at an excavation site for a water pipeline project, emergency services said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The construction workers were believed to be Indian nationals, New Delhi’s embassy said in a statement on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Rescue teams recovered the bodies of six Asian workers that were buried in a water project” in the coastal city of Seeb, about 30 kilometres (18 miles) northwest of the capital Muscat, the Public Authority for Civil Defense and Ambulance (PACDA) said.</p>
      <p>“The workers were trapped in rainwater and mud while laying down pipes… underground in a site that was 295 metres (968 feet) long and 14 metres (46 feet) deep.”</p>
      <p>It took rescue workers about 12 hours to recover the bodies after pumping the water out, the authority said.</p>
      <p>The Indian embassy wrote: “We are deeply saddened to learn about the incident involving the deaths of six workers, who are believed to be Indian nationals”.</p>
      <p>PACDA urged companies in charge of construction projects to abide by safety regulations to protect workers.</p>
      <p>The General Federation of Oman Trade Unions called for an investigation to “clarify the circumstances behind the incident and for the necessary legal procedures” to follow.</p>
