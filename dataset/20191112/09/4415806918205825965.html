      <p>Robert Carlyle has given a foul-mouthed summary of his views on Brexit.</p>
      <p>The Scottish actor, who has now made his home in Canada, said the division caused by Brexit is “very sad”.</p>
      <p>He is concerned that friends and family can be split by their opinions on the referendum.</p>

      <p>The star of Trainspotting and the upcoming BBC series The War Of The Worlds said he believes Brexit is a “f****** disaster”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Radio Times magazine, he added: “People are entitled to their opinion.</p>
      <p>“Whether they voted remain or whether they voted to leave, that’s up to them, their opinion’s valid.</p>
      <p>“But maybe it’s interesting for people to see how the world views this all. It seems like a shocking thing to be happening.</p>
      <p>“There are friends back home who have fallen out over this, families have fallen out, and I find it hard to believe that some political thing could cause such unrest. I don’t know. It’s very sad.”</p>
      <p>Carlyle currently resides in Vancouver, Canada, and is focused on projects that earn money for his family, rather than taking independent film work in the UK.</p>
      <p>Carlyle stars in The War Of The Worlds, a female-led update based on the HG Wells novel, which is coming to the BBC.</p>
      <p>The full interview with Carlyle is available in Radio Times magazine, out now.</p>
