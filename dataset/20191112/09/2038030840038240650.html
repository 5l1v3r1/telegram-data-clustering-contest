      <h1>The subtle way T.I.'s daughter responded to the intrusive comments he made about 'checking her hymen'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:43:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – After T.I.'s very public comments about his daughter's hymen, Deyjah Harris recently unfollowed her dad and the rest of her family on Instagram – and honestly, we completely get it.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, in an interview with Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham on their podcast <i>Ladies Like Us</i>, the 39-year-old admitted he'd talked to his daughter. He then added, "Not only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen."</p>
      <p>The "virginity test" meetings started when she was 16. He added: "I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact."</p>
      <p>While they didn't initially, Nazanin and Nadia have now taken down the episode and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4kc81DJyKd/"><b>apologised</b></a> for the lapse of judgment in discussing and then sharing the conversation.</p>

      <p>Deyjah has since unfollowed her dad on Instagram and Twitter, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4ulhf5BvTw/"><b>Hollywood Unlocked</b></a> reports that she doesn't follow family members Tiny or Zonnique Pullins either.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1091989/t-i-s-daughter-unfollows-him-and-her-family-after-his-comments-about-her-hymen"><b>E! News</b></a>, Deyjah hasn't publicly addressed the comments, but she did recently like a series of tweets about the situation. One tweet read, "This is disgusting, possessive and controlling *whew*" while another user commented, "I am so sorry that you are going through this, it's not right. Your body is yours, no one else's."  </p>
