      <h1>Former Cumberland and Circle Traders Pool Money for Crypto Prop Trading</h1>

      <p>Dan Matuszewski remembers the early days of cryptocurrency trading, just a handful of years ago. It wasn’t the possibility of a market correction that worried him. It was the risk that the whole business might disappear.</p>
      <p>“There was always a non-zero chance that bitcoin would gap down, die, and never come back,” Matuszewski, 31, said in a phone interview.</p>
      <p>Matuszewski, who previously oversaw trading at the cryptocurrency-focused financial company Circle, says he’s now confident enough in the market’s future that he’s teamed up with two partners to pool more than $10 million to start a proprietary-trading firm. They are Bobby Cho, 35, former head of trading at brokerage firm DRW’s Cumberland crypto unit, and Julien Collard-Seguin, 31, a former technology executive at Circle.</p>
      <p>According to Cho, the new company, called CMS Holdings, started trading in October. The business is registered in the Cayman Islands and doesn’t manage money from outside investors, he said.</p>
      <p>“We deploy strategies much like a hedge fund in the market, except that we’re not structured as such,” Cho said.</p>
      <p>The plan is to put 30 percent of the firm’s money into highly liquid cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum and 40 percent to 50 percent into less-frequently traded tokens and digital assets, Cho said. The rest would likely go into long-term equity investments in the crypto industry, he said.</p>
      <p>“The space is evolving very quickly, and it’s not stopping,” Cho said.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled this year to about $8,700 each, though it’s still well off the record of about $20,000 reached in 2017.</p>
      <p>Said Matuszewski:</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s a lot safer now, in that it’s probably not going to disappear.”</blockquote>
