      <h2>Since Abbey Oxley, of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ended her relationship with Steve Harvey, the mum-of-one listed the diamond ring on Facebook and labelled him as 'not worth the oxygen'</h2>

      <p>A mum has put her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/engagement-ring">engagement ring</a> up for sale for £200 on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> after splitting with her "d***head" partner.</p>
      <p>Abbey Oxley, 25, listed the diamond ring on the site this week with a message saying: "Had it on about 2 weeks. He's a d***head wasn't worth the oxygen."</p>
      <p>She ended things with Steve Harvey 34, after a string of rows.</p>
      <p>"Within minutes it was shooting off with people messaging me and bidding over the ring. I can't believe it," the mum-of-one, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, said.</p>
      <p>"I'd had enough of all the arguing so was like 'f**k it, might as well make something from this'.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully it will sell and the offers are serious because I'd like the money and it's a bit of a silver lining then."</p>

      <p>Abbey admitted her relationship with Steve was "rocky anyway".</p>
      <p>They'd only been dating for a year and a half, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10323641/bride-sells-engagement-ring-facebook/">Sun Online</a> .</p>
      <p>And Abbey, who works at a bookmakers, said Steve bought the ring from Warren James recently.</p>
      <p>Now she intends to pamper herself with the cash.</p>

      <p>The mum added: "He wasn't happy about the post and messaged me about it.</p>
      <p>"If I get the £200, I'll spend it on a spa day for myself because I need to relax after getting out of that relationship. Basically a 'f**k you present' to myself."</p>
      <p>But Steve, who is a tiler, defended himself.</p>
      <p>"She knows I'm the best s**g she's ever had," he told the publication.</p>
