      <p>“As a mother, nothing can replace the profound loss of a child, and the devastating heartbreak the family and their loved ones are experiencing,” San Diego State president Adela de la Torre said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to support the family during this tragic time, and ask that we all respect the privacy of his loved ones.”</p>
      <p>He had been pledging Phi Gamma Delta, the Los Angeles Times reported. De la Torre urged anyone with information to come forward.</p>

      <p>The university placed the Interfraternity Council, or IFC, and 14 fraternities affiliated with the group on suspension Friday after university police “uncovered information which alleges that a fraternity was involved in possible misconduct,” the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-11/san-diego-state-phi-gamma-delta">Los Angeles Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The San Diego Police Department would only take over the case if the death is ruled a homicide by the medical examiner's office, spokesman Lt. Shawn Takeuchi told the Associated Press.</p>
