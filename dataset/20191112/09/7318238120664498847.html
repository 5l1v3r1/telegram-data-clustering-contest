      <h1>Israel hit by 50 rockets from Gaza after airstrike kills Islamic Jihad leader</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:20:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Smith and Paul Goldman and Associated PressÂ </a></address>
      <p>Around 50 rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel in retaliation after a senior Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza was killed in Israeli airstrikes early on Tuesday, intensifying violence with Palestinian militants.</p>
      <p>In northern Gaza an Israeli strike killed Bahaa Abu el-Atta and his wife, setting off a barrage of rockets, some of which reached as far as the Tel Aviv heartland as Islamic Jihad vowed further revenge.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military says Abu el-Atta was the mastermind of recent attacks against it, and responsible for most of the rocket, sniper and drone fire from the region.</p>
      <p>The IDF said its "Iron Dome" aerial defense system had intercepted about 20 rockets. Schools and businesses have been closed across southern Israel.</p>
      <p>"The barrage of rockets being fired by Islamic Jihad in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gaza?src=hashtag_click">#Gaza</a> at Israeli civilians after our surgical strike on their commander shows exactly why he was targeted in the first place," the Israel Defense Forces <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1194156784363220992">said on Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Islamic Jihad said: "These terrorist crimes are aggression and a declaration of war against the Palestinian people, and the enemy bears full responsibility for them."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, warned that Israel's actions could provoke more violence.</p>
      <p>"The Zionist enemy's assassination of the leader Mujahid Bahaa Abu al-Atta dangerous escalation, and the continuation of the series of aggression and criminality against our people and its valiant resistance," said Fawzi Barhoum.</p>
      <p>Syrian state media accused Israel of an attempted separate attack on another Islamic Jihad leader, Akram Al-Ajouri, in Damascus. He survived but Islamic Jihad claimed that the attack killed one of his sons.</p>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to give a press conference Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, told reporters that Abu el-Atta was a "ticking time bomb," saying he had been responsible for a number of recent rocket attacks on southern Israel and claimed that he was actively planning new attacks.</p>
      <p>"We essentially over the last week have been waiting for the opportune moment to conduct this surgical strike," he said.</p>
      <p>Conricus added that the airstrike had been carried out with a warplane that destroyed only the floor of the building where Abu el-Atta was hiding in order to minimize "collateral damage."</p>
      <p>Israel pulled out of Gaza in 2005 but keeps it under a blockade, citing security concerns. Aid officials warn that the 2 million Palestinians living in the narrow strip of land face imminent humanitarian collapse.</p>
