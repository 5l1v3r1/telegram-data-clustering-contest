      <p>Taking to Twitter, Goyal said that he spoke about advancing Trade and Investment cooperation between BRICS nations, as well as on the growing trend of non-tariff barriers.</p>
      <p>"Attended the 9th BRICS Trade Ministers Meet in Brazil and deliberated on the global economic climate. Also, spoke about advancing BRICS Trade and Investment Cooperation," Goyal tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Interacted with BRICS Trade Ministers and spoke about the growing trend of non-tariff barriers which deny market access, lead to economic uncertainty and raise the cost of doing the trade for developing countries especially MSMEs. Thus, a win-win mindset is needed to spur trade &amp; promote equity," the following tweet read.</p>
      <p>BRICS brings together five major emerging economies comprising 42 per cent of the world's population, having 23 per cent of the global GDP.</p>
