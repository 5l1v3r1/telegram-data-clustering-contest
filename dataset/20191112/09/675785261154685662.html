      <h1>Jurgen Klopp's wife prevented Liverpool boss taking Man Utd job before approving Anfield move</h1>
      <h2>The German boss guided the Reds to an incredible Champions League triumph last season and has them on track for a Premier League title triumph this term</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:28:14+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:28</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp is finally delivering success for Liverpool - but it could have been a different story if fierce rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> had their way.</p>
      <p>The German boss guided the Reds to an incredible Champions League triumph last season and has them on track for a Premier League title triumph this term.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Klopp, 52, has turned things around remarkably since taking charge of the Anfield giants in 2015.</p>
      <p>But former Reds defender Phil Thompson has revealed that United had previously attempted to bring him to the Premier League - only for the boss' wife Ulla to intervene and stop him making the switch.</p>

      <p>Speaking to TV2 in Norway, Thompson said: "I interviewed Klopp for Sky, and I asked if he and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were created for each other. He looked at me and asked 'Why?'.</p>
      <p>"Then Klopp told me he could have taken over Manchester United, but his wife said it wasn't right.</p>
      <p>"When Liverpool arrived, his wife said it was right. There is something strange there. It is as if he's created for Liverpool."</p>
      <p>At the time, believed to be 2013, Klopp was in charge of a Borussia Dortmund side who he guided to stunning back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2010-11 and 11-12.</p>

      <p>The German was being tipped as one of the finest managers of his generation while David Moyes was struggling in his first and only season in charge of the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>Klopp's wife, a social worker and children's writer, predicted United's current struggles - and Thompson is delighted that Liverpool are now benefiting from his decision to hold firm.</p>
      <p>"In my time we always lost three to four games [at this stage of the season], but this team leads by nine points and lost only one game last season," Thompson added.</p>
      <p>"This season they have beaten everyone, except for a draw at Old Trafford. They are doing something great."</p>
