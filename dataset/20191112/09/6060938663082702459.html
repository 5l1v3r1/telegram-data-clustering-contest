      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:11:15+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Today, the gorgeous <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonali-Bendre">Sonali Bendre</a> and her husband <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Goldie-Behl">Goldie Behl</a> are celebrating their 17th wedding anniversary and how. Sonali was undergoing <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cancer">Cancer</a> treatment last year, recalled how her hubby Goldie has changed over this one year through a heartfelt post.</p>
      <p>The couple today is spending their special day together at a wellness centre and Sonali is all hearts for her husband as he approved this plan. Sonali took to her instagram handle and wrote a moving note. She shared a happy picture of theirs as they enjoy the day and wrote, "This day, last year... we were in New York at the hospital. Since then, the Bendre-Behls have identified two time periods - B.C. (Before Cancer) and A.C. (After Cancer). Lately, my motto has been to move on &amp; keep trying new things, and detoxing and rejuvenating is on top of the list. So on the occasion of our 17th wedding anniversary, I thought letâ€™s take a break and go on a road trip to @atmantan. Before Cancer, Goldie would have never agreed to something like this but I love how he's changed ðŸ˜„He has put everything on standby and has been focusing so much on me... and now I'm turning the focus back on him. P.S. Happy Anniversary @goldiebehl, I love you more than you could imagine... thank you for being my pillar of strength in health &amp; sickness... literally!."</p>
