      <p>When the JL <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/wrangler/">Jeep Wrangler</a> went on sale in early 2018, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/">Jeep</a> made a couple of price corrections — both in the upward direction — as it realized just how hot a property it had. First came <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a19299594/climbing-the-hill-jeep-raises-price-of-new-wrangler-jl/">a $750 increase</a> across-the-board, $500 in the price and $250 in the destination and handling charge. Four months later, Jeep boosted the <a href="https://www.jlwranglerforums.com/jeep-wrangler-base-price-increases-again/">two-door Wrangler price by $450</a>, the four-door by $500, and destination another $50. That's a $1,250 or $1,300 premium for anyone who didn't get their orders handled at the starting gun.</p>
      <p>Now it's the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/gladiator/">Gladiator's</a> turn for some financial tinkering, <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/the-most-expensive-jeep-gladiator-is-getting-a-price-increase"><i>CarsDirect</i> reporting that</a> price of the popular pickup in Rubicon trim will go up this month by $330. The news comes from "a recent <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/car-dealers/">dealer</a> order guide." Right now, the beefiest Gladiator starts at $43,545 and tacks on a handling charge of $1,495, for a total of $45,040. <i>CarsDirect</i> didn't say when, but the price is imminently scheduled to hit $45,370 after destination. When the increase takes effect, a Gladiator with the six-speed manual will be $2,080 more than a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/jeep/wrangler+unlimited/">Wrangler Unlimited</a> Rubicon with the 3.6-liter V6 and manual gearbox. At $47,370 when optioned with the eight-speed automatic, the Gladiator will cost $1,580 more than a likewise equipped Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon, and $390 less than a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/buy/2020-Toyota-Tacoma/">2020 Toyota Tacoma</a> TRD Pro with a six-speed automatic.</p>
      <p>What's this mean for buyers? Nothing but 'bring more money.' In <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/audi/q3/">Q3</a>, Jeep sold 245,474 vehicles, outdoing sister brand Ram by 66,274 units. The Gladiator contributed 16,132 units to that number. <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/fca-q3-sales-rely-largely-on-ram-incentives/">According to Cox Automotive's <i>Market Insights</i></a>, Jeep "set a new Q3 high" for brand-wide average transaction price at $37,812. The Gladiator, however, still leaves dealer lots for an average transaction price above $50,000. Six months ago, we wondered if the pickup could keep up its option-happy orders after Cox noted a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/18/jeep-gladiator-sales-average-price/">$56,403 average transaction price</a> during the truck's first month on sale, when the sample size was small, and the $62,310 Launch Edition and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/06/20/jeep-gladiator-dealer-markups-20000-over-sticker/">wild markups skewed the curve</a>. There's that question answered. For now, the Gladiator won't be stopped, so anyone who wants to save themselves a <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/calculators/">car payment</a> should see a dealer immediately.</p>
