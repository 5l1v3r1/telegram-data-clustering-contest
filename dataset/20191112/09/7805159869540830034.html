      <h1>Partially remap the Pixel 4’s Motion Sense gestures without root</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:08:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-specs-features-pricing-availability/">Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL</a> are Google’s newest flagships, featuring some worthy upgrades and a few cutting-edge technologies like <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-face-unlock-soli-gestures/">Soli</a>. Soli is a radar-based gesture recognition technology, which works on Pixel 4 through the sensor located on the top bezels of the device. Soli can sense motion around the device, and Google has leveraged this for the Motion Sense feature, allowing users to control music, silence alerts, or check their phone by waving their hand over the Pixel. If you are looking to do anything more than this, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/remap-pixel-4-motion-sense-gestures/">you need root</a>, which is not something we recommend to each and every user. However, you can still remap the Pixel 4’s Motion Sense gestures without root, albeit in a limited fashion, following either of the methods mentioned below.</p>
      <h3>Method 1: Button Mapper</h3>
      <p><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-4-xl/themes/app-button-mapper-remap-motion-sense-t3999591">Button Mapper</a> by XDA Recognized Developer <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4684315">flar2</a> introduces support for Motion Sense on the new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL through its newest v1.40 update. This app filters the logcat to detect when a Motion Sense event has happened, then allows you to set actions for those events. Although one can swipe in any direction to perform the action, the developer notes that swiping left or right has the highest rate of success. Note that you need to enable Motion Sense in the System Settings, and the “Reach to check phone” option also must be enabled. You also need to undertake a <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=80870069&amp;postcount=15">one-time ADB setup</a> to allow the app to read logcat output. Also, keep in mind that you need the premium version of the app to remap the gestures.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Motion Sense through Button Mapper will work with the screen off, on the lockscreen and on the homescreen; the sensor is not active within other apps.</p>

      <h3>Method 2: <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/u/tasker-tips-tricks">Tasker</a></h3>
      <p>The other method involves <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/tasker/">Tasker</a>, of course. While Tasker is also a paid app, it is likely that you already have it purchased or can put it to further use because of its unmatched versatility.</p>
      <p>To remap the gestures without root using Tasker, you need the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tasker-update-logcat-detection-automation/">latest version of Tasker</a>. Then, follow the steps below in order:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In Tasker, create a new Profile and choose the Event context.</li>
        <li>Select “Logcat Entry” as the Event.</li>
        <li>In the “Component” field, enter “<i>Oslo/FlickGestureSensor</i>” without quotes to remap the flick right/left/up/down gestures.</li>
        <li>Then in the “Filter” field, enter “<i>SOUTH</i>“, “<i>NORTH</i>“, “<i>EAST</i>“, or “<i>WEST</i>“, without quotes, depending on the gesture direction you want to listen for. Though, note that accuracy is best for both the sideways flicks.</li>
        <li>Finally, set the remap action you wish to undertake, and you are good to go.</li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>There are limitations to what you can achieve with both of these non-root methods for remapping Motion Sense. If you want true and full remapping capabilities for Motion Sense gestures, enabling you to undertake whatever action you want, the best way is to root your phone and install the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/remap-pixel-4-motion-sense-gestures/">OsloBridger Magisk module</a>.</p>
