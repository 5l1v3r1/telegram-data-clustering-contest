      <p>DENPASAR, Nov 12 — An Australian tourist who fly-kicked a motorcyclist and assaulted a man in his own home during a drunken rampage was jailed for four months today.</p>
      <p>The ruling comes after Nicholas Carr’s antics were caught in a viral video that saw him carry out a campaign of destruction in Seminyak, a popular tourist area on the Indonesian holiday island.</p>
      <p>“The defendant Nicholas Carr is found guilty and is sentenced to four months” in jail, presiding judge Soebandi, who goes by one name, told the Denpasar District Court. </p>
      <p>A lawyer for Carr, charged with assault and property damage, said the 26-year-old would not appeal the ruling. </p>
      <p>He is expected to be released next month because of time already served.</p>
      <p>In August, Carr ran barefoot on to a street and shouted expletives before the apprentice builder slammed into the bonnet of a moving car and then fly-kicked an unsuspecting motorcycle rider. </p>
      <p>The biker, who was thrown from the moving scooter, sustained minor injuries — later the pair embraced during a court hearing as Carr apologised to the victim.</p>
      <p>Carr also shattered a convenience store’s glass door before stealing a motorcycle.</p>
      <p>Later, he broke into a house where he assaulted the sleeping homeowner, leaving him with injuries, police said earlier. </p>
      <p>He was eventually caught by locals and police and taken to hospital. </p>
      <p>Pictures that circulated on social media showed at the time showed Carr bloodied and bruised, and trussed with hosepipe and rope.</p>
      <p>Shortly after his arrest, Carr apologised and admitted drinking more than 10 small bottles of vodka as well as other alcohol. </p>
      <p>After a string of embarrassing incidents by tourists, Bali officials recently warned that boorish visitors may be kicked off the island, which attracts millions annually to its palm-fringed beaches, colourful nightlife and ancient temples.</p>
      <p>Australian professional rugby league player David Fifita returned home this week after he was briefly arrested in Bali for assaulting a nightclub security guard.</p>
      <p>Several days after Carr’s arrest, a Czech couple who were slammed for disrespecting a Balinese temple took part in a ritual purification ceremony. — AFP</p>
