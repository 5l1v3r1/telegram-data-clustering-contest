      <p>SINGAPORE (Nov 12): Wealthy people around the globe are hunkering down for a potentially turbulent 2020, according to UBS Global Wealth Management.</p>
      <p>A majority of rich investors expect a significant drop in markets before the end of next year, and 25% of their average assets are currently in cash, according to a survey of more than 3,400 global respondents. The US-China trade conflict is their top geopolitical concern, while the upcoming American presidential election is seen as another significant threat to portfolios.</p>
      <p>“The rapidly changing geopolitical environment is the biggest concern for investors around the world,” said Paula Polito, client strategy officer at UBS GWM, in a statement. “They see global interconnectivity and reverberations of change impacting their portfolios more than traditional business fundamentals, a marked change from the past.”</p>
      <p>Nearly four-fifths of respondents say volatility is likely to increase, and 55% think there will be a significant market sell-off before the end of 2020, according to the report which was conducted between August and October and polled those with at least US$1 million in investable assets. Sixty percent are considering increasing their cash levels further, while 62% plan to increase diversification across asset classes.</p>
      <p>In the same survey in May, an even higher amount — 32% — of investor portfolios was in cash.</p>
      <p>Still, it seems that wealthy investor caution is strictly for the short-term. Almost 70% of respondents globally are optimistic about investment returns over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>“The challenge is that they seem to want to respond” to short-term uncertainty “by really shortening their time horizons and shifting to assets like cash that are safe,” said Michael Crook, a managing director on the investment strategy team. Though with many of these people investing on a time horizon across decades and for future generations, that “seems like a mismatch.”</p>
