      <p>David*, a trans man assigned female at birth, attended an all-girls school in the south of the country, and identified as a lesbian in his teenage years.</p>
      <p>Now at university, David never felt he could come out as trans while he was a secondary school student.</p>
      <p>“I came out as a lesbian at 14”, he says, adding that this was after self-harming and experiencing suicidal thoughts,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I presented myself as more ‘masculine’ and I looked ‘stereotypically gay’.”</p>

        <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/survey-finds-73-of-lgbti-students-feel-unsafe-in-school-963147.html">Survey finds 73% of LGBTI+ students feel unsafe in school</a>
      </p>
      <p>However, this made school for him difficult for a number of reasons.</p>
      <p>“I often felt unsafe,” he says.</p>
      <p>After coming out as a lesbian, he was bullied, physically attacked, and harassed by other students in his school.</p>
      <p>Rumours were spread about him and his partner, and he was often called homophobic slurs. He was also confronted and targeted several times by older students.</p>
      <p>“It did escalate to the point of violence,” he says. “It was always very strategic.</p>
      <p>“It would be when I was waiting for a bus or in the locker rooms. It was always out of sight of teachers.</p>
      <blockquote>However, I was never comfortable enough to tell my teachers about what was happening as I was afraid they would out me to my parents, who weren’t accepting of me</blockquote>
      <p>“I felt like I was getting it from home and at school all because I looked ‘gay’.”</p>
      <p>The all-girls school he attended had a very strong Catholic ethos and David felt this prevented the school from fully supporting its LGBTI + students.</p>
      <p>“Because I was attending an all-girls school, I couldn’t wear pants, we all had to wear skirts,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I was very aware at that point that I didn’t feel like a woman so that was awful.</p>
      <p>“There was literally no chance I could have come out as trans while in school.</p>
      <p>“I would have been the only man at an all-girls school that was unsupportive anyway to its visibly gay and lesbian students.”</p>
      <p>Now at university, David is doing much better.</p>
      <p>“I’m in a really inclusive environment, I’ve been able to come out socially and I’ve legally changed my name. I was unable to do any of that when I was in school.</p>
      <p>“Education is great and there is a lot of work in that area but some kids do fall through the cracks.”</p>
