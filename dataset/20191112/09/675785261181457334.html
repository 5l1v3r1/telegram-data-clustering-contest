      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T09:06:39+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 09:06</time> by <a rel="author">David Coleman, Courtney Pochin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-coleman/, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>The Coca-Cola truck Christmas tour dates for this year have officially been confirmed.</p>
      <p>Each year, when you hear the jingle and see the illuminated red truck drive across your television screen, you know that holidays are most certainly coming.</p>
      <p>And if you're yet to see the jolly sight in person, then we've got some very good news for you - the full tour dates have finally been announced.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-coca-cola-company">Coca-Cola</a> has confirmed that the truck, which brings free drinks to cities across the UK, will be kicking off its trip around Britain on November 15.</p>
      <p>It will visit 19 cities all over the country including Edinburgh, Leeds, London and Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>This year, for the first time, Coca-Cola has also partnered with Crisis - the national charity for homelessness.</p>

      <p>As part of the partnership, Coca-Cola has pledged to donate 10p for each can recycled by visitors at the truck tour.</p>
      <p>Coca-Cola's iconic trucks were first created in 1995 by the W.B. Doner Agency and back then they were known as 'Christmas Caravans'.</p>
      <p>The illuminated lorries were made more enchanting with special effects by the world-famous Industrial Light and Magic, the company behind the Star Wars films.</p>
      <p>Images of Santa Claus adorned the sides of the trucks, which were created by artist Haddon Sundblom.</p>

      <p>Since then, the iconic image has undergone various changes to become the fleet of trucks you see today. </p>
      <p>Last year the truck visited 24 different locations on its tour, including Glasgow, Exeter, Newcastle, Bristol, Manchester and London.</p>

      <p>Kris Robbens, Marketing Director at Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland, said: “Christmas is all about sharing special moments with friends and loved ones and we’re looking forward to spreading the festive cheer across Great Britain again this year with our iconic Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour.</p>
      <p>“Whilst Christmas is a moment of celebration, it’s also incredibly important to remember those that need support throughout the season.</p>
      <p>"So, we’re really pleased to partner with Crisis and whilst guests at the tour enjoy a refreshing Coca-Cola zero sugar, when they recycle their can, they’ll be helping to support an amazing charity.”</p>
      <p>Jon Sparkes, Chief Executive at Crisis, added: “Everyone in our society  should have a safe and secure home.</p>
      <p>"But right now, many people are denied this basic human need. None of us should be facing the prospect of a Christmas without a home.</p>
      <p>“We know that ending homelessness is absolutely possible.</p>
      <p>"We’re delighted to be working with Coca-Cola throughout its iconic Christmas Truck Tour and receiving a donation that will help us to continue to be there for the people that need us, both at Christmas and all year round.”</p>
