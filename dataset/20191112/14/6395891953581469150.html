      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - A Berlin zoo says a giant panda whose twin cubs have captured international attention has undergone a CT scan after veterinarians discovered one of his kidneys was smaller than the other.</p>
      <p>The zoo said Tuesday that 9-year-old Jiao Qing was examined last week by experts at the city's Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research after the discrepancy was picked up on an ultrasound.</p>
      <p>The 110-kilogram (243-pound) bear underwent the scan while under anesthesia. Doctors confirmed one kidney is smaller.</p>
      <p>The panda's urine will be tested to determine whether the smaller kidney is functioning properly. Even if not, animals can live healthy lives with only one kidney.</p>
      <p>Jiao Qing is the father of twin cubs born Aug. 31. They are doing well.</p>
