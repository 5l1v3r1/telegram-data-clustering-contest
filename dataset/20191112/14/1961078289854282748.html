        <i>Good morning.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>(Here’s </i>
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline">
          <i>the sign-up</i>
        </a>
        <i>, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, we asked you what you wanted to know about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/us/california-income-inequality.html?module=inline">California’s gaping economic inequality,</a> and many of you raised questions about homelessness.</p>
      <p>Over the past few weeks, my colleague Marie Tae McDermott has tackled reader questions about whether most people experiencing homelessness are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/homeless-population.html?module=inline">from California</a> or have moved from out of state, and why the homelessness crisis seems to be so much <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/homelessness-california-population-states-comparison.html?module=inline">more dire in California than in other states</a>.</p>
      <p>Today, we want to take a moment to look forward.</p>
      <p>Many of our readers have said that homelessness in California can seem overwhelming to the point of paralysis. Still, many asked about what they can do to help.</p>
      <p>“What are specific actions I can take as a resident of the Bay Area to help homeless populations access services or resources they need?” Scout Leonard, a Berkeley resident, asked.</p>
      <p>“What can we do to help the homeless and many others to find housing and gain better living conditions?” wrote Theo Armour, of San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Experts say there is no way around it: In order to meaningfully address homelessness, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/los-angeles-homeless-population.html?module=inline">more housing</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/california-housing-crisis-local-regulations.html?module=inline">must be built</a>.</p>
      <p>

          <i>homeless populations around the state</i>
        </a>
        <b>
          <i> have been surging.]</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>But we also want to hear from people who have experienced homelessness themselves about how they think Californians can make a difference.</p>
      <p>Have you or anyone you know experienced homelessness? What helped you through that time?</p>
      <p>Were there agencies that connected you with housing? Did you get mental health care or substance abuse treatment that made it possible to find more stable work?</p>
      <p>On a more intimate level, were there any gestures by family, friends or strangers that made your day better?</p>
      <p>Above all, what do you wish more people knew about homelessness?</p>

      <h3>And Finally …</h3>
      <p>Over the weekend, I trekked to Pomona for the second day of this year’s <a href="https://tropicaliafestival.com/">Tropicália</a> Music and Taco Festival. (Not the festival where <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/drake-camp-flog-gnaw-set-boo-fans-explain?utm_campaign=complexmag&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social">Drake got booed</a> — that was <a href="https://campfloggnaw.com/">Camp Flog Gnaw</a> at Dodger Stadium.)</p>
      <p>I’ll admit I’m not exactly a fiend for festivals; we bought tickets mostly because we couldn’t pass up a chance to see Sunday’s top-billed acts — <a href="https://story.californiasunday.com/making-cuco-happen">Cuco</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/arts/music/chicano-batman-serves-latin-rock-with-60s-spice.html?module=inline">Chicano Batman</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/08/600141366/kali-uchis-finds-her-peace-in-isolation">Kali Uchis</a> — in one place.</p>
      <p>But as The <a href="https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/11/05/why-tropicalia-music-and-taco-festivals-growth-is-about-more-than-just-music/">Daily Bulletin reported</a>, the event, <a href="https://www.dailybulletin.com/2019/11/09/tropicalia-music-taco-festival-opens-third-year-with-a-multi-generational-party-in-new-venue/">in its third year</a>, has grown into something more than another big Southern California music festival: It’s a celebration of the diversity, depth and economic power of Latino culture in L.A.</p>
      <p>And as such, I figured it would be a great place to keep an ear out for songs to add to our <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/california-music-playlist-spotify.html?module=inline">California Soundtrack</a> playlist.</p>
      <p>Since several of the artists who played (including Cuco and Chicano Batman) are already represented, we’re adding to the list a bilingual track called “<a href="https://genius.com/The-marias-carino-lyrics">Cariño</a>,” by The Marías, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-the-marias-interview-20190329-story.html">once described in The Los Angeles Times as</a> “the perfect indie band for L.A. kids,” and who performed for a chilled-out, swaying crowd on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>If you went to Tropicália, though, you probably came away with playlist picks of your own. Send them, along with your name, age and where you live, to <a href="mailto:CAtoday@nytimes.com">CAtoday@nytimes.com</a>.</p>
