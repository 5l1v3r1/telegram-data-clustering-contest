        <b>The couple</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lacey Smith, from Kirkwood in Coatbridge, and Ricky Spence, of East Kilbride, both work as store managers for Next.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When they met</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lacey met Ricky via a dating site and after spending the night chatting, they met the following day under the clock at Central Station in Glasgow; they have been together for more than two-and-a-half years and inseparable ever since.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The wedding</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ceremony was conducted by a registrar at Duck Bay Marina in Loch Lomond on May 23, attended by 50 members of their family and friends, followed with an intimate reception in the same venue where their guests celebrated with them and danced the night away.</p>
