      <h1>Jedi: Fallen Order Lets You Live Out Your Darth Maul Power Fantasy</h1>

      <p><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> arrives in just a few days, and while EA is trying its best to keep things under wraps, dataminers have already uncovered a few new details about protagonist Cal Kestis' combat abilities.</p>
      <p>In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/dux0ym/jedi_fallen_order_gameplay_force_powers_and/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-datamine-uncovers-a-familiar-face-double-bladed-lightsabers-and-more/#comment-jump">PC Gamer</a>), user TheMastersSkywalker posted a video of what looks like a developer testing tool for trying out Cal's moves. As well as host of force powers and traditional lightsaber moves, that footage shows a few clips of Cal wielding his own homage to Darth Maul. It's a pretty showy new toy, letting the Jedi carve through a host of stormtroopers at once, and it seems that players will be able to switch between a single and double blade throughout combat.</p>
      <p>There aren't many positives that can be taken away from<i> The Phantom Menace</i>, but the first (chronological) Star Wars film did have one saving grace. The battle between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon Jinn and Darth Maul at the end of the film is, thankfully, one of its most memorable moments, helped in no small part by the Sith Lord and his badass double-bladed lightsaber.</p>
      <p><i>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</i> releases on Friday, November 15.</p>
