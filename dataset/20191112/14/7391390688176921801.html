      <p>The weather might be slightly miserable and the dark nights have crept in, but it's still the season of fun and festive activities. Some people are strict about not starting the Christmas period too soon, but it can’t come quick enough in my opinion. The twinkly Christmas lights and market stalls around the UK's towns and cities prove it really is the most wonderful time of the year and there’s one other iconic festive tradition you really can’t miss. So, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/coca-cola-tic-tacs-will-be-arriving-on-shelves-soon-19213619">where is the Coca-Cola truck stopping in the UK</a> in 2019? It might be November but it’s time to see the big, red festive truck in action once again.</p>
      <p>As far as Christmas adverts, Coca-Cola and its big red truck is a staple.

      <p>As well as a fun festive activity, visiting the Christmas truck also helps Coke perform an act of seasonal goodwill. This year the company pledges to donate 10p for every can thrown into one of its recycling bins during the truck's UK stop-offs. The money raised <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/">will go to homeless charity Crisis.</a> Not only will your visit help do amazing things for people who are struggling over the festive period but it also ensures that your waste is disposed of sustainably and responsibly.</p>
      <p>So it’s really not long before the Coca-Cola truck starts it’s engines and heads for a city or town near you. Not that you’d need more persuading, but Coke's commitment to donating money to Crisis and the environment means your festive tradition may help someone in need. What more excuse do you need?</p>
