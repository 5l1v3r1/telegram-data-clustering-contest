      <p>Aldi is going to delight shoppers as it's launching a mac and cheese <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/aldi-launches-halloumi-burgers-after-shoppers-went-wild-for-its-sell-out-fries/">burger</a> this week.</p>
      <p>The burger is made with a steak patty and is topped with a cheddar mac and cheese that melts over the top of the burger.</p>
      <p>Aldi has described the burger as a "flavour fusion" and revealed customers can buy the treat on November 14.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The supermarket adds: "A fusion of classic American dishes, the Specially Selected Mac &amp; Cheese Burger combines two delicious favourites to create a flavour sensation with every mouthful.</p>
      <p>"The burger is made with a Scotch steak patty, topped with a scrumptious macaroni and mature cheddar cheese melt that oozes evenly over the patty during cooking. What’s more, this heavenly dish is completely gluten free, so everyone can enjoy it!"</p>
      <p>The burgers will cost £2.49 for a 440g pack. However, once the product sells out, it won't be restocked.</p>
      <p>The burgers won't be sold online, so you'll have to pop to your local Aldi to pick a pack up.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Aldi <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/aldi-launches-halloumi-burgers-after-shoppers-went-wild-for-its-sell-out-fries/">launched a halloumi burger after shoppers raved about its sell-out cheese fries</a>.</p>
      <p>The supermarket is also bringing back its halloumi fries, which were a hit with shoppers and sold out last year.</p>

      <p>The new halloumi burgers are priced at £2.29 each in a 190g pack.</p>
      <p>Last year, the newly-launched halloumi fries sent shoppers wild and they took to Twitter to praise the delicious treats.</p>
      <p>Aldi says about the fries: "Inspired by a similar offering from popular Portuguese chicken eatery, Nando’s; Aldi’s Specially Selected Haloumi Fries are made with scrumptiously soft - and salty - halloumi cheese from Cyprus and a lightly seasoned crispy coating making them the perfect side or snack for sharing."</p>
      <p>One person said: "Halloumi fries from Aldi are the real deal."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Late to the party but the halloumi fries from Aldi are 10/10."</p>
