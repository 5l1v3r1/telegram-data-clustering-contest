The streaming service will be the exclusive home for beloved Walt Disney Studios films like <i>Fantasia </i>and <i>The Little Mermaid, </i>as well as films from brands under the Disney umbrella, like Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and National Geographic<i>. </i>You’ll also find Disney Channel shows and movies, like <i>Kim Possible </i>and <i>High School Musical</i>, <i>and </i>brand new original programming, from scripted programs to docuseries and reality shows. (And psst… one of those reality shows is executive produced by none other than queen Kristen Bell!)</p>

      <p>That's right, Lizzie is back! Hilary Duff will reprise her role as the quirky character, who's now in her 30s and living in New York City. (And yes, we'll still learn what she's <i>really </i>thinking via a pop-up cartoon version of her younger self.)</p>
      <h3>Encore!</h3>

      <p>In this reality series, former high school musical castmates are reunited as adults. But it's not just a reunion: They have to re-stage their old performances, all while navigating former crushes and grudges. If that didn't sound great enough, the show is also executive produced by Kristen Bell, a former theater kid herself.</p>
      <h3>Stargirl</h3>
      <p><i>Stargirl </i>is a YA novel by Jerry Spinelli published in 2000 about an eccentric girl who makes her mark on her new school, and a boy named Leo who befriends her. In the Disney+ movie adaptation, due in early 2020, Grace VanderWaal is playing Stargirl. VanderWaal seems like a perfect fit for the character, who sings and plays the ukulele.</p>
      <h3>Ms. Marvel</h3>
      <p>Marvel Entertainment on YouTube</p>
      <p><i>Ms. Marvel </i>is a new live-action series that centers on Marvel's first Muslim superhero, Kamala Khan, a teenager living in New Jersey. The character will be featured in movies, too.</p>
      <h3>WandaVision</h3>

      <p>This star-studded Marvel series follows Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda Maximoff (A.K.A. Scarlet Witch) and Paul Bettany's Vision as they make a home in suburbia. Something tells us theirs won't be a sleepy, ho-hum life, though. Randall Park, Kathryn Hahn, and Kat Dennings round out the cast. (Told you it was star-studded!)</p>
