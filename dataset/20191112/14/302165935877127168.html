      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — A total of 1047 civilians were arrested and charged under the National Registration Regulations 1990 from 2013 until Sept 30 this year, said Deputy Home Minister Datuk Mohd Azis Jamman</p>
      <p>He said during the period, 2,100 enforcement operations were conducted against syndicates selling or in possession of fake identity cards or other personal identification documents.</p>
      <p>“The selling and issuing of these fake personal documents were carried out by irresponsible people out to make easy profits.</p>
      <p>“As a result, full authority was given to the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) to investigate and charge them for committing the offence,” he said during question-and-answer session in the Dewan Rakyat today.</p>
      <p>He said this in reply to a question from Datuk Che Abdullah Mat Nawi (PAS-Tumpat) who inquired about statistics on fake MyKad syndicates since 2013. — Bernama</p>
