        <b>Bengaluru FC's Raphael Augusto revealed that he was more upset than shocked after fans of Chennaiyin FC ― his former club ― showcased a disrespectful banner about the Brazilian. The banner displayed during Bengaluru's 3-0 win over Chennaiyin read, “Snake into the team of Dolphins, unreal combo."</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the summer, Augusto had decided to join the defending champions after having won the ISL twice with Chennaiyin. However, this did not sit well with the Chennaiyin fans who portrayed Augusto as a snake in the banner for joining a rival club, while the dolphins jibe was intended at accusing the Bengaluru players for diving. </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old responded to the criticism in a series of tweets via his Twitter account, revealing how difficult it was for him to read the things said about him.</p>
      <p>"When my departure from <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/chennaiyin_fc">Chennaiyin FC</a> was announced, I decided to keep the truth to myself but I cannot do that anymore. When I left CFC, I decided not to talk about the fact that I was sad. It was among the hardest moments of my life and career. But I had decided that I would be quiet and that I would keep my respect for the club and its fans. But I read that I had 'decided to leave', that I was a 'snake'. Only God knows how difficult it was to read these things," Augusto wrote, reported Scroll.</p>
      <p>"But, once again, I was quiet. My brother Mailson and I decided that we would remain quiet, despite having to face all these things. But then last week a fan from my last club told me that they were planning to travel to the game with a bad banner for me. I was shocked. I couldn't believe that they would do something like this with me. Yesterday, when I was on the pitch, my teammates showed me that banner. They couldn't believe it, but I was not shocked anymore. I was just upset that something like this could happen," Augusto added.</p>
      <p>Bengaluru registered their first win of the 2019 campaign with Sunday’s win and sit on fifth in the table, while Chennaiyin, who have just one point from four matches, are down at the bottom.</p>
