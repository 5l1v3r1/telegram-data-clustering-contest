      <p>I’ve reviewed a lot of keyboards over the years, a few of them membrane, but most of them were mechanical. We don’t see many slim models come through the office, and even less so, mechanical and slim together. A lot of our readers are enthusiast gamers, and they tend to favour mechanical keyboards, which are rarely available in a slim format. Now <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/msi">MSI</a> thinks they’ve found the solution, with the slim and mechanical MSI Vigor GK50 Low-Profile gaming keyboard. Using a new custom switch type, it promises MX Blue style clicky switches in a keyboard that stands just 34mm at the thickest part, giving it a pretty slick design.</p>

      <h3>MSI Vigor GK50 Low-Profile</h3>
      <p>Their new mechanical switch features the same operation force and tactile force of a full-size switch. However, it has a much shorter pre-travel and total travel distance. This makes it feel more like a hybrid of the MX Speed and MX Blue switches while having the low resistance you would find on an MX Red. That means it’s light, ultra-fast, and still has that affirmative click that gamers love so much.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Of course, a new switch isn’t the only thing MSI is bringing into this battle. The Vigor GK50 comes equipped with a brushed metal finish top panel for added strength and style. Plus with full per-key RGB lighting, custom-designed keycaps, a braided USB cable and more, it’s well equipped to compete with any other high-end gaming keyboard.</p>

      <h3>A Closer Look &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>First impressions of the new GK50 are very good indeed. The top plate of the keyboard is a thick layer of metal with a brushed finish. Of course, it’s not the first high-end keyboard to do that, but it’s always a big hit with PC gamers. It looks great, it adds strength and that’s good enough for me.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-3-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>MSI has done a nice job keeping the keyboard slim and I’m loving the new low-profile look. However, they’ve been careful with the dimensions elsewhere too, such as the ultra-slim bezels on the sides of the keyboard.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-4-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One of the first things you notice about this keyboard isn’t how slim it is, it’s those custom keycaps. The corners are cut and angled to give them a really slick and original style. I love the way the light catches the corners, they’re unlike anything else on the market right now. Keep in mind, however, that these are new switches and custom slim caps, so you won’t be able to use your own caps on it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-5-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While the keyboard can be configured through the optional software, it’s not needed for everything. You can use the Dragon key on the keyboard to tinker with loads of built-in customisation options.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-6-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the top row, you’ll find some multimedia controls. These are perfect for skipping through tracks while you’re working and gaming.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-7-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You’ll find some volume controls further along too should you need them. I prefer dedicated buttons, but given the slim nature of the keyboard, these will do just fine.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-8-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You can control virtually every aspect of the RGB lighting directly on the keyboard too. You can use the “insert” key to cycle through profiles. These range from RGB rainbows, to custom gaming colour coded layouts.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-9-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Then you can tinker with the brights and colour here. Seriously, that’s an awful lot of RGB control built-in. Of course, if you love RGB, that’s a good thing. However, if you’re like me, you’ll set it to a single colour and likely leave it alone forever, ha. Either way, it’s nice to have options.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-10-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Some of the little details are what makes this keyboard truly shine. The metalwork does look stunning, and I love the subtle MSI dragon logo they’ve painted onto it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-11-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The keyboard doesn’t come bundled with a wrist rest. However, because it sits so low anyway, it doesn’t really need one. It does have a slight wedge shape to it, but without the feel deployed, the profile is pretty flat.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-12-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The keyboard may be slim, but it has a decent weight to it, so it doesn’t rattle and slide around. Plus, there are five big rubber grips on the bottom, so even if you’re smashing your fists into the keyboard to rage type, it shouldn’t slide around.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-14-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The kickstands are a good size too, should you need a little more angle. Plus, they have their own rubber grips, so you don’t lose too much traction when they’re deployed.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-15-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The real star of the show, however, is the new switches. They’re a custom design from Kailh. It’s by far one of the best switches they’ve ever made too. It uses a wider body design that helps keep it balanced, while also providing a much wider mount for the keycap. The end result is a switch that can handle a slim cap without any annoying keycap wobble.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-13-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Powered up, the keyboard sparks to life with a rainbow of colour. The brightness of the LEDs is pretty decent, with plenty of vibrancy. Even in my well-lit office, it’s doing a fine job. However, you can turn them down or turn them off if you so desire.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-16-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s a bunch of built-in profiles too. You can cycle through an array of nauseating reactions and effects, not that they have much practical use. Of course, my teen son loves those modes, but not 35-year-old me.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-17-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The real perk is that it has full per-key customisation though. You can dial in really cool looking templates like this. They’re ideal for gaming and showing you where your macro keys are.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-18-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I love that even the indicator lights are RGB too, and they’re hidden in a clear plastic frame at the top of the keyboard; it’s the little details that matter.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-21-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Best of all though, the lighting does look fantastic, and we wouldn’t expect anything less from MSI. The switches are pretty to look at, sure, but they’re also fantastic to type on. Now, the keyboard is on the noisy side, but if you’re coming from an MX Blue or any other kind of clicky mechanical switch, they’re no louder than any other. It’s a matter of personal taste really.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-19-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>From the perspective of the person sitting next to me, clicky switches are annoying as hell. However, from a typing perspective, there’s something oh-so-satisfying about the clickety-clack of them, as well as the affirmative tactile response they give.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MSI-Vigor-GK50-Low-Profile-Gaming-Keyboard-Review-20-880x428.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The light switches are super fast thanks to their short travel, which also gives them a fast return rate. If you need to fire off rapid commands, you can smash away at them with amazing speed; really handy for those MOBA games!</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>The MSI Vigor GK50 Low-Profile Gaming Keyboard is available now. However, while many flagship mechanical keyboards cost well over £100, this one is priced much more reasonably. At just £89.99, even the price is slim. Of course, that’s still not “cheap” but it’s a very well made and very well equipped keyboard, so you get what you pay for.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>MSI has a strong reputation for delivering fantastic gaming hardware. From their <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/msi-meg-z390-godlike-motherboard-review/">amazing motherboards</a> to their <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/msi-optix-mpg27cq-whqd-144hz-curved-monitor-review/">kick-ass gaming monitors</a>. Of course, their peripherals too. The new Vigor GK50 doesn’t offer anything particularly innovative, I mean, we’ve seen slim keyboards before. However, the introduction of the latest Kailh switches does give it a bit of an edge.</p>
      <h3>Low-Profile</h3>
      <p>Speed and performance is everything when it comes to gaming. I know that having good peripherals doesn’t make you a pro overnight. However, the GK50 does have a few features that can give you the edge in competition. With a shorter travel distance, the switches are much faster to strike than most mechanical switches. That means less time from moving your finger to getting the action on the screen. Milliseconds can make the difference in competitive gaming!</p>
      <h3>Mechanical</h3>
      <p>There aren’t many options out there from slim mechanical keyboards, so it’s certainly nice to have another option on the market. I’d love to see them make a TKL version of this too; slim and compact, it would be awesome for the travelling LAN gamers out there.</p>
      <p>Of course, despite the smaller switch and slimmer design, they’ve still crammed in all their latest RGB tech too. Having per-key lighting is great for setting up gaming profiles. Of course, it’s good for throwing up some rainbow colours to please your inner child too.</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>The stylish brushed metal finish, those fantastic custom shaped keycaps, and per-key RGB lighting. The MSI GK50 Low Profile is certainly ticking all the right boxes. It’s well made, it’s great for gaming, and the price is competitive too. What’s not to love!</p>
