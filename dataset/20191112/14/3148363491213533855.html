      <h1>Pete Buttigieg Struggles to Shed 'Old Normal' Without Ditching Obama</h1>
      <h2>Pete Buttigieg wants to dismiss the “old normal” of politics and run as a change candidate, but the 37-year-old mayor is struggling to avoid including former President Barack Obama in that equation.</h2>

      <p>The campaign mobilized against <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Evan Halper for mistakenly quoting Buttigig as referring to the “failures of the Obama era” on the campaign trail, a quote weaponized by his political rivals to damage his campaign.</p>
      <p>The snafu prompted Buttigieg to recommit his support for the former president on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“My appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>But Buttigieg’s line about the “failures of the old normal” include former President Obama, which he reminds political audiences, led to the Trump presidency.</p>
      <p>The South Bend mayor also spoke about Obama during a conversation with journalist John Heilemann about his campaign.</p>
      <p>“I also don’t believe we can go back, I don’t think there’s going back to Obama, I don’t think there’s going back to Clinton,” he said in a clip posted by Mediaite’s Tommy Christopher on Twitter.</p>

      <p>In November, Buttigieg even claimed he had more executive experience than Obama did in 2007 when he ran for president.</p>
      <p>“He had more national exposure sooner than I did. But then I have the benefit of executive experience. So I guess we’re just different,” he told the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/pete-buttigieg-2020-next-phase/601237/"><i>Atlantic.</i></a></p>
      <p>Since announcing his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has tried to emphasize the contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden (and current senators) by arguing to voters they are part of a “normal” political system that produced President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“We are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive,” Buttigieg <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/07/30/buttigieg_trump_got_within_cheating_distance_of_presidency.html">said</a> in the first night of the Democrat presidential primary debates in July. “We’ve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.”</p>
      <p>The effort to appear “different” was part of Obama’s emphasis in the 2007 Democrat presidential primary until his campaign finally caught fire in Iowa and won him the state.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg even compared his improbable run for president to Obama’s campaign for president, during a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/01/pete-buttigieg-we-will-not-recognize-america-if-donald-trump-is-re-elected-in-2020/">speech</a> at the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?465865-1/democratic-presidential-candidates-speak-iowa-party-dinner&amp;live&amp;vod">Liberty and Justice Celebration dinner</a> in Iowa.</p>
      <p>“The first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate – a young man with a funny name,” he said. “We knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now.”</p>
      <p>Commentators have <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwagner/status/1190431815099715584">observed</a> that Buttigieg is clearly a student of Obama’s upset run against failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, by echoing the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pete-buttigieg-pitches-barack-obama-iowa-bus-tour-2020-democratic-presidential-primary_n_5dc44e2be4b0d8eb3c91c9f5">same rhetoric</a> and offering a break from the past.</p>
      <p>While Buttigieg wants to break from candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, he does not want to break from the Obama legacy that he hopes to inherit. It’s a strange paradox of running against the establishment while sounding like the establishment — at least the politics that Obama established in 2007.</p>
