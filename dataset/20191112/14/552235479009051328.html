      <h1>Sex crimes up 17% per cent in North Ayrshire</h1>
      <h2>The figures were presented at the North Ayrshire Council police and fire and rescue committee last week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:00:17+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irvine Herald, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/irvine-herald/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>The number of sex crimes continues to rise in North Ayrshire, with a 17 per cent recent increase.</p>
      <p>A total of 196 sexual crimes were recorded by police between April 1 to September 30. </p>
      <p>The figures were presented at the North Ayrshire Council police and fire and rescue committee last week. </p>
      <p>A police report said: “The increasing trend around sexual crime continues and is anticipated.</p>
      <p>“The use of online platforms to communicate indecently continues and increased reporting of non-recent crimes remains.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Overall crime levels have increased by nearly four per cent between April and September, compared to the same time last year.  There were 5795  crimes during that period. Housebreaking offences plunged by nearly 17 per cent over those months to 146 cases.</p>
      <p>Domestic abuse cases saw a five per cent rise, with more victims reporting crimes from the past.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report said: “The number of domestic abuse crimes has increased compared to last year, which is due to a significant increase in non-recent crimes being reported.</p>
      <p>“It is positive to see complainers coming forward to report matters which have often occurred years ago.”</p>
      <p>Overall dishonesty was up by six per cent and overall violent crime was up five per cent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report added: “Serious violent crime has reduced this year with fewer serious assaults and robberies.</p>
      <p>“The total number of common assaults have increased, which includes assaults on police officers and other emergency workers.”</p>
      <p>It warned: “This year’s increase in overall dishonesty crimes continues to be evident, with issues around shoplifting and fraud accounting for most of the increase. Overall housebreaking remains significantly <br/>down.”</p>
      <p>Sixty-one people were hurt in road smashes between April and September, which was down by 42 per cent.</p>
