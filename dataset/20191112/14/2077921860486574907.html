      <h1>Disney+ Faces Technical Difficulties on Launch Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:58:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p>Highly anticipated streaming service Disney+ launched earlier today, and the platform’s early sailing has not been smooth.</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/12/disney-plus-crashes-streaming-service/">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> reports, subscribers were in an uproar Tuesday as “[they] complained of a variety of problems, from logging in, to setting up their profiles, to certain content being absent from the platform, to shows not loading, to long wait times for customer service.” A significant amount of users were unable to access the app and had been unable to do so since the early hours of the launch.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, 73% of reported problems involve the actual streaming of video, per <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/disney-plus/">DownDetector.com</a> (via <i>EW</i>), with over 8,000 users reporting issues as of 9 a.m. on Tuesday morning. While some luckier users managed to get the service up and running, most took to social media to berate Disney for the lack of foresight and apparent lack of customer support, getting the hashtag #disneyplusfail trending.</p>

      <p>According to Disney+’s Twitter, they simply didn’t expect the demand for the service and are “working quickly to resolve any current issues.”</p>

      <p>To make the situation a little more awkward for Disney, subscribers based in Puerto Rico are blasting the service for being unavailable despite Disney’s original statement that it would launch on Nov. 12, as well, being shown the following message: “Disney+ is only available in certain regions. Depending on where you are located, you may not be able to access Disney+.”</p>
