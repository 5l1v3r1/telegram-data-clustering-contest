        <b>Former Barcelona and Manchester United star Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available for free with his contract at LA Galaxy expiring in December but the 38-year-old prefers a move to Bologna. The Swede has been heavily linked with a move to the Serie A and the La Liga but no move has materialized as of yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another twist in the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/zlatan_ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a> saga as the Daily Mail has reported that Bologna have emerged as the shock favourites to sign the enigmatic Swede. The 38-year-old has been linked with a move to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/ac_milan">AC Milan</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/napoli">Napoli</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/atletico_madrid">Atletico Madrid</a> and even <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> but the Daily Mail has revealed that the Serie A’s 15th place side is Ibrahimovic’s top destination.</p>
      <p>Corriere Dello Sport has further admitted that while Napoli was said to be high on his shortlist, Bologna have now taken over with Sinisa Mihajlovic playing a large part. The Bologna boss and the former Ajax prodigy are reportedly said to be very close which is one of the reasons that the Mail has reported has seen the Il Rossoblu shoot to the top of the list with the other being the club struggling to score goals.</p>
      <p>This comes just months after Zlatan announced that he was not done with football yet, after a two-year spell in the US. Reports expected the 38-year-old to retire at the end of his contract but a video released by the superstar announced that he was looking for a new move and Spain seemed to be his top destination. That has clearly changed with Europe’s top sides in consideration over a move for Swedish superstar.</p>
