      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Ciudadanos party said on Tuesday it will not back a preliminary government coalition deal between the Socialists (PSOE) and the leftist Unidas Podemos.</p>
      <p>It instead called for a grand coalition deal with PSOE and the conservative People’s Party (PP).</p>
      <p>“We appeal to the responsibility of PSOE and PP to reach a moderate and constitutionalist agreement with Cs (Ciudadanos) based on state deals that are good for our country”, the party said in a statement.</p>
