      <p>Months after the first trailer for <i>Sonic the Hedgehog </i>came out and brought the world the frightening prospect of a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/why-does-sonic-the-hedgehog-have-human-teeth.html">blue hedgehog with human teeth</a>, Sonic’s back, and now significantly less terrifying. The movie, which was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/sonic-is-getting-a-makeover-so-we-can-all-sleep-again.html">pushed back to February</a> for some much-needed CGI improvements, has Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz) teleport from his own planet to ours, causing much chaos along the way. He becomes BFFs with a local sheriff (James Marsden, <i>certified </i>cute), while Dr. Robotnik (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/jim-carrey-was-warned-against-getting-political-with-his-art.html">Jim Carrey</a>) chases after the speedy blue mammal in order to achieve some form of world domination. Now that the newer, tanner, less toothy version of Sonic is out in the world, someone please go back to the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/detective-pikachu-director-of-photography-critiques-sonic.html"><i>Detective Pikachu</i> team</a> and see if they still want to start some drama about this.</p>
