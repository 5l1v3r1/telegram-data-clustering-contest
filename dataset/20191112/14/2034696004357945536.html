        <b>It might not be the end...</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/slayer">Slayer’s</a> manager has hinted that the band might continue after their current ‘farewell tour’.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slayer-announce-final-dates-of-farewell-tour-2526467#7G3pbz32rEDi7To9.99">the thrash metal legends announced the final dates of their extensive supposed farewell tour, which is currently heading across the US. </a></p>
      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/2019/11/massachusetts-born-slayer-manager-finds-end-bittersweet.html"><i>MassLive</i></a>, the band’s manager Rick Sales says: “The band has always had a lot of integrity and there are a couple things that go on.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I totally get that they made a decision to stop touring. That doesn’t mean the end of the band. It’s just the end of touring. I always thought of it as, ‘You go out on top.’ They made that decision. They’re not milking it. From that standpoint, I get it and they made the right choice.”</p>

      <p>Slayer live</p>
      <p>Slayer <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slayer-announce-new-film-relentless-killogy-2548062#7ge2huhYv2DLxzEs.99">announced details of a new live film with an accompanying album on the way back in September. </a></p>
      <p>‘Slayer: The Repentless Killogy’ motion picture and companion LP/CD, ‘The Repentless Killogy, Live At The Forum in Inglewood, CA’ arrived earlier this month (November 8).</p>
      <p>The narrative short film was paired with Slayer’s entire performance of its August 5, 2017 concert at the Los Angeles Forum.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/features/slayer-film-the-repentless-killology-is-vulgar-gruesome-and-problematic-just-like-the-band-2565599#5BtUrJIEquuk0yzQ.99">Writing about the live film, <i>NME</i>‘s James McMahon said:</a> “You watch the concert footage at the end of the movie segment of the film and remember that, in full flight, there isn’t a single act on earth who wail like Slayer do.</p>
      <p>“If <i>The Repentless Killology </i>really does mark the end for Slayer, the world without them is undoubtedly a nicer place, but also so much more boring.”</p>
