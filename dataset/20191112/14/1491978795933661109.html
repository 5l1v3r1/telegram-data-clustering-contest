        <i>TV Licensing reveals surprising figures 50 years after advent of colour on BBC One</i>
      </p>
      <p>More than 6,000 homes across the UK still have black and white television licences, half a century after the advent of colour on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc">BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the latest figures published by TV Licensing, London leads the way with 1,311 black and white permits, followed by Birmingham with 323 and Manchester with 245.</p>
      <p>Published on the 50th anniversary of colour television on BBC One, the figures show there were 6,586 black and white licences at the end of September this year – a fall of 575 from September 2018 and down from 212,000 at the turn of the millennium.</p>
      <p>Paul Cooper, a TV Licensing spokesman, said: “When BBC One launched its colour TV service in November 1969, there were only three channels available. Fast-forward to 2019, and more than half (53%) of TV households have in some way an internet connection to their TV and access to hundreds of channels.</p>
      <p>“Whilst only accounting for a very small proportion, it’s interesting to know that some households still like to watch their favourite shows on a black and white telly.”</p>
      <p>Black and white televisions remain popular with collectors, with vintage and portable TV sets regularly traded online. The black and white annual licence costs £52 – one-third of the £154.50 for colour.</p>
