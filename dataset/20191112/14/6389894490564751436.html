      <p>Tesco has removed an advert featuring an image of Spice Girls star Mel B after the singer complained about its use.</p>
      <p>The advert for Tesco’s new Clubcard Plus featured a picture of Scary Spice with the words “Stop right now. You get 10 per cent off two big shops a month for £7.99”, a play on the girl band’s hit single Stop. </p>

      <p>Mel B – also known as Melanie Brown – used social media to ask Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis to contact her over the use of the image. </p>
      <p>She wrote on Instagram, alongside a picture of the advert at a bus stop: “Can the CEO of Tesco Dave Lewis please contact me urgently. Thank you.” </p>

      <p>Tesco bought the image through Getty and had signed a contract with Getty and Mel B’s agent, authorising the use of the photograph. </p>
      <p>A Tesco spokesperson said: “Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign.</p>
      <p>“We had authorisation to use this image, but we’re sorry Mel B is unhappy and so we’ve stopped using it where possible.”</p>

      <p>The photo, taken at the 1997 Brit Awards, was used as part of the advertising campaign for Tesco’s new subscription loyalty card Clubcard Plus, which it launched earlier this month. </p>
      <p>The marketing campaign also features cultural references such as Morecombe and Wise, and scenes from Casablanca. </p>
