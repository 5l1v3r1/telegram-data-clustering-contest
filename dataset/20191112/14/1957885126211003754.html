      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog's original movie design was first revealed last December - and everything felt wrong. First we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-10-sonics-looking-slightly-terrifying-in-first-image-for-next-years-movie">hedgehog's silhouette</a>, then his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-15-that-nightmarish-sonic-movie-poster-is-real">nightmarish legs</a>. Fans were not happy.</p>
      <p>In March this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-03-05-even-sonics-creator-isnt-happy-with-the-leaked-live-action-design">Sonic's creator chipped in</a>. "Is this a Sonic movie?" Yuji Naka tweeted.</p>
      <p>In May, we saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-30-the-first-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer-is-even-worse-than-you-expected">Sonic the Hedgehog film's first teaser trailer</a> - a montage of X-Men's dead-eyed James Marsden, the now-fully-revealed CGI Sonic monstrosity and Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik, all of which lead to a hilarious joke about child abduction. Criticism was swift and damning.</p>
      <p>"The message is loud and clear..." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-02-sonic-movie-producer-says-studio-hears-criticism-and-character-redesign-is-going-to-happen">Sonic's movie director Jeff Fowler admitted</a> a few days later, promising changes would be made. The film's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-24-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">delay from this month to February 2020</a> was announced shortly after.</p>
      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog will launch on Valentine's Day - 14th February - 2020.</p>
