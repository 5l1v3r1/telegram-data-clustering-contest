      <p>A police officer shot a masked protester in an incident shown live on Facebook and a man was set on fire on Monday during one of the most violent days of clashes in Hong Kong since pro-democracy unrest erupted more than five months ago.</p>
      <p>Protesters, who had already begun a city-wide day of action aimed at paralysing the international financial hub, reacted to the morning shooting by rampaging through train stations, barricading streets and vandalising shops throughout the day.</p>

      <p>A masked assailant also doused a man with a flammable liquid and set him ablaze during an argument, with the horrifying scene captured on mobile phones and also posted online.</p>
      <p>Police said a protester carried out that attack and accused black-clad "rioters" of an array of other violent acts, including throwing a petrol bomb inside a train carriage.</p>
      <p>"Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong," police spokesperson John Tse said at a press conference in which he showed the video of the man being set alight, as well as a fire inside a train.</p>

      <p>At the end of the business day, Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam held a press conference to denounce the violence and vow it would not lead to any government concessions.</p>
      <p>"I am making this statement clear and loud here, that will not happen," Lam said.</p>
      <p>The footage of the shooting - broadcast live on Facebook by a bystander - showed a police officer drawing a pistol as he tried to detain a masked person at a junction that had been blocked by protesters.</p>
      <p>Another unarmed masked protester then approached the officer and was shot, quickly falling to the ground.</p>
      <p>Authorities said he was in critical condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>Police chiefs defended the officer drawing his weapon and firing as a legitimate use of force given his fears for his safety.</p>
      <p>But protesters, who for months have accused police of using excessive force and demanded an independent inquiry into their actions, were incensed.</p>
      <p>"I don't understand why police have to use that kind of brutality to hurt innocent people... it's just out of control," a 22-year-old IT worker, who gave her surname as Chan, told AFP as she joined angry crowds to protest in the area of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Monday's shooting was the third time protesters had been hit by live rounds fired by police. None of the shootings have resulted in deaths.</p>
      <p>Lam said the man set on fire was in a critical condition. She described that attack as "totally inhumane".</p>
      <p>Protesters ignored her pleas for calm with further rallies in multiple locations across the city on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Online forums used by the largely anonymous and leaderless movement also carried messages vowing another day of chaos on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has endured 24 straight weeks of increasingly violent rallies aimed at securing greater democratic freedoms from China, which has ruled the city under a "one country, two systems" framework since its handover from the British in 1997.</p>
