      <p>A MAN was robbed at knifepoint at a railway station in Belfast.</p>
      <p>The victim was approached by an unknown man at Yorkgate station who wielded a small flick-type knife and demanded money.</p>
      <p>A struggle followed and the assailant made off with the man's mobile phone and suitcase.</p>
      <p>The suitcase was found just a few streets away. It appeared an attempt was made to set it on fire, but the contents were undamaged.</p>
      <p>The victim sustained some small cuts to his hand in his attempt to hold onto his mobile, but he did not need medical attention.</p>
      <p>The robbery happened on Monday night and was reported to police just after 11pm.</p>
      <p>Inspector Paul Noble said the victim had "understandably been left shaken by a terrifying ordeal, which could have had grave consequences".</p>
      <p>The suspect was described as wearing a grey, hooded top.</p>
      <p>Police urged anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity to phone them on 101, quoting reference number 1995 of 11/11/19, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
