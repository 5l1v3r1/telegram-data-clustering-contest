      <p>One of just eight customer cars built in late 1923. This very early Aston Martin was competing against two Bugattis and two other Aston Martins – one of which had been entered by the company’s founder, Lionel Martin, who won the trophy on the day.</p>
      <p>This four cylinder 1,486 cc side-valve engined 1923 long-chassis ‘Cloverleaf’-bodied tourer came second at the event, and remains one of only two Bamford and Martin-built Aston Martins from that meeting in 1924 still in existence today.</p>

      <p>To mark the anniversary of its first competitive outing, ‘Cloverleaf’ has returned to Aston Hill to be driven by Aston Martin Racing ace and three-time Le Mans class winner Darren Turner, followed closely by a Bugatti, to recreate as accurately as possible the events of almost a century ago.</p>
      <p>The car was painstakingly prepared for its hill climb return by renowned specialists Ecurie Bertelli, the Midlands-based firm which currently manages the vehicle on behalf of its owner.</p>
      <p>Aston Hill was the venue for many defining moments in the early years of the brand, with Lionel Martin driving his home-tuned Singer specials and later cars of his own design up the hill, cementing a lasting ethos of sporting performance for the great British brand.</p>

      <p>Built in late 1923, chassis 1926 is one of the oldest road-going Aston Martins still in existence and had an open-body design known as a Cloverleaf, because the two front seats and one rear seat behind created the shape of a three-leaf clover.</p>
      <p>Built at Aston Martin’s second home, 53 Abingdon Road, Kensington, this car, now known affectionately simply as ‘Cloverleaf’, is a stunning example of the very earliest Aston Martins and continued in active competition until the late 1960s.</p>
      <p>Featuring front wheel brakes, a rare feature in the 1920s, and a top speed guaranteed to be in excess of 72 mph, Cloverleaf’s 38 bhp power peak is channelled to the driven wheels via a four-speed gearbox.</p>
      <blockquote>Paul Spires, president of Aston Martin Works, said of the anniversary run: “There are not many brands that are fortunate enough to have as many iconic milestones as Aston Martin. Cloverleaf is a perfect example of how, even from the brand’s inauguration, we were racing and competing at the highest level in terms of design and innovation.”</blockquote>
      <p>The iconic Aston Martin brand fuses the latest technology, exceptional hand craftsmanship and timeless design to produce models including the Vantage, DB11, Rapide AMR and DBS Superleggera.</p>
      <p>The Lagonda brand will relaunch in 2021 as the world’s first luxury electric vehicle company.</p>
      <p>Based in Gaydon, England, Aston Martin Lagonda designs, creates and exports cars which are sold in 53 countries around the world.</p>

      <p>Lagonda was founded in 1899 and Aston Martin in 1913. The two brands came together in 1947 when both were purchased by the late Sir David Brown.</p>
      <p>Under the leadership of Dr Andy Palmer and a new management team, the group launched its Second Century Plan in 2015 to deliver sustainable long-term growth.</p>
      <p>The plan is underpinned by the introduction of seven new models including the DB11, new Vantage, DBS Superleggera and an SUV, as well as the development of a new manufacturing centre in St Athan, Wales.</p>
