      <h1>Bangladesh: Many dead in train collision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:57:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:57</time> by <a rel="author">DW</a></address>
      <p>Two trains have collided in eastern Bangladesh, leaving at least 15 dead and injuring dozens. Emergency personnel were on the scene to rescue passengers who were trapped in wreckage.</p>
      <p>"So far, 15 bodies have been recovered," district official Hayat Ud Dowlah Khan said, warning that the death toll would likely rise.</p>
      <p>"More than 40 injured people have been admitted in hospitals," he said.</p>
      <p>"When I came out of the train, I saw dead bodies without heads, without legs, without hands," Mohammad Moslem, 50, who was among the</p>
      <p>passengers told Reuters. "We were so close to death, but Allah saved us," he added.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed shock and sorrow at the injuries and loss of lives, urging officials and the public to provide support for the victims.</p>

        <b>Both trains on same track</b>
      </p>
      <p>The accident took place at around 3 a.m. local time (9 p.m. UTC) in Brahmanbaria, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of the capital, Dhaka, when a train headed for the capital crashed into another bound for the southern city of Chittagong, crumpling three compartments.</p>
      <p>Most passengers were asleep when the crash occurred.</p>
      <p>It remained unclear what caused the two trains to run on the same track. Authorities have launched a formal investigation.</p>
      <p>"One of the trains might have broken the signal, leading to the tragedy," Shayamal Kanti Das, a police official, told reporters.</p>
      <p>Firefighters, police, border guards and army officials were all at the scene to assist with the rescue operation.</p>
      <p>Train accidents are a frequent occurrence in Bangladesh. Unsupervised railway crossings, poor signaling and poor track conditions have been some of the causes of previous accidents.</p>
