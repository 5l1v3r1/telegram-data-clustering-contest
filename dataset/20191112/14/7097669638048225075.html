      <h1>Allegiant adding five new nonstop routes, three to Nashville, two to Florida</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:02:37+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/travel/" target="_blank">Dawn Gilbertson, USA TODAY</a></address>
      <p>Allegiant Air is adding five new nonstop routes in February: three to Nashville and two to Florida.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Las Vegas-based discount carrier, which offers bargain fares but charges extra for everything else – including advance seat assignments, carry on bags and soft drinks, said the new seasonal routes are aimed at spring break and summer vacationers.</p>
      <p>Allegiant doesn't offer daily service on its routes like major airlines, generally offering flights one, two or three times a week depending on the route and demand. The new routes, which will all be offered twice a week:</p>
      <h3>Nashville International Airport, to and from:</h3>
      <p><b>Des Moines, Iowa: </b>Flights begin Feb. 13 with one-way introductory fares starting at $55.</p>
      <p><b>Gulfport, Mississippi: </b>Flights begin Feb. 15 with one-way fares starting at $55.</p>
      <p><b>Appleton, Wisconsin:</b> Flights begin Feb. 14, with one-way fares starting at $55.</p>
      <h3>Punta Gorda (Florida) Airport, to and from:</h3>
      <p><b>Richmond, Virginia:</b> Flights begin Feb. 13 with one-way fares starting at $65.</p>
      <h3>Sarasota-Bradenton (Florida) International Airport to and from:</h3>
      <p><b>Allentown, Pennsylvania: </b> Flights begin Feb. 13 with one-way fares starting at $65.</p>
      <p>The fine print: The introductory fares, which are limited, must be purchased on Allegiant's website, by Wednesday, Nov. 13 for travel through Aug. 15.</p>
