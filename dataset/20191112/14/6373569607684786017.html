      <h1>Mural warning of dodgy money lenders is unveiled in Plymouth city centre</h1>
      <h2>Illegal money lenders, often known as loan sharks, prey on people in dire need but help is available</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T14:06:04+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Eve</a></address>
      <p>A huge mural to highlight the evils of loan sharks has been unveiled in the city centre - and was paid for out of loan sharks' ill-gotten gains.</p>
      <p>The England Illegal Money Lending Team used the proceeds of criminal money seized by convicted loan sharks to pay for the mural which was created over the weekend by local graffiti artist Jon Lilly and artist Harriet Russell.</p>
      <p>Jon's handiwork can also be seen in other parts of the city, including the wonderful Elburton underpass where he worked with children from Elburton Primary School <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/coolest-subway-plymouth-1657005">to create a stunning 'under the sea' themed mural.</a></p>
      <p>The mural was unveiled by the Deputy Lord Mayor on Sunday and creates a lasting legacy in Plymouth to discourage people from using loan sharks, who charge obscenely high interest rates, and instead urge them to use safer borrowing methods, such as Credit Unions.</p>

      <p>The mural also features the 24-hour telephone number to report loan sharks and Citizens Advice Plymouth contact details for debt and budgeting advice.</p>
      <p>Tony Quigley, head of the Illegal Money Lending Team said: "Loan sharks spell misery for borrowers, often targeting people at times in their lives when they’re particularly vulnerable, and we are pleased to be working with Citizens Advice Plymouth in cracking down on these ruthless criminals.</p>

      <p>"The mural will be a permanent fixture on the North Cross Subway and will serve as a constant reminder of the dangers of borrowing from unauthorised money lenders.  It will also signpost residents in financial difficulties to debt support services.</p>
      <p>Jaroslava Hurtikova, research and campaigns officer at Citizens Advice in Plymouth said: "Citizens Advice Plymouth were delighted to be the only successful applicant in the South West to the Illegal Money Lending team and the Proceeds of Crime fund. Their work around the UK in raising awareness and tackling illegal money lending is well documented and we are proud to continue this in here in Plymouth.</p>

      <p>"We are only too aware of the adverse consequences for people who work, live and study in Plymouth of getting into debt with illegal money lenders. We welcomed a member of the Illegal Money lending team whose testimony to our advisors around victim impact and previous cases was harrowing."</p>
