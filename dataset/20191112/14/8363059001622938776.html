      <h1>Amazon Fire TV Update Lets You Create Your Own Echo Based Home Theatre System</h1>

      <p>With the latest update, you can hook up compatible Echo devices with your Fire TV and turn your living room into a home theatre.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://uk.amazonforum.com/forums/devices/fire-tv/528806-introducing-alexa-home-theatre-system">firmware update</a> lets you connect up to two Echo devices for 1.0 and 2.0 configurations, and if you have an Echo Sub to throw into the mix, 1.1 and 2.1 configurations too.</p>
      <p>If that sounds like a great way to upgrade your home theatre system without having to invest in a dedicated setup for the minute, make sure you download the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202168870">latest version of the Alexa app</a>, and navigate to the Home Cinema screen from the “Set Up Audio System” option, and set it all up from there.</p>
