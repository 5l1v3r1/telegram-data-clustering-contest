      <h1>Measures to cut childhood obesity by 50% supported by public - survey</h1>

      <p>Measures to cut childhood obesity by 50%, including a blanket ban on junk food marketing to children and a levy on sweets, are widely supported by the public, a new survey suggests.</p>
      <p>There is also “overwhelming” public support for an end to promotions encouraging the overconsumption of unhealthy food and drinks like buy-one-get-one-free offers, the study by the Irish Heart Foundation found.</p>
      <p>This comes as the national charity launches a plan seeking to halve the childhood obesity rate in the next decade.</p>
      <p>“This manifesto has the potential to be a game-changer if people take it at face value,” said Professor Donal O’Shea, the HSE clinical lead on obesity.</p>
      <blockquote>It is the truth, simply spoken and crucially has been developed in cooperation with young people who it is ultimately for.</blockquote>
      <p>Polling carried out by the Irish Heart Foundation found that 71% of the public support a band on the promotion of unhealthy food and drinks to children.</p>
      <p>A further 64% support extended the sugar-sweetened drinks tax to other products with a high sugar content.</p>
      <p>This support rose to 82% if the proceeds of such a tax are spent on subsidies to make healthy food like fruit and veg cheaper.</p>
      <p>Almost 90% of those polled support rules to make manufacturers reduce excessive levels of fat, sugar and salt in products popular with children.</p>
      <p>The plan also calls for greater political priority for action on tackling childhood obesity, and for the immediate removal of food industry representatives from national health policy formation.</p>
      <p>The Irish Heart Foundation is also calling for the introduction of legislation prohibiting all forms of unhealthy food marketing to children online, as well as a 9pm watershed for all food and beverage advertising.</p>
