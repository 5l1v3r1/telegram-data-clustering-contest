      <p>An author of the original firewall letter said a fair deal panel appointed by Premier Jason Kenney is better late than never, nearly 20 years after a group of conservative heavyweights drafted a plan to strengthen Alberta’s autonomy.</p>
      <p>Though the policies being addressed by the panel are the same as they were in January 2001, when the firewall letter was published in the National Post, there’s more appetite for change now because the province is struggling and frustration with the federal government is rising, according to Ted Morton, executive fellow at the School of Public Policy.</p>
      <p>At the time of Ralph Klein’s government 18 years ago, the province was prospering, so people accepted the status quo.</p>
      <p>“There’s a growing number of Albertans who find the status quo increasingly unacceptable but they don’t want to go as far as separation or independence, so this agenda represents a number of options that are in between the two extremes,” Morton said Monday. “These are positive reforms that would strengthen Alberta’s position and give the Kenney government leverage to negotiate reforms at the federal level.”</p>
      <p>At a speech in Red Deer on Saturday, Kenney said the panel would answer questions including whether Alberta should pull out of the Canada Pension Plan and form its own plan; whether it should create a provincial police force instead of relying on the RCMP for rural policing; and whether it should opt out of some cost-sharing programs with the federal government.</p>
      <p>Kenney’s list is a near carbon copy of the firewall letter signed by Morton, Stephen Harper and other conservatives in 2001, according to Mount Royal University political science professor Duane Bratt.</p>
      <p>“The policies are the same. The difference is that this has the full weight of the provincial government behind it, whereas Klein largely resisted it. It’s one thing to, a couple years from now, fill a backbench MLA committee, it’s another to appoint a high-profile person like Preston Manning to give a big address like Kenney did,” said Bratt.</p>
      <p>The panel wasn’t in Kenney’s election platform but the premier hinted that something was coming shortly after the federal election, said Bratt. He said changes to the tax system and police service would increase expenses, but pulling out of the Canada Pension Plan is a mystery because a province hasn’t left in more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>Morton said he’s pleased that the panel will open the discussion on benefiting through structural change. He said the province would be in a better position today if his suggestions had been implemented in the early 2000s. But the original firewall letter received strong criticism from Klein, who described it as “defeatism” on Feb. 25, 2001.</p>
      <p>On Jan. 30, 2001, the conservative premier responded to the public letter by saying that building walls around the province wasn’t the answer to unfair treatment from the federal government.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we need a firewall around Alberta,” Klein told Postmedia. “I think we need to be vocal, we need to be forceful in our desire to be treated fairly within the federation of Canada because we’ve always said ‘We’re a player’.”</p>
      <p>The UCP-appointed fair deal panel consists of well-known conservative figures, such as Manning and Stephen Lougheed, three MLAs and a Blackfoot chief. Their mandate from the provincial government is to listen to Albertans and their ideas for the future, focusing on ideas that would strengthen the economy, offer the province a stronger voice within Confederation and increase provincial power over institutions.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had it with Ottawa’s indifference to this adversity. Albertans have been working for Ottawa for too long, it’s time for Ottawa to start working for us,” Kenney declared in <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/kenney-reveals-fair-deal-plan-to-assess-alberta-run-pension-police-and-tax-collection/wcm/8da6ced6-57e9-47aa-b14d-1b7c7c7cf3e7">his speech to the Alberta Manning Networking Conference</a>. “We Albertans will not lose our heads, we are practical people, we are not unreasonable people. Nothing we are asking for is unreasonable.”</p>
      <p>Regional chief Jason Goodstriker is excited about his role on the panel, gathering information from people to forge a new path for Alberta.</p>
      <p>“The panel, itself, is going to seek out the voice of grassroots and corporate and all kinds of Albertans who are involved in what makes our region work,” Goodstriker said Monday. “People in our region have had an opinion for a long time so I don’t think it will take a great amount of time to say what’s being said.”</p>
      <p>Donna Kennedy-Glans, a former Calgary MLA, is also among the panellists and is ready to hear people’s concerns and ideas.</p>
      <p>“People are concerned about what’s going on and people are unclear about what the choices are within Confederation,” said Kennedy-Glans.</p>
      <p>Kenney said during his speech that any measures coming out of the panel that warrant serious consideration would be subject to a provincial referendum. “I can assure Albertans that we would not make a decision . . . unless the majority of Albertans were to endorse those proposals in a fair and democratic referendum,” he said.</p>
      <p>The panel will begin public consultations Nov. 16 and conclude Jan. 20, 2020, with the panel’s recommendations going to the government by the end of March.</p>
