      <p>It's been a while since we had a bit more written lore from the universe of multiplayer shooter <i>Overwatch</i>, but Blizzard are looking to fix that with a new novelette, <i>Valkyrie,</i> which is available to read online <a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/x3/X38BR3N7HTDP1573261672394.pdf">right now.</a><br/><br/>The short story sees<i> Overwatch's</i> resident healer, Mercy, reflecting on her early days with the globe-trotting outfit. Valkyrie takes us to Egypt, where a young Dr. Angela Ziegler was stationed, providing medical attention and support to those affected by the Omnic War. It isn't long before she encounters early <i>Overwatch</i> members such as Ana Amari and Commander Morrison (the man who would be Soldier: 76) who encourage Ziegler to take her medical expertise out onto the battlefield, becoming the support extraordinaire and the woman who healed a thousand Genjis, Mercy.</p>

      <p>The story ends with an image of a new skin, blending the cyber-mechanics of the Mercy outfit with the Doctor's coat of Ziegler's early years. The Legendary skin is available to earn now in <i>Overwatch</i> as the newest Limited Time Challenge. Simply bag yourself nine wins in arcade mode before December 2 to unlock a new player icon, some new sprays, and finally the "Dr. Ziegler" skin.<br/><br/>If you want to check out the short story for yourself, <a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/x3/X38BR3N7HTDP1573261672394.pdf">then you can read <i>Valkyrie</i> right here.</a></p>
