      <h1>Suspicious photo of kitchen leads to house listing being removed</h1>
      <h2>The property received thousands of views when it was posted online - but has since been removed after people noticed something very suspicious happening in the kitchen</h2>

      <p>A house listing has been removed after people noticed something very suspicious going on in the picture of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Despite receiving 29,000 views on the first day it was posted online, the listing has now been removed.</p>
      <p>Instead of browsing through pictures of the house with the view of booking an inspection, eagle-eyed house-hunters were instead drawn to a plate on the counter of the kitchen, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/house-listing-removed-after-suspicious-20865846">Mirror Online</a>. </p>
      <p>The listing on website Zillow, which gave an asking price of around £128,000, has since been taken down after it attracted 29,000 views on its first day and led to the homeowner being bombarded with inquiries.</p>
      <p>And the boyfriend of the homeowner has now claimed the photo was a 'joke'.</p>
      <p>Among snaps of the home in Michigan, US, was a photo of the spacious kitchen, showing wooden cabinets, granite worktops and an island in the middle.</p>
      <p>On the island you can see what looks like a beer can, a plastic cup, and a plate - with what appears to have five neat lines of a white powdery substance on it, as reported by <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/zillow-listing-of-home-goes-viral-after-photo-shows-white-powder-substance-drawn-in-lines">WXYZ</a>.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of viewers commented, with many saying it resembled cocaine, and even questioned if could land the current occupiers in hot water.</p>
      <p>Talking to 7 Action News, the boyfriend known only as Jeff said: "I was like, I’m wondering if I did something like this if anybody would even notice or if somebody did notice it, that it would go viral and it went viral.</p>
      <p>“It went too viral.”</p>

      <p>Jeff said he created the scene by putting lines of headache powder on a plate but claims he took down the photo after it got 'way out of hand' as he was left fielding more than 100 calls, texts and emails.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was happy with the popularity of the listing, he said: "Yes and no."</p>
      <p>However, Zillow said it had been the one to remove the listing, with a spokesperson saying it had violated its 'Good Neighbour Policy'.</p>
      <p>A local police lieutenant said the force won't be carrying out an investigation into the image as 'there are too many legal questions to establish probable cause for a search warrant'.</p>
      <p>He added that even if it had been a stunt, he 'wouldn't recommend' anyone stages a scene like that to boost interest in a home listing.</p>
