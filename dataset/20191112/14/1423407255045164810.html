      <h1>Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 19023</h1>

      <p>Hello Windows Insiders, today we’re releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview <b>Build 19023 (20H1)</b> to Windows Insiders in the Fast ring.</p>
      <p>If you want a complete look at what build is in which Insider ring, head over to <a href="https://aka.ms/flighthub">Flight Hub</a>. You can also check out the <a href="https://aka.ms/wip-docs">rest of our documentation here</a> including a complete list of new features and updates that have gone out as part of Insider flights for the current development cycle.</p>
      <p>Not seeing any of the features in this build? Check your <a href="https://aka.ms/winsider-settings">Windows Insider Settings</a> to make sure you’re on the Fast ring. <a href="https://aka.ms/InsiderMissingFeature">Submit feedback here</a> to let us know if things weren’t working the way you expected.</p>
      <h3>Other updates for Insiders</h3>
      <p>We’re continuing to look at ways we can improve the update experience on Windows 10 PCs for our customers. As part of this effort, we are conducting an experiment related to how we deliver driver updates through Windows Update. During this experiment, drivers categorized as “optional” will not be automatically downloaded and installed on Windows Insider’s PCs running 20H1 Build 18980 and newer. To install any new optional drivers available for a PC that’s involved in this experiment (including drivers for new devices that might get plugged in to a PC), Insiders can go to Settings &gt; Windows Update &gt; Optional Updates and manually download these drivers. This experiment will be running now through November 25th, 2019.</p>
      <h3>General changes, improvements, and fixes for PC</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We resolved an issue where, if a build attempted to download and install before you had completed the first log in of a prior install (such as Build 19013), you would experience a 2-hour window before you could install this new build.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue resulting in a lag processing input when running a video fullscreen.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue where the quick action section in the Action Center was slightly off-center in the last few builds.</li>
        <li>We fixed an issue that could result in Cortana’s voice activation setting switching from on back to off after explorer.exe restarted, or if you rebooted your PC.</li>
        <li>Just a reminder for Insiders, that as of the previous flight, based on feedback, we’ve decided to remove the downloads folder from Disk Cleanup. If you liked having this option, it’s still available via Storage Settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Known issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>We’ve identified an issue preventing Sandbox and WDAG from working. If you rely on these features, you may consider pausing updates before taking this build. </b>We know what’s causing this issue, and we’re working hard to get another flight out with the fix as quickly as possible.</li>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, we have applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>
        <li>We’ve heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and are investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install. We’re looking into the issue.</li>
        <li>We’re investigating reports that certain fingerprint readers are no longer working as of Build 19013. If you’re impacted, for now you’ll need to log in with a password instead–appreciate your patience.</li>
      </ul>
