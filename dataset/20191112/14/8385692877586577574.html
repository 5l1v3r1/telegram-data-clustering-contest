      <p>Best Buy has put the LG 55-inch B9 OLED TV down to its <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">lowest price ever</a>. It is now just $1299. That's a pretty good price for this model, considering it just came out a few months ago, and hasn't really gone on sale much.</p>
      <p>The B9 is the latest model from LG, which launched just a few months ago. It has all of the support that you'd expect from a high-end TV in 2019. That includes Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, for some really good looking and sounding movies and TV shows.</p>
      <p>LG is using its a7 Gen2 Intelligent Processor to process the images in these movies and TV shows that you are watching. This is going to allow it to output some really good picture quality. And of course with this being OLED, the picture is going to feature more true to life colors. Especially when it comes to darker movies and TV shows. Since blacks will actually be black instead of a dark gray. Like an LCD TV might show.</p>

      <p>Inside this TV, you're going to find webOS running the show. It has all of the big name apps like Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Netflix, and now Disney+.</p>
      <p>LG has also opted to add Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant support, so that no matter what virtual assistant you prefer to use, you'll be good to go with this TV. You'll be able to control your smart home devices using your voice through your TV, which is pretty cool. There is also Apple Homekit support here, in case you do use Apple products in your home.</p>
