      <p>Cape Town - <b>Mamelodi Sundowns</b> coach <b>Pitso Mosimane</b> believes <b>Cape Town City</b> were too quick in pulling the trigger by sacking <b>Benni McCarthy</b>.</p>
      <p>McCarthy lost his job after a spell of just two wins in 18 games as City ran out of patience with the man that led them to the MTN8 title last season and had transformed the side in to title contenders over the past few seasons.</p>
      <p>Bafana Bafana's all-time leading goalscorer had also got the Citizens to play a high-tempo attacking brand of football that saw them score the most goals in the 2018/2019 season and thus far this season.</p>
      <p>Mosimane struggled to understand the decision made by City CEO John Comitis and his brains-trust and believes more faith should have been shown in McCarthy.</p>
      <p>"It's a sad one, I never saw that one coming. It's sad and unbelievable," Mosimane told <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/benni-mccarthy-deserved-better-from-cape-town-city-says-pitso-mosimane/667293">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"I never thought Benni would ever take coaching this seriously to be honest. He really came out and took it to another level.</p>
      <p>"His team was playing very well. Of course they were not winning many games this year but they were playing well, a good team.</p>
      <p>"I mean a guy is two years [as a head coach], he's already won a cup. I mean two years he's won a cup.</p>
      <p>"Do you want to do research and see coaches in this country who have been coaching for more than 10 years and haven't won a cup?</p>
      <p>"I talk on the side of coaches because team owners will say 'hey we haven't won for the last seven games' but he didn't lose those seven games, he drew four or three.</p>
      <p>"I mean two years with a guy who gave you a cup, give him a chance hey, and he's playing good football. But who am I?"</p>
