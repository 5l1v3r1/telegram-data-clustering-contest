      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In morning, we discussed the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/12/bitcoin-btc-price-turned-sell-on-rallies-towards-9k/">chances of more losses and sell opportunities</a> for bitcoin below $9,000 against the US Dollar. BTC remained in a bearish zone and it failed to break the $8,850 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the price is now trading well below the $8,800 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It seems like the price failed to capitalize above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,150 high to $8,610 low.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the price was rejected near the 50% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $9,150 high to $8,610 low. Bitcoin is now trading below the $8,750 level and is following a bearish path.</p>
      <p>Recently, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support near $8,730 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, there is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/bitcoin-btc-price-rebound-facing-key-resistance-near-9100/">risk of more downsides</a> below the $8,650 and $8,600 levels.</p>
      <p>In the mentioned bearish case, there is a risk of a sharp breakdown even below the $8,500 support. On the upside, an initial resistance for the bulls is near the $8,820 level and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>However, the main resistance is near the $8,850 and $8,950 levels. Besides, today’s key bearish trend line is active with resistance near $8,960 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>If there is a nice upward move above the $8,850 and $8,950 resistance levels, the price may perhaps start a fresh increase towards $9,200 and $9,500 in the coming days.</p>
