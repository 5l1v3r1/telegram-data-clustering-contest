      <p>A Monklands band are casting a spell on fans with the release of their much-anticipated new single.</p>
      <p>Pale Fire’s second album Husbands is due out in six months, but for now the Airdrie and Coatbridge boys’ sensational sounds are hitting the airwaves with tune Various Witches available for download and streaming.</p>
      <p>The band have also recorded a music video for the song, which features shots of well-known Airdrie locations, such as the Staging Post pub, Airdrie library and the former Orrs department store building.</p>
      <p>It is the first of three singles they will be releasing before the album hits the internet next spring.</p>
      <p>Pale Fire headlined King Tuts in 2015 thanks to the success of their debut album which was hailed as one of the top 50 Scottish albums of that year.</p>
      <p>They believe they make pop music for “people who feel pressure to put away childish things” and touch on the demands of adulthood in their writing.</p>

      <p>On Various Witches, the band’s literate and sophisticated song craft is elevated by members of the vibrant Scottish music scene.</p>
      <p>The song features an array of renowned, award-nominated musicians including jazz pianist Tom Gibbs and members of the Cairn String Quartet.</p>
      <p>The merging of many talents results in a richly melodic, lush chamber pop song that makes reference to the catchy noughties hit A Thousand Miles by Vanessa Carlton.</p>
      <p>Producer Jamie Savage, Craig McMahon, Alex Sharples and Donna Maciocia are four other contributors that helped bring Various Witches to life and earned praise from BBC Music’s Tom Robinson who described Pale Fire’s latest effort as: “Lovely, yearning and powerful.”</p>
      <p>While Beerjacket’s Peter Kelly reckons the top track is a “combination of tremendous literary words, spirited song-writing and very real performances”.</p>
      <p>Various Witches is available on all platforms including iTunes and Spotify.</p>
