      <p>If you've been playing <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go"><b>Pokémon GO</b></a> recently, you'll be more than aware that the pesky <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/uh_oh_team_rockets_giovanni_has_blasted_his_way_into_pokemon_go">Team GO Rocket has infiltrated the game</a>. The man behind all of the chaos is, of course, the notorious Giovanni, and highly experienced players have now started to come up against him in battle.</p>
      <p>Finding him is a challenge in itself - we have a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/guide_pokemon_go_-_looming_in_the_shadows_walkthrough_mysterious_components_rocket_radar_and_battling_giovanni">full guide to Pokémon GO's Looming in the Shadows special research tasks</a> if you need it - and once you get there you'll realise that you're up against a rather formidable opponent. Sure, if you have a bag full of super-strong monsters you should get by without too many issues, but you'll still need to concentrate to get the job done.</p>
      <p>Anyway, without further ado, here's a look at how the battle with Giovanni goes down. You can get a glimpse at the Pokémon he uses and even the reward that follows - a chance to capture a Shadow Articuno.</p>

      <p>Developer Niantic has confirmed that new Giovanni questlines will appear every month, with a new medal also now showing up on players' profiles to indicate how many times you've completed them. We'd guess that next month's battle will reward you with a different Shadow Legendary, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
