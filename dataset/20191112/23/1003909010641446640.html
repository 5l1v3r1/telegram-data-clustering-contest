      <p>The Calgary Chamber of Commerce is calling on city council to show “leadership and conviction” by making a decision this month to shift more of the city’s tax burden from businesses to homeowners.</p>
      <p>Calgary Chamber president and CEO Sandip Lalli said she was concerned that what has become known as the downtown tax shift problem was not addressed during a budget discussion Tuesday at city hall. While councillors debated various budget scenarios for 2020 — including a zero per cent tax increase scenario, as opposed to the 3.03 per cent tax hike on homeowners that was part of the city’s previously approved four-year budget — they did not make any decisions on what to do about the increasing tax burden on non-residential property owners outside the core as a result of the steep decline in market value experienced by a handful of downtown office buildings.</p>
      <p>That conversation is instead set for Nov. 18, when council will consider changing the current system whereby Calgary homeowners pay about 49 per cent of municipal taxes, while commercial property owners shoulder 51 per cent. The Calgary Chamber of Commerce supports changing that so that homeowners pay 52 per cent of the city’s tax burden, and commercial property owners pay 48 per cent.</p>
      <p>The move would help reduce the burden on small business owners who have seen consecutive years of double-digit tax increases. But Lalli said she is worried council will do what it did last November, when it failed to address the issue during budget discussions and instead created a one-time, $131-million assistance package for eligible non-residential property owners months later, after angry business owners rallied outside city hall.</p>

      <p>“That’s what we don’t want to happen here,” Lalli said. “We need this issue addressed in conjunction with the approval of (the budget.) We know the downtown core is looking at a 10-year time frame to come back, so this issue has to be addressed structurally.”</p>
      <p>Mayor Naheed Nenshi told reporters Tuesday that he believes it is time to adjust the residential/non-residential tax ratio, but that it makes sense to make that decision after deciding on the budget.</p>
      <p>“I think we should move more to a 50-50, maybe more than that. But as I’ve said many, many times, percentage isn’t what matters . . . what matters is the actual amount on the bill,” Nenshi said. “I really believe council should make that decision once they decide what service levels are appropriate for everyone.”</p>

      <p>Even if council implements a budgetary freeze in 2020 and also shifts more of the property tax burden onto homeowners, it could still mean double-digit tax hikes for some businesses as rebates offered in previous years to deal with the problem artificially capped taxes even as assessments continued to climb.</p>
      <p>Nenshi has stated previously there is no more money for another one-time rebate to soften the blow for businesses or residents.</p>
      <p>According to the city’s own Citizen Satisfaction Survey, released Tuesday, only 23 per cent of business owners polled have “trust” in the City of Calgary, versus 52 per cent of citizens overall.</p>
      <p>Lalli said she believes those numbers are the direct result of the city’s failure to come up with a long-term solution on the tax burden issue.</p>
      <p>“That lack of decision making and lack of conviction and follow through is what we’re seeing there,” she said. “So I’m not surprised by those results at all, based on what we hear from our business community.”</p>
