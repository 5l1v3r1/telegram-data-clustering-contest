      <h1>Yes, you can still get that Disney Plus bundle if you already subscribe to Hulu</h1>

      <p>Now that Disney owns three streaming services — Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, and Hulu — it was pretty much a given that the company would find a way to leverage its impressive portfolio. Disney CEO Bob Iger announced in August that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/6/20757643/disney-plus-hulu-espn-bundle-price-subscription">Disney would offer a bundle of all three services</a>. However, what exactly that would mean for current Hulu subscribers was unclear.</p>
      <p>Well, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20956257/disney-plus-tv-shows-movies-full-list-star-wars-marvel-pixar-dcom">Disney Plus</a> is finally here, and we have a few more details about how exactly this package works. The <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vrdby">$12.99 monthly bundle</a> includes subscriptions to Disney Plus (usually $6.99/month), ESPN Plus (usually $4.99/month), and the ad-supported version of Hulu (usually $5.99/month). Assuming that you don’t already subscribe to any of those services, the bundle is billed through Disney Plus.</p>

      <p>However, those who already subscribe to Hulu can still take advantage of the bundle. You can keep your Hulu subscription and continue to be billed through Hulu; you’ll just get a $5.99 credit toward the Disney Plus bundle each month. The sign-up process is a bit confusing, though, so we’ll do our best to walk you through it.</p>
      <p>First, you’ll need to head to the <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/zkkOM">Disney Plus sign-up page</a>. (I found it easier to navigate on a desktop computer than on a TV app or phone, but your mileage may vary.) Click “Buy Now” under the Disney Plus bundle, and enter the same email address you use for your Hulu account. You’ll then be prompted to create a password, which does <i>not</i> have to be the same password you use on Hulu.</p>

      <p>On the next page, where you enter your payment information, there’s a link with more information for those who are subscribed to one or more of the services already. A screenshot of that info can be seen to the right, but the gist is that Disney will will automatically adjust your bill to reflect your current subscriptions. Just enter your credit card number (or link your PayPal account) on this page and you should be all set, although it may be a good idea to check your next Disney Plus and Hulu bills to make sure you’re not being charged twice.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve set up your Disney Plus account, you’ll be emailed instructions on how to link your ESPN Plus and Hulu accounts.</p>
      <h3>But what about ad-free Hulu and Hulu with Live TV?</h3>
      <p>The Disney Plus bundle only includes the base-level, ad-supported Hulu subscription, which cannot be upgraded if you sign up for Hulu with the bundle. If you want to subscribe to the more expensive ad-free Hulu, or Hulu with Live TV — or just think you might want to in the future — you’ll need to first sign up for Hulu separately and then sign up for the Disney Plus bundle following the instructions above. Note that you’ll still only get a $5.99 credit toward your Disney Plus bill regardless of the Hulu subscription you choose.</p>
