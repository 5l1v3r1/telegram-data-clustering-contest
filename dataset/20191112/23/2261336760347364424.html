      <p>From the sound of things, Francisco Trinaldo has been through one of the most productive camps of his entire career. Just a few days short of his match with Bobby Green at UFC Sao Paulo, ‘Massaranduba’ can barely contain his eagerness to show all his aggression when the pair meet on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://sportv.globo.com/site/combate/noticia/massaranduba-sobre-bobby-green-nao-sabe-a-vontade-que-estou-de-meter-a-porrada-nele.ghtml">Combate</a>, the 41-year-old made it clear that he won’t let this fight go down the same path as his previous one, when he dropped a controversial decision to Alexander Hernandez. This time, Trinaldo wants to put on the hurt on Green and score a clear, undisputed win.</p>
      <p>“It was one of my best camps, I feel pretty damn well. I put my last fight behind me, I focused on striking. I want to decide this fight with my hands, I’ll be there to finish it, I don’t want to leave it for the judges. I’ll be a more aggressive Massaranduba.”</p>
      <p>“What I have to tell the fans is that this will be one of the best fights of the night.” Trinaldo continued. “I want a slugfest. I want to walk out all messed up, but victorious. Nobody is taking this win from me. He doesn’t know how bad I want to beat him up. I mean it. I’ll mess this dude up.”</p>
      <p>In his last outing, in July, Francisco Trinaldo (23-7) dropped a unanimous decision to Alexander Hernandez, which came right after a TKO win over the now retired Evan Dunham, in September 2018.</p>
      <p>UFC Fight Night 164: Blachowicz vs. Jacare goes down on November 16, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The card is scheduled to be headlined by a light heavyweight bout between former middleweight contender Ronaldo ‘Jacare’ Souza and Jan Blachowicz. Stay tuned to Bloody Elbow for more news and updates.</p>
