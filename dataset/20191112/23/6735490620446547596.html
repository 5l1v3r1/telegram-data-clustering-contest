      <p>Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon appeared on Australia’s <a href="https://9now.nine.com.au/today/jennifer-anniston-and-reese-witherspoon-send-prayers-to-australia-following-bushfires-hollywood-actresses-talk-about-series-morning-wars-today-show-australia/69b99277-a4a1-4591-9176-32fa1796e93d">“Today”</a> show on Tuesday to promote their new Apple TV+ series “The Morning Show” (which is titled “Morning Wars” in Australia), and the Matt Lauer’ sexual misconduct on NBC’s “Today” inevitably came up.</p>
      <p>In the new series, Aniston plays Alex Levy, longtime co-host of a morning show much like the actual “Today” show, who finds the ground shifting beneath her feet when her on-air partner of 15 years, Mitch Kessler (Steve Carell), is abruptly fired for sexual misconduct.</p>
      <p>While that is one of the themes running through the show, Aniston said “The Morning Show” features many others. “The power struggles, the pay equality, all of it. Sexism, ageism, racism. Every ‘-ism,'” she said.</p>

      <p>“We really wanted to dig into journalism and broadcast media in a real way to see how systems have treated women for years and years, and what has changed in these moments of #MeToo and this real cultural reckoning,” Witherspoon added.</p>
      <p>Aniston recalled when she and Witherspoon first read the pilot script, “I remember we were both like, ‘Wow! Woah! We are going right into this, right off the top. Scene one,'” she said said. “But you know, why not? I thought it was sort of brave and bold of [writer Kerry Ehrin], and why avoid the elephant in the room?”</p>

      <p>Despite the obvious similarities, Aniston insisted that the “Morning Show” plot isn’t specifically based on Lauer’s scandal, but as a fictionalized example reflecting the numerous men in powerful positions to be accused of being sexual predators in the wake of the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>“Mitch is like the archetype of this man that we are basically telling the story of, and sadly there is more than one,” said Aniston.</p>
      <p>“Across many different networks,” Witherspoon added, “and across many different industries as well.”</p>
