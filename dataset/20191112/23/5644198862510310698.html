      <p>REUTERS: U.S. Food and Drug Administration staffers reviewing Amarin Corp Plc's fish oil-derived drug said on Tuesday the agency's tests were inconclusive on whether the use of mineral oil as placebo in the company's trial could have impacted results.</p>

      <p>Vascepa, Amarin's only drug, originally won U.S. approval in 2012 to lower high levels of triglycerides â€” a type of blood fat that can increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p>Amarin is now seeking to expand approval of the omega-3 fatty acid pill to make it a treatment for reducing the chance of heart attacks and strokes in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>An independent panel of experts is set to discuss the safety and effectiveness of the drug on Thursday.</p>
