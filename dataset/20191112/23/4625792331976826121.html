      <p>A New Zealand cafe said their decision to offer an "inclusive" gingerbread man has been a hit with customers.</p>
      <p>Tannery Cafe started offering a $2.50 "GingerBread Gender Neutral person" cookie just in time for the holidays. Cafe owner Andre Cettina <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/food-wine/food-news/117267857/auckland-cafe-cooks-up-genderneutral-gingerbread-people#comments">told</a> Stuff the move was inspired by a customer who asked why the cookies were not called "gingerbread people."</p>
      <p>"It was completely tongue-in-cheek at the start," Cettina said. "But it's become a really good conversation piece in the cafe." Before the name change, 90% of the cafe's gingerbread cookies were sold to kids, but now adults are flocking to get a taste of the "Gender Neutral person" cookies. "There's a lot more people buying them now, which is quite funny," Cettina said.</p>
      <p>Not all of the customers have found the cookies' new name funny. "We've had a lot of people commenting saying, 'Stop being so pedantic, it's just a biscuit.' I had to reply to them going, 'Did you miss the whole point?'" the owner said.</p>
      <p>Target also <a href="https://www.target.com/p/gender-inclusive-gingerbread-long-sleeve-sweater-33-degrees-black/-/A-77288034?preselect=54650897">introduced</a> a "Gender Inclusive Gingerbread" sweater for the holiday season. The $30 sweater has one review of one star on the company's website.</p>
