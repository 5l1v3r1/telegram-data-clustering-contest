      <h2>Debut hopefuls must seize chance to stake claim for next year’s England series against Australia when Great Britain face Papua New Guinea in tour finale</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:41:38+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:41</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Stott</a></address>
      <p>George Williams and Jake Trueman have been urged to go out and make Wayne Bennett’s life difficult.</p>
      <p>Gareth Widdop and Jackson Hastings have been the half backs in the first three Great Britain Tests Down Under.</p>
      <p>Despite three defeats, coach Wayne Bennett is thought to favour them for next year’s England Series with Australia if he is still in charge.</p>
      <p>But Bennett is expected to hand debuts to both Williams and Trueman in Saturday’s final Series game against Papua New Guinea.</p>
      <p>It’s a chance assistant coach Ian Watson says the two youngsters must grab with both hands.</p>

      <p>He said: “They need to have a real good input into the game and stake a claim going forward.</p>
      <p>“They need to put their best performance out there at the weekend so that they are not coming on any tour again and not playing a part.</p>
      <p>“They need to make sure they force Wayne Bennett’s hand so that they get selected.”</p>
      <p>Zak Hardaker could make a shock return after being ruled out of last week’s second Test against New Zealand with a shoulder injury.</p>

      <p>The Wigan full-back was expected to move from centre last week, where he’d played in the first two Tests, to the wing following injury to Ryan Hall.</p>
      <p>His injury in training was initially expected to end his tour but he has been named in a 21-man squad along with Joe Philbin.</p>
      <p>The Warrington forward was ruled out last week with a slight hamstring injury, after making an impressive debut in the first Test defeat by New Zealand.</p>
      <p>If Philbin plays, it will complete a remarkable hat-trick of international appearances in Papua New Guinea by the 24-year-old.</p>

      <p>He played there for Ireland in the 2017 World Cup and toured there last year with England Knights.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am such a PNG veteran that I think I’m going to get citizenship. I’ve loved every visit here.</p>
      <p>“It’s a life changing experience and it makes you far more appreciative of what you’ve got in your life.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people live in poverty but they absolutely love their rugby league and are so happy when a team tours. I’m so glad the Great Britain lads are experiencing it.”</p>

      <p>The Lions received a heroes' welcome when they arrived in Port Moresby yesterday, with hundreds of fans greeting them at the airport.</p>
      <p>Centre Jake Connor said: “It was a bit crazy, a bit mind blowing. It was like something off a film - everyone wanted to touch you.”</p>
      <p>The Lions always name a 21-man squad on Tuesday with the first 17 normally expected to play.</p>
      <p>But this week’s team will not be decided until after training on Thursday. The 21-man squad is the same 17 as last week, plus Philbin, Williams, Trueman and Hardaker.</p>
