      <h1>Braid: Despite attacks, Kenney's ideas aren't separatist or dangerous</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:26:35+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:26</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney and hockey crank Don Cherry went off at nearly the same moment Saturday.</p>
      <p>Cherry got more national attention and deserved every negative word. The media eruption showed what’s really important in this country — <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/canada/don-cherry-fired/wcm/65a82ceb-d309-4de0-8bc9-941f3f0ee092">Coach’s Corner</a>.</p>
      <p>Kenney could hardly be ignored, though.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/kenney-reveals-fair-deal-plan-to-assess-alberta-run-pension-police-and-tax-collection/wcm/5077aaa9-2613-4791-8aa0-0875ad4f6752">long and passionate speech in Red Deer</a>, he laid out a series of prescriptions for improving Alberta’s health in Canada.</p>
      <p>This was instantly painted as a path to separatism by the NDP and other critics. Kenney is, in their view, the Don Cherry of politicians — outdated and divisive.</p>
      <p>But Kenney is actually being quite moderate. Everything on his long to-do list is permissible within Confederation.</p>
      <p>You may like these ideas — <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/fp-street/alberta-will-study-already-compelling-case-for-its-exit-from-cpp-kenney/wcm/1646ac25-35c7-43fd-bc2f-b6396cdebcf6">Alberta pension plan</a>, provincial police and tax collection, fixing the stabilization program — or you may truly hate them.</p>
      <p>But to call them separatist is itself divisive. To say that a province can’t even discuss using its legitimate powers is what’s really un-Canadian.</p>
      <p>The late premier Peter Lougheed, the object of modern hagiography from all sides, was once called a nation-wrecker for cutting oil shipments to the rest of Canada.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Lougheed was named the best Canadian premier of the past 40 years.</p>

      <p>Kenney’s proposals were studied and rejected during the Ralph Klein years. They were also largely scorned when the famous <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/an-original-author-of-the-firewall-letter-pleased-with-ucp-appointed-fair-deal-panel">Firewall Letter</a> was published in 2001.</p>
      <p>But those ideas weren’t dismissed because they were invalid or improper. Most Albertans, despite their annoyances, just didn’t think they were necessary.</p>
      <p>The tensions then were nothing like the mood today. Never have more Albertans felt so abandoned and suppressed by their national government.</p>
      <p>There are three general reactions to Alberta’s sense of crisis:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Just hope it all works out, which seems to be the NDP idea, even though in government they favoured several of Kenney’s measures;</li>
        <li>Things will never work out, so Alberta should separate. Hence, Wexit;</li>
        <li>There’s a better chance of working things out if Alberta pressures Ottawa by using dormant powers. Even if no settlement ensues, Alberta would be better able to protect its interests.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In that wider context, Kenney’s approach is the centrist one.</p>
      <p>And yet, the criticism was immediate and unrestrained. Even the idea of a provincial police force was offered as evidence of separatism.</p>
      <p>In that case, Ontario’s OPP is a separatist project. So is the proud Constabulary of Newfoundland and Labrador. (Quebec’s Surete is just part of the landscape, no matter what the provincial mood about Canada.)</p>
      <p>Among many demands, Kenney asked Ottawa to lift the $60 per capita limit on fiscal stabilization grants.</p>
      <p>This is a stunning inequity in a program allegedly designed to help provinces that suffer sudden and severe economic stress.</p>
      <p>When Alberta’s revenues fell by $6.9 billion because of the oil crash, the feds paid only $251.4 million — less than the province received in 1986-87, when there was no population cap.</p>
      <p>Former NDP finance minister Joe Ceci made Alberta’s case forcefully.</p>
      <p>“In order for this program to work for Albertans, we must revisit or remove this cap so that provinces receive adequate support when revenues fall sharply,” he said in a 2018 letter to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau.</p>
      <p>Ottawa refused, of course.</p>
      <p>The NDP in office had many of the same concerns as Kenney — equalization, stabilization, pipelines and much else.</p>
      <p>But according to Opposition Leader Rachel Notley, Kenney’s demands are now “dangerous.”</p>

      <p>Albertans will have many legitimate questions about these proposals.</p>
      <p>Is Kenney indeed using them only for political advantage? Will the UCP employ more provincial power to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-bill-207-challenges-abortion-access-based-on-conscience">constrain social rights</a>, make even deeper budget cuts?</p>
      <p>Most controversial is the thought of a provincial pension system, hived off from CPP.</p>
      <p>People would have to be convinced that the benefits would be larger and the contributions smaller. Punishing Ottawa by withdrawing provincial CPP contributions wouldn’t be reason enough.</p>
      <p>These are big ideas with many uncertainties around them. Even after study by Kenney’s Fair Deal panel, they may fail to pass a provincial referendum.</p>
      <p>But Albertans should not, at this superheated moment, scorn the proposals as un-Canadian and dangerous when they are nothing of the sort. That just encourages separatism.</p>
