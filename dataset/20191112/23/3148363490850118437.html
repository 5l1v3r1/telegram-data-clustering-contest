      <h2>The town of Menifee, California, gave one Marine veteran the surprise of a lifetime by giving him a custom-built, mortgage-free home.</h2>

      <p>Community members and his new neighbors lined the streets on Monday to welcome Marine Cpl. Timothy Jeffers to his new home in Menifee, and cheered on his arrival.</p>
      <p>“I’m kind of at a loss for words,” <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Community-Comes-Together-to-Surprise-Veteran-With-a-New-Home_Los-Angeles-564779862.html">said</a> Jeffers upon receiving the surprise, according to NBC Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Jeffers was fighting in the Anbar province during the Iraq War in 2006 when he stepped on an improvised explosive device (IED). The IED caused him to <a href="https://tunnel2towers.org/sh-recipients/timothy-jeffers/">suffer</a> severe injuries, including the loss of two legs below the knee, an eye, and a finger.</p>
      <p>The Purple Heart recipient received the keys to his custom-built mortgage-free home from the nonprofit Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation, a charity named after the New York City firefighter who died saving others during the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>
      <p>“There is no better day than Veterans Day than to welcome home a true American hero,” Jack Oehm, a retired New York City firefighter with the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, <a href="https://abc7.com/society/wounded-marine-receives-a-heros-welcome-and-new-home-in-menifee-/5690749/">told</a> KABC.</p>
      <p>“It is an awesome house. I’ve never seen one like it,” said Jeffers.</p>
