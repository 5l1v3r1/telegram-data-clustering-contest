      <h1>Cardinal George Pell Will Have His Appeal Heard By The High Court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T23:20:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 23:20</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p>Today, a court has ruled that Cardinal George Pell will be granted the opportunity to make an appeal to the high court. This will lengthen an already long and involved legal battle for <a href="https://junkee.com/george-pell-plaque-chaser/218978">the disgraced Cardinal.</a></p>
      <p>Pell, who was <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-13/george-pell-sentenced-for-sexually-abusing-choirboys/10876012">convicted of historic sex crimes</a>, had his first attempt at an appeal dismissed from a Victorian court in June of this year.</p>

      <p>In the aftermath of that decision, the Cardinal made an appeal to the High Court. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/12/cardinal-george-pell-to-find-out-if-hes-reached-end-of-road-to-appeal-child-sexual-abuse-conviction">It was up to that court to decide whether the appeal would even be heard.</a></p>
      <p>Today, they have decided that they will hear the appeal. That does not necessarily mean that Pell will not serve jail time. It will all depend on what now happens with the appeal, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/george-pell-appeal-to-be-heard-by-high-court-20191113-p53a3j.html">which it is believed will be heard by a court this forthcoming Summer.</a></p>
      <p>The appeal heard by the high court will be Pellâ€™s last chance to clear his name.</p>
