      <blockquote>"This amount, apart from the helicopters, also covers weapons systems, ammunition, a training simulator and the cost of initial training for pilots and technicians. I hope that we will conclude the agreement with the US government by the end of this year and that our army will receive these helicopters in 2023", Metnar told reporters.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the minister, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201903201073392263-czech-president-turkey-daesh-ally/">Czech</a> military wants to replace 17 Russian Mi-24/35 attack helicopters, since it no longer wants to be dependent on the supply of spare parts from Russia.</p>
      <p>In August,Â Lubomir Metnar said Czech Republic was going to buy a mixed fleet of US helicopters from the Bell Helicopter Company.</p>
