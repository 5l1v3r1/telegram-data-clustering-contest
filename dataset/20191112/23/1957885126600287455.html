      <p><b>News</b> by Matt Wales, Reporter Updated on 13 November 2019</p>
      <p>Kaze Emanuar, the noted Nintendo 64 ROM hacker responsible for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-08-16-someones-created-a-waluigi-game-for-the-n64">Waluigi's Taco Stand 64</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-08-bowsette-game-mods-are-getting-out-of-hand">playable Mario 64 version of Bowsette</a> has released his latest project - a massive 32-level sequel of sorts to Super Mario 64.</p>
      <p>Known as Super Mario 64 Land, Emanuar's latest endeavour is chock full of references to Mario's various platform outings, most notably Super Mario 3D World and Land.</p>
      <p>There's a 3D overworld map, for starters, a modernised move-set for Mario, and even power-ups new to Mario 64, including a Tanooki transformation and 3D World's much-loved cat suit - all served up in the Mario 64 engine's distinctive style.</p>

      <p>In total, as outlined in the launch trailer above, Super Mario 64 Land features 32 new levels, 70 different areas, eight new bosses, 10 new power-ups, and 75 new music tracks - the latter including some modern Mario tracks given a retro spin.</p>
      <p>Super Mario 64 Land is being released as a mod for Super Mario 64, which means you'll need a ROM to play it. And if you manage to fulfil that requirement, then Kaze Emanuar's latest gargantuan endeavour can be downloaded by following the <a href="https://youtu.be/Fqew0W6AYew">links on YouTube</a>.</p>
      <p>Emanuar's previous efforts have been no less impressive. As well as transplanting Super Mario Odyssey's delightful hat-tossing transformation mechanics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-26-super-mario-odysseys-capture-mechanic-modded-into-mario-64">into Mario 64</a>, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-22-mario-hacker-recreates-super-mario-bros-in-super-mario-64">remade Super Mario Bros.</a> in the game's engine, and also collaborated on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-11-you-can-now-play-super-mario-64-online-with-others">24-person online multiplayer version</a> of Super Mario 64 (sadly, thanks to Nintendo's legal team, now deceased).</p>
