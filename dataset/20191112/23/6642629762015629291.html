      <h3>Who are the candidates?</h3>
      <p>This year's election has a record 35 candidates running, from across the political spectrum.</p>
      <p>Incumbent Maithripala Sirisena, elected in 2015, will not be seeking re-election, leaving the fight down to the two main candidates according to analysts: The ruling United National Party's (UNP) Sajith Premadasa and Gotabaya Rajapaksa from the opposition Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPP) party.</p>
      <h4>Gotabaya Rajapaksa - SLPP</h4>

      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the brother of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his former defence secretary, is the leader of the Sri Lanka People's Front party. He is running on a platform promising to prioritise security and economic reform.</p>
      <p>As defence secretary, Rajapaksa presided over the end of Sri Lanka's 26-year civil war with Tamil rebels in 2009 and has been accused of being responsible for human rights violations committed at that time.</p>
      <p>The SLPP is backed by Rajapaksa loyalists, including the outgoing president's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa is a divisive figure among minorities but has strong support among the island nation's majority Sinhala Buddhist population.</p>
      <h4>Sajith Premadasa - UNP</h4>

      <p>A cabinet minister in current Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's government, Premadasa is backed by Sri Lanka's ruling United National Party.</p>
      <p>The son of a former president who was assassinated by Tamil rebels in 1993, Premadasa has been in and out of power since entering politics in 1994.</p>
      <p>While he is backed by Wickremesinghe, the two have not always gotten along, including when it came to the question of Premadasa being fielded as the UNP-backed candidate in this election. Premadasa is standing as the candidate for the United National Front (UNF) alliance.</p>
      <p>Premadasa is also promising economic reform and will be relying on support from Sri Lanka's minority Tamil and Muslim populations to get him over the line against a strong Rajapaksa candidacy. The two minorities together form about 20 percent of Sri Lanka's 21 million population.</p>
      <h4>Anura Kumara Dissanayake - Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP)</h4>

      <p>Anura Kumara Dissanayake leads the People's Liberation Front (JVP) alliance, a leftist political movement that abandoned armed struggle against the government to join politics in 1994.</p>
      <p>He is a member of the Parliament of Sri Lanka for Colombo and was chief opposition whip until December 2018.</p>
      <p>Despite being in the opposition, Dissanayake became known for speaking out vehemently against the 2018 constitutional crisis which would have unseated Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.</p>
      <p>DissanayakeÂ is standing as the candidate backed by the National People's Power (NPP) alliance.</p>
      <h4>Mahesh Senanayake - National People's Party (NPP)</h4>

      <p>Sri Lanka's recently retired army chief, Mahesh Senanayake, is seen by many as the candidate for the apolitical voter.</p>
      <p>Senanayake retired in August 2019, having served in the military for 36 years, including through the civil war.</p>
      <p>His career was not, however, without controversy: In 2010, he fled the country following a presidential election won by Mahinda Rajapaksa, fearing reprisals for having supported Rajapaksa's opponent.</p>
      <p>He returned in 2015 when Rajapaksa was defeated by Sirisena.</p>
      <h3>What are the key issues?</h3>
      <h4>Security</h4>
      <p>On April 21, 2019, eight suicide bombers targeted three churches and three luxury hotels across Sri Lanka in a devastating series of attacks timed to coincide with Easter Sunday services. In all, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/sri-lanka-bombings.html">269 people were killed and more than 400 wounded</a>.</p>
      <p>The attacks appeared to take the Sri Lankan government by surprise, and a scathing parliamentary investigation report documented systematic failures at every level of the state's security structure, including at the prime minister, president and intelligence chief levels.</p>
      <p>In this election, voters will be concerned about addressing those issues and ensuring that such attacks do not recur. The blasts also prompted a series of counterattacks and riots targeting the island's Muslim minority, mainly led by right-wing Sinhala Buddhist leaders, which has led to increasing polarisation in the country.</p>
      <h4>Economy</h4>
      <p>Burdened with high debt and sluggish economic growth, the Sri Lankan economy could not afford the hit it took following the Easter Sunday bombings.</p>
      <p>Tourism numbers plummeted in the months that followed, after having already dropped during the constitutional crisis of 2018.</p>
      <p>Whoever takes the helm will have to find a way to ensure growth while also servicing the country's $34.4bn foreign debt. The current government's handling of the economy has come under criticism from both the leading presidential candidates, although much of the debt was inherited from Rajapaksa's government.</p>
      <h4>Fallout from the 2018 constitutional crisis</h4>
      <p>In October 2018, President Sirisena attempted to remove Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, from power and replace him with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The country's top court reversed Sirisena's decision, bringing back Wickremesinghe.</p>
      <p>This presidential election will see Premadasa, the nominee for Wickremesinghe's party, face off against Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Mahinda's brother, for the slot of president.</p>
      <p>If Rajapaksa wins, it would set up an immediate face-off with Parliament, which is led by the UNP, and a possible snap election.</p>
      <p>Premadasa's election, however, would not necessarily ensure stability, as the UNP leader also has serious differences with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and as president would wield significant power.</p>
      <h3>How does voting work?</h3>
      <p>The island nation has traditionally high rates of voter participation, with more than 15.9 million registered voters in a total population of 21.8 million, according to Election Commission statistics.</p>
      <p>During the last presidential election in 2015, voter turnout out was 81.5 percent, the highest in the region.</p>
      <p>Voting for Sri Lanka's president is carried out through a modified "contingent vote" system, where voters mark both their first and second preference candidates when casting their ballots.</p>
      <p>In the case of a runoff - if a single candidate fails to win more than 50 percent of the vote outright - the second preference votes will be added to the top two candidates' tally to adjudicate a winner.</p>
      <p>Voting will take place throughout the day on Saturday, November 16. If there is an outright winner, a result is expected by November 17.</p>
      <p>If a runoff is required - which has never before happened in Sri Lanka - the results could take a day longer.</p>
      <h3>How is the government structured?</h3>
      <p>Sri Lanka's government operates under a semi-presidential system, where the president holds widespread executive authority but governs in partnership with a prime minister he appoints and a cabinet recommended by the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The president is directly elected for a five-year term, and can only be removed by a two-thirds vote in Parliament and with Supreme Court approval.</p>
      <p>Parliament consists of a single-chamber house of 225 members, 196 of whom are elected in multi-seat constituencies and the remaining 29 by proportional representation from the results of the parliamentary election.</p>
      <p>The prime minister and federal cabinet are drawn from Parliament. Under a recent constitutional amendment, the president no longer has the power to dismiss them and they are answerable solely to Parliament.</p>
      <p>The same amendment also stripped the president of many powers - key among them the ability to hold ministries - which will apply to the office for the first time.</p>
