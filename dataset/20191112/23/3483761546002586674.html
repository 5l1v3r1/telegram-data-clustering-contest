      <p>A Glendale retiree who had no luck in Melbourne Cup day sweeps has instead scratched his way to a $10,000 windfall.</p>
      <p>The man won the top prize on a $1 'Money I'm Home' instant scratch-its ticket, which was purchased from Nextra Glendale atthe Stockland shopping centre.</p>
      <p>"Every week I treat myself to 10 $1 scratchies," the winner, who wished to remain anonymous, said. "Last week on Melbourne Cup day I'd had absolutely no luck in the sweeps and then I sat down to scratch my tickets.</p>
      <p>"On about the second last ticket I scratched the winner. I couldn't believe it. I was so thrilled with my $10,000 prize. I've won plenty of prizes over the years but nothing like this. It was very exciting."</p>
      <p>When asked how he planned to enjoy his instant windfall, the man said he would use it to splurge throughout his retirement.</p>
      <p>"I'm not completely sure what I'll do with my prize just yet," he said. "I'll sit on it for a little while but I'm sure I'll find plenty of ways to enjoy it."</p>
      <p>Nextra Glendaleowner Michelle Nash said she was over-the-moon for her regular customer.</p>
      <p>"We are so happy for our winner," she said. "He's been coming to visit us for so long and he is such a deserving winner. Congratulations to him. We are sure he will really enjoy his prize."</p>
