      <p>With <i>Sesame Street</i> due to reach its half-century milestone as its new season premieres on November 16, Grohl’s wholesome ‘Here We Go Song’ has now been shared in full.</p>
      <p>Arriving on YouTube earlier today (November 12), the clip sees Elmo introduce the Foos singer to viewers. “Oh, hi everybody. This is our friend Mr Dave Grohl,” says the iconic character.</p>
      <p>“Hi, it’s nice to come here and be with my friends Big Bird and Elmo,” an enthusiastic Grohl replies. “You know, I was just thinking: there’s friends everywhere, even the ones that you don’t know.”</p>

      <p>Grohl and his new pals then travel to various US locations to meet new friends as the trio perform ‘Here We Go Song’. “<i>All across America, whoa,</i>” they sing in the song’s chorus. “<i>From my street to your street, whoa</i>.”</p>
      <p>Earlier tonight, Foo Fighters shared the video on their official Twitter page. “Here we go <a href="https://twitter.com/sesamestreet">@sesamestreet</a>!” they captioned the post. </p>
      <p>“This better be a new addition to the setlist,” said one fan in the comments section. Another wrote: “I’d heard the Foos were working on a new album… But I never thought this…”</p>
      <p>Grohl previously appeared in 2015’s <i>The Muppets</i> movie, which saw him take part in a drum battle with Animal.</p>
      <p>Foo Fighters, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-foo-fighters-new-b-sides-and-rarities-ep-02050525-2564733">shared a new EP of B-sides called ‘02050525</a>’. It was released in celebration of the band’s 25th anniversary and features ‘Spill’ from the ‘In Your Honour’ era.</p>
