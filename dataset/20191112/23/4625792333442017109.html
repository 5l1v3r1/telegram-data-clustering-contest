      <h1>‘No question’: Bernie Sanders says Ocasio-Cortez would play a role in his White House</h1>

      <p>Bernie Sanders claimed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would “play a very, very important role” in his administration if he becomes president.</p>
      <p>During an interview with ABC News, Sanders, 78, explained that he believes Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most accomplished freshman members in Congress.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know of any person — I’ve been in Congress for a few years — who in the course of less than one year, she’s been in office for less than one year, who’s had more of an impact in American politics as a freshman member of Congress than she has,” said Sanders.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged that the 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez could not be his vice president because of constitutional age limits but noted that he would consider placing her in his Cabinet.</p>
      <p>“At the end of one year, she is a leader in the United States Congress,” he said. “Her ideas are resonating all over this country.”</p>
      <p>He added, “If I am in the White House, she will play a very, very important role. No question.”</p>
