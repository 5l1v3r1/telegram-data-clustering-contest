      </p>
      <p>Chelsea’s manager, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard</a>, has imposed a strict disciplinary regime on his young squad with a range of hefty fines, including £20,000 for being late for the start of training. Players are also charged £500 for every minute they are late to team meetings.</p>
      <p>Any player not reporting an illness or injury before a day off or an hour-and-a-half before training can expect a £10,000 fine, while lateness for treatment, medical appointments or matchday departure will cost £2,500. A phone ringing during a team meal or meeting will set a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a> player back £1,000, as will wearing the wrong clothing for team travel or matchdays.</p>
      <p>It is understood the leaked list of penalties, which is entitled ‘Chelsea FC first team internal player fines season 2019-20’, is accurate. The list is dated 27 August and signed by Lampard.</p>
      <p>The fines are doubled if not paid within 14 days, with the money going towards team activities and charities.</p>
      <p>Other fines include £5,000 for not turning up to fulfil corporate or community duties, the same amount for not travelling back from a match on the team coach without giving 48 hours notice and £1,000 for a late appearance at the gym.</p>
      <p>Lampard took over at Stamford Bridge in the summer and his strict regime appears to be working, with his side lying third in the Premier League table after a run of six straight wins.</p>
