      <h1>Australian who fly-kicked scooter driver in Bali sentenced to 4 months in prison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:10:05+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>An Australian tourist who fly-kicked a motorcyclist and assaulted a man in his own home during a drunken rampage was jailed for four months on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The ruling comes after Nicholas Carr’s antics were caught in <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/australian-man-filmed-fly-kicking-scooter-driver-in-bali-arrested-video/">a viral video</a> that saw him carry out a campaign of destruction in Seminyak.</p>
      <p>“The defendant Nicholas Carr is found guilty and is sentenced to four months in jail,” presiding judge Soebandi told the Denpasar District Court.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for Carr, charged with assault and property damage, said the 26-year-old would not appeal the ruling.</p>
      <p>He is expected to be released next month because of time already served.</p>
      <p>In August, Carr ran barefoot on to a street and shouted expletives before the apprentice builder slammed into the bonnet of a moving car and then fly-kicked an unsuspecting motorcycle rider.</p>
      <p>The biker, who was thrown from the moving scooter, sustained minor injuries – later the pair embraced during a court hearing as Carr apologized to the victim.</p>
      <p>Carr also shattered a convenience store’s glass door before stealing a motorcycle.</p>
      <p>Later, he broke into a house where he assaulted the sleeping homeowner, leaving him with injuries, police said earlier.</p>
      <p>He was eventually caught by locals and police and taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Pictures that circulated on social media showed at the time showed Carr bloodied and bruised, and trussed with hosepipe and rope.</p>
      <p>Shortly after his arrest, Carr apologized and admitted drinking more than 10 small bottles of vodka as well as other alcohol.</p>
      <p>After a string of embarrassing incidents by tourists, <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/bali-governor-warns-disrespectful-tourists-will-be-sent-back-home/">Bali officials recently warned that boorish visitors may be kicked off the island.</a></p>
