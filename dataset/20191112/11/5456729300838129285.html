      <h1>Rat holds up flight in India for 12 hours - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:45:37+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/362419-rat-holds-up-flight-in-india-for-12-hours.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>A domestic flight in India was delayed for nearly 12 hours after a rat was spotted scampering around the aircraft, news reports and officials said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Air India flight AI-952 was preparing for take-off from the southern city of Hyderabad for Vishakapatnam, a coastal city, early on Sunday, when the rodent was seen running around the cabin, the Times of India daily reported.</p>
      <p>Helpless passengers for the flight were forced to stay put at Hyderabad airport all through the day until airline staff managed to get rid of the rat, the report said.</p>
      <p>An Air India official confirmed the incident to dpa, adding that it was being investigated but gave no further details.</p>
      <p>The passengers continued on their journey only after staff carried out a fumigation to sanitise the flight and searched for any possible damage caused by the rat.</p>
      <p>The report said there were ugly scenes at the airport as infuriated passengers checked with airline staff when their flight would take off.</p>
      <p>Several among them took to social media to express their amusement and anger over the incident.</p>
      <p>Rats on planes are reported occasionally and are thought to enter the aircraft most frequently through catering deliveries.</p>
