      <p>The accident took place late on Monday as the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911031077214967-dozens-wounded-in-bus-crash-in-northern-france---reports/">passenger bus</a> was heading from Puno to Juliaca — one of the most popular tourist destinations due to Lake Titikaka tours starting from Puno and the airport being situated in Juliaca, according to the RPP broadcaster.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing, and the number of casualties may later rise, RPP added.</p>
      <p>Fatal road accidents are frequent in Peru due to speeding, poor road conditions and dangerous turns. In early October, 23 people were killed in a bus crash in the southern Cusco region.</p>
