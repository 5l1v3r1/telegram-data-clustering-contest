      <p>The 300-acre studio compound in Atlanta houses 12 soundstages each dedicated to a prominent African American actor/actress.</p>
      <p>In a new video by Architectural Digest the 50-year-old takes us inside the Atlanta Studio.</p>
      <p>In case you didn't know Marvel's <i>Black Panther</i> and <i>The Walking Dead</i> from the AMC Networks were filmed there.</p>
      <p>The lot houses areas that resemble hospitals, pubs, restaurants, hotels and even Madea's house. </p>
      <p>The centrepiece of the studios is the White House, which is used for his new series The Oval. The first of its kind, it is an 80 percent replica of the official residence in Washington.</p>
