      <p>Birmingham Moseley’s unblemished home record this season has restored Billesley Common’s reputation as a graveyard for visiting teams. However, Adam Balding’s seventh-placed team are a lot less comfortable on their National One travels, with Saturday’s defeat at Plymouth being their fourth in five road trips.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In an attempt to avoid the stresses of a long coach journey, the Red and Blacks even braved the M5 on Friday afternoon, hoping to ensure their pre-match preparations to face the Devonians were unhindered. But according to experienced prop Nathanael Titchard-Jones, despite this preventative measure, a sluggish first half during which the visitors conceded three unanswered tries, once again cost them dear.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Going on Friday meant we had eaten, done the physio and pre-activation before going to the ground so we only had to get changed and do our individual warm-ups,” he said. “There was no rushing around and nothing in the way, so we can have no excuses.</p>
      <p>“Our away form is not good enough – we need to find a way to flick the switch so we are fully on the pitch rather than still partly on the coach. That’s one for the players to reflect on and individually analyse, as the coaches have put everything in place so it’s now down to us. “Enough of us have played at Plymouth before to know what to expect from them and their pitch is always heavy in bad weather.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>Room for improvement for Moseley's discipline</h3>
      <p>“It’s a hard place to go, but so are a number of other grounds in National One, so it’s up to us to work out why we’re able to perform so much better at home.” Getting on the wrong side of the referee is another theme which is becoming worryingly <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/moseley-rfc">recurrent for Moseley</a> , who this week lost second-row Danny Wright to the sin-bin.</p>
      <p>As a serving member of the British Army Titchard-Jones knows plenty about the importance of maintaining discipline, and he acknowledged Moseley have much room for improvement. “Ill-discipline is playing a big part in our performances,” he said. “We’ve now had yellow cards in our last three or four games, which has caused us to play with 14 men for 10 or even 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>“We’ve really felt the impact of that, and again it is entirely down to us players. There is nothing the coaches can do about it. “Plymouth were a very physical side and we were brought down to that level and got into a dogfight with them instead of just walking away. “Adam Balding called us in behind the posts late in the first half – we knew what was coming from the coaches at half-time and only had ourselves to blame.”</p>
