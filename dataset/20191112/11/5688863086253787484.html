        <b>India football team’s goalkeeper Gurpeet Singh Sandhu has stated that while he has been convinced that India are a tough nut to crack now, the side needs to score more frequently. The custodian also admitted that the team has been taking some time to properly adapt the philosophy of the coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blue Tigers have conceded just three goals in their opening three <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/fifa_world_cup">FIFA World Cup</a> qualifying matches against Oman, Qatar, and Bangladesh respectively, as they drew two and lost one. And their first choice goalie Sandhu has been of the opinion that the team has evolved into a battle-hardened unit under Ogor Stimac with goals the only ingredient missing.</p>
      <p>“I think, of late, we have turned ourselves into a team which is tough to beat. We just have to add something more to it which is scoring to get the points on the table and we have that quality,” said Gurpreet, reported PTI.</p>
      <p>India would be facing Afghanistan and Oman next and Sandhu has stated both the teams would be posing their own challenges. “Both games are difficult. Oman are a very good side and have quality players, whereas Afghanistan will be tough to play against in Tajikistan. But we have to go there with a strong approach to get something out of the two games,” he added.</p>
      <p>Igor Stimac hasn’t had the best of starts as India’s coach and like skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/sunil_chhetri">Sunil Chhetri</a>, Sandhu also feels that the players would be needing time to get accustomed to his philosophy. “Yes, the team is getting accustomed with the system but most importantly getting used to each other as well playing with the ball,” said Sandhu</p>
      <p>After surrendering a 1-0 lead to a 2-1 defeat against Oman, India went on to churn out a goalless draw against Qatar before being held to a 1-1 draw against Bangladesh. They would be playing Afghanistan away from home on November 14 and Oman on November 20 next.</p>
