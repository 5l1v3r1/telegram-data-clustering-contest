      <p>CAMARILLO, Calif. (KABC) -- The <a href="https://abc7.com/society/wwii-sub-found-bringing-closure-to-camarillo-woman/5688924/">USS Grayback</a> was one of the most successful American attack submarines in the Pacific Theater in World War II.<br/><br/>When it sailed out of Pearl Harbor on it's 10th combat patrol in January 1944, it never returned.<br/><br/>Now 75 years later, a deep water search team has found the submarine and the crew of 80 it carried.<br/><br/>Among the first people to hear the news and see footage of the undersea wreckage was Kathy Taylor of Camarillo.<br/><br/>For 75 years, Taylor hasn't stopped looking for John Patrick King.<br/><br/>"I didn't want him to be forgotten," she said. "He was my uncle, he was my godfather. He was there for me."<br/><br/>Her uncle and godfather was an electrician's mate, third class, when his submarine, the USS Grayback, went missing during WWII.<br/><br/>Taylor's family received a telegram when he went missing in action decades ago.<br/><br/>Decades later, private explorers set out to find it.<br/><br/>"It was just exciting to know that somebody was looking for it," Taylor said.<br/><br/>This past week, Taylor flew to the East Coast to meet with members of the Lost 52 project.<br/><br/>But she wasn't expecting they'd find her uncle's missing vessel so soon.<br/><br/>The submarine was likely bombed when it left Pearl Harbor. The USS Grayback now sits somewhere south of Okinawa, Japan.<br/><br/>Taylor says the coordinates won't be released and there are no plans to excavate the boat, but the warship is still intact. Its namesake plaque still shines on the bow.<br/><br/>"You know I came in here after I got home and said 'We know where you are.' And that's some bit of closure," Taylor said. "But at the same time it's also a sad reckoning because now I'm an adult and I understand the meaning of being lost."<br/><br/>The Lost 52 Project has now found five of the 52 missing vessels of WWII.<br/><br/>"It's very vital that we remember them and that they feel that they haven't been forgotten," said Christine Dennison of the Lost 52 project. "That their sacrifice wasn't in vain."</p>
