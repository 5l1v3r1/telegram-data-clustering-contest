      <p>The moment we've all been waiting for is here, folks: the brand new Sonic the Hedgehog movie trailer has officially landed.</p>
      <p>When the first <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/12/the_upcoming_sonic_movie_has_received_its_first_poster_and_its_strangely_muscular">images</a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/sonic_the_hedgehog_movie_gets_its_first_official_trailer_and_its_definitely_something">trailer</a> were revealed for the upcoming Sonic movie earlier this year, it's pretty safe to say that <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/random_phew_the_internet_is_fixing_that_terrible_sonic_movie_trailer">fans weren't impressed</a> with the blue blur's design. It caused so much of a stink online that the movie's creators <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/05/sonic_movie_director_promises_to_change_controversial_design">felt the need to scrap Sonic's look altogether</a> and give him a new coat of paint.</p>
      <p>Now, we can finally see the new redesign in action, and we have to say we definitely prefer this to the original. As you can see, the film is now expected to hit theatres on 14th February 2020. Here's the new official poster:</p>

      <p><b>Update:</b> Sonic creator Yuji Naka has <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/sonic_creator_yuji_naka_comments_on_the_movies_redesign">commented on the new design</a>, and he seems mostly pleased.</p>
