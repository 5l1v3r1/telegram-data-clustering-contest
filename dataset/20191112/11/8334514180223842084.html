      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 60% of federal oil and gas drilling leases offered since 2017 are located in areas that are at risk of shortages and droughts, according to a report released on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The report from the left-leaning Center for American Progress argued an increase in drilling in these areas could worsen water shortages, a potential problem for ranchers, farmers, and municipalities, because it requires vast amounts of water.</p>
      <p>“Oil and gas leasing in water-stressed areas has been largely unscrutinized but poses threats to water users across the West,” report author Jenny Rowland Shea said.</p>
      <p>Oil and gas producers using the hydraulic fracturing process typically pump a concoction of water, chemicals and proppants into underground reservoirs to break open rock formations and increase pressure, forcing hydrocarbons to the surface.</p>
      <p>A proppant is a material such as sand used to prop open the underground cracks from which oil and natural gas can then be harvested during the fracturing process.</p>
      <p>The average fracking job now consumes 13 million gallons (49 million liters) of water, up 40% in two years <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-water/wastewater-private-equitys-new-black-gold-in-u-s-shale-idUSKCN1QZ0B6,">here</a> according to a Reuters analysis of Permian producers’ data reported to FracFocus.org.</p>
      <p>The Center For American Progress report analyzed leasing data from the Interior Department and a water risk map from the World Resources Institute.</p>
      <p>In Nevada, 1,050 of 1,122 drilling leases were offered in areas of “high” or “extremely high” water stress, according to the report. In New Mexico, the heart of the Permian Basin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shale-water/wastewater-private-equitys-new-black-gold-in-u-s-shale-idUSKCN1QZ0B6">here</a> oil boom, 387 of 402 leases under the Trump administration, or 95%, are located in “extremely high” water-stress areas, it said.</p>
      <p>The report urged the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management to weigh the impact of drilling on local water use in its permitting decisions.</p>
      <p>“With climate change increasing water scarcity in much of the West, consideration of energy development impacts on watersheds can no longer be optional,” Rowland Shea said.</p>
