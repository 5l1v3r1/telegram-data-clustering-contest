      <p><b>The Twitter boss expressed his joy</b>, stating that Twitter had grown and evolved from a platform which was created for interactions and social engagements 13 years ago to what is used by millions of young people across the world to make a difference in areas of entrepreneurship, news dissemination and crusade for social justice.</p>

      <p><b>Mr Dorsey stated the </b>purpose for his visit to Nigeria, is to interact with the youth so as to improve on the services provided by Twitter through observations and comments from the users of the platform.</p>
      <p><b>Dr Iweala in her statement</b> encouraged Nigerian youths not to await the creation of jobs by any individual, but should explore social media platforms to create jobs for themselves and for others. Dr Iweala commended young Nigerian entrepreneurs who have leveraged on social media platforms to create employment opportunities in various sectors of the economy.</p>
      <p><b>The former minister </b>expressed excitement about the future of Nigeria and stated that Nigerian youths are vibrant and dynamic in their approach to social media, taking advantage of the platforms to combat economic challenges.</p>
      <p>“<i>The point I want to make is that Jack believes that twitter can serve as a platform for young people to create jobs for themselves and for others. That can have a big impact on employment and that is why we wanted him to come to Nigeria so that he can do things for our youths.”</i></p>
      <p><i>“We are glad he is here and you can see some of the young entrepreneurs who have spoken on what they have been using twitter to do, creating jobs for themselves and for others,” </i>Dr Iweala said.</p>
