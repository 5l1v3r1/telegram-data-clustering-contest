      <p>When you're scrolling through Facebook's app, the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-bug-has-camera-activated-while-people-are-using-the-app/">social network could be watching you back</a>, in more ways than just your data, concerned users have found. Multiple people have found and reported that their iPhone cameras were turned on in the background while looking at their feed. From a report:<i> The issue came to light with several posts on Twitter, showing that their cameras were activated behind Facebook's app as they were watching videos or looking at photos on the social network. After clicking on the video to full screen, returning it back to normal would create a bug where Facebook's mobile layout was slightly shifted to the right. With the open space on the left, you could now see the phone's camera activated in the background. This was documented in multiple cases, with the earliest incident on November 2.</i></p>
