      <p>Daniel Hazan, a driver on the 340 bus line, said he had just dropped his last passenger and was hoping to relax a little when the rocket hit the road ahead of him, the <i>Times of Israel </i><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/video-emerges-of-bus-driver-witnessing-the-moment-rocket-strikes-highway/">reports</a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>“I have been shaking until now,” Hazan told Channel 12 news. “I picked up my coffee to drink a little while waiting for the traffic light to turn green, when suddenly the rocket hit.</p>
      <p>“There was no siren. I didn’t hear anything. The rocket just fell. I am shaking,” he says. Watch the impact below:</p>

      <p>There were no reports of casualties from the incident.</p>
      <p>The terror strike against Israel came in retaliation for the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2019/11/12/50-rockets-fired-at-israel-after-idf-eliminates-gaza-terror-leader/">assassination</a> of Palestinian Islamic Jihad senior commander Baha Abu al-Ata by Israeli military forces.</p>
      <p>Approximately 50 rockets and mortar shells were fired from the Gaza Strip at central and southern Israel on Tuesday as of 9:10 a.m., according to the IDF. Soldiers operating the Iron Dome missile defense system shot down 20 of those incoming projectiles, the military said.</p>
