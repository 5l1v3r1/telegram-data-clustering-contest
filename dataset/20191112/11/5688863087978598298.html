      <h1>Commonwealth Games Federation CEO likely to keep shooting out of CWG 2022</h1>

        <b>Even after prolonged tensions concerning Indian Olympic Associations’ threat to pull out of the Commonwealth Games 2022, the CGF CEO would most likely keep shooting out of the Games. The decision would be conveyed to Indian Olympic Association chief Narinder Batra in Thursday's meeting.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the likes of India and Australia protesting about England’s decision to exclude shooting from the CWG 2022, which they would be hosting, reports have emerged that the federation would go ahead with the scheduled plans and inform Batra about the same in the meeting in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>“I think we have been fairly clear of our constitution and the jurisdiction of the host country. The decision to drop shooting is their (Birmingham organising committee) recommendation and it is their decision. They have been very clear where they stand on this,” said Grevemberg, reported The Times of India.</p>
      <p>However, CGF hasn’t ruled out the idea of hosting the sport in some other form and has been open to discussion about its future in Games.</p>
      <p>“There may be some potential opportunities other than the 2022 CWG, like organising a Commonwealth Shooting Championships, which the ISSF (international shooting body) would need to help conduct. Also, this could be discussed for the 2026 Games and beyond,” he added.</p>
      <p>With India taking a strong stance against the exclusion of shooting, their strongest discipline on world stage, Grevemberg has stressed upon the importance of having a dialogue over. Grevemberg has suggested the two parties needed to “find solutions together” as no country or sport is bigger than the CWG constitution.</p>
