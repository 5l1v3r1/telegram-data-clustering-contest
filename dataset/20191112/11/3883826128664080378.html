        <b>The Financial Times has named its first female editor since it was founded in 1888.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Roula Khalaf will take over from Lionel Barber, who announced on Tuesday that he would leave in January after 34 years at the pink-coloured financial newspaper.</p>
      <p>Ms Khalaf, his deputy, said she was "thrilled" to be running "the greatest news organisation in the world".</p>
      <p>The FT was sold<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33636321"> to Japanese media firm Nikkei in 2015</a> by publisher Pearson.</p>
      <p>Tsuneo Kita, chairman of Nikkei, said: "I have full confidence that she will continue the FT's mission to deliver quality journalism without fear and without favour."</p>

      <p>Ms Khalaf has been with the FT for 24 years. Her roles have included running its Middle East coverage during the Iraq war and the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>
      <p>She has been the deputy editor since 2016, overseeing strategic planning and the launch of "Trade Secrets", which covers global trade.</p>
      <p>Mr Barber said he was leaving "the best job in journalism" after a 14-year tenure and 34 years at the paper.</p>

      <p>He is the longest-serving UK national newspaper editor and led a push into online subscription that is regarded as having helped the business during a period when traditional newspaper sales have been falling.</p>
      <p>"When I took over as editor, I pledged to restore the gold standard in the FT's reporting and commentary and to help the board build a sustainably profitable business," Mr Barber said.</p>
      <p>Mr Kita said he had "strong personal trust" in Mr Barber. "It's very sad to see him leave the FT. However, both of us agree it is time to open a new chapter," he said.</p>
      <p>The FT's print circulation is about 166,000 a day. In April, it said it had achieved one million paying readers, including digital subscribers.</p>
