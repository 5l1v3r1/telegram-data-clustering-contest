        <b>Long-term unemployment has risen in Sweden for the first time in 16 months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 148,000 people in the country had been unemployed for at least a full year by the end of October 2019, according to the latest figures from the Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsförmedlingen).</p>
      <p>That was an increase of 2,000 people compared to the same time last year, the first time that long-term unemployment had risen since summer 2018.</p>

      <p>And the total number of people without a job had risen by 17,000 in a year, reaching almost 358,000. That equates to an unemployment rate of 7.1 percent, up from 6.9 percent at the same time 12 months ago.</p>
      <p>For the fourth month in a row, the rate of increase itself rose compared to the same months in 2018, meaning that unemployment is growing at an ever faster rate.</p>
      <p>"In order to reduce long-term unemployment, a combination of different efforts are needed. It's partly a question of adult education, but it's also about different forms of subsidized employment," said Swedish Public Employment Service analyst Annika Sundén.</p>
      <p>The groups most likely to be affected by unemployment are those born outside Europe, those without high school education, and people aged over 55, according to the same figures.</p>
