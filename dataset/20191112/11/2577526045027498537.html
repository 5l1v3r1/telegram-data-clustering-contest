      <h1>The New Sonic The Hedgehog Trailer is Here and Oh My God it's So Much Better</h1>

      <p>A new trailer for next year's Sonic the Hedgehog movie has just dropped, and I'm not sure what there is to say except <i>thank God</i>. The video, which I've embedded below, is another teaser for the film, but also doubles up as our first look at the new-and-improved version of our furry blue friend.</p>

      <p>Cast your mind back to May, and you might remember the <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/04/30/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-looks-uh">frankly horrifying design</a> that Paramount had come up with. That version of Sonic remains horrifying to this day, and fan outcry saw filmmakers decide to <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/05/03/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-design-to-be-changed-following-criticism">delay the film in order to redesign the character</a>.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, it would seem that their efforts have not been in vain, as the new Sonic is far easier on the eyes. Those teeth are gone, for one thing, and the eyes are much better. I'm still not 100% sure on the length of his legs, but overall, this is much less likely to haunt my dreams for the next several months.</p>
      <p>The trailer also offers more time to revel in Jim Carrey's excellent Dr Robotnik, even treating us to a <i>Footloose</i>-esque dance number around the 1:30 mark. <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> arrives in cinemas on February 14.</p>
