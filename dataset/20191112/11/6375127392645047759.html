      <h1>Lovi wants to explore the world before settling down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:12:18+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>LOVI Poe says the rumor that she is moving to ABS-CBN is not true. “I just appeared there to promote my new movie, ‘The Annulment’,” she says. “But I just did GMA-7’s ‘Magpakailanman’ episode ‘Pati Ba Pintig ng Puso’ and may bago raw akong soap na gagawin so, Kapuso pa rin po ako.”</h3>
      <p>Lovi is very open in admitting that she’s now in a long-distance relationship with Monty Blencowe, a movie producer and medical researcher from England who is currently based in the U.S.</p>
      <p>“I met him in Los Angeles and our friendship just grew,” she adds. “He is a nice and good person, an old soul, so nagkasundo agad kami and we’re just sharing this moment together even while we’re far away from each other. Thanks to modern technology and the internet, we can still easily communicate with each other constantly.”  </p>
      <p>Monty got to visit her recently and Lovi toured him around. “It’s his first visit to the Philippines and I took him to Boracay and to Samal Island in Davao na gandang-ganda siya. He also got to meet my mother, who has nothing but good words for him.”</p>
      <p>Before Monty, she was on with a Filipino-French guy, Chris Johnson. What happened to them? “We dated for almost two years but it just didn’t work out for us. But we are still on good terms. He’s okay, wala akong masasabing masama sa kanya, talaga lang we’re not meant for each other. Now, with Monty, we’re hoping for the best.”</p>
      <p>What is she looking for in a guy? “First and foremost, he has to understand that my career is  one of my top priorities. I don’t want someone dictating on me and asking me to stop what I’m doing. Ayoko nung sasabihan ako kung ano ang puede kong gawin on screen. I can’t see myself sacrificing my career for love. Kamukha rito sa ‘The Annulment’, I have very daring love scenes with Joem Bascon as we play husband and wife in the movie, so hindi mo ko puedeng sabihan na huwag mong gawin yan.”</p>
      <p>She also doesn’t see herself getting married in the near future. “Although I’m happy to see my friends being happily married, the idea of me also becoming a wife has not crossed my mind yet. I believe in people who love each other, and make things work after making that commitment in marriage, but in my case, there’s still a lot of things I want to do at talagang hindi pa ako ready to settle down and start my own family. I want to take my time and explore the world, travel to new places, meet new people, so there’s really no need to rush.”</p>
      <p>In “The Annulment”, she plays Gari, a teacher who falls in love with Joem Bascon as Sherwin after a whirlwind romance. She sees some faults in Joem but she tells herself that she can make him change for the better after they get married. But it didn’t happen, he still drinks a lot and has no drive in life, so their marriage suffers and she seeks an annulment.</p>
      <p>“You know, making this movie is an eye-opener for me as it made me realize just how hard it is to keep a relationship going. So before taking the plunge, you have to make sure that you’re really right for each other. What happens to our characters is something I wouldn’t wish to happen even to my worst enemies. Masyadong masakit ang pinagdaanan ng characters namin ni Joem dito.”</p>
      <p>“The Annulment”, directed by McArthur Alejandre, will open  in theaters nationwide this Wednesday.</p>
