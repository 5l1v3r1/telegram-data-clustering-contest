      <p>SINGAPORE: A moving services company director who tried to scrimp on disposal fees ended up paying far more for illegally dumping bulky furniture.</p>
      <p>The man was fined S$9,000 last Thursday (Nov 7) for dumping more than 20 pieces of bulky furniture along Jalan Terusan in Jurong, said the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>NEA officers found the illegally dumped furniture during "routine surveillance", and traced it to the director.</p>
      <p>Investigations found that the man had provided moving services on Sep 30 last year to a customer. Instead of sending the unwanted furniture to a second-hand dealer or recycler, he decided to save on the disposal fee and dumped the furniture along Jalan Terusan.</p>
      <p>A photo provided by the NEA showed a pile of haphazardly stacked office chairs by the roadside.</p>
      <p>The man was charged with dumping waste from a vehicle in a public place under the Environmental Public Health Act.</p>
      <p>He could have been fined up to S$50,000 and jailed for up to 12 months. For repeat offenders, the fine may be as high as S$100,000.</p>
      <p>"Illegal dumping of waste in a public place is a serious offence as it causes pollution and public health hazards," said NEA in a media release.</p>
      <p>In response to CNA's queries, NEA declined to provide details on the identities of the company and director involved.</p>
      <p>The agency said it welcomes tip-offs from members of the public on illegal dumping activities.</p>
      <p>The number of illegal dumping cases fell from 160 in 2000 to 53 cases last year, it added.</p>
