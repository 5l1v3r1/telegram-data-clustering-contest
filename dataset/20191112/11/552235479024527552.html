      <h2>Christopher Nicol's body must be kept in the mortuary while police probe his murder but his distraught mum believes someone in the Greenock community is sheltering the killer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:40:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Rodger, Lorraine Tinney</a></address>
      <p>A mum whose son was brutally murdered in front of his children told of her heartache that a funeral cannot be held until the killer is caught.</p>
      <p>Christopher Nicol, 27, was stabbed to death in his own home in front of his two kids during a botched robbery four weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He was at home with his girlfriend Courtney Lowe and his two children, Amylynn, aged six, and Darren, aged five, when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dad-murdered-as-children-coloured-20378974">a masked man burst in and attacked him with a knife</a> on September 26 - and is believed to have said 'sorry' as he fled.</p>
      <p>In the moments before the brutal attack, Christopher had been helping Darren with his colouring book while Amylynn was in the kitchen helping to make dinner.</p>
      <p>Cops launched a manhunt but Christopher's distraught mum, Karen Nicol, 52, believes someone in the community in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock">Greenock</a> , Inverclyde, is <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/heartbroken-family-greenock-dad-stabbed-20560480">sheltering the killer</a> .</p>
      <p>Heartbroken mum Karen, from Dunoon, Argyll, said she cannot get closure or say goodbye to her son until she holds his funeral.</p>
      <p>For legal reasons, Christopher's body has to remain in the mortuary while detectives continue to search for his killer.</p>

      <p>Karen said :"It's so upsetting that no-one is saying anything.</p>
      <p>"He knew so many people.</p>
      <p>"Somebody has got to be hiding this person, someone's got to be feeding him.</p>
      <p>"He is an absolute scumbag, a rat.</p>
      <p>"If it was one of my kids who had done that I would hand him in, especially for doing it in front of kids. It's evil.</p>
      <p>"I don't know why he didn't realise that kids were there, didn't go back out and run away.</p>
      <p>"He took away a daddy, a son, a brother, then he's got the cheek to turn round and say 'sorry'.</p>
      <p>"It's an insult.</p>
      <p>"He could be out there, he could walk past me and know who I am but I don't have a clue who he is.</p>
      <p>"Is he going to do it again?</p>
      <p>"What if it's a child this time, is he going to stab them?</p>
      <p>"He's got no morals."</p>

      <p>Karen, who also has another son Craig, 33, and daughter Demilynn, 24, said Christopher's death has devastated the whole family.</p>
      <p>She lived in Greenock until moving to Dunoon 18 years ago, but Christopher moved back to Inverclyde when he met ex-partner Kathleen, whose daughter Jasmine he was a stepdad to.</p>
      <p>Karen believes her son may have been targeted in a botched robbery, for £1,000 he inherited from his grandfather.</p>
      <p>She said: "When my dad passed away he left all the grandkids £1,000.</p>
      <p>"Christopher said he wasn't going to spend it, he said he would save it to take the kids on holiday.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I can think of is if he's said that to anyone."</p>
      <p>She urged anyone sheltering the killer to turn them into police.</p>
      <p>Karen added: "It just takes one person to get a conscience.</p>
      <p>"It won't bring Christopher back but it would make me feel as if justice has been done.</p>
      <p>"If this guy is never found, it will kill me.</p>
      <p>"I hate the idea of him lying up there on his own.</p>
      <p>"I want him home with me here.</p>
      <p>"I visited in the mortuary last Friday and placed a St Christopher on his chest and I promised him that I would get the man who killed him.</p>
      <p>"I've been living in limbo since it happened.</p>
      <p>"My heart has been totally ripped out.</p>
      <p>"I lost my dad last year and we weren't even over that, and now to get this a year later.</p>
      <p>"We are a small family and losing Christopher has had a ripple effect.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing how many people are suffering because of this one incident, it's really affected so many people.</p>
      <p>"As soon as I close my eyes, the tears just start streaming down my face.</p>
      <p>"I just miss him so much.</p>
      <p>"The children doted on him and he doted on them.</p>
      <p>"Him and Darren were more like buddies, he was a big kid at heart and Amylynn is a daddy's girl.</p>
      <p>"He used to say he was lost between a Monday and Friday without the kids.</p>
      <p>"He had them all during the school holidays and took them to safari parks, trips to the seaside, down to Largs.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't just money he was spending on them, he enjoyed being with them.</p>
      <p>"The worst thing is seeing the pain they're going through.</p>
      <p>"Darren said: 'Nanna I miss my daddy, that was your son', and they ask when will he be coming back.</p>
      <p>"When their grandad died they said he went to heaven and their gran's up in heaven but when they talk about Christopher, they say 'the bad man killed my daddy'.</p>
      <p>"It breaks my heart when they keep asking if he'll be coming back.</p>
      <p>"When you cuddle in you feel their wee tears on you."</p>
