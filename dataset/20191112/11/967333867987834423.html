      <h1>Russian Oil Production Cost One of World’s Most Expensive, Aramco Says</h1>

        <b>Earlier in November, Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority (CMA) approved the initial public offering (IPO) of the kingdom’s state oil giant Aramco, in a move that the CMA said would be valid for at least six months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oil production in Russia remains expensive compared to other parts of the world, according to <a href="https://www.saudiaramco.com/-/media/images/investors/saudi-aramco-prospectus-en.pdf">the just-published Saudi Aramco initial public offering (IPO) prospectus</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The document placed Russia on a top-ten list in terms of crude production costs which stand at $42 and $44 per barrel price tags pertaining to the country’s land and offshore projects, respectively.</blockquote>
      <p>However, extraction is even more expensive in the US, as well as India, China, Azerbaijan, Angola, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The prospectus claimed that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait can boast the lowest costs associated with crude production, where the cost to producers of extracting oil is only about $17 per barrel.</p>
      <blockquote>According to the document, the evaluation was conducted on the basis of the so-called break-even price of oil, which stipulates that project crude production is permissibly cost-effective.</blockquote>
      <p>Aramco’s prospectus was published after Saudi Arabia’s Capital Market Authority <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911021077205184-saudi-crown-prince-approves-ipo-aramco-sunday/">(CMA) approved the IPO of the kingdom’s oil giant earlier in November</a>. This was preceded by Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman greenlighting Aramco’s IPO, in line with his plan to shake up the kingdom’s economy and diversify away from oil.</p>
      <p>Russia’s Federal Service for State Statistics (Rosstat), meanwhile, reported that the country’s total oil production cost in the second quarter of 2019 amounted to 2,508 roubles per barrel, or $31.9 in line with the average exchange rate for the quarter.</p>
