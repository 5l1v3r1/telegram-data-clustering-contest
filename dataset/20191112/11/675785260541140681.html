      <h2>England trained at St George's Park on Tuesday after the row between Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez which has seen Sterling dropped from the squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:13:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, James Whaling, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez trained at St George’s Park today sporting a scratch below his right eye.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez appeared to have a small mark from his bust-up with Raheem Sterling on Monday.</p>
      <p>But Sterling also trained this morning despite Gareth Southgate deciding to make him unavailable for Thursday’s game with Montenegro after the row.</p>
      <p>Both sides have played down the physical side of the row and they have made peace with Gomez believed to have urged Southgate not to send Sterling home.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Southgate initially clashed during Liverpool's victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield on Sunday.</p>

      <p>The players were involved in a heated exchange towards the end of the game, but embraced after the full-time whistle.</p>
      <p>But emotions were still running high when the duo joined up for England duty at St George's Park on Monday.</p>

      <p>Sterling reacted badly as Gomez offered a handshake from behind leading to a verbal altercation between them.</p>
      <p>Some England stars stepped in to separate the duo after realising the incident was not friendly banter as initially thought.</p>

      <p>Sterling moved to play down the altercation having been stood down from duty for the Montenegro clash, appearing the situation has been defused.</p>
      <p>He wrote on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account: "First and foremost everyone knows what that game means to me! Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point. Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me. <br/>Sterling added that he and Gomez "are good" and "both understand it was a 5-10 second thing it's done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's focus on our game on Thursday," he signed off, alongside three love heart emojis.</p>
