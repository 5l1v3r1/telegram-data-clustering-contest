      <p>Pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deepak-Chahar">Deepak Chahar</a> almost did a repeat of his hat-trick feat against Bangladesh a couple of days ago. Playing for Rajasthan against Vidarbha in a Group B game of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Syed-Mushtaq-Ali-Trophy">Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy</a> T20 tournament at Sports Hub in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday afternoon, Chahar took three wickets off three consecutive legal deliveries but in between those wickets he bowled a wide.</p>
      <p>On Sunday in the third T20I between India and Bangladesh in Nagpur, Chahar had recorded the best bowling figures in T20I, taking 6/7, which included a hat-trick.</p>

      <p>In a match reduced to 13 overs at Sports Hub, Chahar, bowling the final over of the Vidarbha innings, removed Darshan Nalkande of the fourth ball, then bowled a wide, before proceeding to dismiss <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shrikant-Wagh">Shrikant Wagh</a> and Akshay Wadkar in the final two deliveries. The wide in between the three wickets meant Chahar's (4/18) feat could not be considered a hat-trick. Even though there is no official definition of what constitutes a hat-trick in cricket, the general understanding is that a bowler has to take wickets off three consecutive deliveries (legal or illegal) for it to be construed as a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Despite Chahar's brilliance, Rajasthan went on to lose the game. Vidarbha finished their innings at 99/9. Chasing a VJD-adjusted target of 107, Rajasthan fell one run short at 105/8. With this win, Vidarbha maintained their 100 percent record.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, seamer Ankit Rajpoot's five-wicket haul (5/17) helped Uttar Pradesh beat Tripura by seven wickets in the other Group B game which was reduced a six-over affair at St Xavier's College Ground, Thumba.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kerala ride on Sachin's brilliance</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sachin Baby continued his good run with the bat to set up Kerala's big 75-run win against Manipur in another Group B match.</p>
      <p>Sachin, who had hit a fifty in the last game, scored 48 off 35 balls (5x4, 1x6) as Kerala posted 149/9 after being put into bat. The total would not have been satisfying for the Kerala camp but the Manipur batting did not measure up to the challenge meandering to 74/7 in 20 overs. Leg-spinner Midhun S took 4 wickets conceding just five runs and he was backed by the experienced off-spinner Jalaj Saxena (1/9) who also did not give away anything.</p>
      <p>Sanju Samson returned for Kerala after India commitments but fell for 12. Skipper Robin Uthappa finally showed some glimpse of form in his 24-ball 29. The 65-run stand for the fourth wicket between Sachin and Uthappa formed the bedrock of the Kerala innings.</p>
      <p>With their second win in three games, Kerala are now third in the group behind Vidarbha and Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p><b>Brief scores: </b>Vidarbha 99/9 in 13 overs (Deepak Chahar 4/18) bt Rajasthan 105/8 in 13 overs (Manender Singh 44; Akshay Wakhare 3/15) by 1 run (VJD method). Vidarbha: 4 points, Rajasthan: 0.</p>
      <p>Kerala 149/9 in 20 overs (Sachin Baby 48; Thomas Moirangthem 3/35, BS Konthoujam 3/28, LA Singh 2/16) bt Manipur 74 /7 in 20 overs (Midhun S 4/5) by 75 runs. Kerala: 4 points, Manipur: 0.</p>
      <p>Tripura 49/6 in 6 overs (Ankit Rajpoot 5/17) lost to UP 50/3 in 5.2 overs by 7 wickets. UP: 4 points, Tripura: 0 points.</p>
