      <p>South Africa’s state-owned airline South African Airways (SAA) could cut more than 900 jobs as it restructures to stem severe financial losses, the airline said in a statement.</p>
      <p>SAA said it had started consultations with its more than 5,000 staff and was talking to labour unions.</p>
      <p>The airline has not made an annual profit since 2011 and is grappling with severe funding difficulties and an inefficient and ageing fleet of airplanes.</p>
      <aside>No final decision will be taken until the consultation process is concluded. However, it is estimated that approximately 944 employees may be affected.</aside>
      <p>South African officials have been searching for an investor to take a stake in the airline, but their efforts have so far been unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>“We urgently need to address the ongoing loss-making position that has subsisted over the past years. That is why we are undergoing a restructuring,” said SAA acting-Chief Executive Zuks Ramasia.</p>
      <p>“No final decision will be taken until the consultation process is concluded. However, it is estimated that approximately 944 employees may be affected.”</p>
      <p>In a dramatic fall from grace over the past decade, SAA has lost its place as Africa’s biggest airline and a symbol of patriotic pride to become a source of frustration for taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Analysts have long said its workforce should be cut to bring it in line with regional competitors.</p>
