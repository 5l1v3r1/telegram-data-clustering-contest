      <h1>Man gives girlfriend's upset pal kind gift - but some say he has ulterior motive</h1>
      <h2>A woman took to social media to share the sweet gesture her boyfriend made for her heartbroken pal, but her post was met with backlash from many people</h2>

      <p>As the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/spice-girls">Spice Girls</a> once said, "If you're gonna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends..."</p>
      <p>It seems one man knows this only too well, as he recently went out of his way to help cheer up one of his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dating">girlfriend's</a> close pals.</p>
      <p>But the internet seemed to think there was more to his sweet gesture than meets the eye.</p>
      <p>Abigail Gibson, a student at Bull State University in Indiana, caused controversy on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after sharing a tweet about her best friend and her boyfriend.</p>

      <p>The 21-year-old revealed how her best friend Stephanie had recently been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cheating">cheated</a> on and she was understandably devastated.</p>
      <p>Abigail's boyfriend, Max, also 21, thought it would be nice to do something to cheer Stephanie up and prove that all guys weren't awful.</p>
      <p>So he gave the heartbroken girl a bunch of flowers.</p>
      <p>His girlfriend was touched that he cared enough about her friends to do something like this and shared the whole thing online.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She wrote: "My best friend was cheated on by her boyfriend and MY boyfriend bought her flowers to show her that she deserves better than a cheater.</p>
      <p>"He knows if he's dating me, he's dating my best friends."</p>
      <p>Her post quickly went <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/viral">viral,</a> garnering over 21,000 likes and hundreds of comments.</p>
      <p>While some praised Max, many suggested he may have had an ulterior motive for his actions - namely they thought he was sleeping with Stephanie.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Your boyfriend's shagging your bestpal," replied one user.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Ma'am why couldn't you just buy your BFF the flowers and your BF introduce her to one of his homies. Y'all in a lil love triangle now."</p>
      <p>A third person questioned: "That's sweet, but who's gonna buy you flowers when they end up smashing?"</p>
      <p>Someone else added: "Who gonna tell her?"</p>
      <p>However not everyone thought this way, a different user replied: "If your friendships are healthy and your relationship is healthy you would understand the pure love in this."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Abigail said she was "shocked" by the reaction to her post.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/boyfriend-bought-flowers-for-her-friend-twitter-backlash">Buzzfeed News,</a> the student said: "I didn't think the tweet would get so much backlash.</p>
      <p>"Max messaged me and asked if buying her flowers would be creepy. I didn't think it would come off creepy or overstepping, especially since they're close friends."</p>
      <p>She added: "I meant it more as a metaphor... my friends are his friends.</p>
      <p>"Max has a heart of gold and cares about the people I keep close to me, which is everything I could ask for in a boyfriend."</p>
