      <h1>Devastating injury prognosis for Jonathan Davies, but at least Rhys Patchell should be back sooner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:25:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/six-major-issues-on-wayne-pivacs-wales-to-do-list/">Wales’ Six Nations title defence</a> has been dealt a huge early blow as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales/players/jonathan-davies/">Jonathan Davies</a> will miss the entire championship through injury.</p>
      <p>An ever-present during the 2019 Grand Slam success under Warren Gatland, the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/scarlets">Scarlets</a> centre will now miss Wayne Pivac’s first campaign in charge as Wales’ new boss.</p>
      <p>In a media statement released on Tuesday morning by Scarlets, it was reported that Davies faces surgery following an injury sustained at the recent World Cup where <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> finished in fourth place after semi-final defeat to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> was followed by the loss to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> in the third-place play-off.</p>
      <p>‘Jonathan Davies faces at least six months recovering from knee surgery,’ ready the Scarlets release, a prognosis that leaves him doubtful to play any part in his club’s season, never mind help out his former boss Pivac as he switches from regional to Test level coaching.</p>
      <p>Confirmation of Davies’ lengthy lay-off was accompanied by further bad injury news concerning Rhys Patchell.</p>

      <p>He too is facing surgery and while the lay-off isn’t as considerable as it is for Davies, he still won’t be available for the early stages of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> which opens at home to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy">Italy</a> on February 1 and is followed a week later by the visit to Ireland.</p>
      <p>“Rhys Patchell is expected to return to play between 12-16 weeks following a shoulder injury,” read the Scarlets statement.</p>
