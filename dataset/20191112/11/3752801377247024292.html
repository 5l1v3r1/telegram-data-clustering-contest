      <p>A shooting in the early hours of Tuesday morning has left four people dead in a house in Mitchells Plain.</p>
      <p>Western Cape police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said Anti-Gang Unit officers and crime scene experts were combing the scene for clues following the shooting which saw three men and a woman - aged between 30 and 32 - gunned down.</p>
      <p>"Reports at the disposal of police indicate that the victims were in a house in Hazeldene Street in Portlands when a vehicle with occupants pulled up. Three suspects got into the premises and fired multiple shots before they fled," Potelwa said.</p>
      <p>"Investigations by detectives are looking into all possibilities, including indications this could be gang related."</p>

      <p>Bianca Alexander and Mandy Samuels had been lying in a makeshift bedroom with Samuels' daughter, Toslin, 10, between them when shooters entered their shack and opened fire indiscriminately.</p>
      <p>Bianca's son, Adrian "AJ" Alexander, 12, was shot in the neck and Samuels' son, Malcolm Junior "MJ" Samuels, 12, was shot in the face. The boys had fallen asleep on a couch opposite the doorway.</p>
      <p>Vineto Africa, 19, was killed when he was shot in the face while lying on a bed in the same room as the boys. He is believed to have been the target of the shooting.</p>
      <p>Toslin was shot and died instantly, while family members told News24 that the women had managed to escape when the shooters were forced to reload after running out of ammunition.</p>
      <p>Alleged gangsters Peter Nokewes and Rowan Stuurman have been arrested and charged with the murders. Stuurman has denied it, claiming in an affidavit that he <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/alleged-gunman-behind-elsies-river-massacre-claims-he-saw-real-shooters-flee-scene-20191101">saw the real gunmen flee</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Magistrate Ricardo Phillips, who is hearing the pair's bail application, a similar shooting also took place earlier this year in the Goodwood Magistrate’s Court’s jurisdiction.</p>
