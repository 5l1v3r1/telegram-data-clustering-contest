      <p>Ondina teamed up with Nate's Honor Animal Rescue in Bradenton to get her “puppquets." Instead of flowers, her bridesmaids held the adoptable, and adorable, little 5-week-old puppies.</p>
      <p>"I knew our dream wedding would not be complete if we were not helping to bring awareness to a cause near and dear to our hearts," Ondina said on Facebook.</p>
      <p>She and new wife Tina Krasinski had their big day at the Wishing Well Barn in Plant City on Monday.</p>
