      <p>A Chapelhall dancer is preparing to perform in front of hundreds at a prestigious Strictly Kids ballroom event.</p>
      <p>Taylor Lawrie, 10, successfully auditioned for the showcase event which will be held at Glasgow’s Double Tree Hilton on December 1.</p>
      <p>Taylor, niece of Coatbridge songwriter – and former X Factor star – Ryan Lawrie, will take to the stage with partner Zak after they were paired together following the audition process.</p>
      <p>She now has a month of learning Latin and ballroom styles before competing against the other 19 couples.</p>
      <p>Proud mum Samantha said: “Taylor is over the moon to have been picked. She’s been a dancer for five years and watches Strictly on TV so it’s a big deal for her.</p>

      <p>“She can’t wait to get her dress on and be up on the stage. She’s not feeling nervous at all and will take it all in her stride.</p>
      <p>“There’s an extensive training schedule before the event so she’ll need to stop dancing around the house so often to get a bit of a rest!”</p>
      <p>The event is in aid of STV’s kids’ appeal which aims to raise money in aid of children living in poverty.</p>
      <p>All competitors are encouraged to collect funds for it before the competition night.</p>
      <p>Samantha continued: “It’s good for the kids to get to do some fundraising as well.</p>
      <p>“Taylor is going to do a dance-a-thon at school and probably do a bake sale too. Ryan is going to participate in a 10k and it’s great of him to get involved.</p>

      <p>“Taylor loves him to bits and really looks up to him.”</p>
      <p>Strictly Kids coach Tracy Donald reckons Taylor will do brilliantly come December.</p>
      <p>She said: “Taylor is a very good dancer and sparkles on the floor.</p>
      <p>“She loves dancing and that clearly comes across in her energy.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking forward to seeing her and Zak develop as a pairing and I’m sure they’ll do well.”</p>
