      <p>Soon you won’t need to ring up the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/420156-entire-rta-dubai-taxi-fleet-fitted-with-security-cameras">Road and Transport Authority’s (RTA)</a> call centre to book a <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news">Dubai</a> taxi, as it will soon be taken over by a recently launched (and very popular) e-hailing service.<br/><br/>Taxi booking and dispatch services will move entirely to <a href="http://timeoutdubai.com/news/414310-careem-officially-launches-full-rta-hala-service">Hala</a>, a joint venture between RTA and Careem, cutting down booking and pick up times for passengers around Dubai.<br/><br/>The full transition of the usual taxi booking and dispatch services to the Hala platform will start on Saturday December 7. The Hala e-hailing system officially launched last September, making up 5,500 taxis of the RTA Dubai Taxi fleet.<br/><br/>Along with a live tracker and arrival notifications, the app also offers passengers the chance to earn and redeem points for rewards. We like the sound of that.<br/><br/>“Our mission is to offer the best experience to customers when booking a ride in Dubai,” said CEO of Hala Clemence Dutertre.<br/><br/>“The migration of the Dubai Taxi booking process to Hala will continue to ensure the most efficient experience for customers, connecting users to the closest Dubai Taxi at the touch of a button.”<br/><br/>Those that use Hala will be able to book a taxi in less than ten seconds, which takes an average of three minutes via the call centre, and get a taxi in an average of three and a half minutes.<br/><br/>The app will also feature the average of the fare upfront, driver details, tracking their route, and the ability to pay through cash or credit card.<br/><br/>This transition comes after a landmark one-millionth booking within days after the official launch of Hala service on August 29,” said CEO of RTA’s Public Transport Agency Ahmed Bahrozyan.<br/><br/>He adds: “The step contributes to RTA’s objective of revamping taxi services in Dubai making the service more accessible through e-hailing, and at the same time advancing the integration of public transit means.”<br/><br/>For more updates on transport and beyond, click <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news">here</a>.<br/><i>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.rta.ae/">www.rta.ae</a></i></p>
