      <p>He told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: "She was completely overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>"She rang me bless her 10 minutes after it aired. She was so overwhelmed, she just broke down on the phone to me. She's a strong girl now."</p>
      <p>Chris then became upset recalling what his girlfriend went through, and placed his head in his hands.</p>

      <p>As Holly supported the Love Island star, he found himself unable to speak but explained what had upset him.</p>
      <p>Praising the "brilliant" documentary and his girlfriend, he said the singer was "brave" and "strong".</p>
      <p>He said: "I don't know why I get so emotional every time I speak about it,"</p>
