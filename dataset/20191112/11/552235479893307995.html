      <p>Santa will be making an early arrival to take part in the popular St Andrew’s Hospice fundraiser this weekend.</p>
      <p>The Airdrie charity will be holding its annual Santa dash, reindeer run and Santa cycle at Strathclyde Park this Sunday at 11am, and is inviting as many Monklands residents as possible to take part in the 6k event.</p>
      <p>All participating adults will be provided with Santa suits, while children will receive reindeer antlers and flashing noses.</p>
      <p>Registration costs £10 for adults, £5 for children and £25 for a family ticket (for two adults and two children), with all proceeds going to the hospice’s work in providing specialist palliative care.</p>

      <p>Dogs are also welcome to take part at no additional cost, while there will also be a chance to visit Santa’s grotto and meet his magical reindeer.</p>
      <p>The event is being sponsored for a fifth year by Amey; whose communications manager, Findlay Robertson, said: “We’re delighted to lend our support.</p>
      <p>“The Santa dash plays such an important fundraising role and allows the hospice to carry on its outstanding work caring for patients and their families.”</p>
