      <h2>There's always one extra celebrity who flies out to the jungle every year but doesn't get to participate in came life - unless something goes wrong</h2>

      <p>Every year, 10 stars jet out to Australia to be the face of the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! series.</p>
      <p>Occasionally there'll be a bombshell arrival or two - Noel Edmonds was last year's surprise campmate - but for the most part, what you see on screen is what you get.</p>
      <p>However, hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly have revealed that there's always one secret celeb who jets out separately from the rest of the line-up and is never seen on camera.</p>
      <p>That's because the secret star acts as an emergency back-up just in case one of the original campmates falls ill or pulls out before the launch show.</p>

      <p>It's a great deal for the stand-in, who gets to stay in the lap of luxury at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/australia-new-zealand/im-celebrity-stars-stay-leave-11661294">the Palazzo Versace hotel</a> in the Gold Coast, eating and drinking on ITV's tab for the whole time the show is being filmed.</p>
      <p>If they're lucky, not a single bull testicle or emu anus will pass their lips.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec uncovered the practice in their 2010 autobiography Ooh! What a Lovely Pair: Our Story.</p>
      <p>In it, Ant recalled the first series of I'm A Celebrity in 2002, when they had no idea what to expect.</p>
      <p>"When we arrived at the big hotel, we had the first of several thousand surreal experiences we'd face over the next few weeks," he wrote.</p>

      <p>"We bumped into Keith 'Cheggers Plays Pop' Chegwin. Every year on I'm A Celebrity they fly stand-ins out in case any of the cast get ill or realise what they're getting themselves into and, in series one, Cheggers was that stand-in."</p>
      <p>Ant went on: "One thing about Cheggers is that he's a very heavy smoker and, when we ran into him, he'd just got off the 24-hour flight from London. To combat his cigarette cravings on the plane, he'd come up with a carefully thought-out plan - he would wear nicotine patches, chew nicotine gum and drink copious amounts of Coke.</p>
      <p>"All of this meant that when we saw him, he was completely wired. He was also keen on showing us some of the home-made footage he'd already taken around the hotel."</p>

      <p>Ant finished: "When we bumped into Cheggers, he had just finished filming a cassowary [a type of Australian emu] attacking its own reflection in a car door. So there we were, jetlagged, standing in our second hotel of the day with wired children's TV legend Keith Chegwin showing us home-video footage of a giant bird attacking its own reflection."</p>
      <p>This year's stand-in celebrity has - as always - been kept secret by tight-lipped ITV bosses.</p>
      <p>The main line-up is made up of Nadine Coyle, Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Andrew Maxwell, Jacqueline Jossa, James Haskell, Roman Kemp, Kate Garraway, Adele Roberts and Myles Stephenson.</p>
