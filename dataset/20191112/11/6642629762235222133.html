      <p>Bahaa Abu al-Ata, a commander of the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, has been <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/israeli-forces-kill-top-islamic-jihad-commander-gaza-strike-191112040427905.html">assassinated in an Israeli air raid</a> targeting his home in the besieged Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>The attack in the early hours of Tuesday also killed the 42-year-old's wife. Medics and local sources told Al Jazeera that the raid in Gaza's Shejaiya neighbourhood also wounded two of his children who are receiving medical treatment in the city's al-Shifa hospital.</p>

      <p>Israel accused Abu al-Ata of being responsible for rocket fire into Israel and a series of other attacks.</p>
      <p>According to Islamic Jihad, Abu al-Ata was one of the most prominent members of its military wing and played a major role in carrying out operations against Israel.</p>
      <p>The group's armed wing, the al-Quds Brigades, is the second-strongest in Gaza after the al-Qassam Brigades of Hamas, the group administering the coastal enclave that has been under a joint Israeli-Egyptian blockade for more than 10 years.</p>
      <p>Local sources confirmed that Abu al-Ata survived a number of assassination attempts in recent years, including one in 2012 that wounded him.</p>
      <p>Abu Al-Ata's father reportedly said his son had been in hiding in recent weeks fearing he would be targeted.</p>
      <p>During the 2014 Israeli war on the Gaza Strip, Abu al-Ata had survived an assassination attempt when he was a deputy commander to Daniel Mansour, commander of al-Quds Brigades in northern Gaza, the sources said.</p>
      <p>Mansour was targeted and killed by Israel on August 3, 2014.</p>
      <p>Overall, more than 2,250 Palestinians, including nearly 1,500 civilians, were killed and a further 11,000 were wounded in the July-August 2014 war, according to Palestinian and United Nations estimates. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died.</p>

      <p>At a press conference on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged that Abu al-Ata was "in the midst of plotting additional attacks these very days", without elaborating.</p>
      <p>"He was a ticking bomb," he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad promised to avenge Abu al-Ata's killing. A barrage of rockets was fired towards Israel after his assassination was confirmed.</p>
      <p>"Our inevitable retaliation will rock the Zionist entity," the group said, referring to Israel.</p>
      <p>Hamas, meanwhile, said Israel "bears full responsibility for all consequences of this escalation" and promised that Abu al-Ata's death "will not go unpunished".</p>
