      <h2>The local authority say they have launched a range of supports to help employees.</h2>

      <p>Sickness absences caused by mental health and stress among West Dunbartonshire Council staff has been branded a “concern” by local authority bosses.</p>
      <p>In one department, mental health issues accounted for a 96 percent of absences between April and September this year. Council-wide, personal stress was the third most common reason for sick days – accounting for 15.5 percent of absences.</p>
      <p>The figures are revealed in a new report prepared by council chiefs, which notes a hike in the numbers of staff taking time off work for sickness at a loss of £3million over the three months.</p>
      <p>In total, 22,127 full-time equivalent days were taken off due to sickness – with an extra 3471 on the same time last year.</p>
      <p>The council say a number of services were restructured in the first quarter of last year so comparisons should be considered indicative.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report, which will be discussed at a corporate services committee meeting tomorrow (Wednesday), says there has been a 13.6 percent increase in council-wide sickness during the period compared to last year. It works out at each employee taking five sick days.</p>
      <p>The document, prepared by chiefs, states: “The level of sickness absence attributed to mental health and personal stress is a concern and as such the Employee Wellbeing Group continues to have a particular focus on mental health and wellbeing.”</p>
      <p>At the meeting, councillors will also be asked to approve a Supporting Employee Wellbeing Policy, which aims to remove the stigma from those experiencing mental health issues.</p>
      <p>Overall, minor illness was the most common reason for absences across the council, accounting for 21.4 percent of cases, followed by acute medical conditions and personal stress.</p>
      <p>In the people and technology department, one-quarter of staff took sickness days due to their mental health.</p>
      <p>In the procurement department, mental health accounted for 96 percent of sickness absences, followed by minor illness.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Val Jennings, of West Dunbartonshire’s Unison branch, said: “There are a lot of vacancies, which is causing stress.</p>
      <p>“We have situations where members of staff will take on the work of two people and many will do this anyway because they don’t want to complain.</p>
      <p>“To be fair to the council, they are doing work around this but it is slow progress.”</p>
      <p>Community Party councillor Jim Bollan said: “Hundreds of jobs have been cut in recent years by the SNP council resulting in the workload of the remaining staff dramatically increasing, resulting in these appalling ill health figures. The SNP council job cuts and constant reorganisation and amalgamation of departments and sections is the root cause of this increase in mental health issues amongst our staff.”</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman said they offer a “range of supports” to help employees and added: “We provide extensive training to managers focused on raising awareness of mental health and supporting any employees experiencing difficulties. In addition we offer practical supports such as carer’s leave, special leave, stress management and flexible working. A significant number of absences were as a result of long-term cases where staff are suffering from complex or acute medical conditions including cancer.”</p>
