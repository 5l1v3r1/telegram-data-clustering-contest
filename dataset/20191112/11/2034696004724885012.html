      </p>
      <p>The new redesign of the controversial live-action Sonic The Hedgehog has been shared in the film’s new trailer – watch it below.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/watch-first-trailer-sonic-hedgehog-reboot-2482566">The adaptation of the character for the new movie was met with ridicule</a> upon its unveiling back in April.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The fan backlash eventually ended up <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-to-be-redesigned-following-fan-backlash-2483766">forcing the creators of the movie to redesign the new Sonic</a>, with director Jeff Fowler saying: “Thank you for the support. And the criticism. The message is loud and clear… you aren’t happy with the design &amp; you want changes. It’s going to happen. Everyone at Paramount &amp; Sega are fully committed to making this character the BEST he can be…”</p>
      <p>Get a glimpse at the new Sonic in the trailer for the film, which comes out on February 14, 2020, below.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/the-mascot-for-a-disease-a-leaked-image-of-live-action-sonic-the-hedgehog-isnt-going-down-too-well-2457306">The unveiling of the original <i>Sonic The Hedgehog</i> trailer angered fans</a>, with one going as far as to say that the character looked like “the mascot for a disease”. The movie was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/new-sonic-hedgehog-movie-delayed-2020-2492217">delayed from November 2019 to February 2020</a> after the backlash, as the producers had to work on the new version of Sonic.</p>
      <p>Judging by the comments to the new trailer, it already seems to be going down much better with fans. One called the new design a “step in the right direction” while another said it was “a lot better”.</p>
      <p>Another fan calls the difference between the two characters “insane”, while another says the new character is “the way [Sonic] was meant to be”.</p>
