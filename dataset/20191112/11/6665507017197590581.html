      <p>MUMBAI — <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/katy-perry/">Katy Perry</a> arrived in the city for her performance this weekend and says she’s excited to indulge in “all things Indian”, including discovering shopping streets and partying with Bollywood celebrities. </p>
      <p>The ‘Roar’ hitmaker will perform at the DY Patil Stadium on 16 November as part of the OnePlus Music Festival.</p>
      <p>“I’m excited to watch some of the other people performing. I’m totally excited to immerse myself in the culture, this week in Mumbai. I am not the girl who stays indoors and orders room service. I go out, seek the world, I love people, culture, traditions. You’re going to catch me on these streets,” Perry told reporters.</p>
      <p>She was speaking at a special press conference, where she was joined by actor Jacqueline Fernandez who will play the host at the festival.</p>

      <p>When asked if she is keen to collaborate with local artistes, Perry said, “That’s what the research and development this week is going to be about. I am going to a fun party, going to meet some Bollywood people and hearing some incredible bands. It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.”</p>
      <p>This is not her first visit to the country. The “Firework” hitmaker performed at the opening ceremony of Indian Premier League in 2012 in Chennai.</p>
      <p>Perry said back then she was just “in and out” and didn’t get to discover India, so this time it’s all about “immersing and educating myself”.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to meet anyone interesting, who has a great perspective, care, kindness and empathy for the world and wants to do compassionate artistic thing. That’s the kind of people I want to hang out with. I’m sure Jacqueline is definitely going to take me shopping, eating,” she added.</p>
      <p>The singer said every seven years, every cell in the body rejuvenates, making one a whole different person, “so I’m a whole different human, here in Mumbai, India.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve always wanted to come to Mumbai. I went to a couple of places seven years ago, did a cricket match, had some fun in Rajasthan at one point in my life. But I’ve always looked at Mumbai as a destination I really want to be at.</p>
      <p>“I have heard it’s the most fun and it’s where arts, culture and entertainment (come together), and Bollywood. I’m excited to indulge in all things Indian,” she added.</p>
      <p>At the festival, Dua Lipa will also be performing and Perry said she’s excited for that as well.</p>
      <p>“I’ve created a little bit of a special show. I am not touring right now and doing very few shows but I decided that this show was one of the most important shows of the year because of just the fact that I always wanted to go to Mumbai. I hear my Indian fans so passionately on social media. So this one checks all the boxes...</p>
      <p>“It is difficult sometimes to bring a big production over here. That’s why most people don’t add places on their tours because the production is hard to bring, you’ve to change everything. I really wanted to come back to India, and I knew I was going to be in good hands with One Plus,” she added.</p>
