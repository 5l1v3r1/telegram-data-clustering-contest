      <p>A woman was battered unconscious by a 'charming' stranger she met in a nightclub after he went 'pyscho' when she went back to his house for a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/drink">drink</a>.</p>
      <p>Darran Read seemed nice and the victim agreed to go with him to consume more <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alcohol">alcohol</a>.</p>
      <p>Before she knew it he flew into a violent rage and repeatedly hit her over the head with a pan in a shocking attack which she feared would kill her.</p>
      <p>The vulnerable victim lay injured on the floor in a pool of blood and Read continued drinking and even went for a bath, delaying summoning help for hours and prolonging her suffering, reports the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/charming-stranger-battered-woman-invited-17239573">Chronicle Live</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Prosecutors</a> had claimed Read attempted to murder the woman and raped her while falsely imprisoning her but he was cleared of those charges and convicted of wounding with intent.</p>
      <p>Now the 38-year-old, whose previous convictions include child sex offences, has been branded dangerous and locked up for 14 years, with an extra four years on licence, at Newcastle Crown Court.</p>
      <p>As he was sentenced, the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said in a statement read to the court: "I'm absolutely distraught at what Darran Read has done to me.</p>
      <p>"This started off with me going out with friends and I met him in a bar and was expecting to go back to his home for a drink and it was only for a drink.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"He attacked me in what was the most horrific time in my life.</p>
      <p>"I truly believe he was trying to kill me. My life flashed before my eyes.</p>
      <p>"I was in so much pain and I was in hospital for days after being battered senseless with a saucepan."</p>
      <p>The woman said her mental health has deteriorated as a result of the attack and she has tried to take her own life.</p>
      <p>She also described a nightmare she has, saying: "He takes a knife from the kitchen and stabs my son to death, it's horrific seeing Darran Read's face and the death of my son."</p>
      <p>The victim added: "I don't think I will ever get over this. <br/>"I believe he is a dangerous man."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard the victim met Read at Arizona nightclub during a night out in Sunderland last year and they went to his home in the city.</p>
      <p>They consumed alcohol and there were conflicting accounts about what led up to the attack.</p>
      <p>Judge Paul Sloan QC said: "Whatever it was that triggered your violence, I have no doubt, on the evidence I heard at trial, that you flew into a particularly violent rage.</p>
      <p>"You woke her up and she was in a dazed intoxicated state and you started shouting and swearing at her."</p>
      <p>The woman fled to the kitchen to try to get away from Read but he followed her, Read later telling police he "just went psycho" and couldn't remember why.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Judge Sloan told him: "I'm satisfied there was no good reason for the brutal and sustained attack that ensued.</p>
      <p>"You armed yourself with a saucepan and deliberately targeted her head with the saucepan repeatedly and she was already bleeding after the second blow struck her.</p>
      <p>"She went to the floor where she cowered and tried to protect herself by putting her arms up to protect her head.</p>
      <p>"She described it as horrendous and she thought she was going to die.</p>
      <p>"You hit her with such force, the pan was severely dented."</p>
      <p>After the woman lost consciousness, Read initially thought he had killed her as she lay there in a pool of blood.</p>
      <p>When she came round, such was her fear that she would be killed, she grabbed a letter on the floor and put it in her bag, so if her body was dumped, police would link it to Read's home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Instead of summoning help immediately, Read tried to justify his actions to her, claiming he had been let down by the authorities, which was not true.</p>
      <p>After waiting at least a couple of hours, Read did phone 999 and paramedics found the woman with three wounds to her head, two black eyes, bruising and swelling to her arms and a fracture to her right arm and wrist.</p>
      <p>The court heard Read was convicted of indecently assaulting a female child in 1996 and a male child in 1997 and was jailed for four years in 2009 for sexual activity with a girl aged under 13.</p>
      <p>He also has convictions on his record for harassment, assaulting a girlfriend, breaching a restraining order and possessing drugs.</p>
      <p>A psychiatrist who examined Read branded him dangerous and Judge Sloan said: "I have no doubt whatsoever that you present a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm."</p>
      <p>As a result of the dangerousness ruling, Read, of Roseville Street, Sunderland, will have to serve at least two thirds of the 14 year sentence, rather than up to a half of it.</p>
      <p>By way of mitigation, the court heard there was limited premeditation, he had an unhappy childhood and suffered mental health issues, although he had told health professionals the day before the attack he was fine.</p>
