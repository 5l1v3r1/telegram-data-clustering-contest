      <p>Following the announcement of their new generation of Exynos 990 chipset a few weeks ago, Samsung has confirmed that the same chip will be known as the Exynos 9830 in their future smartphones, such as the S11.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/samsung">Samsung</a> slightly confused us a few weeks ago when it <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345599-samsung-debuts-flagship-exynos-990-processor-probably-for-the-galaxy-s11/">announced its newest flagship and sub-flagship Exynos processors as the ‘Exynos 980’ and ‘Exynos 990’</a> (apeing <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/huawei">Huawei</a>‘s <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/kirin">Kirin</a> naming scheme) given the somewhat consistent though rather confusing ‘Exynos 9XXX’ naming scheme of yore.</p>
      <p>A brief refresher on the Exynos 980 and 990: the 980 is in some ways like a souped-up <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/exynos-9825">Exynos 9825</a> – with the same core architecture – but with an embedded 5G modem along with a few other improvements.</p>
      <p>The Exynos 990 is Samsung’s next-gen <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/arm">ARM</a> flagchip though, featuring ARM’s latest core and GPU architecture as well as significantly improved ISPs (Image Signal Processors), NPUs, though no embedded modem, curiously.</p>
      <p>We had continued to hear leaks that Samsung would be using an ‘Exynos 9830’ in their <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a> family though, and many speculated this must be a renamed Exynos 990.</p>
      <p>Well Samsung has today confirmed that indeed, the <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/exynos-9830">Exynos 9830</a> which will debut in the S11 series is the same chip as the Exynos 990.</p>
      <p>Of course, the Galaxy S11 series will continue to utilise Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8-series in the US and Canada; <a href="http://talkandroid.com/tag/snapdragon-865">the next-gen Snapdragon 865</a> in the S11 series more specifically.</p>
