        <b>Jim McEneaney has played his last game for Louth’s senior footballers after informing both the team management and panel of his decision to retire from inter-county duty.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Geraldines forward, who has been an integral member of the side in recent seasons, steps away almost eight years since making his debut in a National League game against Westmeath at his club’s grounds in Haggardstown.</p>
      <p>News of McEneaney’s departure will come as a blow to manager Wayne Kierans, who is expected to hold talks with other established stars regarding their futures.</p>
      <p>Although the O’Connell’s clubman is already having to plan without Dreadnots defender Anthony Williams, who has been forced to opt off through work commitments.</p>
      <p>A creative centre-forward, Blackrock native McEneaney became a regular fixture in the team under Peter Fitzpatrick in 2012, but his involvement was curtailed, mainly through injury, over the seasons to follow.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his strongest year for The Wee County came in 2016, where he won a NFL Division Four medal before scoring a goal in the Leinster Championship defeat by Meath at Parnell Park</p>
      <p>He was again a focal point of the 2017 outfit that won a second successive promotion under Colin Kelly, and played key parts in the subsequent Pete McGrath and Kierans regimes.</p>
      <p>Widely recognised as one of the county’s leading players, his presence will be missed, particularly in the aftermath of a club championship campaign in which he spearheaded Geraldines’ run to the senior semi-finals, the first time they reached that stage in 37 years.</p>
