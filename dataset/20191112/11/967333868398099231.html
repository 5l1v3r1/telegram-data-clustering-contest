      <h3>“Leading Couple of the People”</h3>
      <p>On 8 November, 52-year-old <a href="https://www.pamelaandersonfoundation.org/news/2019/11/8/pdowm9of2hi7qqkt1j56wk4vl1u20w">Pamela Anderson posted an open letter</a> praising the first couple and urging US President Donald Trump to issue a pardon for her close friend, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.</p>
      <p>In her letter, Anderson, a passionate supporter of Assange, hailed the Trumps as “the leading couple of the people”.</p>
      <p>She went on to link Trump’s success to the “honest journalism” published by Assange and WikiLeaks, adding that Trump is being threatened by the same forces behind Assange’s imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Calling Assange’s treatment part of a “conspiracy to destroy your presidency”, Anderson then asked Trump <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911111077277853-watch-man-climbs-up-australian-parliament-in-free-julian-assange-rooftop-protest/">to pardon her friend and block his extradition.</a></p>
      <p>The animal rights activist then requested a meeting to discuss the environment, and suggested that the first lady could partner up with Anderson’s foundation on a project to protect endangered species.</p>
      <p>Julian Assange, an Australian citizen, is currently serving a 50-week jail term for skipping bail in 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden, where he was wanted on charges of sexual assault, which he rejected as politically motivated.</p>
      <p>Assange, founder of WikiLeaks website, sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and stayed there for almost seven years until April this year, when Ecuador stripped him of his asylum status.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911091077262803-assange-may-die-in-prison-says-father-of-wikileaks-founder/">He is facing an extradition to the United States</a> on charges relating to the publication of diplomatic cables and exposing damning evidence against the US-led military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
      <p>The extradition proceedings in Julian Assange’s case will begin in February 2019, with the whistle-blower facing 175 years in prison if found guilty of all charges.</p>
