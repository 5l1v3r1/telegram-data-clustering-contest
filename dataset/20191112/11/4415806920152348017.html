      <p>Garda√≠ have launched an investigation after a baby's grave was vandalised in Co Limerick.</p>
      <p>Baby Gary McDonagh passed away in August last year and is buried at Taylor's Cross in Fedamore.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, ornaments around his grave were smashed and a cross was taken and dumped at his grandmother's home nearby.</p>
      <p>His father, also named Gary, says it's disturbing to think someone could do this to an innocent child's resting place.</p>
      <p>"What actually happened is I walked out my mam's front door and the cross was sitting in our yard," he explained.</p>
      <p>"(It was) brought down to my mam's and thrown over the wall."</p>
      <p>Mr McDonagh added that angels and flower pots placed at the grave were smashed.</p>
      <p>"The guards did take the cross that night," he said, adding that the guards took the cross to examine for fingerprints.</p>
      <p>"I want them to stop and leave my son's grave alone. It's sick"</p>
