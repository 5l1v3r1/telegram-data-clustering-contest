      <h1>Map out Thanksgiving with these tips from Google Maps</h1>

      <p>For Americans, Thanksgiving is rapidly approaching–which means a time of food, family and fun. As we kick off this holiday season, feast your eyes on our best Google Maps trends and tips to help you save time, reduce stress and navigate the festivities with ease.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ditch the traffic</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanksgiving road trips can be special (extended karaoke sesh, anyone?), but they can also be stressful if you end up stuck in traffic. To make sure you don’t get caught in the gridlock, we analyzed 2018 traffic data to pinpoint the best and worst times to leave for your Thanksgiving road trip.</p>
      <p>Nationally, we see that the day before Thanksgiving between 3-4 p.m. is the worst time to hit the road, but traffic clears up significantly by 6 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning. To avoid any fowl moods after Thanksgiving, try your best to avoid the Friday or Sunday afternoon rush and leave in the morning when there are significantly less cars on the road. For a closer look at holiday traffic patterns and the best and worst times to leave in your city, make sure to check out our <a href="http://www.mappingthanksgiving.com/">interactive website</a>.</p>

        <b>Avoid the crowds</b>
      </p>
      <p>Holiday crowds can easily transform a quick stop into an hours-long adventure. To save you time, we analyzed Popular Times data at key holiday destinations during Thanksgiving week so you can know exactly when the crowds tend to peak and when to avoid them. Pro-tip: If you hate lines, avoid the grocery store at all costs on Wednesday evening!</p>
