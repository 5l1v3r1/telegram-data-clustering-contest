      <p>Coats are essential during winter months and car seats are necessary for children when riding in the car. However, they don't mix, according to <a href="https://chw.org/newshub/stories/winter-weather-advisory-why-car-seats-and-bulky-coats-are-an-unsafe-mix?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=promotedpost&amp;utm_content=facebook-puffy-coat-blog-2019-11&amp;utm_campaign=social-web&amp;fbclid=IwAR2b0l2knVHIwah1uz2URdoFXs-Pkdlqm91aMzfWtNgkEMVTKVMWrOdTN3U">Children's Wisconsin.</a></p>
      <p>Bulky winter coats <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/why-car-seats-and-bulky-coats-are-an-unsafe-mix-for-children">affect how secure car seats are</a> in protecting children. In a crash, the extra puffy coat material will compress, causing the harness to become loose and ineffective.</p>
      <p>Experts say parents should dress their kids in thin, warm layers such as fleece or Thinsulate, a brand of synthetic fiber thermal insulation used in clothing.</p>
      <p>Once the child is secured in the car seat, place a warm blanket over them or put their coat on backward over their arms and shoulders.</p>
      <p>When securing the car seat, it should clip at armpit level while fitting snugly without any twists.</p>
      <p>“I understand the thought of having to go through this each time you get in and out of the car is daunting, especially as you’re trying to keep yourself warm as well. But it really is important, even if you’re just going for a quick jaunt around the neighborhood,” wrote Lisa Klindt Simpson with Safe Kids Southeast Wisconsin. “Studies have shown that most crashes occur within 20 minutes or less from home and at relatively slow speeds.”</p>
      <p>Motor vehicle crashes, wherever they occur, are the leading cause of death in children older than 1, according to Simpson.</p>
