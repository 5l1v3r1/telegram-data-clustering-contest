      <h3>UNIVERSITY of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas face off for one final time this season as they dispute the remaining championship berth today in the UAAP men’s basketball tournament at the Mall of Asia Arena.</h3>
      <p>The survivor of the 4 p.m. knockout match will take on a well-rested Ateneo side in a best-of-three series starting Saturday at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>After this last step-ladder semifinal match, the Blue Eagles can now finally focus on their Finals opponent, aiming to be the first to go a perfect 16-0 season.</p>
      <p>The second-ranked Fighting Maroons remained winless against the Growling Tigers in three meetings this season.</p>
      <p>With UP still upbeat of beating UST in the most important game of the tournament, coach Aldin Ayo is bracing for the worst in the semifinal decider.</p>
      <p>“They’re going to adjust. I think they’re going to be physical. Sa akin, pag mga do-or-die game, nangyayari iyon eh - doing whatever it takes. But knowing them, wala namang madumi maglaro doon eh,” said Ayo.</p>
      <p>“Siguro kung ano man yung physicality, I think it will be part of basketball pa rin. So it will be tough for us because they’re going to adjust. Now magdedepende lang kung paano magka-counter,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Growling Tigers are seeking their first Finals appearance since 2015, where UST lost to Far Eastern University in three games.</p>
      <p>Also, UST hopes to sustain the energy it had in last Sunday’s impressive 89-69 romp that exhausted UP’s twice-to-beat bonus.</p>
      <p>“I have to commend my assistant coaches, especially my conditioning coach and our physical therapist. Grabe yung ginagawa ng dalawa. Ang grabe pineprepare ng dalawa yung mga players namin in terms of the physical aspect,” said Ayo.</p>
