      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T11:51:34+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 11:51</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Labour have vowed to scrap tuition fees "no ifs no buts" as the party confirmed plans to offer every adult six years of free education.</p>
      <p>A £3bn-a-year “cradle to grave” National Education Service would include a new right for workers to take paid time off to learn - with a focus on non-degree vocational skills.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile university tuition fees would also be scrapped - renewing an £11bn-a-year promise in the 2017 Labour manifesto.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Blackpool <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> repeated the commitment to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.</p>
      <p>He added: "But that’s just one part of our life-changing plan for real change.</p>
      <p>"Because we will invest in a National Education Service – free at the point of use – so everyone can learn at every stage of their lives."</p>
      <p>And he hit out at multinational corporations like Amazon and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> , "who rely on a well-educated workforce to make their millions, paying hardly any tax in our country".</p>

      <p>The Labour leader said: "I’d rather give a break to the worker who wants to learn than give a tax break to the billionaire who wants for nothing."</p>
      <p>Outlining Labour's plan for lifelong learning he said: "The National Education Service will do for education what our NHS does for health."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>  analysis reveals the number of adults achieving qualifications in basic skills has plummeted since 2011 - with the number currently learning at its lowest point since 1996.</p>
      <p>It comes as new figures showed that economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade, underlining the need for a skilled workforce.</p>
      <p>Under Labour’s plans, any adult without A-level or equivalent qualification could attend college to study for them for free.</p>
      <p>Every adult would also be entitled to six years of study for diplomas and degrees while workers would get the right to paid time off for education and training.</p>

      <p>The UK has a severe skills shortage, particularly in higher technical skills, with the CBI claiming two thirds of businesses worry they won’t be able to fill skilled posts.</p>
      <p>The Tories have slashed funding for further education and skills training by 47% and overseen a 25% decline in adults enrolling in education.</p>
      <p>Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner told the BBC: "If Labour gets into power on December 13, we will abolish tuition fees, no ifs, no buts. Students at the moment are leaving university with £57,000 worth of debt, that is not sustainable."</p>
      <p>She added university vice-chancellors "are paid too much and are unaccountable for that pay, and I'll crack down on that".</p>
      <p>Appearing with Ms Rayner at Blackpool Football Club, Jeremy Corbyn said: “I see education like an escalator running alongside you throughout life, that you can get on and off whenever you want.”</p>
