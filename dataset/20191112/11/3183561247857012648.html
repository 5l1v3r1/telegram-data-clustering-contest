      <p>These Retro Arcade machines can be found in junk shops everywhere. While your retro gamer friend might not have any attachment to the 300+ shonky knock-off games housed within, the machines do a great job of replicating the feeling of wandering down to your local Timezone as a child and popping your hard-earned cents into a dusty cabinet. Plus, the games are usually close enough to the real thing that you can get at least <i>some</i> measure of joy out of them.</p>

      <p>This little device isn't just a controller, it's also a retro game emulator, complete with AV jacks. I mention this only because this may mean the device is incompatible with modern televisions unless a port converter is used. But if do get ut working, this Pac-Man shaped console will let you play some of Bandai's classic games, including <i>Pac-Man</i>, <i>Super Pac-Man</i>, <i>Galaga</i> and <i>Dig Dug</i>. There's 12 games in total, so there's plenty of gaming to enjoy here, and it's in a great little package.</p>

      <p>The PlayStation Classic was released to little fanfare in 2018, in part due to a "poor" line-up of games. Yes, the console excluded iconic titles like <i>Crash Bandicoot</i> and <i>Spyro the Dragon</i>, but with remasters of both releasing the same year, it kinda makes sense that they were missing. The console has now dropped significantly in price, and still features some fantastic titles that are sure to make any retro gamer happy, including <i>Final Fantasy VII</i>, <i>Tekken 3</i>, <i>Oddworld</i> and <i>Rayman</i>.</p>

      <p>In the same vein, Nintendo's retro controllers the SNES and <a href="https://amzn.to/2rk1dJL">NES Classic Minis</a> are both viable options for a cool, retro gift. Each contains all the hits of the SNES and NES eras respectively, and they both replicate the designs of the iconic Nintendo consoles, but smaller. Unlike the PlayStation Classic, the price of the SNES hasn't dropped much, but if you've got a bigger budget, either of these classic consoles make for a great retro gamer gift.</p>

      <p>If your budget is even bigger again, you could consider a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite as a great retro gift. The console has a great little service called <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo-switch/onlineservice/">Nintendo Switch Online</a> that lets subscribers play classic NES and SNES games including <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Mario Bros.</i>, <i>Star Fox</i> and <i>Super Metroid</i> (just to name a few). There's even an ultra cool retro controller that's available exclusively for subscribers to the service to purchase.</p>

      <p><i>Terrible Old Games You've Probably Never Heard Of</i> by Stuart Ashen is a book that charts the early days of video games, and all the bad games that came out of an era filled with bad graphics and low quality control. It's also a very funny look at the history of gaming, and how retro games developed. There's a heap of fun books surrounding the days of retro gaming and the death of the arcade, but this one comes highly recommended, and will give your retro gamer giftee a good laugh too boot.</p>
