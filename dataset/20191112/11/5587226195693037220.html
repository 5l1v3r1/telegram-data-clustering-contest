      <p>The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) has suspended <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001345174/silverstone-airplane-skids-off-runway-at-wilson-airport-runway">Silverstone Air</a>'s Dash 8 fleet from flying for 7 days to allow inspection. <br/>“They cannot operate until we come up with a report on what happened that led to <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001347179/scare-as-silverstone-airplane-tyre-falls-off-on-take-off">the fall off of the wheel</a>,” Mr Kibe said. The KCAA Director General Gilbert Kibe, however, made it clear that other makes and models of Silverstone planes would operate normally as they have met the required safety standards. “In compliance with the KCAA directive to suspend operations on our Dash 8 fleet, we have temporarily suspended all our scheduled services, the safety of our passengers, crew and aircraft remain our highest priority,” said Silverstone Air. </p>
