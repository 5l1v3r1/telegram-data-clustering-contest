      <p>The sudden death of Bad Azz has left the entire West Coast in mourning. For many familiar with the scene, the DPGC rapper was among the most notable voices, having collaborated with damn near every renowned artist. From <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/IceCube/profile">Ice Cube</a> to <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/SnoopDogg/profile">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/NateDogg/profile">Nate Dogg</a> to <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Kurupt/profile">Kurupt</a>, Knoc-Turn'al to Mac Dre, Bad Azz was prolific in his own right. His most acclaimed album, 2001's <i>Personal Business, </i>is considered a local classic by no shortage of fans. One of the most iconic tracks was the Jelly Roll-produced "Wrong Idea," a bouncy single that also earned placement on Snoop Dogg's <i>Tha Last Meal </i>project.</p>
      <p>Kicking things off with his iconic cadence, Bad Azz showcases a slick flow, playing the dexterous counterpart to Snoop's grounded swagger. "The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials, we credible individuals, ahead of you we original," he spits over Jelly Roll's G-Funk bounce. "Better known as criminals, thuggin' off on the stereo." Today, both Snoop Dogg and Kokane <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/rapper-bad-azz-has-passed-away-snoop-dogg-daz-dillinger-pay-their-respects-news.95411.html">took to social media to pay respects,</a> joining a vast chorus of friends, family, and fans. Rest in peace, Bad Azz; go stream that <i>Personal Business </i>album in solidarity.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials<br/>We credible individuals, ahead of you we original<br/>Better known as criminals, thuggin off on the stereo<br/>Killin 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though<br/>Fuck 'em cause they can't see me though and here we go again</p>
