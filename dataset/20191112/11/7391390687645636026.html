      <p>With the 2020 presidential race heating up, it's high time we took a look at some books that show <a href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/g29272898/women-in-politics-memoirs/">life for women on the campaign trail</a>. From former leaders to current contenders, the nine books on the list cover <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-actually-happens-when-women-run-win-elections-3231157">everything you need to know about women in politics</a>, and may even offer some insight into <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/how-to-get-into-politics-3367485">how you can kick your own political career off</a> right.</p>
      <p>People set out on the campaign trail every year, but women and men encounter very different obstacles to their success. As <i>The New York Times</i> points out, we've only recently begun asking fathers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/us/politics/democratic-candidates-fathers-day.html">who is taking care of their children</a> while they're out on a road — a question that has long been used to cast doubt on the legitimacy of women's political pursuits.</p>
      <p>Whether you're a woman who dreams of joining <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/politics/who-are-the-squad/index.html">the Squad</a>, or you just want to get a sense of what life is like for women on the campaign trail, in the list below you'll find memoirs and how-to guides from some of the biggest names in contemporary politics. Check out my recommendations below, and be sure to share your favorite political memoirs with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.</p>
