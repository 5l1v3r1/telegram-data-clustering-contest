      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is ready for his live-action debut — again.</p>
      <p>The first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/30/18522870/sonic-the-hedgehog-live-action-movie-trailer">trailer for the live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movie</a> was met by some very heated reactions from fans. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/30/18523836/sonic-the-hedgehog-trailer-games-movie-comparison">beloved video game hedgehog</a> looked less like his Sega self and more like a tall, scrawny cat-like creature with teeth. The backlash was loud enough that director Jeff Fowler announced on Twitter that his team was set to go back and overhaul the design, even though the movie was already in the can. Fowler later announced that <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> would be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/24/18638635/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-delay-release-date-changes">delayed from November 2019 to February 2020.</a> The hashtag #GottaFixFast was no joke.</p>

      <p>The new Sonic, having first leaked into fan view by way of a few multiplex standees, feels like a marked improvement. The approach is simple: it’s the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/1/14/18180946/sonic-bible-blasphemy-unraveled">Sonic we know and love</a>. Gone are the long, hairy blue fingers and beady hedgehog eyes. The white gloves and giant mono-eye are back in business, baby!</p>
      <p><i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> stars Ben Schwartz as Sonic, with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, James Marsden as Tom Wachowski, the sheriff of Green Hills, and Adam Pally as a fellow cop.</p>
