      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/take-me-out">Take Me Out</a> fans will know that there's one ultimate destination for romance; the Isle of Fernando's.</p>
      <p>We can't help but be jealous when <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paddy-mcguinness">Paddy McGuinness</a> sends two hopeful romantics off into the sunset for a date on the sun-soaked isle.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the return of the hit ITV show to our screens, Travel Republic has launched a dedicated Isle of Fernando's holiday package for couples - and it's got everything you could want for a dreamy romantic break.</p>
      <p>We're talking a 5* all-inclusive hotel, massages, sunset excursions and of course, heaps of sunshine on the Isle of Fernando's (which you may also know by the name of Tenerife).</p>
      <p>In fact, the package includes seven nights at the 5* GF Gran Costa Adeje in a Superior room on an all-inclusive basis, your return flights, a pre-booked couple's massage and even a ride on the Mount Teide Cable Car at sunset.</p>
