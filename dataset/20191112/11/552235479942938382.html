      <p>Appearing on a national television show provided the catalyst for a Chapelhall man to start a family.</p>
      <p>Ryan O’Connor, 31, was too anxious to have a baby with wife Robyn because of uncertainty over his long-term health prospects.</p>
      <p>However, Ryan’s involvement on the BBC show Laid Bare – which aired last week and showed him receiving a “living autopsy” to highlight problems with his lazy lifestyle – inspired him to make important changes and ultimately help bring little Chloe into the world just a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Ryan told the Advertiser: “One of the main reasons for going on the show was my worry about my health for starting a family.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to make sure I was in good enough shape to look after a child.</p>
      <p>“I really wasn’t sure if I could but the changes I made after filming the show gave me the strength to know I can raise kids.</p>

      <p>“Chloe has been a delight since she was born and I can’t wait to see her grow up. Robyn and I are delighted.”</p>
      <p>During the show, which was filmed last year, Ryan was warned he had a 60 per cent chance of developing diabetes.</p>
      <p>This revelation prompted him to ditch his fizzy juice addiction, cut down on sugary foods and begin exercising.</p>
      <p>He continued: “I’m an IT engineer who works from home, so my commute is literally walking down the stairs. It was normal for me to pour a glass of Irn-Bru or Coke first thing in the morning.</p>

      <p>“I’d sit in front of a screen for eight hours a day for work and then play video games afterwards.</p>
      <p>“It was a very sedentary lifestyle and I was consuming so much sugar, which is a silent killer.</p>
      <p>“I get up and go for a walk every hour of my day now and I’ve completely cut fizzy juice from my diet, whereas before I was drinking at least two litres a day.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been morbidly obese but I’ve lost a good amount of weight and am down to a 32-inch waist. My main goal was to really reduce the risk of diabetes.</p>
      <p>“My life is about my girl Chloe now. I want to keep these changes going for her.”</p>

      <p>Meeting a diabetes sufferer while filming the show proved to be a wake-up call for Ryan.</p>
      <p>He explained: “We were introduced to a man who had his left leg amputated because his lifestyle caused diabetes.</p>
      <p>“The scary thing was, it wasn’t dissimilar to mine. He ate badly, didn’t do much exercise and consumed loads of sugar.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit of an eye-opener for me and he advised me not to keep up that lifestyle.</p>
      <p>“I’m really glad I experienced the show because I have a much more positive outlook on life now and I’m delighted to have started a family.”</p>
