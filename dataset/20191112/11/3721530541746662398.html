      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/zkkOM">Disney Plus</a> is available today, with a massive <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/11/20956257/disney-plus-tv-shows-movies-full-list-star-wars-marvel-pixar-dcom">back catalogue from Disney, Pixar, 20th Century Fox, and, of course, Marvel</a>. The studio’s contribution to the new subscription streaming service will not be trivial.</p>
      <p>Not only will Marvel movies show up on Disney Plus, Kevin Feige and his team will also produce original television shows set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe exclusively for the service. And, according to Feige, elements of those shows will factor into upcoming movies. The upcoming <i>Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness</i> reportedly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/20/20696400/marvel-doctor-strange-2-mcu-movie-black-widow-sdcc-2019">ties directly into the events of both <i>Loki</i> and the <i>WandaVision</i> show</a>.</p>
      <p>But aware, reader: None of those shows are available at launch.</p>
      <p>Other than <i>Marvel Hero’s Project</i>, a reality series flying under the Marvel banner, the MCU shows will hit the service in the coming months and years. Here’s a list of every upcoming Disney Plus-exclusive Marvel TV project announced so far, and when they’ll premiere.</p>

      <h4>MARVEL’S HERO PROJECT (LAUNCH)</h4>
      <p>There is <i>one</i> Marvel show available at the launch of Disney Plus on Nov. 12, but it’s not part of the MCU. <i>Marvel’s Hero Project</i> is a 20-episode docuseries celebrating kids who’ve “dedicated their lives to selfless acts of bravery and kindness,” partly by surprising them with real comics, created by Marvel editors, about their heroism. Expect plenty of tears, onscreen and off.</p>
      <p><i>Hero Project</i> is one of two announced Marvel docuseries for Disney Plus. Little has been revealed about the other, except that it has the working title of <i>Marvel 616</i>. The show will explore “the intersection between Marvel’s rich legacy of stories, characters and creators and the world outside your window. Told through the lens of a diverse group of filmmakers, each documentary will dive into the rich historical, cultural and societal context that has become inseparable from stories of the Marvel Universe.”</p>
      <h4><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/20/20702306/marvel-falcon-winter-soldier-new-details-zemo-comic-con-sdcc-2019"><b>FALCON AND THE WINTER SOLDIER</b></a> (FALL 2020)</h4>
      <p>The MCU’s first Disney Plus original focuses on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/20/20702306/marvel-falcon-winter-soldier-new-details-zemo-comic-con-sdcc-2019">Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson</a>. As with most of the Disney Plus Marvel titles. word’s been pretty mute about this one beyond the base concept of the Falcon and the Winter Soldier. One a key question: since Steve Rogers left his shield and title to Sam, does Sam still go by Falcon? Will the series address a transition?</p>
      <p>On top of Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier </i>actress Emily VanCamp returns for <i>Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i> as SHIELD Agent Sharon Carter, while Wyatt Russell makes his MCU debut as John Walker, known to comics fans as U.S. Agent. The villain will be <i>Civil War </i>foe Zemo (Daniel Bruhl). The first of the Disney Plus MCU tie-ins — which unlike the Hulu and Netflix shows <i>will</i> directly affect the movies — hits next fall.</p>

      <p>A mix of 1950s sitcom and epic MCU adventure reunites Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany). Oh, and also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/23/20830546/marvel-wandavision-disney-plus-series-cast-kat-dennings-randall-park-d23">Darcy (Kat Dennings), Jimmy Woo (Randall Park)</a>, grown-up Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), and Kathryn Hahn as a nosy neighbor. Likely drawing from comic limited series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/25/8930049/wandavision-disney-plus-comics-mcu"><i>House of M</i> and <i>Vision</i></a>, it seems like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/7/20/20702323/marvel-wandavision-scarlet-witch-vision-disney-plus-comic-con-sdcc2019">WandaVision </a>might feature some sort of reality warping, which leads us right into the next title...</p>

      <p>Everyone’s favorite MCU bad boy is back in a Disney Plus original. But it won’t be the reformed Loki who tragically perished in the first moments of <i>Avengers: Infinity War.</i> Instead, it’s the version of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/7/20/20702309/marvel-loki-tv-disney-plus-avengers-endgame-release-date-sdcc-2019">Loki from the alternate 2012</a>, who escaped with the tesseract. Tom Hiddleston returns to the role.</p>

      <p>A part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in only the loosest sense, <i>What If...? </i>is based on the long-standing Marvel tradition of What If...? stories answering questions about the company’s continuity. Like “what if Uncle Ben hadn’t died?,” or “what if Captain America and Iron Man hadn’t split in Civil War?”</p>
      <p>The Disney Plus series will be animated, and feature <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/22/20704303/marvel-what-if-voice-cast-actors-jeffrey-wright-watcher-disney-plus">lots of voice talent from the live-action MCU</a>, with Jeffrey Wright (<i>Westworld</i>) as the Watcher, who traditionally narrates every What If...? story.</p>

      <p>Even though we’re all confused about <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/14/jeremy-renners-ex-wife-sonni-says-gun-in-mouth-threat/">what’s going on with Jeremy Renner right now</a>, the series where <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/20/20702356/marvel-hawkeye-series-jeremy-renner-kate-bishop-disney-plus-sdcc-2019">Clint Barton trains his successor Kate Bishop</a> is still happening! <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/9/20857667/hailee-steinfeld-kate-bishop-hawkeye-disney-plus">Hailee Steinfeld (<i>Bumblebee</i>) </a>will reportedly play Kate.</p>
