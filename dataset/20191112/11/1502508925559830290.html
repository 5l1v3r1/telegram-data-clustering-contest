      <h1>India's Q2 GDP data crucial, rupee to decline further on weak numbers: DBS</h1>
      <h2>India's industrial production contracted sharply by 4.3 per cent Y-o-Y in September against the 2.5 per cent consensus. August's contraction was revised down to 1.4 per cent from 1.1 per cent.</h2>

      <p>India's July-September quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, scheduled for a release on November 29, will be important as headline growth has already slipped to a six-year low, said Singapore's DBS Bank in its daily report on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"Headline growth has already slipped to a six-year low of 5 per cent Y-o-Y in the quarter ending June," said the bank.</p>
      <p>A disappointing GDP report could lift USD/INR above its two-month range between 70.5 and 71.5 and bring it closer to the year's high around 72.5, believes DBS.</p>
      <p>The Indian rupee depreciated to 71.47 from 71.29 on Monday, noted the bank.</p>
      <p>India's industrial production contracted sharply by 4.3 per cent Y-o-Y in September against the 2.5 per cent consensus. August's contraction was revised down to 1.4 per cent from 1.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>The weakness was broad-based, cutting across capital goods, consumer durables, and infrastructure and construction.</p>
      <p>In particular, the sharp 20.7 per cent decline in capital goods production did not bode well for investment, a sign that the economic slowdown has become entrenched, according to the bank.</p>
      <p>In its Monday report, DBS said it expected the 2QFY20 GDP to show that the economy slowed further against 5 per cent in the first quarter.</p>
