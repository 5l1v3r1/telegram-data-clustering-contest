      <p>Meanwhile, young Englishman Rahsford was in inspired form and a thorn in the side of the Brighton Hove &amp; Albion defence as the Red Devils powered their way to a 3-1 win at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Rashford also produced a bit of skill Ronaldinho would be proud of, as his "elastico" effort bamboozled midfielder Davy Propper.</p>
