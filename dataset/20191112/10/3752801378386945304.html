      <p>"This is as a result of flooding. It will be closed for an unknown period of time. We have reached out to the Department of Transport's engineers to assess the damage so far. I don't think the road will be opened today," Durban Metro Police spokesperson Senior Superintendent Parbhoo Sewpersad said.</p>
      <p>He said alternate routes were the M41, N2 and the R102.</p>
      <p>Verulam, Amanzimtoti, Chatsworth and other low-lying areas were also affected by the rains.</p>
      <p>Disaster management teams in the province have been on high alert since Sunday, following reports of severe thunderstorms.</p>
      <p>Teams were placed on alert after the South African Weather Service indicated a strong possibility of severe thunderstorms that could lead to localised flooding in large parts of the province.</p>
      <p>Recently, four people were killed in a lightning strike in Mkuze, in northern KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
