      <h1>Celtics F Hayward has surgery on broken left hand</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> forward Gordon Hayward had surgery on his broken left hand, a move that is expected to keep him out for about six weeks.</p>
      <p>The team sent out a release late in the first quarter of Monday's game against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/dallas-mavericks">Dallas</a> that Hayward had successful surgery "to repair a fourth metacarpal fracture in his left hand."</p>
      <p>Hayward broke his hand in a collision with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/san-antonio-spurs">Spurs</a> forward LaMarcus Aldridge in the second quarter of Saturday night's game in San Antonio. He left the game and did not return.</p>
      <p>"He was frustrated. He was down," coach Brad Stevens said at the team's morning shootaround. "But this isn't like last time."</p>
      <p>Hayward, 29, missed all but five minutes of the 2017-18 season after breaking his leg in the first quarter of the opener against Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Forward Jayson Tatum also said Hayward seemed frustrated after the latest setback.</p>
      <p>"I feel bad for him. He was just getting back to being himself," Tatum said. "It's a bummer."</p>
      <p>Hayward returned last season and played in 72 games, most of them off the bench, and averaged 11.5 points and 4.5 rebounds - far short of his numbers before the injury. He had been closer to his peak performance in the first seven games this season, averaging 19 points, four assists and a career-high seven rebounds before the latest injury.</p>
      <p>"He'll be out a little bit and go from there, and he'll come back," Stevens said before the game. "This is not a season-ending thing. There's a silver lining whenever you miss games is you're more fresh in the end. He's playing great, but there's other guys that are ready to step up and fill the void."</p>
      <p>His teammates know how well he was playing.</p>
      <p>"The crazy thing is he was playing unbelievable," forward Enes Kanter said. "I said in the beginning of the season, 'He's back, 100%. And he's going to shock the world.' He was shocking the world. Now he's got that injury. But I know he's going to come back and be amazing again."</p>
      <p>Kanter was cleared to return for Monday night's game against the Dallas Mavericks after missing seven games with a left knee contusion. Kanter said he was not aware of any limitations on his playing time.</p>
      <p>"Let's see what happens tonight," he said. "I've been like trying to get into game shape the last two weeks. We'll just see how it feels."</p>
