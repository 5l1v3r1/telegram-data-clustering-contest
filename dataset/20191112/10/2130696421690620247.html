      <p>SINGAPORE sovereign wealth fund GIC and the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock have inked a deal to buy Kellas Midstream from private equity firm Antin Infrastructure Partners.</p>
      <p>Kellas Midstream owns and operates key gas infrastructure in the UK Central and Southern North Sea.</p>
      <p>GIC and BlackRock’s Global Energy and Power Infrastructure Funds (GEPIF) III are making the purchase via a joint venture, for an undisclosed amount.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Kellas Midstream comprises gas transportation and processing system Central Area Transmission System (CATS); the Esmond Transportation System (ETS), a subsea pipeline in the Southern North Sea; and the Humber Gathering System (HGS), a greenfield project building the infrastructure for the development of a large gas field in the Southern North Sea.</p>

      <p>Antin, which focuses on infrastructure investments, had first acquired a 63 per cent stake in CATS from BG group (now part of Shell) in 2014 for £562 million (S$983.6 million). Antin then increased its stake to 99 per cent by buying a 36 per cent interest from BP the following year.</p>
      <p>Kellas Midstream then expanded in the UK Southern North Sea by acquiring ETS and the HGS development.</p>
      <p>It has also connected to new major gas fields such as Stella, Caley &amp; Shaw, Culzean and Vorlich.</p>
      <p>A growing number of institutional investors are seeking exposure to energy and power investments, said Mark Florian, group head of the GEPIF team at investment giant BlackRock.</p>
      <p>“Within the sector, energy from gas is viewed as a necessary component of the energy transition as we move towards a lower carbon economy,” Mr Florian added.</p>
      <p>GIC’s chief investment officer of infrastructure, Ang Eng Seng, said the sovereign wealth fund will be a long-term investor and support the future growth of Kellas Midstream.</p>
      <p>Bank of America Securities and Citi were financial advisers to Antin, while Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges acted as its legal adviser.</p>
      <p>RBC Capital Markets and Scotiabank were financial advisers to BlackRock Real Assets and GIC, and Herbert Smith Freehills and Xodus acted as their legal and technical advisers respectively.</p>
