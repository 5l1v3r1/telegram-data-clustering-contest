      <h3>THE House of Representatives has ratified the final version of the bill postponing the May 2020 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan elections.</h3>
      <p>The bill resets the elections to December 2022.</p>
      <p>The measure allows incumbent elected barangay and SK officials to continue implementing policies and complete programs affected by the budget delays early this year.</p>
      <p>The same measure has been ratified by the Senate.</p>
      <p>The bill will now be transmitted to Malacañang for the President’s signature.</p>
      <p>The elections were supposed to be held on May 11, 2020.</p>
      <p>The last barangay elections were held in May 2018 by virtue of a law signed by President Rodrigo Duterte postponing the October 2017 polls.</p>
