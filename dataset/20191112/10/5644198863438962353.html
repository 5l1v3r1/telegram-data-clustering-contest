      <p>HONG KONG: Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday (Nov 12) said protesters who are trying to "paralyse" the city were extremely selfish and hoped all universities and schools would urge students not to participate in violence.</p>
      <p>Lam was speaking a day after police shot a protester and a man was set on fire in some of the most dramatic scenes to grip the city during the more than five months of civil unrest.</p>
