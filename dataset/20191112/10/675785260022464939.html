      <h1>UK weather forecast: Snow to slam Britain after -9C night - will it hit near you?</h1>
      <h2>The Met Office says 5-10cm of snow is expected in places amid the first cold snap of the season - bringing widespread frost and ice - as heavy rain threatens towns ravaged by flooding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:01:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>Britain is set to be slammed by up to 10cm of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snow">snow</a> after temperatures plunge as low as -9C on the coldest night of autumn so far.</p>
      <p>This week has brought the first cold snap of the season, with temperatures several degrees below normal, and nasty <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> conditions are expected from Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has issued heavy rain warnings for parts of England and Northern Ireland as downpours threaten flood-ravaged towns in Yorkshire and the Midlands.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, heavy snow is possible over high ground in Scotland, England and Wales from Wednesday night, and there could be a few flakes or sleet in Northern Ireland as well.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill told Mirror Online: "The higher ground of Scotland, northern England and Wales will see some sleet and snow through (Tuesday) morning and thereafter it’s an improving picture.</p>
      <p>"Over high ground of the Peak District the heavier rain may bring a little sleet or snow.</p>
      <p>"Things will turn drier apart from the odd sleet or snow shower for Scotland.</p>
      <p>"The bigger problem is the rainfall amounts, particularly across the areas still affected by flooding from the heavy rain last week.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In Scotland, heavy snow is expected as a front moves in from the west from Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, with 5-10cm possible over the Cairngorms and a few centimetres in the Highlands.</p>
      <p>Up to 4cm is possible in the North East of England and about 1cm could fall in the Peak District in central England. Some snow is possible over high ground in Wales.</p>
      <p>The exact path of the front remains uncertain, however.</p>
      <p>As temperatures drop overnight, ice patches, widespread frost and freezing fog are expected to develop.</p>
      <p>Mr Burkill said: "It’s a cold week. Temperatures are a little bit below average. With the wet and windy weather it is feeling cold.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"There will be a little bit of sleet and snow, but that’s not that unusual for this time of year.</p>
      <p>"Tuesday night is probably going to be the coldest night - we could get lows of maybe -8C or -9C in the sheltered glens in Scotland, in the valleys.</p>
      <p>"That would make it coldest night of the autumn so far.</p>
      <p>"Even southern parts of the UK could get some patchy frost with lows of -1C or -2C."</p>
      <p>Average temperatures for this time of year are daytime maximums of 10-11C in the south and 8C in the north, and overnight lows of 5C in the south and 2-3C in the north.</p>
