      <p>MOBO founder Kanya King said: “We felt empowered to bring MOBO back to Brent to coincide with the borough’s Year of Culture because this is where our fight to challenge the status quo to create a level playing field started.</p>
      <p>“We are returning with even more determination and energy to support and boost our culture wherever we can.”</p>
