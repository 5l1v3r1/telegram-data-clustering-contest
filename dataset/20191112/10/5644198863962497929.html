      <p>LOS ANGELES: The star of Disney's hugely ambitious new Star Wars television series remembers the moment he first stepped into a galaxy far, far away.</p>
      <p>Pedro Pascal was trying on his character's helmet for "The Mandalorian" - the mega-budget, live-action show which launches the Disney+ streaming platform this Tuesday (Nov 12) - when he caught a glimpse in the mirror.</p>

      <p>"If you grow up playing with Star Wars toys, and seeing the movies, and then you're staring at yourself and you are the image of that childhood imagination - it's a super 'pinch me' moment," recalled Pascal.</p>
      <p>Disney is banking heavily on audiences getting that same feeling.</p>
      <p>Its new rival to Netflix - costing US$6.99 a month in the US - trades heavily on nostalgia, boasting a huge back-catalog from classic Disney animations and Pixar favorites to Marvel superhero films and "The Simpsons".</p>
      <p>But Disney+ has relatively few original titles at launch, meaning a lot is riding on "The Mandalorian".</p>
      <p>Written and helmed by Jon Favreau, who directed Disney's wildly successful remakes of "The Jungle Book" and "The Lion King", the show brings together a constellation of stars from within and beyond the legendary franchise.</p>
      <p>Chilean actor Pascal, familiar to fans of "Game of Thrones" and "Narcos", plays a masked bounty hunter known as The Mandalorian.</p>
      <p>Plot details are tightly under wraps. But the story is set five years after "Return of the Jedi," and follows his adventures as a gun-for-hire roaming the galaxy's lawless outer reaches.</p>
      <p>"He's cloaked in mystery - an entire story that is literally hidden underneath the armor," Pascal told journalists at a Los Angeles press conference.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by veteran action star Carl Weathers ("Rocky"), former martial arts fighter Gina Carano ("Deadpool") and "Breaking Bad" villain Giancarlo Esposito.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LUCAS'S RIGHT HAND</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taika Waititi ("Jojo Rabbit", "Thor: Ragnarok") directs an episode as well as voicing a droid, while Nick Nolte and German auteur Werner Herzog also have roles.</p>
      <p>But die-hard Star Wars fans will be most excited by the presence of executive producer and director Dave Filoni, described as George Lucas's "right-hand man."</p>
      <p>Star Wars creator Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012.</p>
      <p>But Filoni worked for almost a decade closely alongside the filmmaker on previous Star Wars projects, and brings some old-school continuity to the project.</p>
      <p>"One of the dreams George had even when I worked with him on 'Clone Wars,' he would talk about the future being streaming, the future being episodic, serialized Star Wars," said Filoni.</p>
      <p>Huge advances in technology - and Disney's deep pockets - have now brought what was once only possible in blockbuster films to the small screen.</p>
      <p>"I tried to offer the knowledge that I've had passed on to me by George for Star Wars, and the way that he likes to shoot things," said Filoni.</p>
      <p>Lucas himself even visited the set, appearing in an Instagram photo shared by Favreau last year.</p>
      <p>Along with "The Mandalorian," at least two other live-action Star Wars series are in the works for Disney+.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DISNEY ARCHIVE</b>
      </p>
      <p>From launch, the platform will also premiere a live-action remake of "Lady and the Tramp".</p>
      <p>Post-production of the new movie took place on the same studio lot outside Los Angeles where the 1955 original was created.</p>
      <p>It was filmed using real dogs - mainly strays rescued from shelters and foster families - who had mouth movements superimposed onto them with computer-generated visual effects.</p>
      <p>Tessa Thompson and Justin Theroux voice the pampered pure-breed and stray mutt who fall deeply in love.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will also feature at launch a new mockumentary based on "High School Musical".</p>
      <p>The 10-episode scripted series sees pupils at the real Salt Lake City school where the original movie was filmed rehearse a new production of its hit songs 13 years later.</p>
      <p>According to Disney, the show has been created "through the lens of 2019's significant cultural sensibilities" - for instance, the lead female character is being raised by two moms.</p>
      <p>But fondness for cherished past favorites will be key for Disney+, as it competes in a crowded marketplace with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, HBO Max and more.</p>
      <p>The Mouse House is opening its film archive on the streaming platform, with movies from classics "Old Yeller" and "Fantasia" through to "Frozen" and "Iron Man" online from day one.</p>
      <p>Subscribers will have to wait longer for a vast pipeline of new projects, from a grown-up "Lizzie McGuire" reboot starring Hilary Duff to multiple Marvel superhero TV shows.</p>
