      <h1>The 'Green Eggs &amp; Ham' Voice Cast Includes SO Many Celebs</h1>

      <p>Following <i>Horton Hears a Who!</i>, <i>The Lorax</i>, and <i>The Grinch</i>, Netflix's <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> is the next of Dr. Seuss' beloved books to be translated to screen. And just like the adaptations before it, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/80003-dr-seuss-green-eggs-and-ham-series-coming-to-netflix-with-the-help-of-ellen-degeneres"><i>Green Eggs and Ham's </i>voice cast</a> includes a full plate of stars. In fact, there's even a prominent celeb behind-the-scenes: Ellen DeGeneres serves as an executive producer.</p>
      <p>According to Snopes, Dr. Seuss used only <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/green-eggs-and-ham/">50 words in <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i></a> based on a dare from his editor. The Netflix series expands that story significantly, including a number of new characters in addition to the iconic Sam-I-Am — and a number of actors to voice them. In the TV show, the unnamed second character from the book who dislikes greens eggs and ham is called Guy-Am-I. Per Deadline, he <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/02/green-eggs-and-ham-michael-douglas-adam-devine-diane-keaton-among-voice-cast-for-ellen-degeneres-netflix-series-1202560003/">joins forces with Sam</a> despite their different tastes in food in order to save an endangered animal from a zoo. Along the way to Meepville, Sam-I-Am and Guy-Am-I encounter plenty of other characters — each of whom add more star power to the already impressive voice cast.</p>
      <p><i>Green Eggs and Ham</i> may be for kids, but <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/green-eggs-and-ham-animated-series-cast/">the actors behind the characters</a> will make adults want to watch too.</p>
      <h3>Adam Devine as Sam-I-Am</h3>

      <p>Adam Devine gets the honor of portraying <i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>'s main character — and the only one with a name in the original book. The <i>Workaholics</i> star has been quite a workaholic himself in 2019, appearing in <i>Isn't It Romantic</i>, <i>The Righteous Gemstones</i>, and <i>Jexi</i>.</p>
      <h3>Michael Douglas as Guy-Am-I</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The character who eventually comes to like green eggs and ham is played by Michael Douglas. After his tenure on <i>The Streets of San Francisco</i> in the 1970s, the Oscar winner returned to TV regularly with Netflix's <i>The Kominsky Method,</i> and he's sticking with the streaming platform as Guy-Am-I.</p>
      <h3>Diane Keaton as Michellee</h3>

      <p>Another Hollywood legend in the cast is Diane Keaton, who will be channeling her voice acting days from <i>Look Who's Talking Now</i> as Michellee. She's also collaborated with DeGeneres before as the voice of Jenny in <i>Finding Dory</i>.</p>
      <h3>Ilana Glazer as EB</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The <i>Broad City</i> co-creator and star portrays Michellee's daughter EB. She previously lent her voice to another Netflix animated series (and admittedly, a much darker one) — <i>BoJack Horseman</i>. She's next set to star in horror movie <i>False Positive</i>, which she co-wrote with John Lee.</p>
      <h3>Tracy Morgan as Fox</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>In the book, Guy-Am-I said he wouldn't want to eat green eggs and ham with a fox — which <i>30 Rock </i>and <i>Last O.G. </i>star Tracy Morgan will take some offense to, since his character is a fox named Fox.</p>
      <h3>Eddie Izzard as Snerz</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2019/11/5/4c77fb13-2034-4272-8a4c-49c1114c3520-getty-1147374096.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Noam Galai/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The British comedian and transgender activist will show his villainous side as Snerz, a no-nonsense business tycoon. But Eddie Izzard has practice with that since he voiced Voldemort in <i>The Lego Batman Movie</i>.</p>
      <h3>Jeffrey Wright as McWinkle</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2019/11/5/5064bea7-da70-418a-848d-baa2233c59a9-getty-1163239065.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Jeffrey Wright is trading in androids for animation. The <i>Westworld</i> star plays a poacher named McWinkle, who will surely interfere with Sam and Guy's quest.</p>
      <h3>Jillian Bell as Gluntz</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/5/228a032b-8181-4820-9567-0d5b61ad4bff-31086c08-fdd4-4606-aa72-c54453f4964d-getty-1182951347.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Joe Maher/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>McWinkle doesn't operate alone. One of his minions is Gluntz, played by Devine's old <i>Workaholics</i> costar and <i>Brittany Runs a Marathon</i> lead Jillian Bell.</p>
      <h3>Daveed Diggs as Mouse</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/5/8057fcc9-5d96-4353-81d5-9ef29314f8b2-752b192e-1a9f-44e2-b9bf-e72588e2eb03-getty-1170000734.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>Hamilton</i> star Daveed Diggs is another one of McWinkle's lackeys named Mouse — yet another creature Guy didn't want to eat green eggs and ham with<i>.</i></p>
      <h3>John Turturro as Goat</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2019/11/5/4f704ac6-0b91-4fe7-867e-a5006ca8bdc8-getty-1176485690.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Andrea Staccioli/LightRocket/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Guy and Sam will have their fair share of obstacles, including John Turturro's bounty hunter. His name is Goat (another reference to the original book), and knowing the <i>Transformers </i>and <i>Night Of </i>star's ability to play tough guys, he's sure to be intimidating.</p>
      <h3>Keegan-Michael Key as The Narrator</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2019/11/5/7b39980c-2b6c-4952-9f0f-459309ae029e-getty-1185301838.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
        <figcaption>Rodin Eckenroth/WireImage/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>What's a storybook brought to life without a narrator? Following his stint as the Ritual Master in Netflix' <i>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</i>, Keegan-Michael Key handles narrating duties for Sam-I-Am and company.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Variety</i>, the cast has already <a href="https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/ellen-degeneres-green-eggs-ham-dr-seuss-rapper-1203391480/">finished recording Season 2</a>, so prepare to hear their voices back onscreen in the near future.</p>
