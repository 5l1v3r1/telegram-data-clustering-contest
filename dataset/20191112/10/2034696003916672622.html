      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> star Emilia Clarke has responded to a fan-made petition to remake season 8 of the show, calling the backlash “flattering”.</p>
      <p>The finale of the HBO hit has met plenty of criticism since it aired earlier this year, with <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-finale-was-really-rushed-admits-director-2556942">even the show’s director admitting it was “really rushed”</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Now, speaking on <i>This Morning</i> to promote her new film <i>Last Christmas</i>, Clarke has discussed the backlash to the last season of the show.</p>
      <p>“On every level, it’s just profoundly flattering that people genuinely cared that much and they were with us for that long and that they really, truly believed in it,” she began.</p>

      <p>“I don’t read anything online really because it doesn’t help my brain, but largely speaking I think people are being really kind about Daenerys and Mother Dragon and backing me up, so that’s lovely.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s an ending that anyone could’ve written,” Clarke continued, before referencing the fan-made petition. “No matter how many signatures were on any bit of paper, you just can’t and that is really just so flattering.”</p>
      <p>As of the time of writing, nearly two million fans have <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-fans-launch-petition-2488324">signed the petition for Season 8 of <i>Game of Thrones</i> to be re-made</a>, and a number of <i>Thrones</i> stars have subsequently aired their thoughts on the response, with actor <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-star-alfie-allen-was-pissed-off-by-finale-backlash-2540758">Alfie Allen recently saying that he was “pissed off” by the online backlash</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers">The petition</a> reads: “David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have proven themselves to be woefully incompetent writers when they have no source material (i.e. the books) to fall back on. This series deserves a final season that makes sense. Subvert my expectations and make it happen, HBO!”</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-sequel-starring-naomi-watts-has-been-cancelled-by-hbo-2562428">HBO scrapped an upcoming <i>Game Of Thrones</i> prequel, set to star Naomi Watts, even though a pilot episode had already been filmed</a>.</p>
      <p>In its place, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/house-dragon-hbo-confirms-new-game-thrones-prequel-2562527">a full series for a separate <i>Game Of Thrones</i> spin-off titled <i>House Of The Dragon</i></a> is instead set to begin production with HBO.</p>
