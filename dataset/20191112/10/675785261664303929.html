      <h1>Conor McGregor mysteriously deletes tweets criticising Khabib Nurmagomedov's cousin</h1>
      <h2>The Irishman mocked the Russian for tapping out at the weekend - despite McGregor doing the same against Nate Diaz in 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:43:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> has deleted a string of tweets aimed at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khabib-nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov's</a> cousin Abubakar.</p>
      <p>The former two-weight champion took to social media to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/conor-mcgregor-slams-khabib-nurmagomedovs-20849268">criticise the fighter</a> after he tapped out at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ufc">UFC</a> Moscow.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomeodov was beaten by David Zawada who locked in the submission with two minutes of the first round remaining.</p>
      <p>And McGregor said: “Nurmagotaptap. Hahahah s****bags.</p>
      <p>“He tapped his forehead.If you can tap his forehead. You can punch his forehead. He quit. 1 quitter exposed. Abubakar Nurmagotaptap. Forever a failure."</p>
      <p>The irony was not lost on fans after McGregor himself tapped out against Khabib in their lightweight world title fight last year - and against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nate-diaz">Nate Diaz</a> in their first meeting in 2016.</p>

      <p>The UFC champion was in his cousin's corner for the fight and responded to the debut defeat.</p>
      <p>He wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> : "You never know brother, everything from God..</p>
      <p>"Keep on; you never know what lies ahead, but men are different in that they are tested with dignity.</p>
      <p>"Everything from the Almighty, in this life there are things more serious brother. You never know brother, everything from God.”</p>
      <p>McGregor has not fought since he was submitted in the fourth round by Nurmagomedov last year but is expected to return on January 18 against Donald Cerrone.</p>
      <p>The Irishman then wants to fight Jorge Masvidal after his win over Nate Diaz earlier this month, before a rematch with Nurmagomedov</p>
      <p>But the Russian has insisted he will only face McGregor again if he wins 10 fights in succession.</p>

      <p>“As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights," he said. "If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that’s completely possible."</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov is expected to defend his belt against Tony Ferguson in April or May but is reluctant to return to Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>The Nevada State Athletic Commission initially withheld the champion's purse from his fight with McGregor following their post-fight brawl.</p>

      <p>He was later fined $500,000 and insists he will not return unless the commission apologises.</p>
      <p>“They offered me to fight in Vegas in March, but I told them that if Vegas officially apologises for wrongly fining me for that incident on October 6, 2018, then I’ll fight there," he said.</p>
      <p>“If not, then they can assign me to another date. As far as I know, they’re planning in April to hold (a fight card) somewhere in New York, so I’m saying I’m ready for April, or March if Las Vegas apologises.”</p>
