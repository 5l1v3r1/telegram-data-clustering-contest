      <p>Speaking on Heart Breakfast on Tuesday morning, Simon opened up about his new show X Factor: The Band.</p>
      <p>Host Amanda Holden asked him: "What is going on? You completely changed X factor! We all enjoyed the celebrity version, All Stars is now not happening - tell us what’s happening."</p>
      <p>Simon replied: "Very serious Amanda. It is the same with music, radio, TV, sometimes you have just got to do something quick!</p>
      <p>"The truth was that I have a group show that I launched in America four or five years ago, I always decided to do a group show in the UK.</p>
      <p>"So we agreed with ITV that we were going to do X Factor groups in 2020."</p>

      <p>Away from work, the dad-of-one has been completely overhauling his diet.</p>
      <p>He turned vegan and shed a stone and a half earlier this year.</p>
      <aside>For a vain guy he really let go for a while.</aside>
      <p>Meanwhile, last month, Simon's pal<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/simon-cowell-using-75k-treatment-to-get-ripped-abs-following-incredible-weight-loss/"> Sinitta revealed that she bought the music mogul a TESLA Former toning machine for his 60th birthday</a>.</p>
      <p>Sessions last 30 minutes and help to burn fat, build muscle and improve posture by targeting motor nerves in the muscles, giving the same feeling as a high-intensity workout.</p>
      <p>Sinitta told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10252948/simon-cowell-uses-75k-abs-treatment-ripped-six-pack/">The Sun</a>: "For his birthday I got him this machine that you exercise with for half an hour every day and it absolutely rips your abs to shreds.</p>

      <p>The treatment can cost around £75,000.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Simon's transformation, Sinitta added: "I think he’s feeling pretty good. For a vain guy he really let go for a while. But now he’s going for the six-pack, the whole thing."</p>
