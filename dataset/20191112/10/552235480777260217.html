      <h1>Coca-Cola Christmas truck arrives in Scotland this week - here's where it is stopping</h1>
      <h2>Holidays are coming...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:03:27+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>The Coca-Cola is heading to Scotland this week as it kick starts the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> countdown, much to the delight of eagerly awaiting fans.</p>
      <p>Starting its tour on Friday, November 15, the Coca-Cola Truck will visit 19 stops nationwide before making its final stop in London on Sunday, December 15.</p>
      <p>In a snowy winter wonderland setting, visitors will be able to enjoy festive photo moments and a small can of Coca-Cola zero sugar to get them in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> spirit.</p>
      <p>The truck is arriving in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> this Friday, November 15 and Saturday, November 16 to Fort Kinaird, Newcraighall Road - the only Scottish stop on its tour.</p>

      <p>It's as synonymous with Christmas as the John Lewis advert, and each year when you hear the jingle and see the illuminated red truck drive across your television screen, you know that holidays are most certainly coming.</p>
      <p>This year, Coca-Cola has partnered with Crisis - the national homelessness charity, which is now in its 52 year.</p>
      <p>Coca-Cola will donate 10p for each can recycled by visitors at the truck tour, with funds going to Crisis to help people out of homelessness.</p>
      <p>Kris Robbens, Marketing Director at Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland, comments: “Christmas is all about sharing special moments with friends and loved ones and we’re looking forward to spreading the festive cheer across Great Britain again this year with our iconic Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour.</p>
      <p>“Whilst Christmas is a moment of celebration, it’s also incredibly important to remember those that need support throughout the season. So, we’re really pleased to partner with Crisis and whilst guests at the tour enjoy a refreshing Coca-Cola zero sugar, when they recycle their can, they’ll be helping to support an amazing charity.”</p>
      <p>Fans can head to 32 Newcraighall Road from 12pm to 7pm on both Friday and Saturday.</p>
