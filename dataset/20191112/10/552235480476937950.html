      <p>A Perthshire mum, who has dedicated the past two decades to supporting those with brain injuries, has been nominated for a national award.</p>
      <p>Evelyn Menzies (68) from Dunkeld saw her life change forever in 1998 when she received a devastating phone call.</p>
      <p>Her son Niall was fighting for his life after being involved in a car accident while on holiday in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Niall was left in a coma for 13 weeks and when he eventually returned home to Perthshire, he had to learn all of life’s most basic things, such as walking and talking.</p>
      <p>Evelyn ended up becoming his full-time carer and life became very hard.</p>
      <p>She said: “Niall didn’t even know how to swallow when he came out of his coma so the road back to some form of independent life was very long.</p>
      <p>“It was a very dark time and as a family we were all very badly affected.</p>
      <p>“Things were made even worse when we realised that there wasn’t much support from the government.”</p>
      <p>Now, Evelyn has been nominated for the Stephen McAleese outstanding contribution to Headway award.</p>
      <p>She said things were able to improve for her and her family after discovering her local Headway group, which helps to support people with brain injuries.</p>
      <p>Evelyn now volunteers for the charity as its chair.</p>
      <p>She continued: “Finding Headway was a lifeline for me and my family.</p>
      <p>“We were able to not only get support but also provide advice to other people going through what we did.</p>
      <p>“It was a wonderful feeling to realise there were people who understood, who could lend a hand and listen.”</p>
      <p>Having been a volunteer and a member at Headway Perth and Kinross for the past 16 years, she has helped to create new services which help people come to terms with the effects of a brain injury.</p>
      <p>She has also represented the charity at national events, even speaking about the issue in the Scottish Parliament.</p>
      <p>Evelyn will find out if she has won the award on Friday, December 6, when she will attend a glittering ceremony at the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair.</p>
      <p>Joyce Cattanach, development officer at Headway East Lothian, nominated Evelyn for the award after working alongside her on a number of projects.</p>
      <p>When Joyce told Evelyn she had been nominated for the award, she broke down in tears.</p>
      <p>Joyce said: “Evelyn’s passion to support Headway and those affected by brain injury is endless, so I’m delighted that she has been shortlisted.</p>
      <p>“Despite caring for her own son and the pressures that brings, she has become a great friend to many of the service’s users and a great ambassador for Headway in both her local area and nationally.</p>
      <p>“She is a star and deserves to be recognised as one by all who have the pleasure of meeting and working with her.”</p>
