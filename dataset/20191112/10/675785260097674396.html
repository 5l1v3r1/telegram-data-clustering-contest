      <p>A vicious thug who battered a mum unconscious with a saucepan after "going psycho" in his home has been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crime">jailed</a> for 14 years.</p>
      <p>Darran Read, 38, left the woman terrified she was going to die in the sustained bloody encounter.</p>
      <p>A court heard he had initially appeared to be a "charming" gentleman when he met her in a nightclub and invited her for a drink at his home.</p>
      <p>But hours later, he flipped into a violent rage and repeatedly hit her over the head with the pan.</p>
      <p>The motive, if any, still remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Read was yesterday locked up for 14 years after a jury convicted him of wounding with intent.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Sentencing at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Paul Sloan QC said: "Whatever it was that triggered your violence, I have no doubt, on the evidence I heard at trial, that you flew into a particularly violent rage.</p>
      <p>"I'm satisfied there was no good reason for the brutal and sustained attack that ensued.</p>
      <p>"You armed yourself with a saucepan and deliberately targeted her head with the saucepan repeatedly and she was already bleeding after the second blow struck her.</p>
      <p>"She went to the floor where she cowered and tried to protect herself by putting her arms up to protect her head.</p>
      <p>"She described it as horrendous and she thought she was going to die.</p>
      <p>"You hit her with such force, the pan was severely dented."</p>
      <p>The court heard Read, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, continued drinking for hours as the vulnerable victim lay injured on the floor in a pool of blood.</p>
      <p>He even went for a bath, delaying summoning help for hours and prolonging her suffering. He eventually called 999 some time later.</p>
      <p>The victim said in a statement read to the court: "I'm absolutely distraught at what Darran Read has done to me.</p>
      <p>"This started off with me going out with friends and I met him in a bar and was expecting to go back to his home for a drink and it was only for a drink.</p>

      <p>"He attacked me in what was the most horrific time in my life.</p>
      <p>"I truly believe he was trying to kill me. My life flashed before my eyes.</p>
      <p>"I was in so much pain and I was in hospital for days after being battered senseless with a saucepan."</p>
      <p>The woman said her mental health has deteriorated as a result of the attack and she has tried to take her own life.</p>
      <p>She also described a nightmare she has, saying: "He takes a knife from the kitchen and stabs my son to death, it's horrific seeing Darran Read's face and the death of my son."</p>
      <p>The victim added: "I don't think I will ever get over this. I believe he is a dangerous man."</p>
      <p>She suffered three wounds to her head, two black eyes, bruising and swelling to her arms and a fracture to her right arm and wrist.</p>
      <p>Read's previous convictions include child sex offences and harassment.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of indecently assaulting a female child in 1996 and a male child in 1997 and was jailed for four years in 2009 for sexual activity with a girl aged under 13.</p>
      <p>By way of mitigation, the court heard there was limited premeditation, he had an unhappy childhood and suffered mental health issues, although he had told health professionals the day before the attack he was fine.</p>
