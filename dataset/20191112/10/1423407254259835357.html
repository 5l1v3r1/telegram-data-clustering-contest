      <p>As support ends for Windows 7 on January 14, 2020, there has never been a better time to get acquainted with Windows 10 and modern devices.</p>
      <p>With comprehensive security, business-class tools, flexible management and the freedom to choose your own hardware, Windows 10 Pro is a solid foundation for the modern workplace. It helps that Windows 10 is the most secure Windows ever. Windows 10 Pro includes built-in protections for your data, equipment and people, securing business information and personal identities even on lost or stolen devices.</p>
      <p>Business essentials like firewall, secure boot and file-level information-loss protection come standard on every device [1].</p>
      <p>With the Windows 10 November 2019 Update, hard encryption is now easy with a key-rolling feature that securely rotates recovery passwords on Mobile Device Management (MDM)-managed devices. Whenever Microsoft Intune/MDM tools or a recovery password is used to unlock a BitLocker-protected drive, it activates this feature. As a result, the recovery password will be better protected when users manually unlock a BitLocker drive.</p>
      <p>Windows 10 Pro provides compatibility with more business systems, seamlessly works with the most trusted productivity and collaboration suites, and dramatically improves performance.<br/>With the Windows 10 November 2019 Update, Windows 10 Pro gets several updates that boost users’ productivity: Calendar, Cloud Clipboard, Search your PC and OneDrive.</p>
      <p>Calendar is designed to help users save time and work more efficiently. For example, they can check schedules and create events directly from the taskbar without opening the Calendar app. Just click on the date and time to activate the Calendar flyout, where they’ll see their agenda and can begin typing in the text box for whatever day they choose.</p>
      <p>Cloud Clipboard delivers the ability to copy multiple items to paste later. Copied text is synced across devices, so users can copy on one device and paste it on another. With this update, employees can sign-in with either Azure Active Directory or Microsoft Accounts, so it can improve both business and personal productivity. Get to all clippings, which are kept in chronological order, with a simple keystroke combination [Windows + V]. For content that’s going to be pasted often, such as contact information or a project description that must be sent to multiple parties: pin it.</p>
      <p>Another highlight of the Windows 10 Pro update: having one place from which to find everything online, in OneDrive and on your PC. Use search in Windows – found on the taskbar – to locate apps, documents, email messages, company resources, or even people. With files as likely to be stored in the cloud as they are on PCs and local file servers, Windows 10 powers File Explorer updates to help integrate users’ online OneDrive content with indexed results from their locally stored files, giving search results for content and files that live on both PCs and OneDrive.</p>
      <p>Take advantage of keyboard-free interactions, which increase accessibility and help streamline work flow [2]. With voice control, you can operate your entire PC with spoken commands, eliminating the need for manual inputs. For those who like writing and drawing manually, a broad array of pens and styli enable expression across a multitude of apps. Fingers (and gestures, through them) as well as digital pens control touchscreens on modern devices, expanding the possibilities without additional hardware.</p>
      <p>For IT pros, Windows 10 Pro simplifies identity, device and application management. With flexible management capabilities, such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/windows-autopilot">Windows Autopilot</a>, you can control your IT infrastructure intuitively, without hassles.</p>
      <p>Windows 10 Pro comes pre-installed on a large selection of business devices, from the world’s leading manufacturers. If you’re in business, you know that one size doesn’t fit all. From premium 2-in-1s to powerful workstations, the Windows 10 Pro device ecosystem has what you need.</p>
