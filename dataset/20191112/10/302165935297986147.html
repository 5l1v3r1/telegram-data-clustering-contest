      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 — A man, claiming to be a part-time stringer, pleaded guilty in the Sessions Court here to a charge of causing grievous hurt to a female chief executive officer (CEO) last Friday.</p>
      <p>Mohd Zarith Md Hanipah, 34, made the plea after the charge was read to him before Judge M. M Edwin Paramjothy yesterday.</p>
      <p>The court set Nov 18 for sentencing.</p>
      <p>Mohd Zarith was charged with voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute (ASLI) CEO Melissa Ong, 47, at a hotel here at 12.15pm on Nov 8.</p>
      <p>The charge was framed under Section 325 of the Penal Code which carries maximum seven years imprisonment and shall also be liable to a fine upon conviction.</p>
      <p>DPP Annur Atikah Abdul Hadi offered a bail of RM20,000 in one surety pending the disposal of the case.</p>
      <p>However, the accused who was unrepresented said it was his first offence as he had never hurt anyone before.</p>
      <p>Mohd Zarith said he has five children to look after and had just returned from overseas and was currently working as a freelancer.</p>
      <p>The accused was taken to the Sungai Buloh Prison after he failed to pay the RM15,000 bail set by the court. — Bernama</p>
