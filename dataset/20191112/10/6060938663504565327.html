      <p>INDORE: The last time <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajinkya-Rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> played an ODI for India was in February, 2018 in South Africa. Since then, India's Test deputy has not been able to find a place in the Indian XI in limited-overs cricket.</p>
      <p>However, Rahane, who is an integral part of the Test team, believes he can make it to the Indian ODI team if he keeps on piling runs in red-ball cricket.</p>
      <p>"I just need to play well in the Test matches, keep scoring runs and I am confident that I will be back in the ODI side," Rahane told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh beginning on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"It is all about self-belief and being confident. Staying in the present will help me, if I contribute to the side's cause in Tests, I am sure I will be back in the ODI squad," he added.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has represented India in 90 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ODIs">ODIs</a> in which he has amassed 2,962 runs at 35.26. During the 87 ODI innings he got a chance to bat, Rahane scored three centuries and 24 half-centuries.</p>
      <p>Team India, currently ranked No. 1 in Tests, would be brimming with confidence following their historic 3-0 victory over South Africa and would enter the two-Test series against Bangla Tigers as overwhelming favourites.</p>

      <p>However, Rahane insists the hosts will not take Bangladesh lightly and focus on working on their own strengths.</p>
      <p>"Bangladesh is a very good team. They play as a unit. We focus on our strengths rather than thinking about opposition. With the Test championship, every match is important," said Rahane.</p>
      <p>"We are focussing on the Indore Test right now. I thought we played really well against South Africa, but as a side, we must stay in the present and we do not take any opponent lightly," he added.</p>
      <p>The two teams will also feature in their first Day/Night Test at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> slated to begin from November 22.</p>
      <p>The team management has already made a request to the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) to organise for training under lights for <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> and boys as they prepare for their maiden pink-ball affair.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BCCI.tv, Rahane had already spoken about the need to train well to adapt to the challenges that come with playing with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited personally. It is a new challenge. I don't know how it will turn out but we will get an idea when we have a couple of practice sessions. Only then we will get an idea of how much the pink ball swings and how it works session wise," he pointed.</p>
      <p>"Fans perspective wise also it will be interesting. I think as a batsman lateral movement will be there and it will be best if you play late, that is my personal idea. Adapting shouldn't be a problem," he added.</p>
