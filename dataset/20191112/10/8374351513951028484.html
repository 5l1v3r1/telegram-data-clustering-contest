      <h1>Burger King eyes big bite of Europe market with ‘veggie Whopper’</h1>

      <p>US fast-food giant Burger King on Tuesday launched its meatless burger in Europe, hoping to capture a substantial slice of a growing market.</p>
      <p>The vegetarian version of its prime “Whopper” hamburger is being added to the menu in 25 countries and 2,500 restaurants after testing in the United States and Sweden.</p>
      <p>“It’s the biggest production launch ever done in Europe. We see the potential in the future that this is a growing category,” company president David Shear told AFP.</p>
      <p>The new meatless sandwich is to be launched in Britain at a later date, possibly around the start of next year, the firm said.</p>
      <p>Burger King, which is best known for flame-grilled patties, said with the new product it was now the biggest European fast-food restaurant chain offering a veggie burger.</p>
      <p>The company said the vegetarian product had boosted sales of traditional burgers in the United States, as it attracted new customers who normally did not patronise fast-food outlets.</p>
      <p>Some critics noted however that if the same cooking grills were used for meat and chicken products, strict vegetarians would shun the new offering.</p>
      <p>Shear did not provide details on sales or European market targets, meanwhile.</p>
      <p>The fast-food giant and competitors Yum Brands and Kentucky Fried Chicken have got a step ahead of McDonald’s in the United States in recent months.</p>
      <p>In April, McDonald’s launched a test in Germany of its Big Vegan burger, developed in collaboration with Nestle.</p>
      <p>It has also been testing a meat-free cheeseburger in Canada since late September but is not yet at the stage of large-scale sales.</p>
      <p>The global food industry has seen competition open up for alternative proteins to draw in growing numbers of consumers who have adopted a vegan diet for dietary, ethical or environmental reasons.</p>
      <p>JPMorgan has said the plant-based “meat” market could be worth $100 billion in the next 15 years because of the climate emergency, as beef production is a major global polluter.</p>
      <p>British tycoon Richard Branson has invested in Impossible Foods, while Beyond Meat is part-financed by the billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates.</p>
      <p>They are in competition with Dutch firm The Vegetarian Butcher, which was bought recently by the multinational group Unilever, and which supplies Burger King in Europe.</p>
      <p>Nestle already has had a soya protein and wheat-based hamburger on sale in European and US supermarkets since the end of September.</p>
      <p>Consultants Deloitte said in a recent study: “Gone are the days when plant-based alternative products were for the niche consumer and warranted limited shelf space…</p>
      <p>“The European plant-based alternatives market leads the way in terms of market size, with the European meat substitutes market accounting for around 40 percent of the global market.”</p>
      <p>The market is forecast to grow to 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion, £2.1 billion) by 2025 from 1.5 billion euros in 2018, it added.</p>
