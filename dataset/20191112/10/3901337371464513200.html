      <p>With Messi having previously hinted at a return to his native Argentina, Bartomeu has now seemingly sought to ease Blaugrana fans' fears by making a bold statement about his star man's future.</p>
      <p>"Leo Messi will still play with us for the next two, three, four or five years, I have no doubts about that," the 56-year-old said, as per the<i> Daily Mail.</i></p>
      <p>"Surely it will be the wish of all parties, if he (Messi) feels strong and ambitious, to extend this contract indefinitely.</p>

      <p>"Ultimately it is he who must decide. He has earned the right to decide when he will stop playing football.</p>
      <p>"But like he said a few weeks ago, he wants to finish his playing career at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>"Over the next two or three seasons, our leader will continue to be Leo Messi. There's no doubt that he is still young, still strong. He is still ambitious."</p>
      <p>Bartomeu also revealed that there will be a place at the club for 32-year-old Messi even after he ends his playing career.</p>
      <p>"I have no doubt that after Messi finishes his career as a footballer, he will remain linked to this club for the rest of his life," Bartomeu added.</p>
