      </p>
      <h3>The current claim</h3>
      <p>The royal commission into aged care has wasted little time, releasing an <a href="https://agedcare.royalcommission.gov.au/publications/Pages/interim-report.aspx">interim report</a> describing "a sad and shocking system that diminishes Australia as a nation".</p>
      <p>Labor immediately suggested the blame lay solely with the Coalition.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.richardmarles.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/19.11.01-CHANNEL-9-THE-TODAY-SHOW-TRANSCRIPT.pdf">appearance on Channel Nine's Today Show</a>, Deputy Leader Richard Marles was asked why Labor didn't address longer term "systemic failures" when it was in government.</p>

      <p>"There is nothing systemic about a government making a decision to cut $1.2 billion out of the aged care system," Mr Marles said.</p>
      <p>"And that is the decision that this Prime Minister made when he was the treasurer of this nation. That's what this Government has presided over since they were elected in 2013. They had been in government for the last six years. What's going on?"</p>
      <h3>Previous claims</h3>
      <p>This is not the first time Labor has accused the Coalition of cutting $1.2 billion of funding from the aged care sector.</p>
      <p>In October 2018, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-16/fact-check-did-the-government-cut-aged-care-funding/10363758">Fact Check examined a similar claim</a> made by former opposition leader Bill Shorten.</p>
      <p>In parliament, Mr Shorten asked why Mr Morrison as treasurer had slashed funding to the sector.</p>
      <p>"Yesterday, the Prime Minister stated: 'We are committed to providing older Australians with access to care that supports their dignity …'</p>
      <p>"If that is the case, why, when he was treasurer, in his first budget, did the now Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from aged care? How did cutting $1.2 billion from aged care support the dignity of vulnerable older Australians?"</p>
      <h3>Why these claims are misleading</h3>
      <p>Total Commonwealth funding for aged care — excluding the pension and other forms of income support for seniors, but including a range of other programs — was $17.4 billion in 2016-17, Mr Morrison's first year as treasurer.</p>
      <p>As Fact Check has pointed out previously, that represented an increase of more than $1 billion over the previous year.</p>
      <p>The increase came despite a decision to claw back an estimated $1.2 billion of "efficiencies" over four years by lowering the subsidies paid to aged care providers. This followed concerns over alleged over-claiming by some providers which had led to an unexpected cost blowout.</p>
      <p>As noted by Fact Check previously, the overall level of Commonwealth funding provided for aged care had increased on an annual basis for at least a decade, reflecting Australia's ageing population, increased care requirements, and higher care costs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Fact Check found that funding had increased across a range of measures: in nominal dollar amounts, in real terms (after adjusting for inflation), as a proportion of total expenses, and as a dollar amount per aged care resident per day.</p>
      <p>As some experts contacted by Fact Check suggested, rather than representing a cut, the decision to carve out $1.2 billion of "efficiencies" could be characterised as an attempt to better target aged care funding, at the same time that overall spending continues to rise in real terms.</p>
      <p>So Mr Marles has repeated a claim that we found to be misleading in our <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-16/fact-check-did-the-government-cut-aged-care-funding/10363758">fact check in October last year</a>.</p>
