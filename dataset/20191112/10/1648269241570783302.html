      <h1>Volvo S90 Facelift Spied Showing Small Design Tweaks</h1>
      <h2>A new lower fascia and revised lighting are among the more noticeable revisions.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:59:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/chris-bruce/" target="_blank">Chris Bruce</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volvo/s90/">Volvo S90</a> has an update on the way, and these spy shots provide a close look at the tweaks. Unfortunately, the company keeps the revised parts under black concealment over the black body.</p>

      <p>Compared to the existing S90 (see the slider tool below), this revised model wears a tweaked lower fascia, but the covering over it hides the styling changes. The general shape appears to be the same, so don't expect a major design overhaul. The grille features a more textured design. The headlights have the same silhouette, but the lamps on the inside appear to be slightly different by making the LEDs more prominent.</p>

      <p>The revisions at the back are also tiny. Volvo conceals the taillights, but there are new lamps with a new position for the reverse light. The company also hides the exhausts, but the bumper and trunk designs look the same.</p>

      <p>The facelifted S90 should gain the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/306472/volvo-xc90-facelift-revealed/">kinetic energy recovery braking system</a> from the refreshed <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volvo/xc90/">XC90</a>. On the crossover, the company claims the tech can offer 15 percent fuel savings in real-world driving, so the efficiency improvement should be similar for the sedan.</p>
      <p>There's no info about other powertrain changes but expect the S90 to follow Volvo's increased adoption of hybrid and PHEV tech. The company intends to <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/309040/volvo-last-generation-diesel-engines/">no longer offer diesel engines</a> within the next five to six years.</p>

      <p>Starting in 2020, all <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/307785/volvo-limit-speed-new-cars/">Volvos will have a top speed of 112 miles per hour</a> (180 kilometers per hour). The company is also working on tech that would automatically restrict a vehicle's speed in school zones and around hospitals, but this feature isn't ready for production models yet.</p>
      <p>An exact debut date for the updated S90 is a mystery. Look for it to arrive in 2020 and be on sale in the United States for the 2021 model year.</p>
