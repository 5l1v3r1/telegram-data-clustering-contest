      <p>Spain U17 coach David Gordo said that everyone is "pissed off" after the shock 6-1 quarterfinal defeat to France on Monday and revealed that his players are "destroyed."</p>
      <p>"We're pissed off, the kids are sad, they're destroyed," Gordo said in comments to the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in the mixed zone at the Olympic Stadium in Goiania, Brazil.</p>
      <p>The coach added that is's "difficult" to make an "objective assessment when you have lost by such a heavy scoreline." said</p>
      <p>Gordo added: "We had 20 good minutes, but then they equalised and for the rest of the game they were superior to us and we have to congratulate them for that."</p>
      <p>Atletico Madrid's Valera had opened the scoring for a Spain side that featured Barcelona duo Ilaix Moriba and Jose Martinez.</p>
