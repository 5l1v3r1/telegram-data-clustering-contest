      <p>Top-level executives from both the private and public sectors will come together for the 2019 Top Leaders Forum to find concrete measures that would make businesses more resilient against disasters. The event will be held at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay City, Philippines on November 12.</p>
      <p>Organized by SM Prime Holdings, in partnership with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), ARISE Philippines and the National Resilience Council (NRC), this year’s Top Leaders Forum will also highlight the following: 1) Private sector engagement with the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to ensure the same level of preparedness for disasters; 2) NRC’s Adopt-A-City program to engage the private sector in a more innovative and strategic partnership for resilient local government systems; and 3) The launch of the Young Leaders for Resilience Program to engage the youth in co-creating solutions that will address the resilience challenges of NRC’s partner local government units.</p>
      <p>Now on its 8th year, the 2019 Top Leaders Forum’s theme is “From Risk to Resilience: Forging Pathways and Milestones.” Ms. Mami Mizutori, UN Special Representative to the Secretary General (SRSG) will deliver the keynote address while Mr. Hans T. Sy of ARISE International Board and Secretary Delfin Lorenzana of Department of National Defense both co-chairs of NRC will deliver the Welcome and Opening Messages, respectively.</p>

      <p>For the 1<sup>st</sup> time, youth involvement in DRR is highlighted with the Young Leaders for Resilience Program wherein students from various universities in each LGU underwent a Design Thinking Workshop led by IBM Philippines and co-facilitated by the Asia Pacific College (APC) and National University, together with focal persons from NRC’s LGUs and academic partners. Eight (8) entries from the LGUs will compete for the top prize during the TLF on finding potential solutions on climate and disaster risk profiles of their own cities / province.</p>

The NRC is a science and technology-based public and private partnership that supports government, communities, academe and the private sector in advancing the intersections among the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement and the New Urban Agenda.</p>
