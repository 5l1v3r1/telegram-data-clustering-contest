      <p>Mexico's state oil company Pemex successfully fended off an attempt by threat actors to deploy what may have been the Ryuk ransomware variant on internal systems. </p>
      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="http://Pemex.com/">Pemex</a> asked a number of employees not to try and access corporate networks or IT systems in light of an unexpected shutdown, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/pemex-workers-barred-from-computers-after-unexpected-shutdown">reports</a>.<br/><br/>An unnamed spokeswoman told the publication that a Pemex notice on Twitter prompted rumors of a successful cyberattack which were false. Instead, an attempt to compromise Pemex systems was isolated and dealt with.<br/><br/>The statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/Pemex/status/1194077215060824064">released by Pemex</a>, revealed that the cyberattack was "neutralized" quickly and impacted less than five percent of its computer systems overall.  <br/><br/>Operations, including oil production and storage, are unaffected. </p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/ryuk-ransomware-targeted-campaign-break/">Check Point</a>, Ryuk is used exclusively for tailored, targeted attacks against large organizations and enterprises. The encryption scheme <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-ransomware-campaign-targets-business-and-demands-a-massive-bitcoin-ransom/">used by Ryuk</a> has been developed to hone in on critical IT resources, locking down systems and ramping up the pressure for businesses to pay high blackmail demands.<br/><br/>Ransom notes and subsequent demands range from 15 - 50 Bitcoin (BTC), which equates to hundreds of thousands of dollars. In return, a decryption key is promised for the restoration of access to files and systems.   <br/><br/>In July, Ryuk operators <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-gang-wanted-5-3-million-from-us-city-but-they-only-offered-400000/">demanded $5.3 million</a> from New Bedford, Massachusetts, after installing the malware on the city's internal IT systems. City officials countered with an offer of $400,000 before electing to restore access through backups instead.  <br/><br/>Responses to the Pemex notice, of which ZDNet has been unable at present to verify at the time of writing, include screenshots of what appears to be a ransomware blackmail demand.  <br/><br/><b>TechRepublic: </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-we-must-strike-a-balance-with-ai-to-solve-the-cybersecurity-skills-gap/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b">Why we must strike a balance with AI to solve the cybersecurity skills gap</a> <br/><br/>The demand is very similar to that used by RYK, a <a href="https://www.pcrisk.com/removal-guides/14177-ryk-ransomware">variant of Ryuk</a> discovered by MalwareHunterTeam. The variant encrypts files using the .RYK extension, offers two files for free decryption to back up claims that there is a working decryption key, and requires victims to email operators directly or to use the Tor network to negotiate payment. </p>

      <p>Crowdstrike, FireEye, Kryptos Logic, and McAfee believe that this particular form of ransomware is likely the handiwork of a Russian threat group, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ryuk-ransomware-gang-probably-russian-not-north-korean/">nicknamed Grim Spider</a>, which is financially motivated.  <br/><br/><b>CNET: </b><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-to-employ-californias-digital-privacy-law-nationwide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b">Microsoft to employ California's digital privacy law nationwide</a> <br/><br/>ZDNet has reached out to Pemex with additional queries and will update if we hear back. </p>
