      <h1>This Singapore Grab driver really needs a few more screens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:45:24+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>A Grab driver is drawing a mix of praise and bewilderment for his impressive array of screens that allow him to monitor the road, enjoy a live symphony, and maintain home surveillance. </p>
      <p>Images of the tech-savvy driver and his five screens — three of which are mobile phones — were <a href="https://twitter.com/harvinthskin/status/1194112664991125504">tweeted</a> this afternoon by Malaysian comedian and YouTuber Harvinth Skin, who looks like he got picked up by the driver upon arriving in Singapore.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t all, as Harvinth went on to describe a food menu in the back seat filled with meals for passengers to order – we assume for delivery to wherever his passengers are staying.  </p>
      <p>“Yo Singapore! Your Grab drivers are f***ing crack, got 5 different screens, got time to look at the road ah?” he wrote in a 12:40pm tweet. </p>

      <p>The post has been retweeted nearly 1,000 times since, with Singaporeans jumping in to rain laughing emojis. </p>
      <p>Zoom in a little and see the right-most phone screen showing an apartment door and living room – we hope its his – while the screen in front of the driver hosts navigation. The one dangling next to it shows what looks like a list of contacts.</p>
      <p>Proving his tech heart comes with some soul, the largest screen appears to show an orchestra performing. The one above that streams footage from the car’s various external cams. </p>
      <p>“Multitasking at its best. Monitoring home surveillance and symphony,” Twitter user  @Sethmeright wrote in reply. </p>
      <p>“Need one more for Pokemon GO,” said a @Bryanongg, obviously hip to how popular the game is among Singapore’s taxi drivers. Some hang an extra phone in their car so they can catch monsters while carrying passengers. </p>

      <p>The other surprise onboard the Grab vehicle shared by the Malaysian comedian came via an Instagram story, in which he and a friend flipped through the backseat menu in disbelief. </p>
      <p>“The Grab has a food menu!” Harvinth said while laughing. </p>
      <p>“Premium service,” his friend chimed in.</p>
