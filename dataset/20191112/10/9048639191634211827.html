      <h1>Report: Mississippi ranks in the top 10 states where you are most likely to hit a deer</h1>

      <p><b>JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - </b>November is the peak time for deer collisions and, believe it or not, Mississippi lands a spot in the top 10 states where you are most likely to hit a deer, according to a claims analysis by <a href="https://www.statefarm.com/simple-insights/auto-and-vehicles/how-likely-are-you-to-have-an-animal-collision">State Farm</a>.</p>
      <p>“As it gets cooler the deer start moving more. The cold weather is going to mean more deer hits,” said Leon Hemphill of Capitol Body Shops.</p>
      <p>November’s cooler temperatures and darker nights make it difficult to share the roads with deer, and Capitol Body Shop is gearing up for the busy months ahead.</p>
      <p>“Typically the cooler months: November, December, January, February, we see a majority of the deer hits.”</p>
      <p>Fifteen-percent of the Body Shop’s repairs come from a deer collision, something Hemphill says can be a tough price to pay.</p>
      <p>“The average price of a deer collision now would probably cost you around eight-thousand dollars,” said Hemphill.</p>
      <p>“It could be as little as breaking a mirror or breaking a grill, you know, a couple hundred dollars. Or we have seen eight or twelve thousand dollars in damage,” said Chuck Smith, owner of Smith Brothers Body Shop.</p>
      <p>So what can drivers do to avoid coming face-to-face with a deer? Deer whistles have been a popular product on shelves for years, but do they actually work?</p>
      <p>“Oh, they don’t work. Deer whistles have been proven to not really be that effective,” said Hemphill.</p>
      <p>A claim also echoed by Smith, who said, “I have fixed many cars that have deer whistles. If I have fixed none then maybe I would believe in them.”</p>
      <p>Here are a few reminders to keep in mind before you hit the road.</p>
      <p>“I would suggest to just slow it down this time of year because [deer] are all on the side’s of the roads and wherever you live in the state of Mississippi," suggested Smith.</p>
      <p>“Never try to drive a car that has been involved in a front-end deer collision,” said Hemphill.</p>
