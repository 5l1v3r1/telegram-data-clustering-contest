      <p>Cape Town - <b>Sharks</b> wing <b>Kobus van Wyk</b> has signed with the <b>Hurricanes</b> for the <b>2020 Super Rugby</b> season.</p>
      <p>Van Wyk will head to New Zealand after featuring for the Sharks for the past three seasons.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old previously represented the Stormers and also had a short stint in the French Top 14 with Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>The Wellington-based franchise confirmed their Super Rugby squad on Tuesday and their CEO Avan Lee told the <b>Stuff.co.nz <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/super-rugby/117345274/south-african-back-kobus-van-wyk-the-surprise-of-hurricanes-super-rugby-signing-day">website</a></b> that Van Wyk's arrival came in large part due to coach John Plumtree's connections in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Plumtree is a former player and head coach at the Sharks.</p>
      <p>"John has obviously spent a lot of time in South Africa, so he knows a lot of people over there. Kobus' name came up and then John and (assistant coach) Jason Holland had a look at him play and he was really keen to come out," Lee said.</p>
      <p>"We're really excited by that. Super Rugby is an international competition, but having foreign players in New Zealand doesn't happen that often. He's been picked on ability first, but I think it's cool for fans to have a bit of international flavour."</p>
