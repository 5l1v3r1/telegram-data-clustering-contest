      <p>A woman walked free from court despite being convicted of attacking a paramedic and a police officer in a Wishaw street.</p>
      <p>Chloe Borwick had been given six months to show that she could be of good behaviour after admitting three charges against her relating to an incident in Glasgow Road on April 28 last year.</p>
      <p>On that date, 22-year-old Borwick behaved in a threatening manner by shouting and swearing.</p>
      <p>She then assaulted a female paramedic by kicking her on the body and attacked a police officer by pushing and kicking her.</p>
      <p>Borwick, of Primrose Crescent, Motherwell, was cleared of kicking a male paramedic and resisting arrest by struggling violently with police.</p>
      <p>However, despite the assault charges against her, Sheriff David Bicket noted Borwick had been of good behaviour and admonished her.</p>
