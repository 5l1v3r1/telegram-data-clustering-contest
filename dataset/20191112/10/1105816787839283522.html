      <p>In September this year, she had shared a picture of herself with mother Amrita Singh. “Throwback to when I couldn’t be thrown.” This was the time when the actor weighed nearly 96 kilos. In an earlier interview with <i>BBC</i>, she mentioned she had been struggling from PCOD (polycystic ovary syndrome).</p>

      <p>Khan continued, “I went to Columbia for four years and at the end of the second year, I decided that I really want to act, like I said I have always known, but that realisation coincided with the weigh scale saying that I’m 96 kilos. So, it was a bit difficult. Then it was the senior year of college in America itself that I lost the weight.”</p>
      <p>“I was a regular kid. It made it very hard for me to lose weight and the hormone level was very high. So, as you can see, there is a level of delusion that was in me…I was confident, I was delusional,” she added.</p>

      <p>Talking of her dilemma, she said, “<i>Jahaan aapko pizza milta hain, wahin aapko protein milta hain. Jahaan pe chocolate milta hain, wahin aapko salad milta hain</i> (On one hand you could eat a pizza and on the other you could have protein, on one hand you could get chocolate and on the other you could eat salad). That was it. So, I lost all the weight that I had gained there and lots more by working out and maintaining a disciplined life.”</p>
