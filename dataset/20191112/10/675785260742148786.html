      <h1>BREAKING John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 teaser shows glimpse of Excitable Edgar</h1>
      <h2>Excitable Edgar seems to be the main character of this year's top-secret John Lewis Christmas advert</h2>

      <p>The John Lewis Christmas advert 2019 is just days away from dropping, after weeks of speculation about what it will contain this year.</p>
      <p>And it seems the retail giant has gone back to its creative roots for what appears to be an animated advert featuring a character called Excitable Edgar.</p>
      <p>With the ad launching on Thursday November 14, we've got less than two days to wait and see the whole thing.</p>
      <p>But, as with every year, a snippet of the main commercial has been teased on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>

      <p>The 10-second clip shows a child's hand knocking at a big wooden door.</p>
      <p>The hand reaches up and taps the dragon head-shaped iron knocker, as snow falls off its head.</p>
      <p>The door then slowly swings open a crack, showing a glimpse of a warm and inviting room inside.</p>
      <p>Text at the end of the clip then flashes up, bearing the words: "Meet Edgar 14.11.19."</p>
      <p>The hashtag #ExcitableEdgar has been used to hype up excitement around the ad, which may well have cost in the region of £8million, as with other John Lewis offerings.</p>
