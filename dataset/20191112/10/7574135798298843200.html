      <p><b>Remember Sports</b> are celebrating the fifth anniversary of their 2014 debut album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/indie-pop-prom-1/"><i>Sunchokes</i></a> (released back when they were just known as Sports) with an expanded, remastered reissue, and the first-ever vinyl/CD release of the album, which was originally just released on the band’s Bandcamp. The reissue includes eight bonus tracks, including demos and Addie Pray (vocalist/guitarist Carmen Perry’s solo project) versions of the songs. “This whole process has been sort of like a trip down memory lane, going through old photos and old emails,” Carmen says. “It is like a diary…it’s funny looking back on certain songs and remembering how I was feeling when I wrote them. Having them on a record, it’s a nice way to reconnect with your past self.”</p>
      <p>The reissue comes out this Friday (11/15) via Father/Daughter (<a href="http://fatherdaughter.co/sunchokesdeluxe">pre-order</a>), and ahead of the release, we’re premiering the new video for the remastered album opener “Tiny Planets.” The video was directed by Katie P. Bennett of Free Cake For Every Creature, and it’s a VHS home movies-style video that captures memories of the band’s rehearsals and everyday life. Check it out below.</p>
      <p>Remember Sports are also performing the album in full on a short Northeast/Midwest tour with <b>Lisa Prank</b> this month. That tour includes a Brooklyn show on <b>Friday (11/15) at Rough Trade NYC</b> (<a href="https://www.axs.com/events/383192/remember-sports-performs-sunchokes-tickets?q=remember+sports">tickets</a>).
