      <h1>Thailand to ban single-use plastics in 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:49:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>In a bid to rid the country of four types of disposable plastics within two years, Thailand’s cabinet has endorsed a plan to make single-use plastics illegal just over 13 months from now.</p>
      <p>Following the cabinet meeting today, Minister Warawut Silpa-archa of the environment ministry said the government had approved his proposed ban to come into effect on New Year’s Day of 2021.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Specific penalties for violating the planned ban were not specified. Warawut’s announcement comes in the wake of movement away from Thailand’s dependency on the convenience of river-choking and wildlife killing disposable plastic. </p>
      <p>In recent weeks, dozens of shopping malls and department stores signed onto an agreement to <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/dozens-of-thai-malls-pledge-to-drop-plastic-bags-for-2020/">stop providing plastic bags</a> in January. </p>
      <p>“The participating stores are all Thailand’s biggest names including 7-Eleven, Central, HomePro, Big C and more,” Warawut told <i>Coconuts Bangkok</i> last month. </p>
