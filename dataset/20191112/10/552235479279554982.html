      <h1>Airdrieonians have responded to Elgin defeat 'hysteria' says boss Ian Murray</h1>
      <h2>The win over Falkirk now means that the Diamonds can go top of League One this weekend after some early season slip-ups.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:43:02+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/calum-gallagher-makes-airdrie-home-20750217">Airdrieonians</a> boss Ian Murray feels his players have responded to the “hysteria” caused by Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin after stunning Falkirk.</p>
      <p>The shock exit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/calum-gallagher-makes-airdrie-home-20750217">from the competition left many concerned with the home form</a> , however the win over Falkirk has saw the side close the gap at the top of League One.</p>
      <p>Paul McKay’s opener was cancelled out by Declan McManus, before Calum Gallagher scored a late winner for the Diamonds in injury-time.</p>
      <p>Murray says the players have now proven what they are capable of in League One.</p>
      <p>The gaffer told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/monklands-derby-scottish-cup-clash-20750480">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser:</a> “There is no better way to win a game sometimes than a last minute winner, as strange as it sounds.</p>
      <p>“It don’t think David [Hutton] didn’t have too many serious saves to make and we took our chances.</p>
      <p>“The key for us now is to isolate ourselves from the rest of the division, and make sure a mini-league forms at the top of League One that we are involved in.</p>
      <p>“That might not happen until we are 20 games into the season but we need to make sure we are part of it.”</p>

      <p>He went on: “In the last couple of games results haven’t been that bad. The Elgin defeat at home caused a bit of hysteria , and that coupled with the Montrose defeat made it feel like things were going against us.</p>
      <p>“Suddenly things look different. I think things were blown out of proportion a bit. We haven’t lost two league games in a row yet this season.</p>
      <p>“It didn’t feel like that in the dressing room and the players deserve credit. The fans have really got behind the club now and that will really help us going forward.”</p>
      <p>With East Fife and Raith Rovers missing league action this weekend, the Diamonds have the chance to move into top spot.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Murray says that is the message he will be sending to the players ahead of the clash with Stranraer.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s a simple one for us this weekend – if we win we go top of the league. It’s a difficult place to go and we will need to stick together and play as a team.</p>
      <p>"They have a few former Airdrie players which always adds a bit of bite, but our players should be really motivated with the chance to move top.”</p>
