      <p>Bafana Bafana’s Lebo Mothiba made all of Strasbourg’s supporters very happy with his brace at the weekend, but one young fan got something extra from the striker…</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mothiba was back amongst the goals on Sunday as Strasbourg beat Nimes 4-1 to climb up the Ligue 1 table in France, with the Bafana man scoring two of the goals after being given a starting berth by Thiery Laurey.</p>
      <p>Having battled for fitness this season following his exploits at the Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, Sunday’s game was only his third full 90 minutes of the season for the French outfit, but his form has been improving and he picked up his first assist of the campaign in the recent win over OGC Nice.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old is already a fan favourite in Strasbourg following an impressive debut season at the club last time out, and he won’t have done his reputation any harm at all after he spotted a supporter in the crowd with a sign that had his name on it and proceeded to hand him his match shirt. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Mothiba will now be meeting up with his Bafana teammates as they fly to Ghana for Thursday nights 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against the Black Stars, with the former Lille man eager to add to his international tally to follow up his latest goals in Europe.</p>
