      <h1>Gordon to LTO: Implement motorcycle crime law now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T10:12:19+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/marlon-purificacion" target="_blank">Marlon Purificacion</a></address>
      <h3>SENATOR Richard Gordon has urged the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to finish drafting the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of R.A. 11235 of the Motorcycle Crime Prevention Act of 2019  to stop riding-in-tandem crimes.</h3>
      <p>Gordon stressed that the law’s objective  is “to protect the public, and to secure and safeguard the citizenry from crimes committed with the use of motorcycles through imposing bigger, readable and color-coded number plates to make it easier for eyewitnesses to identify the number plates of motorcycles used in crimes that they witness.”</p>
      <p>“The readable number plates must be displayed in both the front and back sides of a motorcycle and shall be made of suitable and durable material as determined by the LTO,” said Gordon, adding the law will make everyone safe.</p>
      <p>“One of the salient features of the law is that motorcycles travelling without number plates will be flagged down and fined. Kapag ninakaw ang plate number dapat i-report within three days, ‘pag di nireport ng may-ari, makakasuhan siya,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>Gordon expressed concern over the high rate of murder cases  involving the use of motorbikes. According to the data of the Philippine National Police (PNP), 13,062 of the 28,409 motorcycle riding incidents reported from 2010 to 2017 involved killings.</p>
      <p>One of the controversial reported assassinations related to riding-in-tandem incidents was the ambush of activist-lawyer Benjie Ramos  last year in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental after helping the families of nine farmers who were shot dead by unknown attackers in the province.</p>
      <p>Several shooting incidents were also reported recently.</p>
      <p>Ellen Dacanay, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) field officer, was shot dead in Manila on November 4.</p>
      <p>Last Novermber 5, Ilocos Sur Judge Mario Anacleto Bañez was killed in ambush in San Fernando, La Union while Police Lieutenant Ernesto Mendoza was shot dead by RIT men  in Barangay Teachers Village, Quezon City. Last  November 7,  radio broadcaster Dindo Generoso from Dumaguete City was killed gunmen on a motorcyle who were arrested just hours ago after the incident.</p>
      <p>“The police should really act with dispatch to solve these killings; these motorcycle-riding in tandem cowards are killing with impunity. They fearlessly execute people even in broad daylight and in plain view of witnesses because they can get away easily,” Gordon stressed.</p>
