      <h1>Khune Lisa – Itu Showcases Amazing Artwork Of Himself</h1>

      <p>Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune recently took to his social media pages to show his fans an amazing piece of artwork of himself. Did you see it?</p>
      <p>The Amakhosi shot-stopper is yet to make any sort of impact between the sticks this season, with the likes of Daniel Akpeyi and Bruce Bvuma stepping up in his absence as he works his way back to full fitness.</p>
      <p>In the most recent Soweto Derby, Khune was reduced to watching the 3-2 thriller from afar, but fans are definitely looking forward to seeing the distribution master back in action.  </p>

      <p>Nonetheless, "Itu", who has slightly more time on his hands as he continues his recovery, was sent an amazing piece of artwork recently, and he showed off the painting on his social media channels.</p>
      <p>Having tagged Danone's DanUp, the yoghurt drink he is a brand ambassador for, in his posts on both Instagram and Twitter, Khune could well have received the artwork from the dairy manufacturers.</p>
