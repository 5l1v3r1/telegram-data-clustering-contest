      <p>TORONTO -- A toddler who was struck by an air conditioning unit that fell from a building in Scarborough has died in hospital, police confirm.</p>
      <p>Officers <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/child-critically-injured-after-air-conditioning-unit-falls-from-scarborough-apartment-1.4680451">were called on Monday to an apartment complex</a> on Lawrence Avenue East, near Mossbank Drive, shortly before 4 p.m. to assist a young girl who had been injured.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/TPSOperations/status/1193995711773335554">Police say a woman</a> was entering the complex with her three children when an AC unit came out of the window of an eighth-floor apartment.</p>
