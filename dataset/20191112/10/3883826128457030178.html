        <b>London-based artist Laura Melissa Williams woke up one morning last week to find thousands of messages for her on social media - all from Malaysia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Overnight, the thirty-something Briton, who paraglides as a hobby, had accidentally caught the attention of the nation's teenagers.</p>
      <p>They are in the process of taking SPM exams, roughly the equivalent of GCSEs.</p>
      <p>And one of the English comprehension questions was about a fictional paraglider called Melissa.</p>

      <p>The question described the fictional Melissa hitting a storm-cloud - like "being tossed around in a washing machine" - and having to be rescued from the roof of a farm by villagers.</p>
      <p>Following the exam, a student looked up the question on the internet, found Ms Williams (whose middle name is Melissa), realised from her social media she was a paraglider - and the hashtag "The real Melissa" was born.</p>
      <p>"It's a bizarre set of coincidences that created the perfect storm and then went viral," Ms Williams told BBC News.</p>
      <p>It began with a whirlwind of humorous memes about washing machines and farms.</p>
      <p>"At first, I thought it was funny," she said.</p>
      <p>Some thought Ms Williams was somehow working with the Malaysian government.</p>
      <p>But as the day wore on, some of the comments became more personal and nastier - along with sarcastic posts about whether "Melissa" should have been paragliding in the first place.</p>
      <p>"I checked with some Malay-speaking friends as I started worrying, I got a bit concerned about any threats - they just said it was mainly immature," she said.</p>
      <p>And then overnight in UK time, Ms Williams found herself the subject of another hashtag: "Stop cyber-bullying Melissa".</p>
      <p>Word had reached Arwind Kumar, a social-media influencer with nearly 200,000 subscribers on YouTube.</p>
      <p>And he had posted a video about Ms Williams in which he said: "There is a fine line between making a joke and being extremely rude."</p>

      <p>And from then on, Ms Williams said, apologies had flooded in.</p>
      <p>"I awoke to thousands of messages of apology, from students across Malaysia - some of whom posted nasty comments originally and now regret it and some who apologised on behalf of their cohort," she said.</p>
      <p>She has since received invitations to go to dinner in Malaysia, offers of gifts, and apologies from school teachers, influencers and the media. A female Malaysian paraglider got in touch to ask if they could take a flight together.</p>
      <p>"For me that's the most amazing thing about this - that the tide turned," said Ms Williams, who doesn't currently have plans to visit the country.</p>
      <p>"You hear stuff in the media about celebrities being bullied and that's the immediate thing that comes to your head, that it's a bunch of 17-year-olds who got carried away, but that's the problem - it's group behaviour, people don't stop and think."</p>
      <p>In total, she has now received 210,000 Instagram messages, 30,000 tweets, countless direct messages and she has also acquired 5,000 new followers.</p>
      <p>"I now have an army of people as my protectors and standing up for what is right and moral," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Williams is now considering creating an art exhibition based on her experience.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, it's not the first time this has happened - the SPM exam in 2018 featured a question about a fictional surfer named Sarah, which propelled Malaysian surfer Sarah Faudzi to Instagram stardom.</p>
      <p>In September, Malaysia's queen, the Raja Permaisuri Agong, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49700077">returned to Twitter in order to express disappointment the police were arresting people who had insulted her on social media.</a></p>
      <p>"I am truly upset that the police have detained those people. Through the years, my husband and I have never made any police report on bad things said about us," she wrote, according to the Straits Times newspaper.</p>
      <p>The tweet has now been deleted.</p>
