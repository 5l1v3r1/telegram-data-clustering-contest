      <p>The man who allegedly stabbed another man to death over a Popeyes chicken sandwich at the Oxon Hill Popeyes in Maryland has been identified.</p>
      <p>Police say that Ricoh McClain, 30, is the man they believe <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/person-stabbed-to-death-in-prince-georges-county-popeyes">stabbed Kevin Tyrell Davis</a>, 28, earlier this month. "We believe he’s still in the area. We’ve identified him within the last week," Prince George's County police Maj. Brian Reilly <a href="https://wtop.com/prince-georges-county/2019/11/suspect-identified-in-deadly-stabbing-outside-popeyes-in-oxon-hill/">said</a> Tuesday at a press conference. "We know Mr. McClain has former addresses in Washington, D.C., and here, in Prince George’s County, Maryland."</p>
      <p>The stabbing came the day after the popular Popeyes chicken sandwich was released. Authorities said Davis tried to cut the line to get the newly released chicken sandwich before he and McClain got in an argument.</p>
      <p>The pair took their altercation to the parking lot, wherepolice say McClain stabbed Davis and fled the scene. Davis succumbed to his wounds at a local hospital.</p>
      <p>Police identified McClain from security images and help from the community, but he is still at large and considered armed and dangerous. Authorities interviewed a woman who had come to Popeyes with McClain but said they do not expect to charge her.</p>
      <p>McClain is facing a first-degree murder charge if caught. If you have any information about the stabbing or the suspect, call 301-772-4925 or Crime Solvers at 1-866-411-TIPS (8477).</p>
