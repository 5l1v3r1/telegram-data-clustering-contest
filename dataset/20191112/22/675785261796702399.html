      <h1>Paul Gascoigne offered place on Italian version of Strictly Come Dancing</h1>
      <h2>The former England star played in the country for three years with Lazio and was a hugely popular figure during his time in Rome</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:56:30+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Legendary former footballer Paul Gascoigne could be set to put on his dancing shoes as he has reportedly been offered the chance to appear on Italy's version of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> .</p>
      <p>Gazza was recently found not guilty of sexual assault following an allegation that he had abused a woman on a train in August 2018.</p>
      <p>As a result of the verdict the 52-year-old is now free to pursue other ventures, and according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10333225/paul-gascoigne-offered-italian-strictly-come-dancing-sex-assault-hell/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573594155">Sun</a> producers on the Italian show have held talks with his representatives about the possibility of him making an appearance.</p>
      <p>Gascoigne is something of a cult hero figure in Italy following the three years he spent at Rome-based club Lazio between 1992-1995, where he gained a reputation as a larger-than-life character as well as an exceptional footballer.</p>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> star is said to be open to the idea of a move abroad following his traumatic time in court, and could relish the chance to start again.</p>
      <p>A source said: "It's early days but Gazza appreciates the offers. The Strictly show in Italy is attractive because he'd be back in the public domain each week, albeit on Italian TV.</p>
      <p>"There'll be media interest in the UK of course, but the spotlight won't be quite so bright. Watch this space, it's very likely."</p>
      <p>Gascoigne has struggled with mental illness and alcoholism since retiring from football in 2004, and turned down a role on <i>I'm a Celebrity</i> in the past due to his problems.</p>

      <p>"They asked me a while back but it wasn't right and I said no," he said.</p>
      <p>"When sober, I'm up for anything, but when drinking I don't want to do anything."</p>
      <p>Gascoigne won 57 caps during his England career and is widely regarded as one of the most talented players of his generation.</p>
