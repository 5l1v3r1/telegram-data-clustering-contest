      <h1>Nick Diaz on possible comeback: ‘It’s on you Dana. It’s on you UFC’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>It’s been almost five years since Nick Diaz last fought in the UFC, but the former Strikeforce welterweight champion is still as popular as ever.</p>
      <p>Nick, older brother of ‘BMF’ runner-up Nate Diaz, returned to the media spotlight earlier this week to give an interview with ESPN, and the 36-year-old hinted at a comeback.</p>
      <p>According to Diaz, though, the ball is in Dana White’s court.</p>
      <p>”I explained to you exactly what’s going on, so it’s on you folks,” he said, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/11/20960136/where-nick-diaz-stands-on-comeback-its-on-you-dana-its-on-you-ufc">per MMA Fighting’s Steven Marrocco</a>. “It’s on you Dana. It’s on you UFC. It’s on them. It’s in your hands now – Cowboy Stadium.”</p>
      <p>The Californian seems most interested in a BMF title bout with Jorge Masvidal, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/11/20960257/nick-diaz-bmf-jorge-masvidal-nate-ufc-244-mma-news-ariel-helwani-dana-white-video">claiming ‘Gamebred’ isn’t worthy of the title ‘baddest mother-fcker’ in the UFC</a>. Masvidal battered Nate Diaz earlier this month at UFC 244, and Nick isn’t too happy with some of the things Jorge said to his younger brother in the buildup.</p>
      <p>”You want to talk about baptizing my younger brother? That’s on you,” Nick said. “I never had nothing disrespectful to say. But you don’t talk about baptizing my younger brother. You’re already in a f*king position if you fight with me. You don’t talk like that to nobody.”</p>
      <p>“My brother just got kicked in his face,” he added. “He’s having a really hard week, and I can fight.”</p>
      <p>Diaz, who made his MMA debut over 18 years ago under the IFC Warriors banner, last fought in 2015 at UFC 183, where he dropped a unanimous decision to pound-for-pound great Anderson Silva. The bout was later overturned to a No Contest (NC) after Silva tested positive for steroids and Diaz for marijuana metabolites.</p>
