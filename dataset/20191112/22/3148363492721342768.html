      <p>Kaepernick, who began protesting in the preseason of the 2016 season by first sitting and then kneeling during the national anthem, has not played in the NFL since he walked out of his deal with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season.</p>
      <p>The protests he began, however, not only continued but grew in his absence. During the 2017 season, nearly all NFL teams – coaches and executives included – participated in some form of protest during the national anthem.</p>
      <p>The protest movement tapered off during the 2018 season, after the NFL agreed to fund social justice initiatives through the then-recently formed Players Coalition.</p>
      <p>In October of 2017, Kaepernick and fellow protester Eric Reid, filed a collusion grievance against the NFL. In February of 2019, the NFL <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/02/15/kaepernick-nfl-reach-confidential-collusion-settlement/">settled</a> the grievance with Kaepernick and Reid. However, despite that resolution, only Reid has re-joined the league. Kaepernick would be eligible to play immediately if a team were interested.</p>
