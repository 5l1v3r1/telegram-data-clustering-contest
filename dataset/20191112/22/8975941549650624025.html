      <h2>New American Heart Association research suggests e-cigs reduce blood flow to the heart </h2>

      <p>E-cigarettes <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/juul-claimed-its-e-cigs-are-totally-safe-but-the-case-against-vaping-keeps-building-2019-09-09">have been marketed as “safer” than traditional cigarettes</a> in the past, as well as a means to quit smoking. But a growing body of research suggests that vaping isn’t only as dangerous as smoking regular cigarettes — it may be even worse.</p>
      <p>The American Heart Association is presenting two new studies at its annual Scientific Sessions meeting with researchers and clinicians in Philadelphia this weekend. The key findings: Vaping has a negative impact on heart-disease factors such as cholesterol levels. But most surprising, according to one researcher, is that vaping e-cigs appears to decrease blood flow to the heart even worse than smoking traditional cigs.</p>
      <p>“There is no long-term safety data on e-cigarettes. However, there are decades of data for the safety of other nicotine replacement therapies,” noted Dr. Rose Marie Robertson, the AHA’s deputy chief science and medical officer, in <a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/e-cigarettes-take-serious-toll-on-heart-health-not-safer-than-traditional-cigarettes?preview=9180">the report released Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>So researchers conducted two studies to see how e-cigs impact heart health.</p>

      <p>One analyzed almost 500 healthy adults ages 21 to 45 who had no existing cardiovascular disease. Of this group, 94 people were nonsmokers; 45 were e-cig smokers; 52 were both e-cig and traditional cigarette (t-cig) smokers; and 285 were t-cig smokers. The results: Healthy HDL cholesterol was lower in dual smokers who used both types of products. And unhealthy LDL cholesterol was higher in the sole e-cig users.</p>
      <p>The second, much smaller study of 19 young adult smokers ages 24 to 32 analyzed heart blood flow (which is a measure of the heart’s ability to pump blood throughout the body) immediately before and after smoking either e-cigarettes or traditional cigarettes. The researchers measured blood flow while the subjects were at rest, as well as after they did a handgrip exercise to simulate physical stress.</p>
      <p>Blood flow normally increases during exercise, but traditional cigarette smoking is known to reduce blood flow during such physical stress. And while blood flow increased modestly after inhaling a traditional cigarette in this study, and then decreased with the subsequent exercise stress, as expected, the smokers who inhaled e-cigs saw their blood flow decrease both while at rest and after the handgrip exercise.</p>
      <p>“We were surprised by our observation of the heart’s blood flow being reduced at rest, even in the absence of stress, following inhalation from the e-cigarette,” wrote study co-author Dr. Susan Cheng, AHA director of Public Health Research. “Providers counseling patients on the use of nicotine products will want to consider the possibility that e-cigs may confer as much and potentially even more harm to users and especially patients at risk for vascular disease.”</p>

      <p>This supports a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-08/uops-nec081619.php">University of Pennsylvania study published in August</a> that found vaping reduced blood flow for up to an hour after the e-cigarette was inhaled. And in that study, the e-cigs didn’t contain nicotine; just flavorings and sweeteners. That report warned that, “a single e-cigarette can be harmful to the body’s blood vessels — even when the vapor is entirely nicotine-free.”</p>
      <p>These findings come as the number of confirmed cases of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cdc-identifies-strong-culprit-in-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-2019-11-08">vaping-related illness</a> over the past several months has hit 2,051, with patients suffering troubled breathing, cough, extreme fatigue, fever, vomiting and diarrhea. At least 39 patients with EVALI — aka “e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury” — have died.</p>
      <p>The FDA has accused popular e-cig maker Juul Labs of illegally marketing its products with misleading claims that they were safer than cigarettes, even as a Pittsburgh study flagged how Juul users used addiction-related terms in their tweets, such as complaining about withdrawal symptoms. In fact, a 2018 Stanford study reported that Juul products delivered more nicotine than competing brands of e-cigs, and produced a “throat hit” that was more comparable to conventional cigarettes. </p>

      <p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-announces-vaping-industry-meeting-ahead-of-veterans-parade-2019-11-11">is also meeting with vaping industry reps this week</a> to discuss tightening e-cigarette regulations in light of the nationwide EVALI outbreak.</p>

      <p>Yet many young people still believe that vaping is safe. A recent <a href="https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/national-survey-reveals-one-five-young-adults-regularly-uses-e">American Society of Clinical Oncology survey</a> found that 20% of Gen Z (ages 18-22) and 24% of millennials (ages 23-38) believe e-cigarettes are “harmless,” while 22% of Gen Z and 24% of millennials think you cannot get addicted to e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes have been especially popular among younger users; the number of high school students using them spiked from 1.5% in 2011 to 20.8% in 2018.</p>
      <p>A growing number of Americans are recognizing the health concerns, however. In fact, 63% of adults in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-vaping-poll/more-americans-say-vaping-is-as-dangerous-as-smoking-cigarettes-reuters-poll-idUSKBN1W9136">a national Reuters poll</a> disagreed with the statement “vaping is healthier than traditional cigarettes,” which is up 16 percentage points from a similar 2016 poll.</p>
