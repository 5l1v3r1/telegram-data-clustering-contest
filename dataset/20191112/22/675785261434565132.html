      <h1>General Election 2019: Lib Dems pledge £500million for youth services to tackle knife crime epidemic</h1>
      <h2>Jo Swinson has also pledged to give youth services protection in law to stop them being subject cuts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>A Lib Dem government would invest £500 million to curb the rise of knife violence epidemic on our streets, Jo Swinson has said.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said her party would invest the cash in youth services as part of a public health approach to cracking down on the knife crime.</p>
      <p>The cash would be used to "provide young people with positive, safe and healthy opportunities to prevent them being drawn into youth violence and gang-related crime".</p>
      <p>Praising the Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, the Lib Dems said they would put protection for local youth services in law to protect them from future cuts.</p>

      <p>The VRU works with teachers, social workers, and the NHS to help police reduce violence.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said: "We are in a knife crime epidemic, but successive governments have taken the wrong approach to dealing with it.</p>
      <p>"For 25 years, Conservative and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> governments have been competing to seem tough on crime, without doing enough to actually prevent crime.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> will build a brighter future for young people by investing £500 million a year in youth services and taking a public health approach to youth violence.</p>
      <p>"With a Liberal Democrat government, young people will have the support and opportunities they deserve, our communities will be stronger and people will feel safer."</p>
      <p>Spending on youth services has been cut by 70% since the Conservatives came to power in 2010, but the Liberal Democrats were in coalition until 2015.</p>
