      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is standing firm against National Grid and is threatening to revoke its certificate to operate.</p>
      <p>He announced Tuesday he is giving the company 14 days to explain what its alternative plan is with regard to a controversial pipeline.</p>
      <p>"I don't accept the premise that if there's no pipeline there's no gas, their job was to provide a plan for future supply, that's one of their essential responsibilities," Cuomo said.</p>
      <p>The utility company serves 1.8 million customers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. Cuomo is giving National Grid two weeks to restore gas to all of its customers or face losing its license.</p>
      <p>Cuomo says approximately 1,100 customers are without gas service. Some had either moved to a new home or had temporarily turned off their service. They're all victims of a moratorium by National Grid on all new gas hook-ups, leaving some customers without cooking gas or heat to their homes.</p>

      <p>The governor's notice is a significant escalation in the fight over building a natural pipeline, which some environmentalists oppose.</p>
      <p>The utility says it doesn't have enough gas supply to meet the demand. That's why it wants the pipeline.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for National Grid released the following statement:</p>
      <p>"National Grid is in receipt of the letter from Governor Cuomo and will review and respond accordingly within the timeframe outlined in the letter. We continue to work with all parties on these critical natural gas supply issues on behalf of all our customers in downstate New York."</p>
      <p>The governor says he has plenty of other companies ready to step in for National Grid.</p>
      <p>If you have an issue with your own service, you can lodge a complaint with the New York Public Service Commission.</p>
