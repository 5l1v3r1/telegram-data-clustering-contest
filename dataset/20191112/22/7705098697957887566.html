      <h1>Anthony Daniels Shares Mark Hamill’s Post-The Rise of Skywalker Message</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:57:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Next month, C-3PO will take “one last look” at his friends in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b></a>. Many fans heard this line in the film’s final trailer and assumed it was hinting at the character’s demise. We won’t know his fate until the movie arrives on December 20. But in any case, it doesn’t seem likely that Anthony Daniels’ beloved protocol droid and Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker will share any more scenes together.</p>
      <p>Currently, Daniels is making the rounds promoting his new memoir, <b>I Am C-3PO: The Inside Story</b>. The book reprints the heartfelt email that Hamill sent to Daniels after he completed his scenes for <b>The Rise of Skywalker</b>. You can read it for yourself (via <a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/mark-hamill-thank-you-anthony-daniels-rise-of-skywalker">SYFY Wire</a>) below.</p>

      <p>“Thanks for the more than kind words, Tony,” wrote Hamill. “I grew so fond of our fictional relationship; it was hard to be separated in this new trilogy. You &amp; R2 were my family &amp; they certainly didn’t dare to take Chewie away from Han. I was appalled that in the original script for <b>VIII</b>, I just walked by without even acknowledging you! I was grateful that Rian let us at least have that brief farewell moment, even if it was only a nod &amp; a wink. Perhaps it was fitting, as there are no words to convey the depth of Luke’s gratitude to his faithful sidekick, just as there are no words to express mine to you. Thank you for a lifetime of fond memories, friend.”</p>
      <p>Daniels wrapped filming for <b>The Rise of Skywalker</b> back in January. Since then, he’s teased that the upcoming installment marks the end of his time in the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> universe. Daniels <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/464377-anthony-daniels-hints-at-c-3pos-farewell-in-the-rise-of-skywalker">previously revealed</a> that “it was difficult not to tear up a bit” during his last scene. Most recently, he expressed an openness toward someone else taking over the role in future projects. But that might be difficult to get used to. After all, Daniels remains to only <b>Star Wars</b> actor to show up in every film in the Skywalker Saga. He’s also provided C-3PO’s voice in various animated series over the years.</p>
