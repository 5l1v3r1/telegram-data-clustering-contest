      <h1>Pakistanis restrict Australia A at 122 runs, lead by 313 runs on Day 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:13:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>PERTH (Dunya News) – Australia A side has been bowled out for 122 in a calamitous tour match performance against Pakistan in Perth, where Pakistanis are leading with a 313-runs lead at the end of day two.</p>
      <p>The forgotten man Cameron Bancroft has provided a timely reminder of his staying powers. However, Joe Burns was clean-bowled for a golden duck and fellow Test hopefuls Marcus Harris, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head and Will Pucovski also fell cheaply as the hosts crumbled on day two of the pink-ball clash at Perth Stadium.</p>

      <p>Imran Khan proved most fruitful for Pakistanis as he bagged five for just 32 runs against Australia XI, while Shaheen Afridi and Iftikhar Ahmed both claimed two wickets each, and Yasir Shah took one wicket.</p>
      <p>Pakistanis were seven for no wicket at stumps, leading by 313 runs in the three-day match.</p>
      <p>Australia A were reeling at 9-57 in reply to Pakistan’s 428 before Bancroft (49) and Riley Meredith (19no) restored some pride, batting longer for the 10th wicket than the first nine combined.</p>
      <p>The resistance came to an end when left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi found Bancroft’s edge shortly before stumps.</p>
      <p>Pakistanis had started the day two on 336 runs for the loss of three wickets as Babar Azam (157 off 197) and Asad Shafiq (119 off 245) were retired out. The pair had piled on a colossal 276-run partnership. Yasir Shah scored a fifty as well (53 off 70).</p>
      <p>Australia A were in trouble from the very beginning as the hosts lost their first wicket without scoring any run. Cameron Bancroft remained unbeaten on 23 at dinner along with Riley Meredith (3).</p>
      <p>Marcus Harris scored 16 runs off 22 balls while Travis Head registered 13 off 18. No other batsman could enter the double figures.</p>
      <p>Pakistan’s Imran Khan dismissed five batsmen while Iftikhar Ahmed picked up two wickets. Shaheen Afridi sent one batsman to the pavilion.</p>

      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that the first Test of the series between Pakistan and Australia will be hosted by Brisbane from November 21-25, while the second day-night Test will be played in Adelaide from November 29-December 3.</p>
