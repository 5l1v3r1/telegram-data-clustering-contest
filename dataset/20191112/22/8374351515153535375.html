      <p>The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has set in motion the crafting of the country’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector roadmap as it vowed to position the Philippines as an AI powerhouse in the ASEAN region.</p>
      <p>Trade Undersecretary Rafaelita M. Aldaba of the Competitiveness and Innovation Group led the formal signing of an agreement with distinguished data scientists, Dr. Christopher P. Monterola and Dr. Erika Fille T. Legara, for the formulation of an AI Roadmap.</p>
      <p>With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) where technology becomes more enmeshed with everyday life, AI advancement is seen as one of the key factors to help keep our country competitive. AI’s importance is underscored as it is emerging to be a potential bright spot for our country, with wide opportunities for growth for our competent workforce.</p>
      <p>“The formulation of the AI Roadmap is very important and timely. This effort provides the impetus that will move the country forward to keep up with the rapidly changing times,” said Aldaba. He also noted that the Philippines ranked third in the Southeast Asian region in the Government Artificial Intelligence Readiness Index 2019.</p>
      <p>For their part, Monterola and Legara from the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) Aboitiz School of Innovation, Technology, and Entrepreneurship (ASITE), presented the framework for the formulation of the roadmap, which shall primarily be data-driven and consultative in nature.</p>
      <p>An A.I. Task Force consisting of academicians, government officials, and industry stakeholders will be created to support this initiative. The roadmap will conduct an analysis of AI’s impact on the country’s industries and work force and recommend policies and programs that are necessary for success such as AI trainings and AI labs.</p>
      <p>The DTI affirms its commitment to look at the interests of the sectors concerned to capitalize on the opportunities as well as address the challenges faced by the country in the ongoing AI transformation, in the wake of 4IR that is projected to affect the country’s economic trajectory.</p>
