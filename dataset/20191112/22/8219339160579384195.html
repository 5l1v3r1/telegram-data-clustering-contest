      <h1>Bloomberg: 16-inch MacBook Pro coming as soon as tomorrow, starting at $2,400</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:29:04+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>A new report from <i><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-12/apple-to-update-macbook-pro-with-new-keyboard-after-complaints">Bloomberg</a></i> this evening says that Apple will debut the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as soon as tomorrow. This follows <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/16-inch-macbook-pro-hands-on-event/"><i>9to5Mac</i>‘s reporting from yesterday</a>, which indicated that Apple is currently holding private briefings with members of the press to showcase the new MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg</i>‘s report reiterates much of what we already know about the 16-inch MacBook Pro. The machine will reportedly include a brighter 16-inch display and a more reliable keyboard, with today’s report calling it the “first major update to the MacBook Pro line” since the Touch Bar revision three years ago.</p>
      <blockquote>This will be the first major update to the MacBook Pro line since it was redesigned three years ago. The new, brighter screen will come in a 16-inch version, up from the current 15-inch option, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced products. The display will likely appeal to video and photo editors, gamers and software developers.</blockquote>
      <p>In terms of price, the report says the 16-inch MacBook Pro will cost “about the same” as the 15-inch model, which starts at $2,399. The 16-inch MacBook Pro will “replace the current 15-inch model,” the report says.</p>
      <p>In addition to supply chain reports, recent macOS releases have provided glimpses at what to expect from the 16-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>macOS Catalina <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/18/16-inch-macbook-pro-forever-design/">contained a hardware icon showing</a> a MacBook Pro with slightly smaller bezels, which corroborates reports that the 16-inch MacBook Pro will be close to the same physical size as the 15–inch MacBook Pro.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, <i>9to5Mac</i> discovered an image in macOS Catalina that shows a revised Touch Bar and Touch Bar layout. As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/30/exclusive-16-inch-macbook-pro-touch-bar-and-touch-id-layout-confirmed/">you can see here</a>, the Touch ID button is separated from the rest of the Touch Bar. This also suggests that the 16-inch MacBook Pro will have a real escape key, rather than a software one.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg</i> also says the new Mac Pro will likely go on sale in December. Apple has promised a release during the fall, which runs until December 21.</p>
