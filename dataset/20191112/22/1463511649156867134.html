      <p>The All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has described the late former Petroleum Resources Minister, Prof. Tam David-West as a highly-principled and morally-upright Nigerian who always spoke truth to power.</p>
      <p>Tinubu, who made the remarks in a statement issued in Lagos on Tuesday, said that the late professor of virology was a nationalist and exemplary social critic.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that David-West died on Monday, at the age of 83.</p>
      <p>“Tam David-West was a nationalist and social critic who always spoke truth to power.</p>
      <p>“I will personally miss the former minister; he was one leader I admired and regularly exchanged ideas with,” he said.</p>
      <p>Tinubu described the former minister as a leader of substance, whose voice regularly cautioned the leadership against unconstitutionality, adding that his intellectual pedigree would be sorely missed.</p>
      <p>“Somebody who served as minister under Muhammadu Buhari as military leader and won his respect and admiration must be a man of integrity and honesty.</p>
      <p>“I mourn with his family, both immediate and extended. I mourn with the people of Buguma, Kalabari Kingdom, the government and people of Rivers State and Nigeria, which he served selflessly.</p>
      <p>“My prayer is that God Almighty grants him eternal rest. I also hope and pray that his good legacies will continue to endure,” he said.</p>
