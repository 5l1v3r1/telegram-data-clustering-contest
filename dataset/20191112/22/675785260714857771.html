      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:28:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:28</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Maguire, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kevinmaguire/</a></address>
      <p>Toxic twins Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin cast long, dark shadows over our British democracy.</p>
      <p>The US tinpot tyrant and his more despotic Russian friend won’t be on ballot papers but the poisonous puppeteers are pulling strings.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage jumped into bed after Trump urged a marriage of convenience, with the NHS and food industry his prize.</p>
      <p>The Tory Prime Minister suppresses an alarming report detailing how Russians buy influence, the wife of a Kremlin one-time crony paying £160,000 to play tennis with Johnson, while Farage openly admires Vlad the ­authoritarian nationalist.</p>

      <p>These days the right not left sucks up to Moscow and it’d be no surprise if Labour’s cyber-attack originated from Putin’s hackers.</p>
      <p>Brexit’s backed by Trump and Putin to weaken Britain and Europe, a pair of vultures waiting to pick the bones from economic and diplomatic chaos. Johnson and Farage are contemptible plastic patriots when under the cloak of the Union Jack they enfeeble our country.</p>

      <p>Modern Britain in its glorious vibrancy is a strange land to privileged middle-aged men privately educated beyond their intelligence.</p>
      <p>Wreckers, not builders, these scaremongering, narrow-minded right-whingers are ­playthings of Trump and Putin.</p>
      <p>Honesty in politics would see Don leading the Tory Brexit Party, Vlad the Brexit Tory Party.</p>
