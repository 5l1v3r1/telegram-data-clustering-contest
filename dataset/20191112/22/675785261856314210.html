      <h1>Jack Leach reflects on whirlwind summer after "draining" Ashes Tests</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Leach was one of the stars during England's extraordinary one-wicket victory over Australia at Headingley which is regarded as one of the greatest Tests ever</h2>

      <p>Jack Leach might have become a cult hero – but his whirlwind summer came at a cost.</p>
      <p>The bespectacled England star started 2019 having played four away Tests, ­battling to be his country’s main spinner and largely anonymous to the public.</p>
      <p>The left-armer flew to New Zealand last week having written his page in ­folklore with his iconic one not out – with all the wiping of glasses and near run outs – as part of Ben Stokes’ ­outrageous match-winning stand at Headingley.</p>
      <p>But the demanding series with ­Australia and the attention that came with it drained the Somerset bowler.</p>

      <p>“I felt tired at the end of the summer,” said Leach, 28, who has not bowled in anger since the end of September. ­­“Mentally especially, a series of that ­magnitude is draining and the hype around it. It takes a lot out of you.</p>
      <p>“Having that time off and getting away from cricket and doing a bit of thinking of how you want to take your game ­forward, and where your game is at, was a really good exercise for me.</p>
      <p>“Then the last couple of weeks I feel I have taken my game on again, mainly by going back to my basics, improving my game with bat and ball and ­remembering what is important to me when I am at my best.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I have nailed them down a little bit more. It is nice to have a couple of weeks out of competition to work on your game and not worry about the game around the corner.”</p>

      <p>When Leach went to New ­Zealand 18 months ago he was a nervous wreck awaiting his international debut.</p>
      <p>He was a late call-up ­following ­injury to Mason Crane and played in the second Test at Christ­church – taking two wickets as the Kiwis clawed their way to a draw to save the series.</p>
      <p>Now it is Matt Parkinson’s turn to have butterflies in his stomach, the Lancashire leg-spinner hoping to be given his Test cap next week. Leach passed on some advice to the 23-year-old. He said: “I’d been working towards that for a while and when it’s actually ­happening it’s a scary thing but one that you massively want to experience.</p>

      <p>“It is important for Matt coming into the set-up that he stays true to himself and does exactly what he’s done for his county. That is what has got him to ­international level.</p>
      <p>“He’s a very exciting player, has a great record in the early part of his career. He’s going to be a wicket-taker and he gives the ball a big rip.”</p>
      <p>Chris Silverwood might be no ­stranger to the England set-up but his promotion from bowling coach to head coach begins a new era for England. “‘Spoons’ is a really good man-manager which will suit the head coach role really well,” said Leach.</p>
