      <p>Consumers complained about glitches in Walt Disney Co's streaming service on Twitter, just hours after its highly anticipated launch.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Consumers complained about glitches in Walt Disney Co's streaming service on Twitter, just hours after its highly anticipated launch.</p>
      <p>While trying to access the service, users were greeted by an image of "Mickey Mouse" on a blue screen, with a message asking them to exit the app and try again.</p>

      <p>Disney did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. It was not immediately known how many users were affected by the outage.</p>
      <p>"Not too surprised but @disneyplus looks like it's already falling over. On FireTV Stick can't load main page (Unable to connect to Disney+) and couldn't play The Mandalorian (some account issue)," user @pmhesse tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully it's worked out by tomorrow's treadmill time."</p>
      <p>"The Mandalorian," next adventure in the "Star Wars" movie and TV franchise, is an eight-episode live-action series which stars "Game of Thrones" actor Pedro Pascal as a helmeted bounty hunter.</p>
      <p>Users who were able to access the service, however, gave rave reviews.</p>
      <p>"Today is the perfect day to just stay home all day on my couch in my PJ's binging all of my favorite Disney movies on #DisneyPlus," tweeted @JulieDwoskin.</p>
      <p>Disney's streaming service will offer a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies and feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe, the "Star Wars" galaxy, "Toy Story" creator Pixar Animation and the National Geographic.</p>
      <p>The service is a direct challenge to market leader Netflix Inc as well as Apple Inc's newly launched Apple TV+.</p>
      <p>Shares of Disney were up nearly 1 percent before the bell.</p>
