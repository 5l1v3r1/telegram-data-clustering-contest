      <p>(CNN) - Kanye West is reportedly bringing a bit of his Sunday Service to Joel Osteen's megachurch.</p>
      <p>The rapper will visit the pastor's Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas, on Sunday, a representative for the church <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Kanye-West-at-Joel-Osteen-s-Lakewood-Church-Housto-14828487.php">told the Houston Chronicle </a>Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Osteen will conduct a 15- to 20-minute conversation with West at the 11 a.m. service and West will return for the 7 p.m. service to perform with his choir, according to the representative, Donald Iloff, Jr.</p>
      <p>"Joel is still putting his questions together, but he will talk about Kanye's journey to his faith," Iloff told the Chronicle.</p>
      <p>West has been promoting his new album, "Jesus Is King," and performing with his choir in various cities.</p>
      <p>His wife, Kim Kardashian West<a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/celebrity-style/a27025445/kim-kardashian-interview-caroline-lemke-sunglasses/"> explained to Elle magazine in an interview in April </a>what her husband's services are all about.</p>
      <p>"It's honestly more like a healing experience for my husband," Kardashian West said. "It's just music; there's no sermon. It's definitely something he believes in -- Jesus -- and there's a Christian vibe. But there's no preaching. It's just a very spiritual Christian experience."</p>
      <p>She said it's open to all faiths.</p>
      <p>"Everyone that comes understands it's just a really healing experience with an amazing choir and amazing messages about love to start off your week," the reality TV star said.</p>
      <p>West was in Houston recently to perform at Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival. Scott has a daughter with West's sister-in-law, Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>Iloff said the idea to have West visit Osteen's church came together while the rapper was in town for the festival.</p>
      <p>"Kanye and Joel are friends," Iloff said. "He's been wanting to come out for some time and it just worked out for this weekend."</p>
      <p>West recently appeared at The Forum arena in Inglewood, California, and at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>CNN has reached out to reps for Osteen and West for additional comment.</p>
