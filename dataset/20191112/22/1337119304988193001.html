      <h1>Snowman-shaped target of NASA’s New Horizons mission gets a brand-new name</h1>
      <h2>The object is now officially known as Arrokoth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:33:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/mary-beth-griggs" target="_blank">Mary Beth Griggs</a></address>
      <p>A snowman-shaped object that NASA probe New Horizons flew by in early 2019 now has a brand-new name. On November 12th, NASA officials announced that the item formerly known as MU69 — and once nicknamed Ultima Thule — would now have the name Arrokoth, which is the word for “sky” in the Powhatan / Algonquian language.</p>
      <p>Arrokoth remains the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft — located approximately 4 billion miles away from Earth in a distant region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt. The name was chosen because the team of scientists who operate New Horizons is based in Maryland — land where the Powhatan people lived historically, and where many still live today. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth">NASA says that they consulted</a> with Powhatan tribal elders and representatives before deciding on the name.</p>

      <p>“We graciously accept this gift from the Powhatan people,” Lori Glaze, director of NASA’s Planetary Science division said <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth">in NASA’s announcement of the name</a>. “Bestowing the name Arrokoth signifies the strength and endurance of the indigenous Algonquian people of the Chesapeake region.”</p>
      <p>The name Arrokoth replaces the former official designation of 2014 MU69 — which doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue. It also replaces the object’s nickname, Ultima Thule, a name that dated to ancient Rome and meant “beyond the limits of the known world.” <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/nasa-named-its-next-new-horizons-target-ultima-thule-mythical-land-nazi-844318">The term was appropriated by the predecessor of the Nazi Party</a>. That made NASA’s original choice of nickname <a href="https://www.space.com/42882-ultima-thule-new-horizons-name-controversy.html">highly controversial</a>.</p>
      <p>The object itself has fascinated researchers since its discovery in 2014. It wasn’t until 2017 that researchers got any clue <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/27/18156181/nasa-new-horizons-pluto-ultima-thule-kuiper-belt-flyby">what Arrokoth looked like</a>. Interest only increased after the New Horizons spacecraft zipped by it on New Year’s Day 2019. Images from that flyby revealed that the object was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/9/18217031/nasa-new-horizons-2014-mu69-flat-peanut-pancake-snowman">far flatter</a> than originally anticipated, and researchers are still analyzing data from the mission.</p>
      <p>“Data from the newly-named Arrokoth, has given us clues about the formation of planets and our cosmic origins,” Marc Buie, one of the people who discovered Arrokoth, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/far-far-away-in-the-sky-new-horizons-kuiper-belt-flyby-object-officially-named-arrokoth">said in a statement</a>. “We believe this ancient body, composed of two distinct lobes that merged into one entity, may harbor answers that contribute to our understanding of the origin of life on Earth.”</p>
