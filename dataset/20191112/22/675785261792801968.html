      <h2>The Strictly Professional decided to ditch the social media site following fierce backlash from trolls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T22:56:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> professional <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katya-jones">Katya Jones</a> has revealed the devastating reason behind her recent social media silence.</p>
      <p>The pro dancer, 30, has spoken out about the "hard days" she experienced during this year's series of BBC's hit dance competition.</p>
      <p>Katya and her celebrity partner <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mike-bushell">Mike Bushell</a> , 53, were axed from the show on Sunday night, after the BBC sports presenter lost the dance-off to Drag Race judge Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC breakfast today, the Russian dancer revealed she suffered at the hands of trolls online.</p>

      <p>She said: "You (Bushell) were absolutely brilliant about it and, no matter what, he came in every Monday smiling and just like ‘Right, I have got to put another fight on.'</p>
      <p>"He was absolutely brilliant. And, of course, there has been in the beginning quite a few… there were hard days, wasn’t it?"</p>
      <p>After admitting their early struggles, Katya revealed she was left with no choice but to remove herself from social media.</p>

      <p>She said: "Just people saying things. So I just deleted the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and that was brilliant after that.</p>
      <p>"When it's not in front of you it doesn't exist so I just got rid of it."</p>
      <p>Katya and Mike faced fierce backlash after they were continually saved by the judges despite falling to the bottom of the leaderboard for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>They even sparked fix claims, with people claiming they've only been kept in the contest because of Mike's ties to the broadcaster.</p>

      <p>The BBC presenter has previously admitted that he has been bombarded with abuse from trolls after being chosen by the judges to stay in the dancing competition and having survived three dance-offs in a row.</p>
      <p>Despite vicious backlash, Mike vowed to keep keep dancing and insisted he had plenty of work to do before embarking on the show’s live tour.</p>
      <p>Mike and Katya will be hitting the floor once more during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> Live Show 2020, alongside six of the current series' other couples.</p>

      <p>The star-studded line-up's been confirmed as Mike and Katya, Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard, Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, Alex Scott and Neil Jones, Catherine Tyldesley and Johannes Radebe and Emma Barton and Anton Du Beke.</p>
      <p>Stacey Dooley, last year's champ, will return to host the show.</p>
      <p>As the numbers thin on Strictly, it's anyone's guess who might lift the Glitterball Trophy.</p>
      <p>Current favourites are Kelvin, Karim and RuPaul star Michelle Visage - who was curiously passed over for a place on the tour next year.</p>
