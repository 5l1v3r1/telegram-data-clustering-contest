      <h1>Eddie Stobart shareholders face steep losses in potential rescue</h1>

      <p>Shareholders in logistics firm Eddie Stobart face a steep cut in the value of their investment as part of a proposed financing deal.</p>
      <p>A proposed offer from former controlling shareholder Dbay Advisors would be at a huge discount to the price at which its shares were suspended in August, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>Citing sources, the report said Dbay’s proposal would involve an underwritten share issue that would result in it owning a majority stake in the haulier.</p>

      <p>Eddie Stobart’s shares were suspended at 71p after an accounting scandal giving it a value of nearly £270m.</p>
      <p>The firm has still not published its half-year results.</p>
      <p>A bid from rival Wincanton is being hampered by the lack of clear financial information, the report said.</p>
      <p>Former Stobart Group boss Andrew Tinkler is working on an alternative financing proposal.</p>

      <p>Tinkler told City A.M.: “I’m ready to go, it’s really down to the advisers and the board and the banks taking this seriously as a refinancing option.”</p>
      <p>Eddie Stobart’s lenders have turned to Alvarez &amp; Marsal to advise on a potential restructuring, while Deloitte is working alongside bankers at Rothschild on the discussions with its lenders.</p>
      <p>Any proposal to refinance the company would not be able to proceed without the lenders’ backing.</p>
      <p>Dbay Advisors bought 51 per cent of Eddie Stobart from Stobart Group when Tinkler was running the combined business five years ago.</p>
      <p>Dbay floated Eddie Stobart in 2017 at 160p a share, valuing the company at £572.7m.</p>
      <p>Eddie Stobart and Dbay declined to comment.</p>
