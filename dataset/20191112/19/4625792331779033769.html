      <h1>'Dictators, it’s OK, come on in': Trump says he is willing to meet with anyone if it helps US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:39:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Emphasizing his “America First” foreign policy, President Trump said he is willing to meet with any foreign leader if it helps the country.</p>
      <p>Trump made the remarks during a Tuesday speech at the New York Economic Club and said that how leaders rule their own countries doesn’t have a bearing on meetings with him.</p>
      <p>“When I meet with the leaders of countries as they come in — kings, and queens and prime ministers, and presidents and dictators — I meet them all,” Trump said to laughter from the audience.</p>
      <p>“Anybody wants to come in,” he continued. “Dictators, it’s OK. Come on in. Whatever's good for the United States. We want to help our people.”</p>
      <p>The comments come a day before Trump is set to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-announces-that-erdogan-will-visit-white-house-next-week-after-uncertainty">meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a>, who has been criticized for his authoritarian tendencies. During his last visit to the White House, Erdoğan watched as his guards <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/video-turkish-president-watched-attack-on-dc-protesters">broke through a police line and beat activists</a>.</p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/one-year-after-attempted-coup-purges-have-left-hundreds-of-turkish-academics-imprisoned">a failed coup in 2016</a>, the Turkish leader jailed hundreds who opposed him, including professors, and arrested more than 100 journalists. He also used the opportunity to push through a referendum expanding his powers.</p>
      <p>In addition, Trump has faced criticism for his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/the-leader-of-the-free-world-should-not-praise-dictators-like-kim">praise of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un</a> and for his reaction to the murder of <i>Washington Post</i> columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of a Saudi kill team assembled by an adviser to the crown prince.</p>
