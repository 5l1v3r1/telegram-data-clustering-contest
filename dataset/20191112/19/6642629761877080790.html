      <p>Belarussian leader Alexander Lukashenko has defended his isolated country's human rights record during a visit to Austria on Tuesday, as he sought closer ties with the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> amid tensions with <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a>.</p>
      <p>On his first trip to an EU member state in more than three years, Lukashenko met Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen. Austria's former Chancellor <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/sebastian-kurz-set-return-power-austria-ousting-190926154709626.html">Sebastian Kurz</a> visited Belarus in March.</p>
      <p>Often described by its critics in the West as "Europe's last dictatorship", <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/belarus.html">Belarus</a> has been the target of Western sanctions over its poor rights record and lack of fair elections. The 65-year-old Lukashenko has rarely travelled elsewhere in Europe.</p>
      <p>In recent years, however, the West and Belarus have sought to improve ties as the Kremlin pushed for a closer relationship between Moscow and Minsk.</p>
      <p>Lukashenko said his country was "wedged in like in a pair of pliers" between the East and the West.</p>
      <p>"Despite this, we are doing sometimes very well," Lukashenko told reporters during a joint news conference with Van der Bellen.</p>
      <p>Asked about his country's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/human_rights.html">human rights</a> record, he said: "It is a country where one can relax in peace and security."</p>
      <h3>Closer ties</h3>
      <p>Van der Bellen said the two leaders discussed many issues, including the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/ukraine.html">Ukraine</a> crisis, as they hoped to "deepen" their relationship.</p>
      <p>Austria also recommended that Belarus, the only European country that still uses capital punishment, should at least put a moratorium on the death penalty.</p>
      <p>Belarus's closest ally is Russia and the two have formed a nominal "union", with close trade and military cooperation.</p>
      <p>In recent months, however, Moscow has been pressuring Minsk into more integration. While Lukashenko has welcomed closer ties with Moscow, he has pushed back at the idea of an outright unification.</p>
      <p>Moscow has denied it wants unification. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said it was "normal" for Minsk to have contacts with other countries.</p>
      <p>Karin Kneissl, who was the foreign minister under Kurz's previous administration, said in January that Austria wanted to develop closer ties with Belarus as a "buffer state" between Russia, the EU and Ukraine.</p>
      <h3>Recognition</h3>
      <p>For Lukashenko, being hosted by an EU member represents a "diplomatic success" before parliamentary elections on Sunday, political analyst Artyom Shraibman said.</p>
      <p>Lukashenko said in September he also wanted to improve ties with Washington as he welcomed the then US National Security Adviser John Bolton for rare talks in Minsk.</p>
      <p>The Soviet-era collective farm chief became Belarus's first post-independence president in 1994 and has dominated the country ever since.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Lukashenko visited <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/italy.html">Italy</a> and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/vatican.html">Vatican</a> after the EU lifted most of the sanctions it had imposed in recent years against him and other Belarusians in a move to encourage progress on human rights.</p>
      <p>Since then, Lukashenko has repeatedly been invited to visit Europe, but had declined offers until now.</p>
      <p>After Russia, Austria is one of Belarus's biggest sources of foreign direct investment. Belarus media labelled it "the most loyal" of EU members to Minsk.</p>
      <p>Lukashenko has been in Austria privately, skiing with his family in 2002. Kurz presented him with a pair of hand-made wooden skis during his March visit to Belarus.</p>
