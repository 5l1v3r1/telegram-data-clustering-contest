      <h1>Setting fire to artworks in the desert "creates atmospheric pollution" says Burning Man festival</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:00:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/marcus-fairs/" target="_blank">Marcus Fairs</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.dezeen.com/tag/burning-man">Burning Man</a> has acknowledged the carbon emissions it causes and called on attendees to consider alternatives to burning, as part of a plan to become carbon negative by 2030.</p>
      <p>The festival, which sees 80,000 people gather in Nevada's Black Rock Desert each summer, has drawn up a draft sustainability plan after calculating that its carbon footprint is 100,000 tons of CO2 per year.</p>
      <p>"They are completely re-questioning everything," said architect <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/tag/arthur-mamou-mani">Arthur Mamou-Mani</a>, who attends the festival each year. "I think it's a very positive sign."</p>
      <p>Mamou-Mani made the comment at the <a href="http://www.dezeenday.com/">Dezeen Day</a> conference in London last month, when he showed images of <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/01/02/burning-man-2018-temple-galaxia-arthur-mamou-mani-university-westminster/">Galaxia</a>, the timber "temple" he designed as the festival's centrepiece in 2018.</p>
      <p>Each year the temple, along with other temporary artworks and structures, is burned at the festival.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Festival to rethink burning ritual</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked how he could justify the burning of a huge wooden structure on environmental grounds, Mamou-Mani said: "I don't think I can defend it. You know, we need rituals, but there could be alternatives to that and it's up to our creativity."</p>
      <p>The week-long festival involves creating a high-density, car-free city on a dry lake bed called the playa. Although Burning Man has a "leave no trace" philosophy, which sees organisers and festival-goers remove all debris from the desert after event ends, organisers said they see "several critical opportunities to improve".</p>

      <p>These include examining the ritual of burning temporary structures and sculptures.</p>
      <p>"Burning art creates atmospheric pollution," festival organisers wrote. "We have to acknowledge that the release of these emissions is of concern."</p>
      <p>The festival called on attendees to to consider "alternatives to burning" and help "find a way to mitigate emissions, and to be thoughtful and intentional about how/when/where and why we burn art".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Burning Man to become carbon negative by 2030</b>
      </p>
      <p>Other improvements under consideration include carbon offsetting, generating renewable energy and coordinating transport to the event.</p>
      <p>"Burning Man Project is beginning an open-source approach to become carbon negative, sustainably manage waste, and be ecologically regenerative by 2030," organisers wrote in <a href="https://medium.com/@burningman/burning-man-project-2030-environmental-sustainability-roadmap-c79657e18146">a Medium post published this summer</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the next 10 years the festival aims to eliminate all non-sustainable waste streams, have a net positive environmental impact, and remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it puts into it.</p>
      <p>"By the end of the next decade, we aim for it to be better for the ecology of Earth for Burning Man to exist than to not exist," organisers said.</p>
      <p>Festival attendees, known as Burners, are already advised to consider the environment when setting fire to their artworks.</p>
      <p>"If you absolutely must burn your art before you leave, there are a few things you should know, including how to burn the environmentally-friendly way, and the health issues inherent in burning," says <a href="https://burningman.org/event/preparation/leaving-no-trace/burning/">a web page that gives advice to festival goers</a>.</p>
      <p>"Most importantly, do not burn materials that are toxic."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Carbon emissions bolstered by activities of festival goers</b>
      </p>
      <p>However the carbon emissions generated by the festival's iconic burn are outweighed by emissions generated by festival goers' transportation, provisions and power consumption at the festival.</p>
      <p>Burning Man has been held in the Black Rock Desert each year since 1991. Black Rock City, as the festival site is known, is the size of a small town and is laid out in a horseshoe formation with radiating streets.</p>
      <p>The urban plan was drawn up by architect Rod Garrett and Burning Man co-founder Larry Harvey. "We needed urban design because it's a city," Harvey told Dezeen <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2015/08/25/burning-man-needed-urban-design-because-its-a-city-says-founder-larry-harvey/">in an exclusive interview in 2015</a>.</p>

      <p>Other artworks and structures burned at the festival include this year's temple, which <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/12/24/burning-man-temple-direction-2019/">San Francisco architect Geordie Van Der Bosch based on Japanese torii gates</a>, and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/09/20/burning-man-temple-marisha-farnsworth-stacked-wood-dead-trees/">artist Marisha Farnsworth's 2017 project</a>, which was built from 100 dead trees to emphasise "dramatic changes occurring in our forests".</p>
