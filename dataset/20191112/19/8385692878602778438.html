      <p>Amazon has a really <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great deal</a> on the Roborock E25 robot vacuum right now, where you can get it for just $239.</p>
      <p>Basically, the Roborock E25 is priced at $299 normally. But there is an on-page coupon that you can clip for another $60 off of its regular price. That brings it down to just $239. Making it a really great price for a pretty incredible robot vacuum.</p>
      <p>The Roborock E25 is a pretty good robot vacuum, especially for its price. Unlike the higher-end S5 robot vacuum from Roborock, the E25 actually uses a dual-gyro system to navigate your home. This is instead of the laser system that the S5 uses. It is still able to do a good job at mapping and cleaning your home, which is what matters.</p>

      <p>With the Roborock E25 you're going to be able to clean up your home pretty easily. The E25 is going to be able to get up all of the dirt, thanks to the pretty strong suction included. We're looking at 1800Pa, which is strong enough to pick up some AA batteries. Now that is strong.</p>
      <p>It also has a dust bin that you access from the top of the vacuum. This is important because it means that you are less likely to end up dumping out all of that dirt back onto the floor, since it is not on the bottom of the vacuum. It also comes with a brush to clean the brushes included on the E25. So it can keep cleaning up.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Roborock E25 has Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant included. Allowing you to control the robot vacuum by using your voice. And that's a pretty cool feature to have.</p>
