      <h1>Rona’s ‘truly Canadian’ ads are inaccurate, watchdog says</h1>
      <h2>Ads Standards points out U.S.-based Lowe’s acquired Rona in 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:21:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>The advertising industry’s self-regulatory body says Rona Inc.’s “truly Canadian” and “proudly Canadian” store signs are inaccurate, since the company has been acquired by a U.S. firm.</p>
      <p>Ads Standards says it received two complaints about the accuracy of the large outdoor signs located on some of the home improvement stores.</p>
      <p>In May 2016, North Carolina-based <a href="https://www.bclocalnews.com/business/lowes-buying-rona-stores/">Lowe’s Companies Inc. acquired Rona</a>, which was founded in 1939 in Canada.</p>
      <p>The council and later an appeal panel decided the “truly” and “proudly” Canadian claims “conveyed an inaccurate general impression” of Rona being Canadian-owned and controlled.</p>
      <p>The council says Rona stated it “strongly disagrees” with the conclusion.</p>
      <p>Rona says its “entire history is rooted in Canada” and its head office is located in Boucherville, Que.</p>
