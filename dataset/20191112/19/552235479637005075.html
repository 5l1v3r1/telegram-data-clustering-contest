      <h1>Jeremie Frimpong rewarded for Celtic form with Netherlands under-20 call-up</h1>
      <h2>The attack minded right-back has been a breath of fresh air since his arrival in Scottish football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:09:22+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Celtic sensation <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a> has been given the nod to join the Netherlands under-20 squad for their upcoming match against the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>The right-back has garnered acclaim for a series of rampaging attacking performances where his pace and trickery down the right and vivacious, effervescent personality has endeared him to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Hoops</a> ' support.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old was signed to little fanfare on transfer deadline day in a deal from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - where the player had spent his entire youth career.</p>
      <p>Frimpong has three caps at under-19 level but an appearance would mark his first at the higher age group.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> has been quick to sing the praises of his young star and the impression he has already left in the East End of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>He said: "I think there's a bit of a love affair going on with him and everyone. We're just really enjoying him and you can see that energy and quality he brings to the team.</p>
      <p>"He's having a fantastic time of it and long may that continue.</p>
      <p>"It's not just about individuals, the team and the squad have been outstanding for the last six or seven weeks."</p>
