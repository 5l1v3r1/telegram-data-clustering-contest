      <h4>Bottom line: The 8BitDo N30 wireless mouse is clearly a nostalgia grab. It doesn’t look very comfortable for long-term use and there are far better options out there in terms of practicality but boy is that retro design incredibly gorgeous.</h4>
      <p>Third-party video game hardware maker 8BitDo is now shipping an affordable stocking stuffer that’s both nostalgic and practical.</p>
      <p>Inspired by the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-n30-24g-wireless-mouse">8BitDo N30 wireless mouse</a> could easily be mistaken for a period correct accessory from the mid-1980s. Designed by Daniel Jansson years ago, the pointer has been brought to life through a partnership with 8BitDo and now you can own one.</p>

      <p>The 2.4GHz mouse features left and right click buttons modeled after the A and B buttons from the original NES controller and even has a touch sensitive panel between the buttons. On the left side is a functional directional pad that offers page up / page down and forward / backward operation. It is compatible with both Windows and Mac.</p>
      <p>Even the bottom of the pointer looks as you’d expect with feet on each corner, an on-off switch, the optical sensor and a battery compartment that also stores the USB dongle.</p>
      <p>The 8BitDo N30 wireless mouse retails for $24.99 and for an additional $0.99, they’ll toss in an NES-inspired mouse pad.</p>
