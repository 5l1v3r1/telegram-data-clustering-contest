      <p>In another heartfelt tribute to his now former Cape Town City counterpart Benni McCarthy, coach Pitso Mosimane has again hit back at local clubs for a lack of patience with South Africans in the Premier Soccer League. </p>

      </p>
      <p>McCarthy was sacked last week following a string of poor results and almost immediately replaced with Dutchman Jan Olde Riekerink. </p>
      <p>Mosimane, the Mamelodi Sundown coach who is an admirer of McCarthy, said the news had caught him by surprise.</p>
      <p>“I never saw it coming. It’s unbelievable – I never thought Benni would take coaching this seriously and he really came in and took it to another level. His team was playing very well, even though they didn’t win a lot of games this season. I mean the guy is two years as a head coach and has already won a cup,” he told reporters. </p>
      <p>Mosimane said the sacking of local coaches was disheartening. </p>
      <p>“I was very angry when Clinton Larsen (at Chippa United) was let go. I was not happy when Cavin Johnson (at AmaZulu) was let go – what has changed? I don’t see such a big difference. As South Africans, we don’t get the big jobs when we go to Slovakia or Serbia. They don’t take us. I can’t go to Germany, they won’t take me,” he said, adding; “but I talk for the coaches because the team owners will say they haven’t won for the last seven games. But you didn’t lose seven games, you dropped points. It’s sad because I like to talk for local coaches because they can do it.”</p>
