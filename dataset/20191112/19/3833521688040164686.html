      <h1>Recipe Unlimited shares sink to record low on 'disappointing' Q3</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:06:29+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>VAUGHAN, Ont. -- Shares of Recipe Unlimited Corp., the company behind Swiss Chalet, St. Hubert and the Keg, sank to a record low Tuesday after it reported "disappointing" results that saw its sales and profits slip in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Recipe's shares fell to a low of $20.01 and were down $2.20 or 9.8 per cent at $20.29 in afternoon trading.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that the industry, in particular the full-service restaurant industry in Canada, is in a challenging environment," CEO Frank Hennessey told a conference call with financial analysts Tuesday after the company released its third-quarter results Monday evening.</p>
      <p>The Vaughan, Ont.-based company saw total system sales fall by $10.7 million to $869.1 million for the third-quarter ended Sept. 29, from $879.8 million in the same quarter the previous year.</p>
      <p>Same-restaurant sales, a key retail metric, fell 3.1 per cent in the quarter.</p>
      <p>The company saw softening guest traffic in most areas where it operates Â except Quebec -- and at most of its brands, Hennessey said. Recipe Unlimited owns 22 restaurant brands as of Sept. 29, including Harvey's, New York Fries and Milestones.</p>
      <p>Hennessey noted several potential factors behind the slowdown, including a slowing economy, more restaurant seats in the market and a struggling retail sector.</p>
      <p>Recipe's net earnings fell to $6.7 million for the quarter, compared with $23.8 million in the third quarter the previous year.</p>
      <p>Adjusted net earnings came in at $19.5 million or 31 cents per diluted share, equal to forecasts according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv. That compared with $25.3 million or 39 cents per diluted share for the same quarter in 2018.</p>
      <p>Still, Hennessey said he sees an opportunity for growth in the current market.</p>
      <p>"In an environment such as we are currently in, standing still is not an option."</p>
      <p>The company formerly known as Cara Operations is working to renovate its restaurants, particularly the Swiss Chalet brand.</p>
      <p>Over the past quarter, it renovated 33 restaurants. The Swiss Chalet spots boasting new designs out perform their older counterparts, he said.</p>
      <p>It is also expanding its salad bar concept to two Swiss Chalet locations -- Ontario's Barrie and Belleville -- by the end of the month, he said. The rotisserie-chicken chain's locations with the so-called Chalet Market see a lift in sales, he said.</p>
      <p>The company also wants to become the delivery leader for the full-service restaurant industry and is working on an initiative to achieve better quality, speed and trust in its delivery service, said Hennessey.</p>
      <p>The industry environment may spark further consolidation in the industry, said Hennessey, who did not close the door on acquiring more brands to add to Recipe's portfolio.</p>
      <p>"We are not content with status quo, and while the results of this past quarter were indeed disappointing, we are excited for our future."</p>
