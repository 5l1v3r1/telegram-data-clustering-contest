      <h1>Ford F-150 Discount Reaches Nearly $12k Depending On Where You Live</h1>
      <h2>It also requires buying a specific model with a bevy of packages.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:52:53+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>Tis the season to try and sell things. Automakers are ramping up Black Friday deals, and a new report from <a href="http://fordauthority.com/2019/11/ford-discount-drops-2019-f-150-price-by-almost-12000-in-november-2019/">Ford Authority</a> shows that even the best-selling <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/f-150/">Ford F-150</a> is wrapped with fresh discounts. If this all sounds a bit familiar, it’s because we covered a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/373181/ford-f-150-9k-discount/">$9,000 discount on the half-ton truck</a> just over a month ago. As our headline clearly states, that figure is now up to almost $12,000, but as is often the case with automaker deals, there’s <i>plenty</i> of fine print.</p>

        <h4>Our Take On The F-150:</h4>

      <p><a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford </a>loves to offer region-specific incentives that vary in price. New York City – arguably the place where you least want to drive a full-size pickup – is where you’ll get the best factory discount of $11,960. Further fine print limits the deal to 2019 F-150 XLT models optioned with the 302A equipment package, <i>and</i> you need the Luxury, Power, and Navigation package as well. You're also limited to choosing just the 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6, so yeah, if you’re looking for a <i>very</i> specific pickup, a trip to New York could be warranted.</p>

      <p>Outside the Big Apple, Detroit buyers can get $6,250 off a similarly-equipped F-150 XLT, though you only need the 302A package. Los Angeles offers a $7,000 discount for any 2019 F-150 XLT, and Miami dishes up a deal nearly as good as New York at $11,500. However, all the same stipulations for equipment are in place along with something else – it’s only good for F-150 XLT SuperCrew 4x4 trucks. Regardless of location (and odds are good that Ford will have something happening on the F-150 is most locations), the deals are primarily for 2019 models though some 2020 models are also up for discounts.</p>

      <p>Offering deals at the end of the year is nothing new in the automotive realm, though Ford could have some added incentive to try and boost F-150 sales. Third-quarter figures from the Blue Oval show F-Series sales were down 6 percent compared to 2018, and overall F-Series sales through 2019 are down 2.4 percent. That’s not a huge number, but considering trucks are Ford’s best-selling vehicles <i>by far</i>, any drop in sales is worrisome. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ram/">Ram</a>, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a>, and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/gmc/">GMC</a> also have all-new models in the last couple of years, whereas the current-generation F-150 dates back to 2015. That will soon change, as Ford is expected to launch its next-gen truck later in 2020.</p>
