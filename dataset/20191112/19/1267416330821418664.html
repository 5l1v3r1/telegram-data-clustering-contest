      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:15:17+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>About this time last year Samsung revamped its mid-range smartphones with new features like in-display fingerprint scanners, notches and four rear-facing cameras.</p>
      <p>Now, CAD-based renderings of a new Samsung smartphone with an interesting design have appeared online. The renderings were posted by <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1194147185555845120">OnLeaks</a> together with <a href="https://pricebaba.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-a51-renders-images-punch-hole-display-quad-cameras-exclusive">Pricebaba</a>.</p>

      <p>This handset is the successor to the<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/07/samsung-galaxy-a20-a50-a70-available-canada/"> Galaxy A50</a>, called the Galaxy A51.</p>
      <p>The purported device sports a 6.5-inch display, a small chin and a centered hole punch cutout similar to the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/08/23/samsung-galaxy-note-10-review/">Galaxy Note 10 series.</a></p>
      <p>The A51 sports a 3.5mm headphone jack, a loudspeaker, USB-C port and an in-display fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>Additional rumours suggest that it features 6GB of RAM, 128GB of expandable storage, an Exynos 9611 chipset and a 4,000mAh battery.</p>
      <p>There’s also a quad rear-facing L-shaped camera setup. The leak also suggests it uses a 48-megapixel primary camera, a depth sensor, a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and, lastly, a 12-megapixel telephoto shooter.</p>
      <p>It’s likely the smartphone will launch in 2020 and come in silver, black and blue.</p>
