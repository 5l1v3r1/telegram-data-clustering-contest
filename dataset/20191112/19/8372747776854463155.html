      <p>Also, Fleet of Angels, a horse rescue group, said that a horse died in Tryon, North Carolina,</p>
      <p>"If you own horses in any of the areas being targeted, please be vigilant and notify authorities if you see any suspicious activity that concerns you. It's not a bad idea these days to have cameras around pastures, pens, and barns when possible," the group wrote on Facebook.</p>
