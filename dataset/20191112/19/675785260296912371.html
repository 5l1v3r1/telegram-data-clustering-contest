      <h1>Danny Rose admits he turned off TV upset as England players were racially abused in Bulgaria</h1>
      <h2>The Tottenham left-back was not part of the squad that travelled to Sofia and could not bear to watch the disgraceful scenes that unfolded in the Euro 2020 qualifier</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:30:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Danny Rose has revealed he switched off his TV because he could not bear to watch the shameful scenes of England’s game in Bulgaria.</p>
      <p>Rose was suspended and missed last month’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Sofia when England players were subjected to sickening racist abuse.</p>
      <p>Bulgaria escaped with a paltry £65,000 fine and two game stadium closure - one of which was suspended for two years - and Rose admits he has been left angry by the fall-out.</p>
      <p>England full back Rose told the BBC: “To be honest with you I couldn't watch it. It got to just before half-time and there was a debate about whether the ref was going to call the game off and after that I couldn't watch it.</p>

      <p>“It was obviously difficult to watch to see the lads put in situations for the first time that were foreign to us because we don't encounter that while we are playing here in England.</p>
      <p>"It was difficult to watch but Harry (Kane) and the lads conducted themselves in a professional manner and I'm glad no-one was physically abused over there.</p>
      <p>“I have said what I have said in the past about the punishments and stuff and after that my views are no different. My views are still the same, I have got nothing to say about things like that.</p>

      <p>“Until harsher punishments are in place then I am not going to keep talking for the sake of talking, I said what I had to say and people agreed or disagreed.</p>
      <p>“Now we are six, seven, eight months down the line and things are still happening after not-so severe punishments so I am fully prepared for it to keep happening for the foreseeable future and we will just have to hope something changes.”</p>
