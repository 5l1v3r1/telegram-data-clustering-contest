      <p>LONDON: British unemployment has hit a fresh 45-year low, official data showed Tuesday (Nov 12) in a mixed labour market snapshot before a UK general election and Brexit.</p>
      <p>The unemployment rate declined to 3.8 per cent in the three months to September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said in a statement.</p>

      <p>That was the lowest level since the final quarter of 1974, and compared with 3.9 per cent in the three months to August 2019.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the ONS said the number of people in work declined by 58,000 to 32.75 million in the quarter. That was the heaviest quarterly fall since May 2015.</p>
      <p>"The latest jobs data are a mixed bunch but overall show a softening trend, indicating that the labour market is now undeniably faltering in the face of overall soft domestic economic activity, a weakening global economy and heightened Brexit and domestic political uncertainties," said EY Item Club economist Howard Archer.</p>
