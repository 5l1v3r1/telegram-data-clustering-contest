      <h1>Star Wars’ Han Solo/Greedo Scene Was Changed Yet Again For Disney+</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:30:50+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ has finally launched, and there’s a lot of content to choose from. That content includes the original <b><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a> </b>films, remastered in 4K with Dolby Atmos support. However, the pretty visuals didn’t stop fans from noticing yet another alteration to the Han Solo/Greedo confrontation in <b>A New Hope</b>. In the new iteration, Greedo has something to say before firing at Han. He yells “Maclunkey!” before they both fire at the same time.</p>
      <p>The scene is below, as posted by the <a href="https://twitter.com/StarWarsVisComp/status/1194160489825284097?s=20">Star Wars Visual Comparisons account</a>.</p>

      <p>This is the latest change to the iconic scene, which originally changed in 1997. Director George Lucas modified it so that Greedo fired first and missed, with Han retaliating. In the original film, Han simply shot him outright. It was one of the more contentious edits from the Special Editions. According to The Verge, Lucas made the change himself before selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012.</p>

      <p>Disney hasn’t provided any comment regarding the scene change, as it has its hands full performing maintenance on its streaming service. Many users reported errors trying to log in, with the company noting that it’s working on the problem.</p>

      <p>Regardless of anything else, the 4K upgrade adds more fuel to the rumor that the <b>Star Wars</b> movies could get a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/461769-star-wars-blu-ray-dvd-re-releases-coming-this-september#/slide/1">4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray release sometime in 2020</a>. Disney has yet to make that official.</p>
      <p><b>A New Hope</b> and most of the <b>Star Wars</b> films are available now on Disney+.</p>
