      <p>Mohamed Salah has been ruled out of Egypt's AFCON qualifiers with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> forward suffered the injury last month following a robust challenge from Leicester City's Hamza Choudhury.</p>
      <p>The Golden Ball winner aggravated it further in the Reds' 3-1 win over Premier League champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Salah will miss matches against against Kenya and Comoros as a result.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian was caught by Fernandinho on Sunday, and was left in a heap on the ground.</p>
      <p>Salah continued after receiving treatment but later came off as a substitute. He then had his ankle strapped with ice by the club's medical team.</p>

      <p>Liverpool are said to be concerned about the ongoing injury.</p>
      <p>Klopp said: "I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>

      <p>Salah had jetted off to Egypt to join up with his international team-mates.</p>
      <p>He injury was then assessed and it was determined that he will play no part in Thursday night's clash with Kenya nor Monday's match with Comoros.</p>
