      <p>A pair of tiny kittens have been found dumped in a skip in sub zero temperatures.</p>
      <p>The six-week-old kittens were found shivering in a box in the skip in Livingston last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The pair were rescued by a member of the public and are now in the care of the Cats Protection West Lothian branch who described the treatment of the animals as “another low”.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the charity made a heartfelt appeal to the owners off the kittens to let them help their mum.</p>
      <p>Posting on Facebook, they said: “These two six-week-old kittens were retrieved from inside a box which was put into a skip in Livingston.</p>

      <p>"They must have spent the night, remember that was minus two, in this box in the skip. Got them to our vet, spent the day in an oxygen tent with a heat pad. Wee ginger kitten is okay, but touch and go for other one.</p>
      <p>"Our real concern now is for the mum cat, she will not be neutered. In total confidence, if anyone knows anything, we will pay for the mum cat to be neutered. No questions asked. Please just call, we won’t ask your name. Please call 01506 298107.”</p>
