      <h1>Liverpool fans fume as Mohamed Salah ruled out of Egypt matches ahead of Crystal Palace clash</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool winger aggravated his injury in the win over Man City and will miss the upcoming internationals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:06:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Salah has been ruled out of Egypt's upcoming Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Kenya and Comoros with an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian forward has been hampered by his ankle since limping off in the win over Leicester, but a tackle from Fernandinho during the 3-1 win over Man City on Sunday appeared to aggravate the problem.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/liverpool-engliverpool/story/3987872/sources-liverpool-concerned-by-latest-mohamed-salah-knock">ESPN</a>, Liverpool were concerned by the severity of the injury and wanted Salah to remain on Merseyside for tests but the Egpytian national team had insisted that he reports for duty to be assessed.</p>
      <p>Egypt have now confirmed that Salah is not fit enough to play and posted pictures of the forward wearing a protective boot on his left ankle.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side now face a nervous wait to see what the scan shows. The Liverpool boss had provided an update earlier this month, saying: "I think it is more really annoying for him, not me, the fact that it always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>
      <p>After the international break, Liverpool will look to maintain their push for the Premier League title as they travel to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Reds fans took to social media to voice their frustration and some blamed City midfielder Fernandinho for causing the injury.</p>
