      <p>Over the summer, the artist appeared to taunt <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> after sending <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/wiley-goads-ed-sheeran-for-a-reaction-after-the-grime-legend-slated-take-me-back-to-london-remix-2542382">a series of negative tweets about the singer’s remix collaboration with Stormzy</a>.</p>
      <p>Sheeran and Stormzy released their <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-stormzy-aitch-feature-ed-sheerans-new-video-take-back-london-remix-2541469">‘Take Me Back To London (remix)’</a> on August 22. The move looked to have irked Wiley – “the Godfather of Grime” – who has accused Sheeran of being a “clout chaser” by using one of the grime’s biggest stars to gain popularity.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who uses us and our sounds are culture vultures… I’m getting my guitar and foot pedal out and I don’t wanna hear nobody moaning about nothing,” Wiley said in the post.</p>
      <p>Stormzy came to Sheeran’s defence, replying: “No Wiley you know Ed been doing this from early, been a real one from early, can’t question that, you know I love you and respect you brother but nah don’t do that.”</p>
