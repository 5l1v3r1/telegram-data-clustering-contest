      <p>On the weekend, <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/lionel-messi-equals-cristiano-ronaldo-laliga-record/667157">Messi equalled Ronaldo's record</a> for the most hat-tricks in LaLiga history, and the Argentine is expected to overtake his longstanding rival, who has left the Spanish top flight for Italy's Serie A.</p>
      <p>The superstar pair also hold two of the extraordinary records recently listed by <i>Marca </i>as milestones that seem unthinkable to be breached.</p>
      <p>The Argentine wrote his name into football's history books in 2012, when he ended the calendar year with an unprecedented 90 goals for club and country, and no one has come close ever since.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo, meanwhile, is the leading goalscorer in UEFA Champions League history, and his current total of 127 strikes, which he can still extend, could be another record that remains set in stone forever.</p>
      <p>However, one of the records neither Messi nor Ronaldo seem likely to catch is Just Fontaine's goals tally from the 1958 FIFA World Cup. The Frenchman netted an incredible 13 times in that tournament – as many goals as the two current superstars of the game have scored between them in four different editions of the competition.</p>
      <p>With the World Cup being the main trophy that eludes Messi and Ronaldo, and not many players experiencing the joy of lifting it in their careers, Pele's three World Cup triumphs seems another unbreakable record.</p>

      <p>What the World Cup is at national team level is the Champions League at club level, and no other player has won it more than Real Madrid's Paco Gento. The Spaniard was part of Los Blancos' successful era in the 1950s, and lifted the European Champions Cup – the predecessor of the current competition – six times.</p>
