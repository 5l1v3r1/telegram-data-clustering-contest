      <h1>Heated Austin MacPhee debate ends with fuming Michael O'Neill shooting down BBC presenter</h1>
      <h2>O'Neill defended his former Northern Ireland No.2 after Allan Preston and Willie Miller eviscerated the Hearts interim manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T19:51:08+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 19:51</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Michael O'Neill has refused to answer questions over a move to take <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a>' interim boss Austin MacPhee to Stoke.</p>
      <p>The new Potters boss, who left Northern Ireland, appeared on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079g4q">BBC Sportsound</a> to defend MacPhee after he put himself in the running for the Tynecastle hotseat.</p>
      <p>Allan Preston eviscerated the Jambos coach at the weekend before their 5-2 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> as he launched an incredible attack, suggesting he should be nowhere near the club as Ann Budge looks for Craig Levein's replacement.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen legend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/willie-miller">Willie Miller</a> then claimed MacPhee needed to "get a life" after claiming he wants to make Hearts a consistent Europa League club.</p>
      <p>O'Neill, who has worked alongside MacPhee at Northern Ireland for the past five years, hit back at the BBC pundits insisting there was no need to be so personal with their comments.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Host Kenny Macintyre, who was joined on the show by Miller and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/partick-thistle-fc">Partick Thistle</a> boss Ian McCall, then ended the contentious discussion by asking McNeill if he would consider taking his former assistant McPhee with him to Stoke.</p>
      <p>And O'Neill bluntly shot down the question, saying: "Kenny, look we're on here to talk about Austin so you can't be asking me questions like that.</p>
      <p>"And he's under contract with another club Kenny."</p>
      <p>As O'Neill was about to hang up, Miller butted in to wish him well in his new role but O'Neill didn't seem to appreciate the sentiments.</p>
      <p>Miller said: "Michael, Michael, Michael good luck in the new job from all of us."</p>
      <p>O'Neill replied: "Thanks Willie."</p>
      <p>McCall added: "Dripping with sincerity there."</p>
