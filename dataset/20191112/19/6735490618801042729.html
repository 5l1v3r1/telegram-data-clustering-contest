      <p>“We’re not friends but we have a lot of friends in common,” Washington explained. “I think a lot of people have us programmed in their phone as ‘KW,’ so I’ll get a text like once a year where I’m like, ‘That’s not for me.'”</p>
      <p>She added, “This year if it happens I’m sure it will be something very pious and Godly.”</p>
