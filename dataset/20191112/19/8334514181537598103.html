      <p>HOUSTON (Reuters) - Refineries from south Texas to east Louisiana saw no impact on production from a steep drop in temperatures across the region overnight, said sources familiar with operations at the plants.</p>
      <p>Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said a reformer shut down on Tuesday at Marathon Petroleum Corp’s 585,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, Texas, where temperatures fell more than 30 degrees Fahrenheit to a low of 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>It was unclear whether the weather played a role in the reformer’s outage.</p>
      <p>Two refineries, however, were starting up units despite the chilly weather driven by fierce north winds.</p>
      <p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s 340,000-bpd Deer Park, Texas, refinery began restarting the large crude unit on Tuesday morning, when temperatures hit a low of 36F (2.2C), according to sources familiar with plant operations.</p>
      <p>Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said there was no weather impact on the company’s refineries in Texas and Louisiana.</p>
      <p>Total SA resumed normal operation on a diesel hydrotreater at its 225,500 bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, on Monday night, said Gulf Coast market sources.</p>
