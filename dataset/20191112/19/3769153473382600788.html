      <p>Albin Merle shares an incredible-looking 'fake' trailer for a television show about Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
      <blockquote>Here is a fake opening credits i did recently as i wanted to improve my 3dskills and explore a new workflow for cutting edge trailer.<br/><br/>Like if a massive production company would decide to make a series on Napoleon. Most of the model are inspired from the online collection of the French army museum of invalides. (musée de l’armée des invalides ).</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Cou can <a href="https://www.cgtrader.com/free-3d-models/various/various-models/soldier-napoleon-coin">download the free Coin 3d model here</a>.<br/><br/><b>A few words about the workflow:</b><br/><br/>Modeling in blender, texturing in substance painter. I used a decimated lowpoly model to rig my model into mixamo, then imported in back into blender to transfer my rig onto the Highpoly model. Whenever a model is duplicated, i use as much as possible the Linked file tool to keep my scene light.<br/><br/>For instance, in the shot with several soldiers i just append the collection and offset the animation.<br/>Cycles for rendering.<br/><br/>Music : Lacrimosa, Mozart.<br/><br/>hope you guys will like it.</blockquote>
