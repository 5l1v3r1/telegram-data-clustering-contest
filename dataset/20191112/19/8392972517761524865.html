      <p>Talking to hosts Phillip Schofield and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> about his own BBC Three documentary, Me, My Brother And My Balls, and the impact of Movember, attention soon turned to Jesy and her documentary.</p>
      <p>"She was completely overwhelmed," he said about the response to the documentary, which saw the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/little-mix/?page=4">Little Mix</a> singer, 28, confront online trolls.</p>
      <p>"She rang me bless her 10 minutes after it aired. She was so overwhelmed, she just broke down on the phone to me. She's a strong girl now."</p>
      <p>It was then Chris himself broke down and became emotional.</p>
      <p>"I don't know why I get so emotional every time I speak about it," he said as Phil and Holly comforted him.</p>

      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/little-mixs-jesy-nelson-reveals-she-attempted-suicide/">Jesy spoke for the first time of the devastating lengths</a> constant online trolling drove her to.</p>
      <p>The Little Mix singer has revealed that the bullying was so bad she began to starve herself and attempted suicide.</p>
      <p>From the moment the girl group won The X Factor in 2011, Jesy was targeted over her appearance.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Speaking to The Sun ahead of the documentary, Jesy said: "I was always known as the fat, ugly one. It literally consumed every part of me.</p>
      <p>"I just remember thinking, 'I just need this to go away, I'm going to end this'.</p>
      <p>"I remember going to the kitchen and just took as many tablets as I could. Then I laid in bed for ages and kept thinking, ‘Let it happen. Hurry up’."</p>
      <p>Fortunately her then boyfriend, in November 2013, discovered her and called an ambulance.</p>
