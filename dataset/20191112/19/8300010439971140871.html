      <p><a href="https://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-DisneyPlus-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVDPlusLaunchDayBundleEditorial-NA">Disney+</a>, Disney's new streaming service, launched Tuesday in the United States. In addition to the $6.99/month Disney+ subscription, customers also have the option of purchasing a $12.99/month bundle deal that includes access to Disney+, Hulu (with ads) and ESPN+.<br/><br/>Here's information on how to sign up for the bundle deal from <a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/disney-bundle-signup?language=en-US">Hulu's official website</a>.<br/><br/><b>If you don't have a Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ account</b><br/><br/>New subscribers can sign up for the bundle <a href="https://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-DisneyPlus-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVDPlusLaunchDayBundleEditorial-NA">on the Disney+ website</a>.<br/><br/><b>If you are an existing Hulu subscriber</b><br/><br/>Disney has set up the bundle deal so that existing Hulu subscribers can maintain their current subscription. Those wishing to purchase the bundle should <a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Acquisition-USLaunch-US-DisneyPlus-DisneyPlus-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVDPlusLaunchDayBundleEditorial-NA">purchase it through the Disney+ website</a>, not the Hulu website, using the same email address associated with your Hulu account.<br/><br/>You will retain your existing Hulu account and have new Disney+ and ESPN+ accounts. Going forward, you will continue to be billed for your Hulu subscription but will receive a credit towards your Disney+ bundle subscription in the amount of $5.99/month as long as you keep your eligible existing Hulu account.<br/><br/>This bundle option may not be available to those who receive Hulu through Spotify or another promotional offer, Disney warned. Other restrictions may apply.<br/><br/><b>If you already have a Disney+ or ESPN+ subscription and you now want the bundle</b><br/><br/>Contact Disney+ customer support to upgrade your account.<br/><br/><b>MORE DISNEY+ COVERAGE:</b></p>
