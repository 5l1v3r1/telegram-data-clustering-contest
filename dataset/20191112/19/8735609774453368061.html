      <p>QUEBEC -- A Quebec pharmacist and blogger has won a prestigious international prize for standing up for science.</p>
      <p>Olivier Bernard, also known as "The Pharmafist," has been awarded the John Maddox Prize in London for his work in debunking myths around the use of vitamin C to treat cancer.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Bernard became aware of a petition circulating in Quebec that was asking the government to approve large injections of the vitamin on the theory that it helped cancer patients.</p>
      <p>Bernard checked into the science behind the claim and found that it was highly dubious.</p>
      <p>He says he and his wife suffered strong social media backlash, including threats, when he published his findings on his blog and broadcast them on his TV show.</p>
      <p>The petition was rejected after doctors and scientists in Quebec came to his defence.</p>
