      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/former-motherwell-hero-says-its-20787866">Motherwell</a> will be preparing for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/former-motherwell-hero-says-its-20787866">exit of boss Stephen Robinson</a> amid links to the Northern Ireland job says Kenny Black.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/swf-chiefs-reviewing-motherwell-ladies-20749099">the Fir Park</a> gaffer among the favourites for the Hearts and Hibs jobs, the IFA are now on the hunt for Michael O’Neil’s replacement after his departure for Stoke City.</p>
      <p>Former assistant manager, caretaker gaffer and player Black reckons that chief executive Alan Burrows will have a contingency plan in place as Robinson continues to be in high demand.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old reckons the likes of youth academy coach Maurice Ross would be a ready-made replacement to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-motherwell-goalkeeper-backs-mark-20672009">continue the Steelmen’s impressive start to the season.</a></p>

      <p>He said: “In football this comes with the territory - if you are doing well in football you will be linked with other jobs.</p>
      <p>“You have to expect this when you are getting a lot of credit and I think <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/ex-motherwell-goalkeeper-backs-mark-20672009">Motherwell</a> will know there are a lot of people admiring the job he has done.</p>
      <p>“They will be bracing themselves for the potential admirers who are watching the work he is doing right now.</p>
      <p>“They will expect the advances now from further afield.</p>
      <p>“Stephen will have every one of the coaches singing from the same hymn sheet, and with the likes of coaches Maurice Ross they will be looking to coach players to make that transition to the first team.</p>

      <p>“Certainly if Stephen was to leave, and I’m sure he will be in no rush to leave but it may well happen, I’m sure they are in good hands and people behind the scenes will have a plan in place to keep the consistency going.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure they can keep finding the consistency to fly under the radar no matter what and maybe get into Europe again.”</p>
      <p>Black, who helped ‘Well finish third in 2012 and earn and consecutive runners up finishes in the SPL in 2013 and 2014, feels like the current crop of talent can replicate that success.</p>
      <p>He continued: “Over the last number of weeks the players have brought back a lot of memories of the team that jumped up to third place.</p>
      <p>“Great credit has to come to the manager and the backroom staff. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/motherwell-boss-stephen-robinson-tipped-20787841">Stephen Robinson</a> has done really well, particularly in the season they got to the two cup finals, but to now be getting that consistency to churn out results week in and week out is really important.</p>

      <p>“You can fly under the radar a bit because you don’t have the pressure on you that other clubs have to finish in the top six, but when you reach that you want to prove you can do that.</p>
      <p>“The sky is the limit for them this season. They are there to be shot at but if they can stay there and be consistent they could find themselves in Europe again.”</p>
