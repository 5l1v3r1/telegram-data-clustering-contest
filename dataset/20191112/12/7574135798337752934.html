      <p>After taking a year off in 2019, <b>The National</b>‘s <a href="https://www.ntlhomecoming.com/">Homecoming Festival</a> will return to Cincinnati, OH’s <b>Smale Riverfront Park on May 8-10, 2020</b>. It’ll once again be produced in association with MusicNOW, who were also onboard for the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-national-debuted-a-new-song-played-boxer-at-homecoming-pics-videos-setlists/">inaugural edition in 2018</a>. The lineup is due to be announced next week, and <a href="https://www.ntlhomecoming.com/ticketslist/">tickets</a> go on public pre-sale Monday, 11/18 at 10 AM EST, with the general sale begining Friday, 11/22 at 10 AM EST.</p>
      <p>At the 2018 edition of the festival, The National <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-national-debuted-a-new-song-played-boxer-at-homecoming-pics-videos-setlists/">performed <i>Boxer</i> in full</a> for its tenth anniversary, joined by guests, and debuted a new song. With their fifth studio album <i>High Violet</i> turning ten on May 10, perhaps they’ll perform it in full this time around instead? Stay tuned for more details.</p>
