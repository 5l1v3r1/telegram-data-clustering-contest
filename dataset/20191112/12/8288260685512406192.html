      <h1>Wolves join top European clubs in sending scout to watch match in Belgium - reports</h1>
      <h2>Latest Wolves transfer news | Reports in Belgium claim that Wolves were one of a number of clubs across Europe to have scouts in attendance for the same match</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:59:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers reportedly had a scout watching a match in Belgium in recent days.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hln.be/sport/voetbal/belgisch-voetbal/anderlecht/indrukwekkend-lijstje-deze-europese-topploegen-stuurden-scout-naar-zulte-waregem-anderlecht~a4f0efa3/">reports in Belgium</a> , a scout from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> was in attendance to watch the First Division A clash between Anderlecht and Zulte Waregem.</p>
      <p>The report also claims that scouts from other top clubs from across Europe were also watching the game, with Manchester United, Arsenal, Rangers, Ajax, Atalanta, Feyenoord, Genoa, Inter Milan, Marseille, Real Sociedad and Sevilla all represented.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that the players being watched were Anderlecht duo Yari Verschaeren and Albert Sambi Lokonga.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Verschaeren plays as an attacking midfielder, while Lokonga is more familiar with the defensive-minded role in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>However, the report adds that Anderlecht are not interested in selling the duo, even if a “monster” offer was to be made.</p>
      <p>Wolves have had transfer dealings with Anderlecht in the past, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> signing Leander Dendoncker from the Belgian club in the summer of 2018.</p>
