      <h2>Students were running for shelters as riot police fire tear gas for more than 20 minutes at a university campus</h2>

      <p>Riot police have turned Hong Kong university campuses into battlegrounds, firing rounds of tear gas at protesters and bringing the city to the 'brink of total breakdown'.</p>
      <p>The clashes came a day after police shot a protester at close range and a man was doused with petrol and set on fire in some of the worst violence in the former British colony in decades.</p>
      <p>University students were called on to boycott classes as part of a citywide strike, while white collar workers were told to skip work and business owners to close their shops.</p>
      <p>Footage has emerged of running riot police firing tear gas and less-lethal projectiles into a sports ground as protesters run for shelter at Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).</p>

      <p>Students and alumni have been forced to form a human chain to move to the front line of the conflict between protesters and police.</p>
      <p>"Our society has been pushed to the brink of a total breakdown," a police spokesman told a briefing.</p>
      <p>Police also fired tear gas at City University in Kowloon Tong, beneath the Lion Rock, and at Chinese University on the other side of the mountain, where protesters threw petrol bombs and bricks at police.</p>
      <p>Protesters at City University have stockpiled bricks and petrol bombs on the bridges and other approaches and were making small devices with nails to apparently  puncture tyres.</p>
      <p>Streets inside and outside the Chinese University campus entrance were littered with bricks, other debris and small street fires as police tackled some protesters to the ground.</p>
      <p>A van used as part of a street barricade was set ablaze.</p>
      <p>Huge plume of smokes emerged from the campus can be seen from across the Tolo Harbour as web users described it as 'chaos' and 'apocalypse'.</p>

      <p>The university said some people had broken into a storeroom and taken bows, arrows and javelins that were later retrieved.</p>
      <p>Endy, who graduated from CUHK, told Mirror Online that the police was 'out of control' when firing tear gas towards students.</p>
      <p>He said: "I felt sad, it [CUHK] is like my second home and I feel like to protect it when the police came throwing tear gas.</p>
      <p>"It's rumoured that at least 60 people were injured and we are now forming a human chain to deliver any useful resources to nearby first-aid stations.</p>
      <p>"I feel that the government and the police would do anything in order to stop the chaos in the city, even with an intention to kill the younger generation."</p>
      <p>Vincent, 28, joined the protesters at 8pm, said he rushed to the university campus after work.</p>
      <p>He said: "The police have no rights to enter the campus. It's a private property by law, they cannot just barge in and arrest students."</p>
      <p>Students and volunteers were seen passing bamboo sticks, food, drinks, and even umbrellas along the mass human chain to different parts of the campus, he added.</p>
      <p>"They will pass along messages if students called for doctors," he told Mirror Online.</p>

      <p>Several people were wounded, including a student reporter hit in the eye, apparently by a brick, who was sitting in tears as friends offered comfort.</p>

      <p>Tuan Sung-chi, vice chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, arrived the scene in the afternoon as he tried to negotiate with the police.</p>
      <p>The police claimed they responded to an incident regarding people hurling objects onto railway tracks at nearby University station and did not intend to enter the campus, reported hkon.cc.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said protesters were being extremely selfish and hoped that universities and schools would urge students not to take part in the demonstrations.</p>
      <p>More than 260 people were arrested on Monday, police said, bringing the total number to more than 3,000 since the protests escalated in June.</p>
      <p>Protesters are angry about what they see as police brutality and meddling by Beijing in the freedoms guaranteed under the "one country, two systems" formula put in place when the territory returned to China from British rule in 1997.</p>
