      <p>McDonald’s workers went on strike on Tuesday, demanding higher wages and more secure contracts from the fast-food giant.</p>
      <p>Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Sir <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a> joined a protest march by workers organised as part of an international movement for better working conditions in the fast food industry.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JohnMcDonnell">John McDonnell</a> was due to meet with the protestors as they arrive at Downing Street as part of a series of global “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/mcdonalds-strikes-latest-workers-ballot-zerohours-contracts-pay-conditions-union-a8295736.html">McStrike</a>” events in countries including France, Belgium, Brazil, Chile and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Employees at six McDonald’s restaurants in the UK have walked out, claiming that they struggle to get by on minimum wage of £8.21 per hour, or less for younger workers. </p>
      <p>They say the problem is made worse because McDonald’s contracts allow managers to change staff hours at short notice, meaning monthly income can go up and down.</p>
      <p>In the UK, McDonald's workers are calling for £15 an hour for all staff regardless of age, the choice of guaranteed hours, and notice of shifts four weeks in advance.</p>
      <p>The burger chain says all staff had been offered contracts with guaranteed numbers of hours and only a tiny minority of 130,000 UK workers would go on strike.</p>
      <p>The staff also want McDonald’s to recognise the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union (BFAWU) so that it can negotiate on their behalf. McDonald’s does not currently recognise any union.</p>
      <p>An employee at Crayford McDonald's in London, Lewis Baker, said he will be striking because he struggles to pay rent on his income of £8.80 an hour.</p>
      <p>Mr Baker, 29, said: “There are a lot of workers who are struggling to pay their bills and get by day to day.</p>

      <p>“We don't have set hours, so we don't always earn enough to pay the bills.</p>
      <p>“If we got £15 an hour, it would have a massive impact - I would be able to afford to pay my rent, to pay my bills, go on holiday and have some kind of work-life balance.</p>
      <p>“I think it's important to strike against massive corporations like McDonald's who are making millions.”</p>
      <p>A former McDonald's employee, Connor McLean-Bolingoli, said he was paid £6.20 an hour when he worked at the fast food outlet as a teenager.</p>
      <p>Mr McLean-Bolingoli, 22, said he left the job in December 2017 after being told to work night shifts despite his bosses knowing he was a young carer.</p>
      <p>He said: “The staff are more or less seen as expendable, as they know there will always be new high school and uni students taking up positions.</p>
      <p>“I left because I had been scheduled to work overnight shifts for the first time since explaining that, as a carer for my mother, who has MS, I couldn't work overnight shifts.”</p>
      <p>The former employee, who now earns double his McDonald's wage, said the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/low-pay">low pay</a> for employees translates into bad customer service.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was told by a guy on my first day, 'we don't get paid enough to care about getting normal burgers exactly right', and obviously that attitude lets things down for the customer.”</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will join the workers at Downing Street to challenge their “poverty wages”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Low pay and insecure work is endemic in the fast food industry.</p>
      <p>“A Labour government will take on the big corporations such as McDonald's to stop them from paying out poverty wages.</p>
      <p>“Labour's commitment to a £10-an-hour real living wage and an end to in-work poverty will help millions of low-paid workers across the country.”</p>
      <p>Shadow Brexit minister Mr Starmer tweeted: “Proud to stand in solidarity with McDonald’s workers in Wandsworth. They are standing up to corporate injustice, low pay and the exploitation of workers. Please support them.”</p>
      <p>A McDonald's spokesperson said: “We are extremely disappointed that a very small number of our people in just a handful of our restaurants are considering industrial action.</p>
      <p>“We understand only nine people are involved across six restaurants, which is a tiny proportion of our 130,000 workforce and 1,300 restaurants.</p>
      <p>“Their potential actions do not represent our people. We are committed to investing in our workforce, listening to and doing what is right by them.</p>
      <p>“The BFAWU is calling for 40-hour guaranteed contracts, which is something we already offer - but has been chosen by very few of our people.</p>
      <p>“With all given the choice, around 90 per cent of our employees have chosen to remain on flexible contracts, valuing the ability to work their shifts around their lives.”</p>
