      <p>One week left before the official launch of Google Stadia in the market. For those eager for its release, Google has announced which games will be available as soon as the service becomes available.</p>
      <p>At the introduction of Stadia, Google announced some titles that will be available on its service. However, by November 19, only 12 of these games will actually be available for play.</p>

      <h3>What to expect from Google Stadia</h3>
      <p>Google Stadia is a gaming subscription service that promises to offer a panoply of games for a monthly fee. This fee will be $9.99 and all you need to play is an internet connection of at least 10 Mbps.</p>
      <p>The great advantage of this service is that you do not have to worry about game processing. This task will be performed on Google’s servers. It means that you will have access to your games either on your PC, smartphone or TV. Unfortunately, not all countries is part of the initial lot where Stadia will be available, but we hope this will change soon.</p>
