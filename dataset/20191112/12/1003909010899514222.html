        <b>"The truth is: remove equalization payments, largely funded by Alberta, and Quebec actually ran an $8 billion deficit."</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Quebec surplus shows Canadian fiscal inequity</h3>
      <p>Quebec announces 2019-2020 surplus: $4 billion; Quebec equalization revenue: $12 billion; Alberta net outflow to Canada: $20-25 billion; Alberta deficit (2018-2019): $6.7 billion (amid harsh cuts in government expenditures). Do the math.</p>
      <p>The truth is: remove equalization payments, largely funded by Alberta, and Quebec actually ran an $8 billion deficit.</p>
      <p>How long will Albertans continue to put up with this fiscal inequity — just one of many reasons why many Albertans want out of Confederation.</p>

      <h3>The Central Library is not free</h3>
      <p>I am pleased to see the high level of local engagement and international recognition for this wonderful facility. I am equally baffled that it is continually labeled as free. Tax-paying citizens paid in full for this building. And we continue to pay every day for the daily operation and staffing to support the provision of free meeting rooms, entertainment and other amenities to the community.</p>
      <p>Agreed, this is a great public facility. However, it is most definitely not free.</p>

      <h3>The east is not the enemy</h3>
      <p>Dissension from Alberta has been coming our way here in Ontario since the federal election. Why the political vitriol directed at the east? Two-thirds of us Ontario voters did not vote for the Liberal party. We are gratefully dependent on your gas and oil. We understand pipeline politics. We certainly have our own economic and social problems. I do not hear people blaming western Canada for high energy costs. Political divisions in the country are intense and much of the media amplifies divisiveness and blame. Why would Canadians not have different political ideas when we live in such a vast, diverse country? Thankfully, we now have a minority government that will require more input and be forced to compromise. Understandably, many Albertans are angry (according to the media here) following the Liberals’ re-election. The east is not the enemy. The struggles and successes of your great province affect us all.</p>

      <h3>Canada is already generous with social programs</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Parents need more than services, letter, Nov. 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Say what? The government should give more money to help parents raise their children? Canada is among the most generous countries in the world when it comes to social programs and financial subsidies. Why do you think so many people are clamouring to get in here –both legally and illegally?</p>
      <p>Yes, the public demands eligibility and accountability for such services, but this would not be possible by simply giving more money directly to parents. What’s to prevent it being spent on things other than children? And heaven help a government that tried to monitor where the money went. Big Brother accusations would fly.</p>
