      <p>At the Beijing Innovation Forum hosted by GSMA today, Wang Jianzhou, former chairman of China Mobile and senior consultant of GSMA, delivered a keynote speech. He said that for the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/5g-network">5G network</a> construction issues can be resolved by the operator’s joint construction and sharing. He also believes that 5G will redefine future mobile phones.</p>

      <p>“Although I have experienced many changes in mobile communications, I am very excited to see the 5G signal in the upper left corner of the mobile phone.” Wang Jianzhou said in the opening.</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that the industry is currently looking forward to 5G. However, the lack of mature 5G application scenarios has become a challenge for 5G commercials. “I have seen a lot of places planning for 5G, and there is a lot of content, but there is still a lack of actual application scenarios,” he said. When 3G came out, everyone didn’t know how to apply it. Until the iPhone was released, various apps were launched, and the application scene became clear. The application scenario of 5G also needs exploration by the industry.</p>
      <h3>Wang Jianzhou thoughts for the future development of 5G</h3>
      <p>For the future development of 5G, Wang Jianzhou believes that the open mobile ecosystem is the basis of 5G innovation. Traditional mobile communication is centered on operators, and the 5G era will change this situation. It is necessary to encourage providers such as content and services to jointly develop 5G applications.</p>
      <p>He also pointed out that 5G not only needs 1 to N innovation but also needs 0 to 1 innovation. For example, the 5G package starts at 30GB, which will cause traffic to rise again. 5G live broadcast, short video, AR/VR, etc will have great development. However, he believes that these are still innovating from 1 to N. Wang Jianzhou takes the example of long-distance mining. The operator can remotely control the mine car in the mine operation. This kind of application scenario is innovation from 0 to 1.</p>
      <p>In addition, Wang Jianzhou stressed that there is still a long way to go before 5G can reach the coverage of 4G. 5G needs to increase investment, and operators are facing downward income and profits, which requires innovative operation mode. </p>
      <p>For example, China Unicom and China Telecom jointly build and share 5G. This will be the development trend of global wireless networks. This is also the case for the construction of 6G in the future. Some enterprises have the needs of 5G private networks, such as hospitals, mining areas, and other scenarios.  This will not only speed up the construction of the network but also strengthen the protection of security and personal privacy. </p>
      <p>Finally, Wang Jianzhou believes that 5G will redefine the mobile phone. In the future, there will be new and epoch-making mobile phone products. For example, wearable devices are likely to be integrated with mobile phones and so on. </p>
