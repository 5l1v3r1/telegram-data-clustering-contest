      <h2>With the 2019/2020 Championship season a third of the way through Birmingham City writer Brian Dick gives his 16-game ratings for Pep Clotet's men</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:38:55+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City’s season is already a third over, sixteen games have gone, 30 remain and the team sits mid-table in the Championship.</p>
      <p>With virtually as many victories, seven, as losses - eight, Pep Clotet’s adventurous team seems to be both living and dying by the sword of their footballing ambition.</p>
      <p>The caretaker head coach is building a team that doesn’t deal in draws, it’s all out for the three points.</p>
      <p>Some of his players have thrived in that environment, others have found it harder, but with the international break upon us Blues writer Brian Dick rates them for their bodies of work so far.</p>
      <p>We’ve focused on the players who have appeared in at least half the games.</p>

      <h3>Lee Camp 5.5</h3>
      <p>The season is three months old, so it’s important not to merely reflect recent slips.</p>
      <p>Without being spectacular Camp was solid enough throughout the first half of the campaign, with particularly important saves against Bristol City and Charlton.</p>
      <p>However, errors against Derby, Wigan and most recently Fulham are set against good stops in the wins over Blackburn and Luton and reignited the debate about <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> ’ best goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 16</b>

      </figure>
      <h3>Maxime Colin 9.5</h3>
      <p>Probably had more defending to do that in many other games this season against Fulham - but despite that he has arguably been the chief beneficiary of the emphasis on attack.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt this already highly-regarded right back is enjoying his best season at Birmingham City. One very good goal and three assists to his name so far, with more to come. The gold standard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 14</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Harlee Dean 6.5</h3>
      <p>Started as though he was still feeling the effects of the groin trouble that bothered him towards the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, looked to have settled in recent weeks, helped no doubt by the growing assurance of Marc Roberts.</p>
      <p>His suspension has opened the door to the equally composed Jake Clarke-Salter, though.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 15</b>

      </figure>
      <h3>Marc Roberts 8.5</h3>
      <p>Pep Clotet invested his trust in Roberts at the beginning of the season and he has not been let down.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old is another who is enjoying his finest campaign at Blues, though the previous two have hardly been stellar.</p>
      <p>He’s looking every inch the impressive Championship defender Blues thought they were getting in 2017.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Kristian Pedersen 8</h3>
      <p>Has had to adjust his game as much as anyone in the squad this season - and has exceeded the expectations of many.</p>
      <p>He has shown himself to be a threat in the opposition box, is attacking with increasing conviction and against Fulham led the charge for an equaliser.</p>
      <p>Apart from one slip against Luton and a little bit of bother with Anthony Knockaert, he’s largely been excellent.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Ivan Sunjic 9</h3>
      <p>Imposing and dynamic, Blues’ club record signing has thrived since bedding in.</p>
      <p>The destructive side to his game has gone up a level and he’s chipped in with two beautiful goals in the last half of this campaign.</p>
      <p>Used to playing as the sole holding midfielder he’s had to adapt to playing with a partner - but good players do that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 14 (1 sub)</b>

      </figure>
      <h3>Jude Bellingham 7.5</h3>
      <p>Strictly speaking his age should not be considered, if only because he is capable of playing with the authority of a senior professional. Equally you can’t ignore it.</p>
      <p>Bellingham has started the last six matches at the heart of Birmingham City’s team. There have been some demanding experiences, at Cardiff and Leeds and again against Fulham, but no experience is a bad one.</p>
      <p>He’s been handled well so far and has brought a reliable touch and energy to the middle of the park. It’s going to be important to mange his games in the next six weeks, though.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 8 (4)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Gary Gardner 6</h3>
      <p>Most of his starts came at the beginning of the season when the team was looking to find itself.</p>
      <p>His goal against Derby sparked what should have been another Pride Park miracle and he’s done reasonably well when he’s come off the bench</p>
      <p>Unfortunate to be pick up a freak injury at Leeds because he’d be a useful part of the match-day squad at the moment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances:5 (6)</b>
      </p>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article16734624.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_David-Davis-with-the-ball.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>David Davis 6</h3>
      <p>Tended to share time with Gardner in the early part of the season but has been restricted to bench duty since Bellingham’s emergence.</p>
      <p>Decent enough in his last start against Blackburn, albeit with a late slip, but with limited opportunities it’s been difficult to get into his stride.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 9 (1)</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Jacques Maghoma 6</h3>
      <p>Blues really miss him when he’s not available, if only off the bench. His ability to carry the ball upfield and his defensive diligence are important facets to Pep Clotet’s tool box.</p>
      <p>There’s loads of competition in the wide areas now but Maghoma’s experience has kept him around the squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 2 (7)</b>

        <figcaption>Birmingham City's Dan Crowley (Image: EMPICS Sport)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Dan Crowley 9</h3>
      <p>Until Bela arrived there was little question that Crowley’s transfer had been the most creative piece of business Blues have done this year.</p>
      <p>The sheer mechanics of the Bela deal might change that but what it won’t alter is the fact that Crowley is almost always in the top two of three rated players every week.</p>
      <p>His partnership with Maxime Colin is perhaps the most effective in the side - his ability to find space and dictate play has been a pleasure to watch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 13 (2)</b>

      </figure>
      <h3>Fran Villalba 7</h3>
      <p>There have been times when the Spaniard has matched the standard set by Crowley on the opposite side of midfield.</p>
      <p>However, with both players it’s all about end product and there’s been marginally more of that from Crowley.</p>
      <p>The last couple of games have been frustrating with not enough quality on his shooting or delivery into the box.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 12 (2)</b>

      </figure>
      <h3>Alvaro Gimenez 6</h3>
      <p>Has dropped out of the team since the last international break with Kerim Mrabti stepping up as Lukas Jutkiewicz’s strike partner.</p>
      <p>He started the season with excellent intent, his goal against Barnsley was superbly taken, but he’s found it difficult to add to his sole strike.</p>
      <p>Coming off the bench he has shown good intent, without applying the finishing touch he is clearly so desperately craving.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 7 (7)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Kerim Mrabti (Image: TIM EASTHOPE/BIRMINGHAM MAIL)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Kerim Mrabti 6</h3>
      <p>Came into the season with a good opportunity but plenty to prove - and he had to wait for his chance to do that.</p>
      <p>The door has opened in recent weeks and Mrabti has shown good mobility and endeavour - but he really could do with a goal after failing to convert from a few feet out against Cardiff.</p>
      <p>There have been two or three really promising displays of  late but we’re still waiting for that truly commanding one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Appearances: 6 (2)</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17152975.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS196936941.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Lukas Jutkiewicz 7</h3>
      <p>For all the evolutionary play around him Blues still rely heavily on the aerial and physical prowess of their 30-year-old target man.</p>
      <p>He’s got four goals this season, all with his head - but could have had more, hitting the underside of the bar against Blackburn, a tap in against Luton and a penalty against Derby.</p>
      <p>He occupies defenders and Pep Clotet wouldn’t be without him, the arrival of Bela and return to fitness of Jefferson Montero could be just what he needs.</p>
      <p>
