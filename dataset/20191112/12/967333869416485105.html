        <b>NASA has been reportedly gearing up for planetary defense from asteroid impact for years, while a recent survey showing Americans prefer a space program that focuses on potential asteroid impacts over sending humans back to the Moon or to Mars</b>
      </p>
      <p>Several asteroids zooming towards planet Earth at breakneck speed are expected to make “close approaches” to Earth on 12 November, NASA’s <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/">asteroid tracking system</a> has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The asteroids are estimated to arrive within hours of one another, starting at 4.54 a.m. GMT.</p>
      <p>According to NASA’s Centre for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS), the first asteroid that will approach Earth is called 2019 VW1, travelling at a speed of about 19,000 miles per hour, and estimated to be about 44 meters wide.</p>
      <p>The second asteroid to zoom in on Earth on Tuesday is identified as 2019 VK3 and has a diameter of 43 meters. </p>
      <p>Trailing behind 2019 VK3 is <a href="https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/">2019 VN2, which is only about 24 meters wide</a>.</p>
      <p>The fourth asteroid is called 2019 UB14 and is estimated to be about 38 meters wide.</p>
      <p>The agency noted that it is currently moving towards Earth at a speed of 35,000 miles per hour.</p>
      <p>NASA has dubbed the speedy rocks Near-Earth Objects or NEO asteroids, which are comets and asteroids that orbit the Sun from a distance of 1.3 astronomical units.</p>

      <p>NASA said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Some asteroids and comets follow orbital paths that take them much closer to the Sun and therefore Earth – than usual. If a comet’s or asteroid’s approach brings it to within 1.3 astronomical units of the Sun, we call it a Near-Earth object.”</blockquote>
      <p>As NASA keeps a watchful eye on these space rocks to evaluate their potential for impact, according to a 2018 report put together by Planetary.org, there are more than 18,000 NEOs.</p>
      <p>"Potentially hazardous" NEOs are defined as space objects that come within 0.05 astronomical units and measure more than 460 feet in diameter, according to NASA.</p>

      <p>NASA has been reportedly preparing for planetary defence from asteroid strikes for years, with a <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/news/articles/2019-06-20/poll-tracking-asteroids-a-favored-focus-for-space-program">June AP-NORC poll</a> finding that Americans prefer that the space agency focus on tracking potential asteroid threats rather than sending humans back to the Moon or to Mars.</p>
      <p>Last June, the space agency unveiled a 20-page plan that detailed the steps the US should take to be better prepared for NEOs – such as asteroids and comets – that come within 30 million miles of the planet.</p>
      <p>Separately in April, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910161077059775-nasa-unveils-new-spacesuits-for-future-moon-missions---video/">NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said</a> that an asteroid strike is not something to be taken lightly and is perhaps Earth's biggest threat.</p>
