      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's highest paid stars ever - Caitlyn Jenner, Noel Edmonds, Amir Khan and Katie Price</h1>
      <h2>Jenner, who was born Bruce and was an Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete before finding TV fame on the series Keeping Up With The Kardashians, revealed her identity as a trans woman in April 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:21:52+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Emmeline Saunders, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner will take part in this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! after reports that she has been paid a sizeable fee to enter the jungle.</p>
      <p>Jenner, 70, is widely reported to be one of the highest-paid celebrities to ever take part in the show, with various outlets suggesting she will earn about £500,000.</p>
      <p>Jenner, who was born Bruce and was an Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete before finding TV fame on the series Keeping Up With The Kardashians, revealed her identity as a trans woman in April 2015.</p>
      <p>She was previously married to Kris Jenner, the mother of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian, and has daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner with her.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/highest-paid-im-celebrity-stars-20666172">Mirror Online</a> reports 2013 series was considered to be the lowest paying season , with bosses shelling out a relatively miserly £100,000 for winner Kian Egan.</p>
      <p>Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington got £80,000 followed by TOWIE's Joey Essex on £60,000.</p>
      <p>Model Amy Willerton - who hooked up with Joey in the jungle - earned £25,000, less than half what Helen Flanagan was believed to have received the previous year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Snooker champion Steve Davis took home just £30,000 and Prince of Bel Air star turned Strictly judge Alfonso Ribeiro signed up for a slim cheque of £40,000.</p>
      <p>Emmerdale's Lucy Pargeter, who plays Chas Dingle, and former chat show host Matthew Wright both took home £50,000 from that series.</p>
      <p>But who has been among the highest-paid I'm A Celebrity contestants? Here's just some of the big earners.</p>
      <h3>Noel Edmonds</h3>

      <p>Noel was the surprise bombshell arrival in the I'm A Celebrity 2018 camp, having jetted in after the 10 original campmates had settled in.</p>
      <p>The Deal Or No Deal host pocketed a whopping £600,000 for signing up - but bosses didn't get nearly enough of their money's worth.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Noel was the first celebrity to be voted out, just nine days after he was parachuted in.</p>
      <p>Despite his brief appearance, Noel still managed to ruffle feathers when he was declared Emperor of the camp and started bossing his fellow stars around.</p>
      <h3>Harry Redknapp</h3>

      <p>The reigning King of the Jungle won hearts and minds across the nation in 2018 for his poignant devotion to wife Sandra Redknapp, his willingness to get stuck in with the camp tasks, and for always retaining his sense of humour.</p>
      <p>He was a huge signing for ITV bosses, and was lured by a £500,000 cheque in exchange for giving up all his creature comforts.</p>
      <p>Harry, who had professed to never watching the show in his life, lost over a stone during his time in the jungle - but was more than rewarded by being voted the winner by jubilant fans.</p>
      <p>And bookies had to pay out £10million to viewers who had backed him from the very beginning - making Harry the most popular I'm A Celebrity star of all time.</p>
      <h3>Amir Khan</h3>

      <p>Boxing champ Amir set records in 2017 for being the show's highest-paid celebrity to date - a record that was broken just 12 months later.</p>
      <p>The Olympic boxer got £400,000 for his jungle stint, which was marred by allegations of bullying against radio presenter Iain Lee.</p>
      <p>Amir hit headlines when he talked Iain into taking the blame for them snaffling the strawberries won in the Dingo Dollar challenge.</p>
      <p>He allowed the other campmates to think Iain had been the brains behind the evil deed, and threw him under the bus despite being caught red-handed on camera.</p>
      <p>Amir later confessed to Ant and Dec that he'd nicked the strawberries because he knew nobody would suspect him over Iain.</p>
      <h3>Katie Price</h3>

      <p>Katie remains the only celeb to have done I'm a Celeb twice - once in 2004, where she famously met her first husband Peter Andre, then again in 2009 for the princely fee of £450,000.</p>
      <p>The glamour model out-earned every single other star in the camp that year, with everyone else on £65,000.</p>
      <p>But she had it written into her contract that she'd be in the jungle for a week less than her campmates, prompting accusations of favouritism by ITV bosses.</p>
