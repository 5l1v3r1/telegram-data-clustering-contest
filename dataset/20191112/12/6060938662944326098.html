      <h1>Bhuvneshwar Kumar trains with Indian squad to test fitness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:34:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>INDORE: Recovering from a hamstring injury and a side strain, pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bhuvneshwar-kumar">Bhuvneshwar Kumar</a> assessed himself for a comeback when he participated in a "skill session" during Indian team's practice ahead of the series-opener against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>The Indian team management seems to have taken charge of Bhuvneshwar's final phase of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>Bhuvneshwar's injury has been a concern for the Indian team since he came back from the West Indies after the limited overs series. He followed a rehabilitation programme at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Cricket-Academy">National Cricket Academy</a>.</p>
      <p>"Bhuvi is here for a skill session with the team. The team management just wants him to get into the groove," a team source said when enquired about the pacer's presence at the net session.</p>
      <p>He had a catching session with fielding coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/R-Sridhar">R Sridhar</a> and then participated briefly in the net session. He bowled a few deliveries from full run-up but it was evident that he wasn't going full tilt.</p>
      <p>However Bhuvneshwar's presence at the session is welcome news considering that the 29-year-old is still an important member as far as India's white ball cricket is concerned.</p>
      <p>With Khaleel Ahmed a work in progress and pace spearhead <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jasprit-bumrah">Jasprit Bumrah</a>'s workload a priority for the team management, a fit-again Bhuvneshwar is a necessity in this set-up with his experience and variations in the shortest format.</p>
      <p>While the team management remained tight-lipped, Bhuvneshwar's presence also indicated that physio Nitin Patel and trainer Nick Webb might have a bigger role to play in the near future as far as his return to full fitness is concerned.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) has attracted a lot of negative publicity for its transformation from a 'centre of excellence' to a "rehab centre for the injured" according to insiders in the BCCI.</p>
      <p>Physio Ashish Kaushik's performance has already been under the scanner. There have been reports that many reputed players are not ready to take the NCA route for rehabilitation.</p>
