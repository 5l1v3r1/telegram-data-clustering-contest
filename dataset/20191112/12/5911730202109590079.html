      <p>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) â€” A Florida woman is accused of setting fire to her boyfriend's home after catching him cheating.</p>
      <p>Citing an arrest report, the Pensacola News Journal reports 47-year-old Tyetha Moore was standing in the driveway of the unoccupied home when firefighters arrived on Nov. 7. She told a battalion chief that she recently moved out of the home after catching her boyfriend cheating.</p>

      <p>The report says neighbors told firefighters that Moore had borrowed a water bottle of gasoline from them earlier in the day. They told firefighters that they watched Moore climb over a fence into the home's backyard and try to remove a window screen. It says the neighbors later saw Moore leave the backyard with an empty water bottle.</p>
      <p>Moore was arrested last week and charged with first-degree arson.</p>
