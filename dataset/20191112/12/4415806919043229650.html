      <p>Alec Baldwin’s wife Hilaria has suffered a miscarriage, her second this year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Baldwin told her followers on Instagram that she and the actor are “devastated” after learning at her scheduled pregnancy scan that their unborn baby had died at four months.</p>
      <p>The couple lost another child in April this year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Baldwin, 35, posted a video of herself being hugged by her daughter Carmen and wrote: “We are very sad to share that today we learned that our baby passed away at 4 months.</p>

      <p>“We also want you to know that even though we are not ok right now, we will be. We are so lucky with our 4 healthy babies – and we will never lose sight of this.</p>
      <p>“I told Carmen and took this so I could send it to Alec. I guess this is a good way to share it with you too.</p>
      <p>“I told her that this baby isn’t going to come after all … but we will try very hard to give her a little sister another time.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I’m really devastated right now … I was not expecting this when I went to my scan today. I don’t know what else to say … I’m still in shock and don’t have this all quite clear. Please no paparazzi … that’s all I ask.”</p>
      <p>The news came one month after the couple revealed that they were expecting a girl.</p>
      <p>Hollywood star Baldwin, 61, and his yoga instructor wife are parents to daughter Carmen, six, and sons Rafael, four, Leonardo, three, and one-year-old Romeo.</p>
      <p>Baldwin also has a 24-year-old daughter, Ireland, from his previous marriage to Kim Basinger.</p>
