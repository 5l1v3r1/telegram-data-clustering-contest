      <p>I don’t know if you know this, but Moby is vegan. And while most vegans <i>never</i> talk about their veganism, that Moby is a real maverick. A couple of months ago, in anticipation of his 32-year vegan anniversary, he <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058618/moby-neck-tattoo-vegan-for-life/news/">got a big “VEGAN FOR LIFE” tattoo on his neck</a>. And now that November has rolled around and he’s <i>officially</i> been vegan for 32 years, he’s decided to go even less subtle with his vegan tattoo game, getting “ANIMAL RIGHTS” in giant letters down both of his arms.</p>
      <p>“As November is my 32 year vegan anniversary i thought i’d get a tattoo (well, technically 12 tattoos) to celebrate,” Moby wrote in a post debuting the new ink on Instagram. “I’m a vegan animal rights activist for many reasons, but ultimately because i believe at the core of my being that every animal has the right to live their own life, according to their own will.
