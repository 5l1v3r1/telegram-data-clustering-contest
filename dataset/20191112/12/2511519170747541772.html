      <h1>Stella McCartney removes Meghan Markle Remembrance Instagram post after backlash</h1>
      <h2>Fashion designer's post was described as 'disrespectful' and 'tacky' by Instagram users</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:00:48+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sabrina Barr</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/StellaMcCartney">Stella McCartney</a> has deleted an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a> post in which she said she felt “honoured” the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/duchess-of-sussex">Duchess of Sussex</a> wore one of her designs to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/remembrance-sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> service.</p>
      <p>On Sunday 10 November, the duchess and other members of the royal family attended a ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial in London to pay their respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict.</p>
      <p>McCartney <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/meghan-markle-remembrance-sunday-stella-mccartney-coat-instagram-criticism-a9197916.html">shared a photograph</a> on Instagram of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/meghan-markle">Meghan</a> taken during the ceremony, stating that the royal was wearing a coat from her eponymous label’s autumn 2019 collection.</p>
      <p>While some Instagram users praised the designer’s garment, others expressed their anger over the post, saying that it was “disrespectful” for her to promote her clothing on such a sombre occasion.</p>
      <p>Following the backlash McCartney received, she has now deleted the picture from the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a> platform.</p>

      <p>Prior to deleting the post, Stella McCartney was unable to provide a comment when contacted by <i>The Independent</i>.</p>
      <p>One Instagram user said it was “just wrong” for McCartney to advertise her design on social media on Remembrance Day.</p>
      <p>Another person said they found the post “extremely tacky”, while someone else stated that they felt “really surprised, shocked, saddened and disappointed” with regards to the situation.</p>
      <p>In addition to the now-deleted Meghan post, McCartney also shared a video on Instagram of poppies in a field in commemoration of Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Remembering the ones that sacrificed to give us freedom,” the designer wrote in the caption.</p>
