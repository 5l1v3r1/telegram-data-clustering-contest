      </ul>
      <p>Fans on Twitter have been speculating as to where the series might go, and believe that there is a mole for the Whisperers somewhere within Alexandria.</p>
      <p>One fan believes that Siddiq the doctor could be the mole, writing: “The Whisperers are poisoning their water with the walker blood to weaken them (water Siddiq jumped in in promo).</p>
      <p>“Negan’s bringing war to Alpha as he continues to bond with Lydia. Siddiq is Alpha’s mole as he has PTSD of killing his friends.”</p>

      <p>Another agrees that Siddiq’s supposed PTSD is a cover for his new operation. “I still think he’s a mole for the Whisperers. He’s not struggling with PTSD, it’s good old fashioned guilt is driving him mad!”</p>

      <p>“My theory is that saddiq is a mole for the whisperers,” a third fan added. “I think that’s why alpha let him live so he could feed her information on when they cross her border and the reason I think he agreed is cuz she Threatened Rosita &amp; coco so yeah my theory.”</p>
