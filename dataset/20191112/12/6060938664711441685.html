      <p>CHENNAI: Mumbai defeated <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Puducherry">Pondicherry</a> by 27 runs in their Syed Mushtaq Ali Group D clash in Mumbai on Tuesday. Taking first strike, the hosts scored 171 for 6 riding skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/suryakumar-yadav">Suryakumar Yadav</a>'s 37-ball 57. Mumbai's top-order comprising <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jay-Bista">Jay Bista</a> (29), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aditya-Tare">Aditya Tare</a> (20) and Shreyas Iyer (19) got starts but failed to capitalise on it.</p>
      <p>Surya looked in good touch from the start. In the company of Siddhesh Lad (39, 4x4, 2x6), Surya added 65 for the fourth wicket from 39 deliveries to help Mumbai post a stiff total. The Mumbai skipper's innings contained 6 fours and 2 sixes.</p>
      <p>For Pondicherry, medium-pacer Sagar Trivedi was the pick of the lot - taking 4 for 29.</p>
      <p>In reply, Pondy were 29 for 2 before opener KB Arun Karthick (27) and Paras Dogra (45) steadied their innings. Once Karthick departed, Paras teamed up with Subramanian Anand (39) to keep Pondy in the chase. The two added 51 for the fourth wicket to help their side cross the 100-run mark. However, once the two were dismissed, Pondy's chase fizzled out. For the winning side, left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (2 for 25) and medium-pacer Tushar Deshpande (2 for 29) were the standout performers.</p>
      <p>Pondy will take on Haryana next on Thursday.</p>
      <p><b>Brief scores:</b> Mumbai 171 for 6 in 20 overs (Suryakumar Yadav 57, Siddhesh Lad 39; Sagar Trivedi 4 for 29). Pondicherry 144 for 7 in 20 overs (KB Arun Karthick 27, P Dogra 45, S Anand 39; Mulani 2 for 25, Tushar 2 for 29). Mumbai won by 27 runs</p>
