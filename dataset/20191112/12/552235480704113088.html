      <h1>Ross McCrorie in Rangers return as parent club run the rule over Portsmouth loanee</h1>
      <h2>The defender has been ruled out for between four and six weeks with a hamstring injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:15:30+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Ross McCrorie has returned to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> to begin his recovery from a hamstring injury he suffered with Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-u21s-football-team">Scotland-21</a> star has been ruled out for between four and six weeks as he was forced off in a man-of-the-match performance against Oxford United.</p>
      <p>McCrorie had already been set to travel north of the border to link up with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scot-gemmill">Scot Gemmill</a> 's side during the international break.</p>
      <p>And so the Ibrox club opted to carry out the initial diagnosis themselves as he starts his rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old will return to Fratton Park, however, as he looks to finish off his loan spell in stule once he regains full fitness.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/portsmouth-fc">Portsmouth</a> boss Kenny Jackett said: "He went into Rangers for a scan and an initial assessment.</p>
      <p>"He’ll be doing all of his rehab here. Ross was going up anyway to meet up with the Scotland under-21s.</p>
      <p>"He got an initial assessment from his parent club.</p>
      <p>"But, similarly, they’ve been in touch already and we’re pretty similar in our views of where it is.</p>
      <p>"It’s quite a straightforward injury. He’ll be coming back here to do his rehab.</p>
      <p>"Once things settle down for him a little bit then he’ll get back to work next week."</p>

      <p>McCrorie's time at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/portsmouth-fc">Portsmouth</a> has been a mixed bag with the versatile defender in and out of the first team.</p>
      <p>But he started to show his potential in recent weeks, starring at right-back, and it seemed like he was going to kick on for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Jackett said following the Oxford game he was delighted with McCrorie's performance and his progress in recent weeks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: "He brought a lot to our game and is learning all the time. In terms of bookings, he has to be careful and learn from that – and he can and will keep improving.</p>
      <p>"He has found his feet now, there have been quite a number of changes in the summer and he is one of them. I am pleased with him.</p>
      <p>"We persevered with him and there is a player there, definitely."</p>
