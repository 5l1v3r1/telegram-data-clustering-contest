      <p>It looks like Leanna could be expecting after she throws up the morning after pill after sleeping with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>David reveals to Leyla that paedophile <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a>, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-grossed-out-by-sleazy-maya-as-she-tries-to-have-sex-with-jacob-in-classroom/">who groomed their son Jacob</a>, is being released from prison leaving her worried she may try to contact the teen.</p>
      <p>They make the decision to tell Jacob about Maya's release and they are surprised at how composed he is.</p>

      <p>Afterwards, Jacob begins to act distant and quickly leaves, leaving Leanna upset.</p>
      <p>She later decides to tell her dad's fiancée Bernice about sleeping with Jacob, but the beautician is left conflicted when Leanna asks her not to tell her dad Liam.</p>
      <p>However when Leanna throws up in front of Liam as a result of taking the morning after pill, Bernice is forced to come clean and tell her soon-to-be husband about Leanna and Jacob.</p>
