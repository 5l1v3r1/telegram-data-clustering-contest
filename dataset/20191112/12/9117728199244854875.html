      <p>With just two Grands Prix to go, the current gap between McLaren and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> is 38 points, with the unofficial title of best of the rest on the line. To mathematically confirm fourth place, McLaren would have to outscore Renault by seven points, with 44 points being the maximum amount of points available during a single race.</p>

      <p>Sainz, who sits in seventh place himself in the drivers' championship, knows this Sunday at Interlagos could be the final nail in the coffin to seal fourth position for his team, as he is still battling <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alexander Albon</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> for P6 individually.</p>
      <p><i>"The season is not over yet, with two more races to go, and there are still many points to fight for," </i>the 25-year-old said in his preview of this weekend's action in Sao Paulo.</p>

        <i>"Confirming our fourth place in the constructors’ championship is the target and I'll push hard until the end for that sixth place in the drivers’ championship, despite the difficulty of the task!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>With Albon sitting in the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> in sixth place, although the difference is just four points, you'd think it would take a mistake from Albon for Sainz to claim sixth place.</p>
