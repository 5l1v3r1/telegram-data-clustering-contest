      <h1>Joe Gomez asked Gareth Southgate not to punish Raheem Sterling over canteen bust-up</h1>
      <h2>Raheem Sterling will not be considered for England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro on Thursday after his clash with Joe Gomez</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:25:59+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:25</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Joe Gomez urged England manager Gareth Southgate not to punish Raheem Sterling following their bust-up at the Three Lions' training ground on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward Sterling will not be considered for England's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro on Thursday after a row with Liverpool defender Gomez.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed towards the end of City's 3-1 Anfield loss to Liverpool on Sunday and it is understood Sterling and Gomez were again involved in an exchange after meeting up for England duty on Monday.</p>
      <p>Both sides have played down the physical side of the row and they have made peace with Gomez believed to have told Southgate to brush the incident under the carpet without any punishment.</p>

      <p>But Southgate and FA chiefs decided that Sterling will miss Thursday's encounter, although the star may be considered for action in the Euro 2020 qualifier with Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Gomez appeared to have a small mark from the bust-up as the Three Lions stars, including Sterling, trained at St George's Park on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sterling, a former Liverpool player, has taken to social media to play down the incident.</p>
      <p>He wrote on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account: "First and foremost everyone knows what that game means to me! Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point. Both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>

      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions got the better of me."</p>
      <p>Sterling added that he and Gomez "are good" and "both understand it was a 5-10 second thing it's done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is.</p>
      <p>"Let's focus on our game on Thursday," he signed off, alongside three love heart emojis.</p>
      <p>England trained at St George's Park on Tuesday following the latest round of Premier League fixtures, which culminated in Sunday's highly-anticipated clash between leaders Liverpool and defending champions City.</p>

      <p>Sterling and Gomez were involved in an on-field argument during that match and there was another exchange between the pair after linking up with England, leading the Football Association to release a statement on Monday night.</p>
      <p>A statement read: "The FA can confirm Raheem Sterling will not be considered for Thursday's EURO 2020 qualifier against Montenegro as a result of a disturbance in a private team area at St. George's Park today. He will remain with the squad."</p>
      <p>It is a remarkable situation and is sure to dominate the build-up to Thursday's Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro, which not only offers the chance to seal progress but is England's 1,000th international fixture.</p>
      <p>England boss Southgate said: "We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday.</p>

      <p>"One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we've been able to separate club rivalries from the national team.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday's game were still raw. My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken.</p>
      <p>"Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it's important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night."</p>
