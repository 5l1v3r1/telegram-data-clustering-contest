      <h1>Rocket sirens blare in Israel after top Islamic Jihad commander killed in Gaza</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:20:49+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Multiple rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip Tuesday after Israel killed a top commander of the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad early Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Baha Abu al Atta, 42, a leader in the Islamic Jihad group, <a href="https://apnews.com/9e45c7e17abf4275a9dc54e1c90cce5b">was killed</a> in a rare targeted airstrike in a residence in Gaza. Al Atta is accused of being behind recent rocket attacks against towns in southern Israel, and the Israeli military <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-50386164">said</a> in a statement after al Atta’s death that the “next attack was imminent.”</p>
      <p>“He was in the midst of plotting additional attacks these very days,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “He was a ticking bomb.”</p>
      <p>Al Atta was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-november-12-2019/">reportedly</a> killed alongside his wife while sleeping in an operation carried out as to avoid civilian casualties. Two of their children were wounded.</p>

      <p>Netanyahu <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-blast/israeli-forces-kill-islamic-jihad-field-commander-in-gaza-strike-idUSKBN1XM08E">authorized</a> the pre-dawn attack against al Atta, blaming him for rocket, drone, and sniper attacks against the country.</p>
      <p>A statement from Israeli officials called him a "ticking bomb" who was responsible for most of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s activity in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>Islamic Jihad, known as PIJ, is a separate terrorist organization from Hamas, which is the larger militant group controlling Gaza, and is backed by Iran.</p>
      <p>Public events and classes at schools in southern Israel were canceled in fear of PIJ retaliation after al Atta was killed. Authorities warned those in the area to remain vigilant and stay close to bomb shelters for fear of escalation.</p>
      <p>The Israel Defense Forces sent out a photo al Atta after his death, writing, “We just targeted Islamic Jihad commander in Gaza, Baha Abu Al Ata. Al Ata was directly responsible for hundreds of terror attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. His next attack was imminent.”</p>
