      <p>Now, the teaser for the second season recently aired showing beautifully captured shots of Pakistan. “Back with a second season, because our stories matter,” the caption of the trailer read.</p>
      <p>Beginning with an overhead shot of the Arabian sea into Karachi, the teaser narrated, “We are so glad Kanwal you could come see us today. Sorry, did you have to sit too long in the waiting room? No it’s ok. We are going through your proposal and don’t get me wrong, I think your intentions are great.”</p>
      <p>“But we don’t see how this would work. I mean, do people really have time to listen to each other’s stories anymore?” The narrator continued, “So isn’t that what can change, should change, I mean when did our stories stop being so important?’</p>

      <p>The images continued to depict a story as the voice over questioned Kanwal on the importance of telling people’s stories. “When we are growing up, other people’s stories are told to us. Her straight A’s. His ideal in-laws. Her amazing style. His perfect job. I guess their meant to inspire us. But somewhere between these ideals and this perception of perfection, we begin to silence our ordinary selves.”</p>
      <p>“We begin to believe our stories don’t fit. That they don’t matter. But that is not true. The broken pieces of our fragile lives are worth piecing our scars, they tell the most beautiful truth.”</p>
      <p><i>Conversations With Kanwal</i> season 2 is set to return November 17.</p>
