      <p>Xbox One owners may spot a new "surprise me" button on their dashboard. Hit it, and your Xbox will suggest a random game from your library to play.</p>
      <p>The feature is currently available to those enrolled in Microsoft's Insider testing program. You'll find it within the My Games &amp; Apps section, next to the search and filter options.</p>
      <p>The option was first spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dv1x5w/new_surprise_merandom_game_icon_in_my_games_apps/">Reddit</a> user Filthy_Firestarter, who's enrolled in the Alpha Skip-Ahead test pool - one of the first to try new features.</p>
      <p>"It won't automatically launch a game," the user said. Instead, "it brings up a popup where you can launch from there". Handy, in case it picks something you forgot to delete and really don't want to play.</p>
