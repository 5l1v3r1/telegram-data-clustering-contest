      <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Telia won conditional EU antitrust approval on Tuesday for its $957 million bid for Bonnier Broadcasting, a deal the Swedish telecoms firm hopes will help it better compete with the likes of Netflix and Amazon.</p>

      <p>The European Commission said Telia had offered a series of concessions to address its concerns, including media plurality in Sweden and Finland, confirming a Reuters story on Sept. 2.</p>
      <p>“This acquisition creates a strong Nordic player who can compete with international corporations who are very active in the Nordics,” Telia chairman Marie Ehrling said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Telia pledged to offer rivals fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory access to its free-to-air and basic pay TV channels, as well as to premium pay TV sports channels in Sweden and Finland, the EU competition enforcer said.</p>
      <p>The company also agreed not to discriminate against rival telecom providers and TV distributors in the sale of TV advertising space on the merged entity’s channels.</p>
      <p>In addition, users will get access to the merged company’s streaming services over the internet, namely its AVOD and SVOD services. The pledges are valid for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Citi analysts said Bonnier’s traditional linear viewing model - where programs are viewed at set times - was under pressure from the rise of video-on-demand services.</p>
      <p>“Telia, itself, is in need to return the business to underlying growth. Given the investments required, dividend risk remains to the downside in our view,” they said in a research note.</p>
      <p>Telia, which expects the transaction to close on Dec. 2, said it still expected synergies from the deal from 2020, with a full run-rate of 600 million Swedish crowns ($61.8 million) in 2022.</p>
      <p>It also expects integration costs of 400 million crowns in 2020-2021, and an impact on operational free cash flow in 2020 of around 500 million.</p>
      <p>The deal is politically sensitive since the Swedish government - owner of 38.35% of Telia’s shares - already controls Sweden’s public service television network SVT.</p>
      <p>Bonnier’s brands include Sweden’s biggest commercial broadcaster TV4, streaming service C More and Finland’s MTV.</p>
      <p>Telia last month appointed Allison Kirkby, the head of Danish telecoms company TDC, as its new chief executive to lead its continuing expansion in television.</p>
