      <p>In another tweet, Gurman suggested the announcement will be made by Wednesday. The news would likely be shared in the form of a press release on the Apple Newsroom and would also likely coincide with early hands-on impressions of the 16-inch MacBook Pro from select media outlets and YouTube channels.</p>

      <p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/11/16-inch-macbook-pro-hands-on-event/"><i>9to5Mac</i></a> recently reported that Apple appears to be holding private press briefings of some kind at its luxury loft mansion in New York City this week, likely to facilitate those 16-inch MacBook Pro first impressions. Multiple out-of-town tech reporters have tweeted that they are in or headed to New York City over the last few days. <br/><br/>Rumors suggest the 16-inch MacBook Pro will feature slimmer bezels around the display, a more reliable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/kuo-16-inch-macbook-pro-scissor-keyboard/">scissor switch keyboard</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/30/16-inch-macbook-pro-touch-bar-layout/">a standalone Touch ID sensor</a>, and <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-inch-macbook-pro-possibly-referenced-in-macos-catalina-10-15-1-beta.2206447/post-27888304">possibly a much-requested physical Esc key</a>. Pricing is unknown, but would likely be higher than the $2,799 high-end 15-inch MacBook Pro. <br/><br/>For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/macbook-pro-vega-graphics-available/">15-inch MacBook Pro models with AMD Radeon Pro Vega graphics options</a> became available to order on the Wednesday of this week a year ago, along with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/apple-watch_productred-sport-loop/">(PRODUCT)RED version of the Apple Watch Sport Loop</a>. Apple also launched its annual <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/14/apple-holiday-2018-gift-guide/">holiday gift guide</a> on the same day. <br/><br/>After <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/17/16-inch-macbook-pro-2019-kuo/">rampant rumors</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/11/16-inch-macbook-pro-production-rumor/">supply chain clues</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/18/16-inch-macbook-pro-macos-10-15-1/">leaked imagery from macOS Catalina</a>, the 16-inch MacBook Pro might be 24 hours or less away.</p>
