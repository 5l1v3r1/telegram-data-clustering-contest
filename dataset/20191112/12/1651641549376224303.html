      <p>Samsung is preparing a second OneUI 2.0 Beta Update for Galaxy Note 10 smartphones and as per sources, the update is all set to arrive later this week.</p>
      <p>The OneUI 2.0 update <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/here-is-the-list-of-new-features-in-the-android-10-based-oneui-2-0-beta-update/">promised to bring plenty of interesting new features to supported Samsung smartphones</a> and these include Apple’s Slofie-like feature, dark mode, new camera UI design, and many more.</p>
      <p>That said, the rollout of these updates appeared to be region-specific, meaning that it might not be available for all beta testers across the world on the first day of its release.</p>
      <p>While Samsung is yet to make an official announcement as to when the company will start rolling out the OneUI 2.0 update to the public, rumors suggest that if all goes as planned, the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-may-deliver-android-10-and-oneui-2-0-for-its-flagships-this-year/">Android 10-based OneUI 2.0 update might arrive around Christmas 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>Aside from Samsung, other major players like ASUS, LG, Motorola, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Sony, Transsion, and Vivo are committed to releasing the Android 10 update by the end of this year. In other words, all the major players have promised to offer Android 10 to their customers by the end of this year.</p>
