      <h2>Sellers are trying out all sorts of tactics to try and tempt reluctant buyers into choosing their home over the others on the market - and now the exact time they're most likely to work has been calculated too</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:43:44+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>The best time to sell a home has been calculated as 1.51pm on a sunny Wednesday in March.</p>
      <p>That's according to research from Privilege Insurance, which also explored the tactics sellers are using to make their property more appealing to viewers.</p>
      <p>Head of Privilege Home Insurance Christian Mendes said: "Selling a home can be a very stressful ordeal, so it's great to see we have found the time when people are most likely to sell their home.</p>
      <p>"However, it's important not to under-estimate the impact of small home improvements such as a lick of paint, or a new piece of art on the walls, which can make all the difference when it comes to the finer details.</p>
      <p>"On the day people are due over to view, the fine aroma of freshly baked bread, or just-brewed coffee can be the ultimate clinchers to help seal the deal too - so it's definitely worth going the extra mile."</p>

      <p>Privilege worked out what was going on by asking people who'd successfully sold recently how they pulled it off in a slowing market.</p>
      <p>And people showed serious ingenuity to create an atmosphere designed to be welcoming to prospective buyers.</p>
      <p>On top of the basics like cleaning, sellers also admitted to clearing pets and children out of the way, buying fresh flowers, lighting candles and turning up the thermostat to make the place seem cosy.</p>
      <p>Smell was also key for many, with tactics ranging from the basic (opening windows) to brewing coffee or even baking break ahead of viewings.</p>

      <p>As well as small tricks, sellers also took more serious action.</p>
      <p>A quarter of sellers admitted to redecorating before putting their home on the market,Â  while others buy new art for the walls, new furniture for the rooms and a few go as far as renting an expensive telly to coincide with viewings.</p>
      <p>Looking to boost "kerb appeal" is also a priority, with new front doors bought, drives re-done and full-blown garage conversions on the list of changes sellers make.</p>
      <p>And those too busy to do the work themselves are even splashing out on the basics - with 6% of sellers paying for cleaners and 3% paying for gardeners to make sure their homes are in prime condidion.</p>
