      <p>E.on and RWE Renewables have agreed a two and a half year deal that will see E.on purchase the power output of 20 of its fellow German company’s British wind farms.</p>
      <p>The deal will help E.on provide renewable power to 3.3m UK homes. Earlier this year the energy giant announced that it was switching all of its British customers to a 100 per cent renewable supply, with no change in tariffs. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The wind farms have a capacity of 892 megawatts and include part of the London Array, the world’s second largest offshore wind farm.</p>
      <p>RWE Renewables is the newest subsidiary of RWE, and has an installed capacity of 9 gigawatts, with a further 2.6 under construction.</p>
      <p>E.on built the wind assets as part of its £3.3bn investment into the UK over the last decade, before transferring ownership to RWE in October.</p>
      <p>In return, E.on took over RWE’s stake in Essen-based Innogy.</p>
      <p>Michael Lewis, chief executive of E.on UK, said: “A significant element of our commitment to providing all our residential customers with renewable electricity – a change at a scale never seen before in Britain – was the fact we have invested more than £3.3bn in renewable energy in the UK in recent years.</p>
      <p>“We have now secured the power coming from all those wind farms, as well as similar arrangements we have with more than a dozen independent generators around the country, which means our customers can continue to enjoy an electricity supply backed by UK renewables.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Lewis added that the company would also try to help customers better manage their energy consumption by developing solutions such as heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers.</p>
      <p>RWE Renewables chief operating officer Tom Glover said:  “Great Britain, where we already operate  over 2,000 megawatts of renewable energy plants, is a very attractive market for RWE due to its well-functioning framework.</p>
