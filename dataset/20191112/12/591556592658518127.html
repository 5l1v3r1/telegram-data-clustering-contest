      <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX on Monday launched 60 more Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit, bringing the company's Starlink satellite broadband internet service closer to its planned mid-2020 go-live date for the US and Canada. </p>
      <p>The Monday launch of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, is one of six more launches required to deliver coverage to North America. It was the second Falcon 9 launch carrying a payload of 60 Starlink satellites.  <br/><br/>SpaceX launched the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-here-are-spacexs-first-60-starlink-internet-beaming-satellites/">first 60 "production design" Starlink satellites in May</a>, representing a small fraction of the 12,000 the Federal Communications Commission has approved Starlink to operate in space. Starlink may one day have as many as 30,000 Starlink satellites in operation. <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/exomedicine-arrives-how-labs-in-space-could-pave-the-way-for-healthcare-breakthroughs-on-earth/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Exomedicine arrives: How labs in space could pave the way for healthcare breakthroughs on Earth</b></a><b> (cover story PDF)</b><br/><br/>Elon Musk has said Space X needs about 400 satellites to provide "minor" coverage and 800 for "moderate" coverage of North America.</p>
      <p>The rocket company will be able to launch a global Starlink satellite broadband service after 24 additional launches, at which point the North American service is scheduled to be available. With 30 launches, SpaceX would have 1,800 Starlink satellites.    <br/><br/>Each compact Starlink satellite weighs 573lb (260kg) and features a solar array for power, an ion thruster propulsion system, navigation sensors, and four powerful antennas for beaming internet to Earth. </p>
      <p>The 60 satellites <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launch-spacex-set-to-launch-another-60-starlink-internet-satellites-2019-11-11/">onboard the Falcon 9 on Monday</a> were released about an hour after liftoff into a 174-mile-high (280km) orbit and then, using the onboard propulsion system, were moved into their operational position. Their orbit is lower than the May batch, which <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/elon-musk-here-are-spacexs-first-60-starlink-internet-beaming-satellites/">lacked the equipment necessary to create a mesh network</a>. <br/><br/>SpaceX says it has upgraded the design of the satellites since May to increase spectrum capacity and maximize their use of the Ka and Ku bands. <br/><br/>SpaceX promises to provide fast, reliable internet to areas with little or no connectivity, such as poorly served rural communities. <br/><br/>Assuming SpaceX meets its mid-2020 target, it could be ahead of the FCC's $1.98bn Connect America Fund (CAF) II rural broadband program, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-were-bringing-high-speed-broadband-to-9-million-in-us-hotspots/">which ISPs are rolling out over the next 10 years</a>. <br/><br/>According to Microsoft, 162 million people across the US, mostly in rural areas, don't have access to broadband speeds. The FCC estimates that number to be just 21 million.   <br/><br/><b>SEE: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fast-affordable-internet-from-the-sky-is-almost-here/">Fast, affordable internet from the sky is almost here</a></b><br/><br/>SpaceX hasn't determined pricing yet, but one group of consumers it will target are those who currently pay $80 for a poor broadband service, SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/fast-affordable-internet-from-the-sky-is-almost-here/">said last month</a>.   <br/><br/>SpaceX and the US Air Force Research Laboratory have demonstrated a 610Mbps connection to the cockpit of an inflight US military C-12 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. But the plan is to deliver to 1Gbps per user with low latency, projected to be around 25ms.<br/><br/>SpaceX will also require users to install a "beautiful" user terminal, but it's not known yet whether it will be a standalone device or serve as a cable modem/router.  </p>
