      <p>The widow of Rep. Elijah Cummings revealed she is planning to run for her husband's vacant Maryland congressional seat.</p>
      <p>Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, 48, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/elijah-cummings-wife-admits-shes-thinking-carefully-about-running-for-late-husbands-congressional-seat">confirmed her intent to run for Maryland's 7th Congressional District</a> during a Monday night interview on <i>The Rachel Maddow Show.</i></p>
      <p>"Tomorrow, I will announce that I will be running for the Congress, the 7th Congressional District of Maryland. I believe very strongly that I have the background and the focus and the commitment and the ability to take the reins and to make a good run for this seat," she said.</p>
      <p>"I've fought right alongside Elijah for the last 12 years and we knew each other another 10 years before that," she continued. "So, I've been on this path for fighting for the soul of our democracy, for fighting for healthcare, education, for a better America for all."</p>
      <p>She went on to explain that her late husband was advocating for her to replace him before his death last month, saying, "He wanted me to continue this fight, and Iâ€™m going to continue this fight and run the race and prayerfully win."</p>

Two others have announced campaigns to replace Cummings, while over a half a dozen are considering joining the race. She previously worked in politics when she was chief of staff for former Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York.</p>
