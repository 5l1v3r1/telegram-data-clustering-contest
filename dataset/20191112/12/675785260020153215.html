      <h1>'Predatory' Uber driver who sexually assaulted vomiting passenger jailed</h1>
      <h2>Temur Shah, 45, denied assaulting the victim in the incident which happened in January 2018, but was convicted after a one week Crown Court trial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:02:16+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">David Coleman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-coleman/</a></address>
      <p>An Uber driver who sexually assaulted his vomiting passenger has been jailed for 16 months.</p>
      <p>Temur Shah, 45, insisted the woman sat next to him on the front passenger seat when he picked her up in London's West End in the early hours of January 15, 2018.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old victim told Shah she was going to be sick and when she leaned out of the door, he groped her intimately.</p>
      <p>He continued to sexually assault her as she vomited onto the pavement in an attack that has been described as "disgusting".</p>
      <p>Shah's victim had no money or charge on her phone battery and the pervert refused to let her go, Isleworth Crown Court previously heard. </p>
      <p>She told him not to touch her again and she finally escaped his clutches near her home in north London before contacting police.</p>

      <p>The Taxi and Private Hire Policing Team then conducted enquiries with Uber and the person who booked the private hire vehicle on the victim's behalf.</p>
      <p>They also collected an extensive amount of CCTV and viewed GPS data from Uber.</p>
      <p>Shah, of Harrow, northwest London, was convicted of sexual assault after a one-week trial.</p>
      <p>Hugh D'Aguilar, defending, told the court that Shah was "fearful of going to prison" as he looked after his three children and his elderly mother during the day while his wife was at work.</p>
      <p>Shah's mother sat in court alongside other members of his family, who wept as the sentence was read out.</p>
      <p>Judge Nicholas Wood said that the offence was aggravated by the fact that it had taken place in the early hours of the morning in an area of London that the victim did not know.</p>
      <p>"As she herself said 'what was she to do?' Her escape route was very limited," he said.</p>
      <p>Judge Wood added that he was mindful of the effect that a custodial sentence would have on Shah's family, but that time in prison was unavoidable.</p>

      <p>"You had a young woman in your trust, in your cab, late at night. She was utterly defenceless as she turned away from you facing the gutter," he said.</p>
      <p>Shah, of Park Crescent, Harrow, was sentenced to 16 months imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Speaking after Shah was convicted, Mandy McGregor, Head of Transport Policing and Community Safety at TfL, said: "This attack on a vulnerable passenger was predatory and disgusting, and we are pleased to see that Shah has been convicted</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank the young woman for coming forward and reporting this so TfL and the police could investigate and take action against the driver.</p>
      <p>"We expect the highest standards from TfL licensed taxi and private hire drivers.</p>
      <p>"Not only has Shah been convicted but immediate licensing action was taken to prevent him from continuing in his role as a TfL licensed private hire driver."</p>
