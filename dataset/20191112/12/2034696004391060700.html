      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>‘s support for <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> has been criticised by a preacher who held the rapper’s Sunday Service at his Atlantan megachurch.</p>
      <p>Pastor Jamal Bryant gave Kanye permission to host the event at the New Birth Missionary Baptist last month, which saw the likes of T.I. and 2 Chainz in attendance.</p>

      <p>It was later reported that Kanye donated a huge sum to Bryant’s church, but the preacher subsequently sent the sum to Morris Brown College – where West’s mother Donda worked as a professor.</p>
      <p>Bryant admitted that Kanye’s support of Donald Trump meant he was unable to accept the money.</p>

      <p>Now, Bryant has also admitted that he finds West’s political views to be “indigestible”.</p>
      <p>“Kanye west project is incredible but his politics are indigestible,” Bryant captioned an Instagram video.</p>
      <p>“The message after the music is just as important. Jesus is king and Trump is a jester. Our theology doesn’t match this administrations politics…the revolution won’t be televised.”</p>
      <p>It comes weeks after Kanye released ‘Jesus Is King’, which sees him experimenting with gospel music for the first time in his career.</p>
      <p>Last week, he also said he is <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-wants-to-change-his-name-to-christian-genius-billionaire-kanye-west-2565854">considering changing his name to “Christian Genius Billionaire Kanye West</a>” for a year and confirmed plans to run for president in 2024.</p>
