      <p>The Committee of Creditors (CoC) of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/il-fs">IL&amp;FS </a>has approved the sale of the IL&amp;FS’s Education business – School net India Limited which was formerly known as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/il-fs">IL&amp;FS </a>Education &amp; Technology Service. CoC has approved the sale to Career Point Publications Private Limited (CPPPL). The CoC of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/il-fs">IL&amp;FS </a>represented all the financial creditors of the group.</p>
      <p>The financial bid of CPPPL was approved by more than 78 per cent IL&amp;FS’s creditors by value. The voting was done electronically and concluded on November 5, 2019.</p>
      <p>The move is in tandem with the resolution plan submitted by the IL&amp;FS board to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai Bench.</p>
      <p>IL&amp;FS Group holds 73.7 per cent stake in School net India Limited (SIL); and School net India Limited holds 80 per cent stake in IL&amp;FS Skill Development Corporation (ISDC) and also has two subsidiaries - IL&amp;FS Cluster Development Initiative Limited (ICDI) and Skill Training Assessment Management Partners Limited (STAMP).</p>
      <p>“CPPPL (Career Points Publications) made a binding offer at an implied enterprise value whereby it shall assume responsibility for all the debt of School net India and IL&amp;FS Skills Development Corporation Ltd, in addition to paying a certain amount towards purchase of School net’s equity,” the release said.</p>
      <p>The group has to take NCLT approval for this.</p>
      <p>CPPPL also made a separate offer to purchase the businesses (including certain business debt) of two other subsidiaries of SIL, namely, ICDI and STAMP.</p>
      <p>After the collapse of the IL&amp;FS group in September 2018 government appointed a six-member board led by Uday Kotak managing director and chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The group crumbled down under massive debt and it also triggered a massive liquidity crunch among banks and non-banking financial <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>across the country.</p>
