      <p>A kind-hearted group of football fans from the Airdrie Supporters Trust are to be recognised in Westminster following their charitable trip from Monklands to Mongolia.</p>
      <p>The group spent 10 nights in the Asian country where they are donating five homes – locally known as gers – to families in need.</p>
      <p>Hannah Eaton and her uncle Stephen travelled in memory of Hannah’s dad Tom, who passed away in June following a battle with cancer, and they donated a ger in his name.</p>
      <p>The Monklands visitors also took part in a football tournament which raised funds for a cancer centre aiming to improve screening services.</p>
      <p>As part of the trust’s KitAid project, they also took football shirts, shorts, socks and boots, as well as tracksuits and training equipment.</p>
      <p>Trust members Dougy Allsop and Willie Marshall estimate they raised around £15,000 for various causes.</p>
      <p>Dougy said: “There was a good support network and everyone helped everyone out; it wasn’t an easy trip.”</p>
      <p>Willie added: “Everyone gelled. A lot of people didn’t know each other but they came together which was great to see.”</p>

      <p>Now the team will visit the House of Commons next month as guests of the Honorary Consul for Mongolia in Scotland, David Scott.</p>
      <p>Mr Scott said: “I commend the actions of the Airdrie Supporters Trust members. The donation of five gers to families in the Gobi desert, and in Ulaanbaatar is an act of life-changing generosity and care.</p>
      <p>“Further, the team funded a year of school supplies for families across the city and Gobi region, as well as supporting a number of disabled children.</p>
      <p>“The trust also took part in the Test for Life football tournament, raising several thousand pounds for the Mongolian cancer centre.</p>
      <p>“Most impressively of all, the team were tremendous ambassadors for Airdrie, epitomising the very finest aspects of people to people diplomacy.</p>
      <p>“The consulate remains indebted for their hard work and remains committed to supporting them in their admirable endeavours.”</p>
      <p>The Trust team plan to embark on a similar trip every August and hope to visit Namibia next year. The 20-person trip will be open to everyone – not just Airdrie fans and Trust members.</p>
      <p>Dougy added: “The plan now is to promote walking football and cost up school projects and donations for next year.”</p>
