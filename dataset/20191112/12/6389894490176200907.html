      <p>All gas production at the site, in which SDX owns a 55 per cent stake, will be sold to Egypt’s national gas company Egas.</p>
      <p>The company said that initial flow rates were in line with expectations and that SDX will gradually ramp up production with a view to achieving its targeted production rate of 50m standard feet per day in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>The firm also announced that interim chief executive Mark Reid had taken up the role permanently, with Nick Box becoming chief financial officer.</p>
      <p>Reid said: “The Company is pleased to announce the commencement of production at our South Disouq concession in Egypt. </p>
      <p>“Production, which is coming on stream in line with our previous guidance, will result in a material increase to Company’s cash flow going forward.  We look forward to providing the market with further updates in due course.”</p>
      <p>SDX’s primary focus is the Middle East and North Africa, with three producing assets across Egypt. </p>
      <p>Analysts at SP Angel welcomed the news, saying: “A plateau targeted gross production rate of 50MMscfe/d will provide the company with a material boost to operating cash flows ahead of a drilling campaign of up to five exploration wells in 2020 on the field. </p>

      <p>“These wells will target the same Abu Madi and Kafr el Sheik prospective horizons that have seen the company make four discoveries from the five wells drilled to date. </p>
      <p>“Mark Reid’s appointment to CEO is another positive in our view, bringing a wealth of financial and sector experience to this key position ahead of an active period for the company.”</p>
      <p>Shares in SDX rose 3.6 per cent this morning.</p>
