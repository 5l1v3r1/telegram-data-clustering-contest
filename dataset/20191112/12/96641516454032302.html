      <h1>'Minecraft Earth' early access arrives in the US</h1>
      <h2>You can play the augmented reality game on Microsoft's home turf.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:05:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>It took ages, but <i>Minecraft Earth</i> is finally available on Microsoft's home soil. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/28/minecraft-earth-launch-october/">early access version</a> of the augmented reality game has <a href="https://twitter.com/minecraftearth/status/1194291266713980928">launched</a> in the US for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftearth">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/minecraft-earth/id1467316099">iOS</a>. While it's still not the full-fledged version Microsoft and Mojang have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/11/stop-saying-minecraft-earth-is-essentially-pokemon-go/">hyping for months</a>, it will let you create dioramas, collaborate with friends on projects and tackle mobs in adventures.</p>
      <p>The US represents the tenth country to get early access. Much of the world is still out of the loop, then, although the developers have promised that expanded support is coming in the weeks ahead. Nonetheless, this is a major expansion. It hints that Microsoft and Mojang are increasingly comfortable with deploying <i>Minecraft Earth</i> in its current state, and that it might be just a matter of time before most countries have their chance to play.</p>
