      <h1>Breakenridge: Is conscience rights bill the first shot in a culture war?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:05:58+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Breakenridge, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The mere existence of a private member’s bill that potentially addresses some hot-button moral issues does not mean that Premier Jason Kenney has broken his vow to not reopen or legislate on such matters.</p>
      <p>However, we won’t really know for sure until we see how Kenney decides to respond to Bill 207. Social and religious conservatives are likely watching closely to see how much of their agenda they can convince this premier to adopt. Everyone else should be watching closely, too.</p>
      <p>Albertans elected a government that would get our finances in order and help spur investment and job creation in this province. Waging a culture war is not high on the list of priorities.</p>
      <p>Peace River UCP MLA Dan Williams, though, clearly has other ideas. His bill, Bill 207, is called the “Conscience Rights (Health Care Providers) Protection Act, which he claims is in response to a ruling earlier this year from Ontario’s highest court. That unanimous ruling confirmed a previous decision in favour of patients’ rights and ruled that physicians must provide an “effective referral” if a treatment or service clashes with their beliefs.</p>
      <p>It was a logical decision. Physicians have made an oath to serve their patients, and at the same time are not being forced to actually do anything that goes against their beliefs. As the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario policy notes, “because the balance of knowledge and information favours the physician, patients are reliant on their physicians and may be vulnerable. The patient must always be confident that the physician has put the needs of the patient first.”</p>
      <p>Alberta’s College of Physicians of Surgeons of Alberta has a similar policy, one that requires doctors who object to providing certain services to offer timely access for patients to a member or to a service that can.</p>
      <p>Williams, though, claims his bill is simply meant to affirm Charter rights and isn’t about limiting access to abortion or any other form of health care. If we are to take him at face value, then it’s hard to see what the point of this is.</p>
      <p>However, it’s easy to see how eroding patient rights in this area could make it harder to access certain services, and that would quite clearly have the effect of limiting access. So perhaps Williams is being somewhat disingenuous about his intent or about the effect this bill might have.</p>
      <p>The premier himself has not yet commented on all of this. It’s probably the case that the personal beliefs of both Williams and Kenney are in alignment in many ways. The difference, of course, is that one is a mere backbench MLA and the other is the head of government who vowed not legislate on such matters.</p>
      <p>Perhaps we can give the premier the benefit of the doubt for now, but a tweet last week from his executive director of issues management should not go unnoticed. The tweet made no reference to Bill 207, but quoted Section 2 of the Charter and capitalized the portion that reads “FREEDOM OF CONSCIENCE” (no mention of the Charter rights of patients, mind you).</p>
      <p>He claimed he was not defending any bill and perhaps the intent of the tweet was simply to downplay the significance of this bill, so as not to let it become a distraction. But by suggesting the bill is no big deal, it also implies that there’s no reason for the premier to oppose it. It would be worth knowing, then, exactly where Kenney stands on all of this.</p>
      <p>As the court ruled, “patients should not bear the burden of managing the consequences of physicians’ religious objections.” Bill 207 envisions doing exactly that, however, and as such deserves to be defeated.</p>
      <p>This bill is a solution in search of a problem, or rather, a culture war in search of a willing premier. Here’s hoping it doesn’t find one.</p>
