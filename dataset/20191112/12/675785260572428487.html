      <h1>Richard Madeley tipped to be I'm A Celebrity late arrival as line-up confirmed</h1>
      <h2>This Morning's Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield are hoping James Haskell will be joined by father-in-law Richard Madeley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:44:46+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>The I'm A Celebrity 2019 line-up could be about to gain another name ahead of the late arrivals being confirmed.</p>
      <p>Richard Madeley recently appeared to deny he would enter the jungle, with it now confirmed his son-in-law rugby player James Haskell is a contestant.</p>
      <p>The full original line-up has been announced, with James joined by Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, Roman Kemp, Nadine Coyle and Jacqueline Jossa amongst others.</p>
      <p>But there's still one or two names to be confirmed, as there's set to be a late arrival or two as usual.</p>
      <p>After Coronation Street's Kirk Sutherland actor Andrew Whyment was missing from the line-up, fans are hoping he might be one of the late entries.</p>

      <p>Now, This Morning host Phillip Schofield shared his own theory on who might be joining the show.</p>
      <p>Phillip believes fellow ITV presenter Richard is now headed for the jungle to join daughter Chloe's husband James.</p>
      <p>Speaking on This Morning ahead of the launch, Phillip pointed out: "There's always the surprise one."</p>

      <p>Co-host Holly Willoughby added: "Yeah, and normally the surprise one comes in and shifts things around, stirs things up a bit because we had Noel Edmonds that went in last year."</p>
      <p>It's then that Phil made his prediction over who would be this year's surprise campmate.</p>
      <p>He said: "Do you know who I would like to go in.</p>

      <p>"It's never released you just don’t know, but my guess if I was to have my favourite... Richard Madeley."</p>
      <p>Holly responded: "That would be incredible, and also because that's his son-in-law cos he's Chloe's husband isn't he?"</p>
      <p>It comes after months of speculation over whether Richard would enter the jungle, with him recently speaking about the claims to Lorraine Kelly.</p>
      <p>Richard refused to confirm or deny an appearance, so fans will have to wait and see.</p>
