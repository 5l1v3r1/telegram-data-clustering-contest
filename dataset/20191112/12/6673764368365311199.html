      <p><b>SEOUL – </b>The central government isn’t planning to attend the first hearing on a lawsuit seeking damages from Japan for former “comfort women” in South Korea, to be held Wednesday, informed sources said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Comfort women is a euphemism for women who worked at wartime Japanese brothels, including those who did so against their will, to provide sex to Japanese soldiers.</p>
      <p>Strained tensions between Japan and South Korea could deteriorate further depending on how the trial goes.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, 20 people, including former comfort women, filed the lawsuit with Seoul Central District Court, demanding the Japanese government pay some 3 billion won (about ¥282 million) in compensation.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs claimed that the 2015 bilateral agreement to resolve the comfort women issue “finally and irreversibly” did not discuss Japan’s responsibility for its inhumane wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The suit was filed in late 2016, but the start of the trial was postponed by the district court after Japan refused to participate in the case.</p>
      <p>In March this year, the district court made public the complaint and related documents, a legal step that presumes the documents have been conveyed to the Japanese government, enabling the court to start the trial in May or later.</p>
