      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla.-- Students in Lee County are a few months into the school year, but parents are still voicing their concerns about bus stop safety.</p>
      <p>Our Lauren Petrelli took the time to follow the Bauer family in Cape Coral to better understand their concerns.</p>
      <p>In her two-part project, she brought some of their biggest concerns about long bus rides and bus stops in the dark— straight to the school district.</p>
      <p>"After the two tragedies last school year, there was an immediate flurry that the school district was going to rezone, they’re going to do this or that," said Bethany Bauer. "From the point of view as a regular citizen, it appears nothing has changed.”</p>
