      <h1>Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello Basically Made Out for an Entire NBA Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T12:19:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Prepare yourself, because this is a lot: Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello are so blissfully in love that they are happy for everyone to see it courtside. The two were at the the Los Angeles Clippers and the Toronto Raptors game at Staples Center last night, and they were very, very affectionate. They kissed each other on the lips, Cabello kissed Mendes on the cheek, they cuddled, etc. Photographers captured all of it for your viewing pleasure (or displeasure if excessive celeb PDA is not your thing):</p>

      <p>Cabello and Mendes openly talk about their relationship now and aren't hiding, physically or verbally, how in love they are with each other.</p>
      <p>Cabello <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29370081/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-dating-friendship-risk-interview/">spoke last month</a> about taking that jump from friends to a couple and the fear she initially felt. “It’s almost more scary because you have more to lose," she said. "When you first start dating a person and you know nothing about them, there’s less at risk there. I think when you fall in love with somebody you’ve known for a long time, there’s more at stake."</p>
      <p>"But it also feels more special because it feels like the love story you see in the movies of people who have known each other for a long time but been too stupid to realize it or say it and then it happens—and that’s beautiful too,” she added.</p>
      <p>Mendes <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29636492/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-dating-anniversary-date/">revealed</a> they started dating July 4. And Cabello <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29683594/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-first-kiss-date/">said</a> their first date was in San Francisco, where they had their first kiss that month.</p>
