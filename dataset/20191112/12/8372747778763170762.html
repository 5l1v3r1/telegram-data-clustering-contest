      <p>All of the major broadcast networks will be bumping their regularly scheduled programming Wednesday and Friday in lieu of coverage of the first public hearings of the impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS will all preempt their regular programming in order to cover the hearings Wednesday and Friday, the networks announced. Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and C-SPAN will also offer live coverage of the hearings.</p>
      <p>Here's a roundup of where you can find coverage.</p>
      <p><b>ABC News</b> announced Monday that George Stephanopoulos will anchor its coverage of the hearings. The network will air "Special Reports" beginning at 10 a.m. EST Nov. 13 and 11 a.m. EST Nov. 15. The hearing will be continuously streamed on ABC News Live.</p>
      <p><b>CBS News</b> says Norah O'Donnel will anchor the TV special reports from Washington, D.C., on Wednesday and Friday. The network also said it will provide live coverage of the first public impeachment hearings on CBSN — its 24-hour streaming news service — CBS Radio and CBS News Special Reports on TV. CBSN will also stream special editions of "Red &amp; Blue" with highlights of each day's hearings.</p>
      <p><b>NBC News</b> says its impeachment coverage will be led by "NBC Nightly News" anchor Lester Holt, chief legal correspondent and "Today" anchor Savannah Guthrie and "Meet the Press" moderator and NBC News political director Chuck Todd. Coverage will begin at 10 a.m. EST Nov. 13 and Nov. 15.</p>
      <p><b>MSNBC</b> will also be offering impeachment coverage. Brian Williams, host of "The 11th Hour," and Nicolle Wallace, host of "Deadline: White House," will anchor special coverage on MSNBC beginning at 9 a.m. EST Wednesday. The impeachment hearings will also stream live on NBC News NOW, NBCNews.com and MSNBC.com.</p>
      <p><b>PBS</b> will broadcast the Trump hearings live starting Nov. 13 with analysis from its new "NewsHour" team. Stations make their own programming decisions but the coverage will be available to all affiliates. The hearings will also be available on digital platforms, including pbs.org and the PBS video app. The hearings will also air during prime time on WORLD, a digital channel carried by 157 public television stations. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2019/11/10/exp-moyers-challenges-pbs-to-re-air-hearings-in-prime-time.cnn">PBS has come under fire</a> in recent days for choosing to not repeat the hearings on their main TV channel during prime time like it did during the Watergate hearings.</p>
      <p><b>Fox News </b>says beginning at 9 a.m. EST, they will present a special edition of "America’s Newsroom<i>," </i>with anchors Bill Hemmer and Sandra Smith, kicking off coverage ahead of the 10 a.m. EST hearing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><b>CNN </b>will air the impeachment hearings live on TV and the streams will also be made available on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/about-live-tv">their digital apps.</a></p>
      <p><b>C-SPAN</b>, C-span.org and C-SPAN Radio will all air the hearings live.</p>
      <p>The hearings will start Wednesday with Bill Taylor and George Kent testifying, followed by Marie Yovanovitch on Friday. They all have previously testified in closed-door hearings. The hearings are expected to last several hours.</p>
      <p>If you're unable to watch the coverage during the day, you can watch the hearings during prime time on <a href="https://worldchannel.org/watch/">WORLD,</a> a digital news channel from PBS. In addition, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMF5z6BIrwwQTtcj2cacBPw/videos?view=2&amp;sort=dd&amp;live_view=503&amp;shelf_id=2">House Intelligence Committee will stream the hearings live on YouTube</a> and past streams are usually available on the channel, should you miss it the first time around.</p>
