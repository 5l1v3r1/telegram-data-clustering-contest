      <p>Tottenham Court Road West (TCRW) will include 92 flats – with prices for a studio apartment starting at £899,000 – and 9,939 sq ft of ground floor retail space. </p>
      <p>One six-storey Art Deco-inspired block will overlook Oxford Street while the other five-storey apartment building will face Dean Street and is inspired by Soho’s Georgian townhouses. </p>
      <p>The scheme is expected to take two and a half years to build and to open in summer 2022. </p>
      <p>The Crossrail interchange is expected to become operational in 2021, making Tottenham Court Road one of London’s busiest stations with access to the Northern and Central underground lines as well as the Elizabeth Line.</p>
      <p>The masterplan for the development was designed by architects at Hawkins Brown. </p>

      <p>“Galliard’s new apartment buildings are integrated with the Crossrail interchange offering residents easy access to London Heathrow, Canary Wharf and locations such as Bond Street and Liverpool Street.”</p>
