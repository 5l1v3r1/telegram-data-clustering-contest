      <p>Just more than a week following the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/01/apple-tv-launches-with-original-series-and-movies">launch of Apple TV+</a>, Apple is still making deals to bring more content to the service. The latest report claims that a deal could be finalized with RLP &amp; Company in the next few weeks to provide unique content for Apple TV+.<br/><br/>At present, there is no indication on the size of the deal, nor the amount of content that is expected.<br/><br/><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> says in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hbo-ex-ceo-in-advanced-talks-to-sign-exclusive-production-deal-with-appletv-11573588982">Tuesday's report</a> about the content buy that Plepler is "one of the most well-regarded entertainment executives of the last decade." Under Plepler's lead, HBO and Cinemax started two streaming services.<br/><br/>Plepler was born in 1960, and studied government at Franklin &amp; Marshall college. After a short stint working for Senator Christopher Dodd, Plepler moved to New York City, and opened a public relations firm.<br/><br/>In 2007 through 2013, he served as co-president with Michael Lombardo, and launched "True Blood," "Game of Thrones," and "Veep." In 2013 Plepler drove both HBO and Cinemax, reaching about 130 million subscribers between the two services.<br/><br/>Richard Plepler departed HBO in February, following the service's acquisition by AT&amp;T's Warner Media.<br/><br/>Apple TV+ was announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/25/apple-announces-apple-tv-service-that-will-host-apples-unique-programming">on March 25</a>. In a presentation that was replete with star names, at the time, Apple would only say that the service is coming in the Fall and be available via the Apple TV app.<br/><br/>The service launched on November 1, for $4.99 a month, and free to purchasers of Apple's new stable of devices. There were some critical reviews of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/01/editorial-apple-faces-entirely-new-challenges-with-apple-tv">programming at launch</a>, but viewer response has been somewhat better.</p>
