      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - Protesters disrupted the first screening in France of Roman Polanski’s new film on Tuesday, following the publication of a new rape accusation against the French-Polish director.</p>

      <p>A group of about 40 activists blocked the screening of the French premiere of Polanski’s film “J’accuse” at a theater in Rue Champollion, although the film was shown at some other theaters in Paris.</p>
      <p>“The cancellation of this screening is not a victory; victory will be when the impunity for rapists ends,” Chloe Madesta, one of the activists, told France Info Radio.</p>
      <p>Polanski is launching his new film in France just days after French actress Valentine Monnier - in an open letter to daily Le Parisien - accused Polanski, now 86, of having raped her in 1975, when she was 18 years old, during a ski holiday in Gstaad, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Polanski, through his lawyer Herve Temime, has denied the accusation.</p>
      <p>Monnier is one of several women who have publicly accused Polanski of sexually assaulting them. Polanski has repeatedly denied all accusations against him.</p>
      <p>In October 2017, protesters disrupted the opening of a retrospective of Polanski’s work in Paris following new rape accusations against him.</p>
      <p>Polanski fled the United States after pleading guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Accusations against Polanski predate the Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment scandal in 2017, but Polanski’s history came under renewed scrutiny as the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment grew in the wake of the Weinstein case.</p>
      <p>Last year, Polanski was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p>
      <p>In a production note for his new film - about Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French army officer who in 1894 was convicted of treason - Polanski has compared his problems with the law and the persecution he says he has suffered with the struggles of Dreyfus.</p>
      <p>Dreyfus’s conviction was criticized as being motivated by anti-Semitism and the case deeply split France. He was eventually exonerated.</p>
      <p>“It is absolutely indecent to make a parallel between Dreyfus’ story of denial of justice and Polanski’s story. Polanski has spent his life fleeing from justice,” activist Madesta said.</p>
      <p>“We call on all theaters not to show this film and on film lovers not to go see it,” she added.</p>
      <p>In August, Polanski stayed away from the premiere of the film - called “An Officer and a Spy” in English - at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
