      <h2>The Manchester United defender has spoken out about Monday's incident between Manchester City's Raheem Sterling and Liverpool's Joe Gomez while on England duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:29:18+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Victor Lindelof has criticised Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez for bringing domestic issues to the national team following Monday's canteen clash.</p>
      <p>Sterling and Gomez came to blows while on England duty following Liverpool's 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Gomez, who had squared up to Sterling the day before, attempted to shake Sterling's hand. The Man City star responded with the comment: "So you think you're the big man?" before reportedly trying to get the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender in a headlock.</p>
      <p>Sterling has been axed from the Three Lions' Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro as a result of the bust-up, Gareth Southgate confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Wading into the debate, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> centre-back Lindelof sympathised with the duo, admitting emotions can run high in football.</p>

      <p>But added it's not "optimal" for rival players to start quarreling on international duty.</p>
      <p>"There can be some hot feelings," Lindelof told <a href="https://www.fotbollskanalen.se/england/lindelof-om-engelska-stjarnbraket-maste-forsoka-slappa-kanslorna/?utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=">Fotbollskanalen.</a> "There are important matches being played in the league.</p>
      <p>"But when you come to the national team you have to try to let go of those feelings and think of the national team.</p>

      <p>"It is perfectly understandable that there can be a lot of emotions, but of course it is not optimal if you should go in and start quarreling.</p>
      <p>"I don't know the whole situation so I can't stand here and say who was right or who was wrong."</p>
