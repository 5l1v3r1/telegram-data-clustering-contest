        <i>Company has confirmed system bug in the latest version of iOS app, and said it is submitting a fix to Apple</i>
      </p>
      <p>A system bug has been allowing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> to access iPhone cameras as users scroll through their feed, the company confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Joshua Maddux <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuamaddux/status/1193434937824702464?s=21">tweeted a screen recording</a> this weekend that showed his iPhone camera would open as he scrolled through his social media feed. Other users had <a href="https://twitter.com/neo_qa/status/1190614998411808768">also noticed</a> the glitch earlier in the month, one calling it “a little worrying”.</p>
      <p>Facebook confirmed the bug in the latest version of the iOS app on Tuesday. A spokesman said the issue would cause the Facebook app to “navigate to the camera screen adjacent to News Feed when users tapped on photos”. The company said it is submitting a fix to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/apple">Apple</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“We have seen no evidence of photos or videos being uploaded due to this bug,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The bug was startling for many users who have long suspected the company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-spying-on-you-microphone-creepy-data-conspiracy-theories">eavesdrops on users</a> through phone microphones in order to better target them with advertising.</p>
      <p>These suspicions have been fueled by uncanny coincidences, such as the company targeting <a href="https://twitter.com/kelleyblythe_/status/923614518378418176">a user with cat food advertisements</a> after the person discussed getting a cat, or advertisements for <a href="https://twitter.com/MorganCrockett/status/923626809559736321">other specific products</a> being shown after they were discussed aloud.</p>
      <p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/09/facebook-spying-on-you-microphone-creepy-data-conspiracy-theories">repeatedly denied</a> the theory that it listens in on users, and it has been theorized that the company simply has enough user data to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/30/facebook-denies-eavesdropping-on-conversations-to-target-ads-again">target</a> its 1.7bn users in a scarily accurate way.</p>
      <p>Conspiracy theories aside, users have a number of legitimate privacy concerns about Facebook. The company has been the subject of multiple privacy controversies in recent years, from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election">Cambridge Analytica data breach</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/sep/28/facebook-50-million-user-accounts-security-berach">a hack of more than 50m accounts</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>It has faced increasing calls for antitrust measures, including from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/19/elizabeth-warren-facebook-break-up">presidential candidates</a> Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Executive officer Mark Zuckerberg also faced heated examination in Congress last month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/23/mark-zuckerberg-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-facebook-cambridge-analytica">over advertising policies</a> and election</p>
      <p>Despite the legitimate security concerns regarding Facebook, it appears this particular bug is nothing to worry about, said Chris Morales, head of security analytics at the Silicon Valley-based cybersecurity firm <a href="http://www.vectra.ai/">Vectra</a>.</p>
      <p>“This is mostly a harmless bug that allows Facebook to use the camera but it is not a compromise or breach of personal data or privacy,” he said. “The easiest thing to do is for users to disable the use of the camera in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone">iPhone</a> app settings”.</p>
