      <h1>Let Us Not Forget About The Ninja Saviors</h1>

      <p>Yes, yes, I know. Our Switch backlogs are huge already. <i>Pokémon</i> is about to come out. Nintendo’s even <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/11/nintendos-ambulance-game-is-giving-me-some-serious-dreamcast-vibes">surprise-releasing games</a>. But if you enjoy the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre, don’t forget that <i>The Ninja Saviors: Return of the Warriors</i> is just sitting there on the eShop waiting for you.</p>
      <p>Much like 2016's <i>Wild Guns Reloaded</i>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch/The-Ninja-Saviors-Return-of-the-Warriors-1621282.html"><i>Ninja Saviors</i></a> is a remake of one of Taito’s cult classic Super NES games. This time it’s the acclaimed 1994 game <i>Ninja Warriors</i>, which was itself a sequel to a 1987 arcade game that’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Arcade-Archives-THE-NINJA-WARRIORS-1601683.html">also available on Switch</a> via Arcade Archives. (I should say that both games are also on the PlayStation 4, although sadly you can’t yank your PlayStation 4 off the shelf and play it in portable mode, so I’d buy these on Switch is what I’m saying.)</p>

      <p>What’s wild about these particular remakes is that <a href="https://www.natsumeatari.co.jp/tengo-project/">the group responsible</a> is actually made up of the original developers of the SNES games. So as you might imagine, they’re lovingly crafted HD-ifications of the originals. <i>Ninja Saviors</i> casts you as one of five different robotic assassins, each with their own widely varied move set; definitely read the in-game manual and study up on everybody’s moves if you want to not die.</p>
      <p>Since all the action is locked to a single plane, rather than having your characters be able to move up and down à la <i>Final Fight</i>, it’s almost more like playing a fighting game that sends an endless line of new opponents every second, each of which has to be negotiated slightly differently. <i>Ninja Warriors </i>is a standout example of this quintessential 16-bit genre. Don’t forget about it!</p>
