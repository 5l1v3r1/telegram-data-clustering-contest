      <h1>Men receive extra jail time for Regina jailhouse riot attack</h1>
      <h2>Britain Volk and Peter Giesbrecht were sentenced after admitting to assaulting a fellow inmate during a July riot at the Regina jail.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:17:17+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/hpolischuk" target="_blank">Heather Polischuk</a></address>
      <p>A jailhouse riot that left several prisoners injured and many others facing criminal charges led to additional time behind bars for two of the participants.</p>
      <p>Britain Volk, 19, and Peter Jordan Giesbrecht, 25, each pleaded guilty and was sentenced at Regina Provincial Court on Friday for one count of assault causing bodily harm, their participation limited to an attack on one of the complainants.</p>
      <p>Judge Doug Kovatch, who sentenced Volk, said it was down to “purely good fortune” rather than any restraint shown by Volk or his accomplices that the complainant in question wasn’t hurt worse than he was.</p>
      <p>“The attack was planned and deliberate and quite brutal,” Kovatch said. “The fact that the injuries aren’t more serious is nothing more than good fortune.”</p>
      <p>Court heard the incident was a gang-on-gang attack that began while four complainants — inmates on one of the sentenced units at the Regina Provincial Correctional Centre — were eating breakfast in the lunch room at about 8 a.m. on July 12.</p>
      <p>In a planned attack, 10 other inmates rushed the smaller group and a series of melees broke out, leaving several inmates with significant injuries, including stab wounds. At the time of the incident, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/crime/five-inmates-injured-during-friday-incident-at-regina-jail">the Ministry of Corrections and Policing said five inmates were taken to hospital as a result of the brawl</a>.</p>
      <p>Volk and Giesbrecht were among one group of inmates who set upon one man in particular. Court heard that man was taken to the ground and that Volk and Giesbrecht kicked and punched him until jail staff entered the area to break up the incident.</p>
      <p>The victim of the Volk and Giesbrecht attack was taken to hospital with injuries said to have been less serious than some of the others inflicted that day. Crown prosecutor Steven Robertson said the man suffered a cut to his scalp that needed a couple of staples to close.</p>
      <p>The pair sentenced on Friday were among 10 charged. Others remain before the court.</p>
      <p>Court heard Volk, though just 19, has an existing record for violence and was serving a 15-month sentence for assault with a weapon when this incident occurred. The Crown argued for a federal penitentiary term in his case, while defence lawyer Dave Armstrong requested nine months.</p>
      <p>Kovatch said the fact Volk suffers from some cognitive and mental health challenges weighed as mitigating circumstances, but he also couldn’t overlook the seriousness of the offence — including the fact it occurred inside a correctional centre — or Volk’s existing record. Kovatch opted for a 15-month sentence less remand credit, effectively duplicating Volk’s previous sentence.</p>
      <p>Because Giesbrecht’s record doesn’t contain past violence, Robertson and defence lawyer Jennifer Calderbank joined in asking Judge Anna Crugnale-Reid to consider a one-year jail sentence, consecutive to Giesbrecht’s existing two-years-less-a-day term.</p>
      <p>Calderbank said her client plans to return to Alberta, where he’d previously lived, and get his life back on track once released.</p>
      <p>Addressing the court briefly, Giesbrecht expressed some regret over the incident.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t realize something could snowball so quickly, the incident in jail,” he said.</p>
      <p>Crugnale-Reid agreed to impose the one-year sentence as requested, telling Giesbrecht both he and the victim were very lucky the injuries weren’t worse.</p>
