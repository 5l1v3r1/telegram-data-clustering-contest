      <h1>Tony Stark Reunites With Adult Daughter in Deleted ‘Avengers: Endgame’ Scene</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:50:27+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>Tony Stark’s death was one of the saddest moments in <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/avengers-endgame-director-explains-how-thanos-blade-broke-captain-americas-shield-1800162/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>. However, the water works are about to begin again, because the hero reunites with his grown-up daughter in a deleted scene that was just released by Disney.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Disney+ officially launched, making many movies, including <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, streamable to fans. Subscribers noticed the two-minute scene while they were watching the <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/watch-thors-transformation-in-cheeky-avengers-endgame-behind-the-scenes-clip-1798295/">movie</a> on the streaming service, <a href="https://www.insider.com/avengers-endgame-deleted-scene-tony-stark-morgan-grown-up-2019-11">INSIDER reported</a>.</p>

      <p>The scene, which takes place in a dream-like setting, features Katherine Langford (<i>13 Reasons Why</i>, <i>Knives Out</i>) as an adult version of Morgan, Stark’s daughter who lost her dad in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>If the <a href="https://twitter.com/Marvel/status/1139208307741200386?s=20">“I love you 3,000” scene</a> didn’t make you tear up, this one will: Stark gets to meet Morgan again at a later point. It’s unclear where they are, but their brief dialogue goes straight to the heart.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of you and sad. I’m strong like mom and I’m happy,” Morgan tells Stark in the scene. “I’m happy we had the time that we did and that you were there for me.”</p>
      <p>I’m not crying, you’re crying.</p>
      <p><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> is streaming on <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a> now.</p>
