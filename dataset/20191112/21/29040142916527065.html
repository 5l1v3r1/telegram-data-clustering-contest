      </p>
      <p><b>Best answer:</b> You'll find almost all classic Disney animated and live-action features and shorts, the majority of the Marvel cinematic universe, Pixar's full catalog, and National Geographic. It also features content from Twentieth Century Fox, including 30 seasons of <i>The Simpsons</i>, which should be well worth the subscription price on its own.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All Disney all the time: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82309YYm%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=ggyyobdk">Disney+</a> ($9/month at Disney+)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Disney+ is a great value for Canadians</h4>
      <p>In the lead up to the launch of Disney+, there was a lot of talk around whether Canadians subscribers would get the full catalog of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-disney-plus-have">movies</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-tv-shows-does-disney-plus-have">TV shows</a> that American audiences would enjoy. It's a valid concern, as Canadians often get the short end of the stick when it comes to streaming services, the most glaring example being a disparity between US and Canadian Netflix.</p>
      <p>But having spent the good chunk of the launch day scouring through the Disney+ library (when it wasn't giving me error messages), I can confirm that there doesn't seem to be much, if anything at all, missing from the Canadian catalog of content. Keep in mind that there's a staggering amount of content included here, so I did my best to cross-reference as much as I can, but as far as I can tell, everything is available to stream â€” which is <i>great</i>.</p>
      <h4>Still content for days</h4>
      <p>So, Canadian Disney lovers out there, rejoice! Looks like the gang, well, at least what was promised, is a here. Even stuff that we didn't expect to be there, such as <i>The Simpsons</i>, is available to stream on day one. I've noticed a few missing Marvel movies, such as <i>Thor: Ragnorok</i>, but that also appears to not be available on the US Disney+ either.</p>
      <p>In short, if you were hesitant to sign up for Disney+ because you feared it would lack the movies and shows you actually wanted to watch, you can put those fears to rest. Disney+ has really knocked it out of the park with its launch day line up for Canadian audiences.</p>
      <h4>All the movies</h4>
