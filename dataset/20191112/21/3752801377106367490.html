      <h1>WATCH | Shot security guard airlifted to hospital after Hurlingham house robbery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:55:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Sharlene Rood</a></address>
      <p>A security guard who was shot in the head by four alleged house robbers in Hurlingham, Sandton, on Tuesday morning was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>It is believed the guard was responding to a house alarm. A police officer was also wounded in the same incident. </p>
      <p>Gauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters told News24 they have launched a manhunt.</p>
      <p>She said a 52-year-old woman was at home with other family members, a helper and their gardener when four armed suspects allegedly stormed into the house, threatening to shoot them.</p>
      <p>The suspects made off with jewellery, laptops and other valuables. </p>
      <p>"A security guard responded to the alarm and was allegedly shot by the suspects on his arrival at the house," Peters said. "The man was rushed to a nearby hospital for medical attention to injuries he sustained to his upper body."</p>
      <p>The suspects fled in a white bakkie.</p>
      <p>Peters confirmed a police vehicle was also struck by bullets and a police officer was rushed to hospital after sustaining injuries to his upper body.</p>
      <p>She said it was unclear if the shots were directed at the police or if the car was hit by stray bullets. </p>
      <p>ER24 spokesperson Ross Campbell told News24 paramedics were on scene shortly after 11:00. </p>
      <p>He confirmed Netcare's specialised helicopter ambulance had airlifted the security guard to a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>Campbell said the police officer had suffered moderate injuries when he was grazed by a bullet. </p>
      <p>Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst told News24 the security guard had sustained an entry-exit wound to the head.</p>
      <p>Peters said two cases of attempted murder have been opened along with the case of house robbery.</p>
