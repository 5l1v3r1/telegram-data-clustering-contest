      <p>Saskatchewan’s parks ministry is looking for private operators to set up inflatable water parks at six provincial parks in time for the 2020 camping season.</p>
      <p>Michael Roth, director of park business services with the Ministry of Parks, Culture and Sport, said <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/southern-saskatchewan-provincial-parks-getting-swimming-and-campground-upgrades">the expansion will follow up on the success of a water park at Rowan’s Ravine Provincial Park on Last Mountain Lake</a>.</p>
      <p>“Water-based recreation is one of the high demand items out there,” said Roth.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got the beaches, we’ve got the lakes, and we think this would be a very popular attraction at some of our other parks as well.”</p>
      <p>The ministry is accepting proposals for six locations: Buffalo Pound Provincial Park, Danielson Provincial Park, Duck Mountain Provincial Park, Greenwater Lake Provincial Park, Makwa Lake Provincial Park and The Battlefords Provincial Park.</p>
      <p>Roth said those parks have the right features — like suitable lake levels — to support inflatable water parks.</p>
      <p>According to a request for proposals posted last week, the ministry envisions “innovative inflatable water park proposals that will provide an entertaining and safe experience for park visitors.”</p>
      <p>Roth said officials are open to almost anything that meets those criteria. Rowan’s Ravine is one model, while the inflatable park at Regina Beach — which is not located in a provincial park — might be another.</p>
      <p>Wild Waves Waterpark at Rowan’s Ravine offers inflatable water blobs, slides, teeter totters, icebergs and a trampoline, for example.</p>
      <p>“We have done a little bit of research, but we don’t want to be very prescriptive,” Roth said.</p>
      <p>The request for proposals foresees a commercial lease agreement between the operator and the ministry. Roth said there’s generally a fee involved, though he didn’t go into details.</p>
      <p>He said the ministry is hoping to have the operators selected by mid-January.</p>
      <p>“If we do get some bids, our goal is to have some of these in place for next camping season,” he said.</p>
      <p>Roth said the ministry is now in negotiations with Wild Waves Waterpark in Rowan’s Ravine to renew the existing agreement, and is also negotiating with yet another proponent who provided an unsolicited offer for an inflatable water park elsewhere.</p>
