      <h1>Grizzlies get goal scorer in trade with Penticton Vees</h1>

      <p>Looking to spark his team’s struggling offence, Victoria Grizzlies GM and head coach Craig Didmon swung a trade with the perennial B.C. Hockey League powerhouse and current Interior Division-leading Penticton Vees on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Coming to Victoria is 19-year-old forward Vincent Nardone, and heading to Penticton is fellow 19-year-old and second-year Grizzlies forward Darwin Lakoduk.</p>
      <p>Nardone, who has an NCAA scholarship to the University of Nebraska-Omaha for the fall of 2021, has eight points in 22 games with the Vees. He has done most of his damage playing on the third line with the talent-loaded team, who have 16 players committed to NCAA schools.</p>
      <p>“Vincent is a real skilled kid, with a scholarship, who wasn’t really getting top-six minutes on a really deep Penticton team. So he’s excited to come here and get a more offensive role, and we really think he’ll thrive here,” said Didmon, whose team will look to snap a seven-game losing skid on Friday night when they host the Nanaimo Clippers at The Q Centre.</p>
      <p>The 5-foot-10, 180-pound Nardone, from Rosemère, Que., spent last season in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League with the Flin Flon Bombers, where he collected 17 goals and 22 assists in 56 regular-season games.</p>
      <p>He added another two goals and an assist in nine playoff games for the Bombers.</p>
      <p>Nardone, expected to be in the Grizzlies’ lineup Friday against the Clippers, scored against Victoria when the Vees beat the Grizzlies 4-1 on Nov. 2 at The Q Centre.</p>
      <p>“He’s got a good nose for the net and we’re going to give him a chance to use those offensive skills,” Didmon said.</p>
      <p>Lakoduk recorded seven points in 25 games with the Grizzlies this season. The Edmonton product had 12 points in 47 games last season for Victoria.</p>
