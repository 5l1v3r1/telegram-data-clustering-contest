      <h1>Man accidentally uses 'secret code' ordering McDonald’s and 'gets cup of weed'</h1>
      <h2>Parrish Brown claimed his McDonald's lemon iced tea came with a side of marijuana after ordering at a drive-thru in South Carolina, US</h2>

      <p>A customer claims a McDonald's in the US state of South Carolina sold him a lemon iced tea with an unexpected 'extra' twist.</p>
      <p>There are all sort of secret menu items at McDonald’s if you know what to ask for.</p>
      <p>But Parrish Brown claimed to have stumbled upon a rather more illicit secret code at one branch of the popular fast food restaurant.</p>
      <p>He claims he ordered a lemon tea with “extra lemon” from his local McDonald's drive-thru and noticed that the clerk at the counter asked him to confirm he wanted “extra lemon,” the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/weird-news/bloke-accidentally-uses-secret-code-20861553">Daily Star</a> reports.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But he didn’t think too much of it until he drank his iced tea and thought it tasted a little odd</p>
      <p>Parrish was thinking “maybe this will get better, maybe it’s just me,” he told the <a href="https://www.islandpacket.com/news/local/crime/article237063389.html">Island Packet</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: “I have never had weed a day in my life, so immediately after I started drinking it, I started to feel weird and it didn’t taste like something I recognised."</p>
      <p>The “weird” feeling began to get worse, so he took the lid off his cup and it was then that he realised the secret ingredient in his drink was three bags of weed.</p>
      <p>He had accidentally punctured them as he poked around in the ice with his straw and the odd taste he had noticed was the weed he was inadvertently drinking.</p>

      <p>“Well, I was high and panicking and at work, so I called my dad,” said Parrish.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to get in trouble for this.”</p>
      <p>Parrish’s dad told him to call the cops.</p>
      <p>The 911 dispatcher didn’t quite believe Parrish’s story at first.</p>
      <p>Nor did the police officer sent to interview him: “I kept being like ‘I swear, there is weed in my sweet tea!’” Parrish explained. “The officer asked me why I drank it and I was like, ‘Well, I was thirsty!’”</p>
      <p>His receipt showed that he had paid the regular menu price for all the items.</p>
      <p>Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Major Bob Bromage confirmed that the marijuana had been impounded as evidence.</p>
      <p>However he declined to give any further details, including which particular branch of McDonald’s Parrish had bought his “extra lemon” drink from.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for McDonald’s in the US said the company is “fully co-operating with law enforcement on the validity of this claim”.</p>
