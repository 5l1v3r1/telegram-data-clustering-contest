      <p>President Trump has privately discussed firing the intelligence community inspector general who informed Congress of a whistleblower complaint, touching off an impeachment investigation led by House Democrats.</p>
      <p>The conversations began in September, around the time the complaint became public, and have continued in recent weeks, according to the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/politics/trump-michael-atkinson-inspector-general.html">New York Times</a></i>. It is unclear whether Trump is seriously considering removing Inspector General Michael Atkinson or merely venting, but the president is said to view the watchdog as being disloyal.</p>
      <p>He has also lashed out at Atkinson in public, tweeting last month, "Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?"</p>

      <p>In the past, Trump publicly griped about officials, including former FBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, before forcing them out.</p>
      <p>The White House and inspector general's office declined to comment for the report.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower, known to be a CIA analyst who once served on the National Security Council, filed a complaint to Atkinson about a July 25 phone call in which Trump urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to look into a conspiracy theory regarding <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ukraine-transcript-reveals-trump-asked-for-favor-related-to-crowdstrike-conspiracy-theory">CrowdStrike</a>. He also urged him to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Atkinson deemed the complaint to be urgent and credible. He forwarded it to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, who did not send it to Congress but allowed Atkinson to notify lawmakers of its existence.</p>
      <p>Following a clash with lawmakers led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, it was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ukraine-whistleblower-complaint-declassified">declassified</a> on Sept. 25.</p>
      <p>Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/schiff-signals-he-will-reject-gop-sham-witness-requests">are now building an impeachment case</a> that accuses Trump of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democrats-likely-to-impeach-trump-on-obstruction-and-abuse-of-power">abuse of power and obstruction of Congress</a>. The president has demanded Atkinson be among those called to testify.</p>
      <p>"I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiffâ€™s lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), &amp; the I.G., be part of the list!" Trump tweeted over the weekend, using the acronym for the inspector general.</p>
