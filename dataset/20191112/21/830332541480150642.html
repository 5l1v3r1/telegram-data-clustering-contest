      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Officials from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services are <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/111219.htm">urging people</a> to make sure they get their flu shots before visiting family for the holidays.</p>
      <p>“Many of those close to us need extra protection from the flu, especially our elderly family members and friends, babies, and those with special health conditions,” said Jeanne Ayers, State Health Officer. “Getting your flu vaccine is a very effective and thoughtful way to protect yourself and your guests this holiday season.”</p>
      <p>According to a news release, there have already been six deaths from flu-related complications in Wisconsin this year. The release noted that the vaccine is readily available through health care providers, and pharmacies and is safe and effective for people aged six months and older. </p>
      <p>“Because it takes two weeks for the vaccine to take effect, getting one now will ensure protection by the time family and friends gather for the Thanksgiving holiday, and that protection will continue throughout the holiday season and beyond,” Ayers said.</p>
      <p>Officials also encourage people to take steps that can help protect yourself and others from illness, including washing hands, covering sneezes and coughs with your upper sleeve, avoiding people who are sick, and frequently cleaning commonly touched surfaces.</p>
