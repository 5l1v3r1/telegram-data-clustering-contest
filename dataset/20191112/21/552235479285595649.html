      <h1>Ovie Ejaria showcases spinning technique Rangers fans will definitely recognise</h1>
      <h2>The midfielder had his ups and downs at Ibrox but could pirouette with aplomb.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:23:23+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:23</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Ovie Ejaria may have left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> under something of a cloud but the former Liverpool loanee left one indelible mark - as the best spinner around a football Ibrox has ever seen.</p>
      <p>And it's safe to say it's not a talent that the midfielder, now at Reading after a £3m summer move, has lost since departing Scotland.</p>
      <p>Playing during the Royals' 2-1 victory over Millwall, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ovie-ejaria">Ejaria</a> found himself isolated near the corner flag, under pressure from Mahlon Romeo.</p>
      <p>He spun around the defender in two full 360 degree rotations before laying off to a teammate in an astonishing display of balance and control.</p>
      <p>Ejaria departed Ibrox in December last year amid claims the Premiership was too physical for his liking.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> spoke at the time of his disappointment that the deal didn't work out and suggested the creative star had made an error in judgement.</p>
      <p>He said: "Look he's a Liverpool player so I first and foremost have to respect the kid and the privacy.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> for the opportunity to have him here for half the season.</p>
      <p>"Am I disappointed he's gone? Yes. Do I think it's the right decision? No, because I think he had an incredible opportunity here.</p>
      <p>"But I'm never going to stand in a player's way who is not happy and who is not settled because I have people who are desperate to wear the shirt and who would run through brick walls to wear it.</p>
      <p>"It is what it is. I have to accept the decision. I'm sad about it, I wish him all the best. He's a nice kid, very quiet. He told me it was 100 per cent football reasons and I have to respect that."</p>
