      <p>Choreographer and '<b>Produce 48</b>' dance trainer, Bae Yoonjung, recently shared some words of encouragement for <b>IZ*ONE</b> during her recent Instagram live.</p>
      <p>During the stream, a fan asked her what her life motto was. To which Yoonjung responded, "If you endure, you'll win." After seemingly seeing a follow up comment about IZ*ONE she said, "That's right, please tell IZ*ONE my life motto. But those friends are holding up well anyway."</p>
      <p>It seems the dancer is wishing the best for IZ*ONE's future regardless of the current voting scandal.</p>
