      <p>(CNN) - Bode and Morgan Miller have welcomed twin boys into the world, about a year after losing a child to drowning.</p>
      <p>The babies were born November 8, three days before they were due.</p>
      <p>Bode, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/31/sport/bode-miller/index.html">a former Olympic skier</a>, and his wife Morgan announced the birth Tuesday on <a href="https://www.today.com/video/bode-miller-and-wife-morgan-announce-birth-of-their-twins-see-the-pics-73323589908">the "Today" show.</a></p>
      <p>"None of the midwives actually made it on time," Bode told the show in a phone call. "By the time they got there, me and my mom were both holding the babies. ... One minute we're just hanging out and the next they were out."</p>
      <p>The couple's 1-year-old daughter, Emeline "Emmy" Miller, died by drowning in a pool. The Millers have dedicated their efforts to child drowning prevention and awareness.</p>
      <p>"Insanely overwhelmed and grateful for all these gifts my baby girl keeps sending," Morgan shared on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Morgan <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/us/bode-morgan-miller-twins-trnd/index.html">revealed the news in August </a>on Instagram, saying that she learned that "joy and grief could coexist. Now, I can actually say with joy and excitement that we are expecting identical twin boys."</p>
      <p>Morgan Miller added that her husband has always wanted twin boys born on his birthday, October 12.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, his wish didn't come true, but the couple is happy the boys are finally here.</p>
      <p>"From the beginning of this pregnancy, we knew Emmy had her hands in this miracle somehow," she wrote.</p>
      <p>The couple said they have not picked names for the babies yet.</p>
