      <p>Three Calgary men are facing a charge of attempted murder following what police call a targeted shooting at a shopping mall that triggered an evacuation involving thousands of people.</p>
      <p>Police and other emergency services from a wide area converged on the food court entrance at CrossIron Mills just north of the city on the evening of Sept. 16 after word of a shooting that seriously injured a man.</p>
      <p>It took several hours to clear shoppers and store employees from the building and parking lot, but there were no reports of anyone being hurt during the evacuation.</p>
      <p>The accused, who range in age from 25 to 37, were arrested Sunday and remain in custody.</p>
      <p>Dakota Brandon Bolton, Carl James Schuyler and Jari Erkki Manner also face a number of other charges that include conspiracy to commit murder.</p>
      <p>Manner was to appear in Airdrie provincial court Tuesday, while Bolton and Schuyler will appear via closed-circuit television in Airdrie on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>Police have previously said that a black 2019 Dodge Ram 4-door pickup truck carrying two people was seen fleeing from the mall following the shooting.</p>
      <p>An update on the status of the injured man has not been released. The RCMP said in a statement that it cannot provide information about the motive behind the shooting.</p>
