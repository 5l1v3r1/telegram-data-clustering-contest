      <p>(Reuters) - A 2-year-old passenger on a Saudi Arabian Airlines plane that made an emergency landing in eastern Canada on Tuesday was pronounced dead on arriving in a hospital, a provincial police official said.</p>
      <p>Flight 35, which left Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, at 6:45 a.m. local time Tuesday and was bound for Washington, D.C., landed shortly before 12 p.m. ET at the St. John’s International Airport, in the province of Newfoundland, due to a medical emergency.</p>
      <p>Upon landing the 2-year-old was transported to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead, James Cadigan, an officer with the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary, said.</p>
      <p>The province’s office of the chief medical examiner will determine the cause of death, although it is not believed to be suspicious, Cadigan said.</p>
      <p>Police declined to release details about the toddler’s family.</p>
      <p>The flight continued onto Washington after the unscheduled landing.</p>
