      <p>The 34-year-old was substituted after just 55 minutes in Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan on Sunday, with his replacement, Paulo Dybala, scoring the eventual winner.</p>
      <p>While there have been reports that Ronaldo himself asked for to be substituted, a number of Italian and Portuguese publications have stated that he was left furious with his coach.</p>
      <p>According to<i> Il Bianconero</i>, the superstar even swore at manager Maurizio Sarri as he walked off the pitch, calling him a "son of a wh***".</p>

      <p><i>Sky Italia</i> reported that Ronaldo left the stadium three minutes before the final whistle blew, while <i>Gazetta dello Sport </i>believe he will not be fined for his actions, but is expected to apologise to his teammates for not returning to the bench.</p>
      <p>Juve sporting director Fabio Paratici reportedly contacted the superstar's agent, Jorge Mendes, to clear up the matter and find out if there were any deeper issues troubling his client.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, meanwhile, has remained silent on the incident, but did take to social media after the match against Milan to write "difficult game, important victory! #finoallafine", accompanied with an image of himself from the game.</p>
