      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:00:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> prepared for her time in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle by forest bathing to get in touch with nature.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain host says she enjoys the practice, which sees people spend time in the outdoors to increase physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Forest bathing, a term developed Japan in the 80s, is said to have numerous benefits, like reducing stress and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> , and improving memory and concentration.</p>
      <p>Kate, 52, said: “If I have an hour or two, I do a bit of forest bathing. I love being in nature, being surrounded by green. I think one of our problems in living in cities is we are completely unaware of the seasons.</p>

      <p>“We don’t have a real sense of what spring is, which is pretty brutal in the natural world, and we don’t have a sense of the warmth and generosity of autumn,” the star adds.</p>
      <p>“So that means... getting rid of the phone. And just really connect with it. Smell the smells, hear the sounds, experience the silence that isn’t silence,” she tells Positivity Podcast.</p>
      <p>The mum of two has previously said she enjoys daily walks in the park to stay in shape.</p>

      <p>She said: “Like many women of my age, I struggle with my bottom sagging, tummy wobbling and flabby upper arms. I don’t want to look old in my advanced years, so I go on a power walk for half an hour every day and it helps to keep the pounds off.”</p>
      <p>As she landed at Brisbane airport in Queensland yesterday to begin her stint on the ITV show, Kate said she thought a lot about what to pack to wear in the famous jungle shower. She said: “I’m a bit nervous. I’ve got a lot of swimming costumes.</p>
      <p>“We did have a big try-on session. It’s quite hard as I’ve got bits of my body that I’m trying to cover up. In fact, a lot of my body I’m trying to cover up. I was looking for one that goes down to my ankles.”</p>
