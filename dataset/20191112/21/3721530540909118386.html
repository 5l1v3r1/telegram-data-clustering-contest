      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019/40544"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a>’s 725 shotgun has plagued players since release. What should be a high damage short-range weapon is instead <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947809/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-recoil-kilo-141-m13-mp5-725">killing people from across the map</a>, even after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/8/20955034/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-shotgun-nerf-claymore-hardpoint-patch">Infinity Ward tried to fix it</a>. In the game’s latest patch, the developer is back at it with another nerf to the 725, along with a few other changes.</p>
      <p>This time around Infinity Ward is trying to slow the 725 down by once again reducing its range. Hopefully this time the change will be enough to keep the gun out of literally every players’ hands. In other weapon news, the M4 is getting a toned down, with a greater hip fire spread and less headshot damage. Meanwhile the FAL will now aim down sights faster and have a little bit less recoil.</p>
      <p>Another frequently-requested change that’s arriving with this patch is are adjusted footstep footstep sounds. In this patch, footsteps will always play when you’re crouched or aiming down sight, no matter how slowly you walk. On the plus side for stealthy players, you can now move just a little bit quicker while still using the walk sound effect, instead of having the louder running sound play.</p>
      <p>For a look at all the changes coming to <i>Modern Warfare</i> as part of this update, you can see the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dv5h1d/111219_update_details_and_patch_notes/">full patch notes</a> below.</p>
