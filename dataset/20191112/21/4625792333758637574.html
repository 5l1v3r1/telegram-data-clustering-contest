      <h1>Man receives response to childhood message in a bottle 9 years later and a continent away</h1>

      <p>A college student in Boston was in for quite a surprise after he received a response back to a message in a bottle he cast out to sea when he was 10-years-old.</p>
      <p>Max Vredenburgh, a sophomore at Suffolk University, <a href="https://apnews.com/b1223e17d80e432f961bc92f37aa9bc4">said</a> the message was sent out in a wine bottle at Long Beach in Rockport, Massachusetts, in August 2010.</p>
      <p>“Hello my name is Max, whoever is reading this letter please write back,” the letter read. “I’ll tell you a little about myself. I’m 10 years old, I like apples, I like the beach, my favorite colors blue, I like animals, I like cars, and I like outer space. Please write back.”</p>
      <p>Vredenburgh’s father texted him on Friday to tell him that he received a response from a man named G. Dubois, who had found the long-lost letter on a beach in southern France.</p>
      <p>“I found your message in your bottle on October 10, 2019 on a beach in France, between Contis and Mimizan,” Dubois wrote back. “According to your date, August 21, 2009, it will have taken 9 years to cover the 6000kms that separates us. You had grown a lot during that time: 10 to 19 years old.”</p>
      <p>The man also included a map of the location where the message in a bottle was discovered.</p>
