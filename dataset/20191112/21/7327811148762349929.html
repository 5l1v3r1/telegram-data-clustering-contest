      <p>NASHVILLE -- The length of the red carpet at The CMA Awards tells you what a big deal this show has become. It's almost half a block long and soon it will be packed with press to cover country music's biggest night.</p>
      <p>The red carpet was rolled out Tuesday in Nashville, but next door, inside The Bridgestone Arena, rehearsals have been underway since the weekend.</p>
      <p>The opening number places the women of country in the spotlight, and that is fitting for a CMA Awards show which has a female focus this year.</p>
      <p>"We're not just chicks with microphones," Gretchen Wilson said backstage. "Many of us write our own songs many of us own our own record labels. There's a lot more depth to us. We're not just singers."</p>
      <p>Entertainment reporter Sandy Kenyon talked to Wilson and to Sara Evans moments after they finished rehearsing their big sing-along with a dozen other female performers.</p>
      <p>Evans said she couldn't "believe that what happened just happened, that I was onstage with all those iconic women and that, that they included me."</p>
      <p>Two legendary guest hosts, Dolly Parton and Reba McEntire will share the stage with Carrie Underwood, who calls this line-up, "the dream scenario for all of us."</p>
      <p>This marks the 12th time Underwood has hosted the CMA show.</p>
      <p>"This year I feel like I'm a little more invested because it's a plight that's near and dear to my heart, like supporting women in country music, so I really want to be great," Underwood said.</p>
      <p>Underwood and the other folks participating hope to inspire a younger generation of fans, just as they were once inspired.</p>
      <p>Sarah Trahern, the CEO of the Country Music Association, summed it up.</p>
      <p>"There's gonna be young girls like I was, like Carrie Underwood was, or Dolly was, watching, hopefully singing into their hair brushes, and having little acceptance speeches with their shampoo bottles, Trahern said."</p>
      <p>7,500 CMA members, who make a living from country music, are eligible to vote to determine who wins Wednesday night.</p>
