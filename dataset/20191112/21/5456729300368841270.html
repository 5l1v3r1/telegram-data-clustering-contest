      <h1>Visa to acquire 'significant stake' in Nigeria’s Interswitch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T21:50:51+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/362607-visa-to-acquire-significant-stake-in-nigerias-interswitch.html" target="_blank">Bassey Udo</a></address>
      <p>Visa Incorporated says it has concluded plans to acquire a ‘significant’ stake in a Nigerian payments platform, Interswitch, Reuters quoted the Nigeria-based digital payments firm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The deal which reportedly involves 20 per cent stake valued at about $200 million, would successfully raise the company’s global valuation to $1 billion, launching into the exclusive status among the “unicorn” players in the Fintech-space for companies.</p>
      <p>Although the Nigerian firm confirmed the deal, it did not make its financial statement available.</p>
      <p>“The investment makes Interswitch one of the most valuable African Fintech businesses with a valuation of $1 billion,” Interswitch said in a release quoted by TechCrunch.</p>
      <p>The Visa investment could create the first of two market distinctions for Interswitch — as it shouldn’t change the Lagos-based company’s plans to go public.</p>
      <p>Despite the deal, the company said it does not change its plan to undertake an initial public offer (IPO) sometime in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Interswitch could stand as Africa’s sole tech-unicorn, as Jumia’s volatile share-price and declining market-cap since an April IPO have dropped the company’s worth below $1 billion.</p>
