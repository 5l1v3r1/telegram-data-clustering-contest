      <p>DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN (WABC) -- Brooklyn officials Tuesday announced a new initiative aimed at curbing and reversing a recent rise in anti-Semitic violence and hate crimes in the borough.</p>
      <p>Anti-Defamation League (ADL) CEO Jonathan Greenblatt and Brooklyn Borough President Eric L. Adams joined local faith leaders, elected officials and community partners to fight back.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn alone has experienced at least 93 incidents of anti-Semitic violence, harassment and vandalism in 2018 -- that number includes 13 violent anti-Semitic assaults in Brooklyn alone.</p>
      <p>The most recent involved <a href="https://abc7ny.com/police-egg-throwing-incidents-in-nyc-may-be-hate-crimes/5690276/">a string of egg-throwing incidents </a>in Borough Park over the weekend.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who would minimize egg-throwing is a problem," Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said. "This is serious."</p>
      <p>The NYPD has made it clear that three egg-throwing attacks on members of the Orthodox community in Borough Park were not considered childish pranks. Investigators are working to identify the teens for more than one reason.</p>
      <p>These trends are reversible, say representatives from the Anti-Defamation League, when public officials, community and faith leaders, educators and others stand united against hate.</p>
      <p>"ADL will be making an additional investment of $250,000 for the 2019 - 2020 school year," Greenblatt said.</p>
      <p>The program has already been rolled out in 22 Brooklyn schools and reached more than 8,200 students.</p>
      <p>"Think it's important to get into more schools," Adams said. "Because the numbers may seem like a lot, but when you look at the student population in Brooklyn, it's not a lot."</p>
      <p>The number of schools administering the program will now double, with an emphasis on Crown Heights, Williamsburg and Borough Park, where most of the incidents have taken place.</p>
