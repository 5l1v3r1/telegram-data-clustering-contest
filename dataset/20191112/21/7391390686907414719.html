      <p><i>High School Musical </i>has found its new Gabriella Montez:<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-high-school-musical-tv-series-cast-is-here-so-let-the-drama-begin-photo-15958415"> Olivia Rodrigo, who plays Nini</a> in <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-high-school-musical-series-will-feature-og-cast-member-cameo-19310848"><i>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</i>.</a> The new Disney+ show follows the students of East High School as they stage their own production of the <i>High School Musical </i>movie, and Nini lands the lead of Gabriella — a big moment for her, considering she'd previously been relegated to background roles. Rodrigo, on the other hand, is used to being in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Before joining <i>HSM: The Musical: The Series</i>, Rodrigo starred as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7111120/">Paige Olvera on the Disney comedy <i>Bizaardvark</i></a>. The show followed two best friends making online music videos, which gave Rodrigo the chance to show off her singing chops. In fact, she even <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4lssBDAmUk4e7rv2ajY6H6">sang its theme song</a>. When the series aired its final episode earlier this year, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BwLqN0Shx5_/">Rodrigo wrote on Instagram</a> that it was "a privilege to get to grow up with" the show.</p>
      <p>Now, she's moved on to Nini, who, as a total <i>HSM </i>fangirl, is ecstatic that she gets to play Gabriella. In real life, Rodrigo was just as excited. "I totally grew up watching [the <i>High School Musical </i>movies]," she recently told Decider, adding that walking into the<a href="https://decider.com/2019/11/08/high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series-olivia-rodrigo-joshua-bassett-interview/"> high school where the <i>HSM </i>trilogy was filmed</a> (and where the series also films) was a particular highlight. "[Sharpay's] pink locker is still there," she said. "It was like, "Oh my gosh. That's where [Gabriella] was when she was crying over Troy in '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiTan82bSD4&amp;feature=youtu.be">When There Was Me and You</a>.'"</p>

      <p>Rodrigo also got to write two songs for the show herself. According to Playbill, <a href="http://www.playbill.com/article/high-school-musical-the-musical-the-series-soundtrack-out-in-january-to-feature-hsm-classics-and-new-tunes">she penned "All I Want,"</a> as well as co-wrote "Just a Moment" with her co-star Joshua Bassett (who plays Nini's ex-boyfriend Ricky, aka the "new Troy.") Per Decider, "All I Want" will be featured in Episode 4, while "Just a Moment" is included in Episode 9. If you want a sneak peak, Rodrigo also writes and performs songs on Instagram — but otherwise, you'll just have to be patient<i>.</i></p>
