      <p>The Anker PowerPort III Nano is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">currently</a> on sale over at Amazon for just $15.99. Down from its regular price of $19.99. Not a huge discount, but still worth taking advantage of.</p>
      <p>This wall charger is a pretty incredible one. It's about the size of the 5W charger that Apple includes in the box with its iPhones, but it charges at 18W. Thanks to this being USB-C.</p>
      <p>Though, this is not USB-C PD, and it only goes up to 18W. So while it might be fast enough to charge a laptop, it is going to take quite some time for it to charge.</p>

      <p>The Anker PowerPort III Nano is a really small wall charger that is great for taking on the go with you, seeing as it is so small. Allowing you to toss it into your backpack, and not worry about it taking up a ton of space. That's definitely a win/win.</p>
      <p>Not only can this one charge at up to 18W, but it also has PowerIQ 3.0. Which means that even if your phone cannot charge at the 18W that this one does, it will still charge quickly. About as quickly as it can. Which is a nice addition here.</p>
      <p>The only downside to the Anker PowerPort III Nano is the fact that it does not use Gallium Nitride. A wall charger this small might make you think that it is using GaaN inside, to keep the charger cool. But when you see that it is only doing it at 18W, then you know it's still Silicon inside. With GaaN, you are able to keep the charger cool and also keep it pretty small.</p>
