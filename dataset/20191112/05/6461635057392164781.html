      <h3>Barcelona preparing an offer for new Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as they continue to look for a successor to Luis Suarez.</h3>
      <p>The Catalan champions are looking to reinforce their attacking options, with <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/07/champions-league-superstar-located-as-luis-suarezs-replacement/"><b>Suarez</b></a> becoming injury-prone as he ages and Antoine Griezmann still taking his time to settle with Barca since his summer transfer from Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is currently under contract with Arsenal until 2021, but the club’s ability to qualify for the Champions League this season plays a crucial role in keeping their superstar in North London. Emery’s side are currently in sixth place and eight points behind the top four.</p>
      <p>Barcelona’s board believe they can lure the Gabonese striker away from Premier League as they can offer him Champions League football.</p>
      <p>The Spanish giants are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/barcelona-enter-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-20834572"><b>reportedly</b></a> impressed with the 30-year-old’s pace and power and are willing to make an ambitious move for the African in January.</p>
      <p>Though the mid-season approach is likely to be unsuccessful, Barca will surely look to secure the Gabon international at the end of the season. Especially with<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/barcelona-considering-move-arsenal-striker-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-11063830/"><b> reports</b></a> claiming that a clause in Aubameyang’s contract will allow him to leave the Gunners if they don’t qualify for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The skipper joined Arsenal in 2017 from Borussia Dortmund for a club-record £56million transfer fee. Since then he has scored 40 goals in 61 appearances in the League. He secured the Golden Boot last season after scoring 22 goals for the club. The Gabonese player has recently been confirmed as the club’s new captain after Xhaka was stripped of his duties.</p>
      <p>Barcelona are also reportedly keeping an eye on Harry Kane, Rashford and Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez as possible replacements for Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Do you think Aubameyang is a good replacement for Luis Suarez?</p>
