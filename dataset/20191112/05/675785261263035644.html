      <h2>City boss Pep Guardiola will reportedly target replacements for Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Sergio Aguero after falling behind Reds in title race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:19:42+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:19</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are reportedly set for a £100million spending spree in the January transfer window after failing to keep pace with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's decision not to replace Vincent <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vincent-kompany">Kompany</a> after the captain retired at the end of last season has backfired spectacularly, with the defence looking shaky in the absence of injured centre-back Aymeric Laporte.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> will also target need replacements for midfielder David Silva, who is in his final season at the club, and Sergio Aguero, who is contracted until 2021 but is now 31.</p>
      <p>Liverpool took full advantage of City's defensive problems in their title-race showdown on Sunday, winning 3-1 at Anfield to go nine points clear of their rivals.</p>
      <p>That gives City a huge problem in their quest to win a third straight Premier League title, with Liverpool having won 11 and drawn one of their 12 Premier League games so far, and not looking like losing.</p>

      <p>City were missing regular keeper Ederson as well as Laporte, who is expected to be out until at least February with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>In Laporte's absence, midfielder Fernandinho has played out of position at centre-back, with John Stones having also had a spell out injured.</p>
      <p>Phil Foden is being groomed as David Silva's successor in the City midfield, but is not yet being given a great deal of game time in the top flight.</p>
      <p>And an eventual replacement for Aguero will also be targeted as Guardiola looks to provide competition to keep his forward line on their toes.</p>

      <p>City will aim to bring in three players in January, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7674383/Manchester-City-chequebook-try-pace-league-leaders-Liverpool.html?__twitter_impression=true">Mail</a> - which will cost them at least £100m.</p>
      <p>There has been speculation that manager Guardiola will leave the club, with his wife Cristina having already returned to Spain.</p>
      <p>But sources have said the City manager will see out the remaining 18 months of his contract.</p>
