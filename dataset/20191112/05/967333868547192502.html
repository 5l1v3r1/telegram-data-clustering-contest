      <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter has been admitted to an Atlanta hospital to relieve brain pressure from bleeding, caused by recent falls, the Carter Center announced on its twitter page.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October,Â the Carter Center said that the ex-President has been admitted to a hospital after falling at his home in Georgia.</p>
      <p>According to reports back then, he already fell at his home earlier in October, but later returned to his activities, going to Tennesse to rally volunteer builders.</p>
      <p>Carter, who was born in Georgia in 1924, served as governor of the state from 1971-1975 and won the 1976 elections, becoming 39th President of the United States.</p>
      <p>After losing his re-election to Republican candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980, Carter left the political stage and established the Carter Center - a humanitarian organisation promoting human rights across the world, which brought him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002.</p>
