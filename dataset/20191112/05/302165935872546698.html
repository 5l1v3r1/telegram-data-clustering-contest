      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 12 — Hafizuddin Gos Hambali is now the proud owner of an iPhone 7 after a phone seller came across his social media and was impressed by his hardworking and humble attitude.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who is currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in veterinary medicine at Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, was initially envious of a Twitter user who managed to receive the latest smartphone from her father by getting on the Dean’s list.</p>
      <p>Hafizuddin told <i>mStar</i> that he was not born in a wealthy family and didn’t want to trouble his dad with any requests, despite being a top-performing student who placed on the Dean’s list four semesters in a row.</p>
      <p>“Since I was young, my parents have taught me not to have a demanding attitude even though I excelled in my studies.</p>
      <p>“I was also aware that we were not well off.</p>
      <p>“My father is a widow and he has to support three kids who are still studying. That’s why I never asked him to buy me a new phone,” said Hafizuddin.</p>

      <p>The eldest of three siblings had been using the same phone since 2014 which came with a slew of complications, including problems connecting to WiFi and weak battery life.</p>
      <p>His story caught the eye of phone seller Muhammad Asyraf Ab Rahim who couldn’t help but feel moved when Hafizuddin shared photos of his various academic achievements on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Muhammad Asyraf then decided to gift the student a brand new iPhone 7 as a reward for his studious nature.</p>
      <p>“I was impressed by his achievements and I noticed that the phone Hafizuddin used was the same one that I had in 2014. To me, that was very nostalgic.</p>
      <p>“I hope that with this gift, it will give him the motivation to continue pursuing his ambition and make his family proud,” he was quoted as saying by <i>mStar</i>.</p>

      <p>In a follow-up tweet, Hafizuddin said it was an “unforgettable moment” to receive the generous gift and hoped to treat Muhammad Asyraf’s pet cats free-of-charge when he becomes a veterinarian.</p>
