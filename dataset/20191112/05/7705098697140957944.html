      <h1>The Mandalorian Gets Into a Bar Fight In New Extended Preview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:08:25+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:08</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>In less than a day, Disney+ will officially launch with the first episode of <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a>. It also happens to be the first ever live-action <a href="http://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> TV series. Naturally, Disney couldn’t resist one more chance to plug the show before tomorrow. During <b>Monday Night Football</b> on ABC, Disney+ dropped a new preview scene from <b>The Mandalorian</b>. Within this clip, the unnamed Mandalorian enters a bar and he doesn’t come back out without his bounties.</p>
      <p>Previous trailers have shown us a few moments from this scene. The big difference this time is that we briefly hear Pedro Pascal’s voice as the bar’s patrons attempt to intimidate the “Mando.” However, the Mandalorian was simply lulling them into letting their guard down before taking them out. It turns out to be an incredibly bad idea to challenge a Mandalorian in full armor. Especially when he’s gunning for you…</p>

      <p>Gina Carano co-stars in <b>The Mandalorian</b> as former Rebel, Cara Dune. Carl Weathers also appears in the series as Greef Carga, with Taika Waititi voicing IG-11, and Giancarlo Esposito appearing as Moff Gideon. Werner Herzog will play “the Client,” an enigmatic individual who hires the Mandalorian.</p>
      <p><b>The Mandalorian</b>‘s first episode will premiere on November 12, only on Disney+.</p>
