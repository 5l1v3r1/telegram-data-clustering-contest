      <p>Kashmir Divisional Commissioner Baseer Khan told <i>PTI</i> on Monday electricity supply in Srinagar district had been restored almost fully. However, residents of other parts of the Valley say they have without been electricity for 4-5 days.</p>
      <p>The lack of power supply has disrupted life in Kashmir.</p>
      <p>“I had to wash my face with a mug of water which I collected from the snowmelt from the roof. There is no electricity for the past two days in our area and we could not get the water supplied to the water tanks on the roof,” said Bashir Ahmed, a resident of Rawalpora in Srinagar, told the <i><a href="https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/untimely-snow-leaves-kashmir-powerless/71978794">Economic Times</a></i>.</p>
      <p> “On previous occasions, there was an elected government to fail us so we would direct our ire at known politicians and public faces. With all of them in jail, who should we blame now?” a local businessman told <i>The Print</i>. </p>
