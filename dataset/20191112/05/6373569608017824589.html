      <h1>Desperate woman's search for her two lost sisters in Plymouth</h1>
      <h2>Ashleigh Brown has never met her sisters, but really wants to</h2>

      <p>A woman has launched a desperate search for two sisters she has never met but who she thinks could be in Plymouth.</p>
      <p>Ashleigh Brown, 23, discovered last year that she has two siblings - Louisa and Charlotte - through her dad.</p>
      <p>She lived with her father in Mannamead for the first few years of her life before he moved to Scotland and lost touch with her.</p>
      <p>Despite hiring private detectives, Ashleigh is yet to track down her sisters who she believes have previously lived in Tavistock with their mum.</p>
      <p>"The man I refer to as dad had two children born before I was born in Plymouth," said Ashleigh.</p>
      <p>"I've not got much to go on about him or my sisters other than that their names might be Louisa and Charlotte, they share the same mum and are about two to four years older than me, so now 25 and 27, but they could be any age.</p>
      <p>"They might have been born or lived in Plymouth.</p>

      <p>"I haven't ever met them and I'm not even sure they know I exist so it's a massive leap of faith but as I found my elusive dad after 16 years on LinkedIn of all places - when two private detectives couldn't find him - anything is possible."</p>
      <p>Having been born in Plymouth, Ashleigh moved to Taunton when she was five years old and has lived there ever since. She says that she believes Louisa and Charlotte's mum is called Karen but she has never had any contact with them.</p>
      <p>"My dad's name is James McCann but he goes by Jim as far as I'm aware," added Ashleigh.</p>
      <p>"He was originally from Scotland and moved back to Dumbarton a few years after I was born. He lived with me in Grantley Gardens, Mannamead, for about two or three years.</p>
      <p>"His LinkedIn profile said he worked as a civil servant at the UK Ministry of Defence in Plymouth starting in May 2001.</p>
      <p>"His parents are called Greta and Thomas and he has three siblings - Dorothy, Margaret and Annette, who have four children between them called Gordan, Caroline, Ann and Linda.</p>

      <p>"That is basically all I have other than a few old pictures of him.</p>
      <p>"After I found my dad we had contact for a few months, met once briefly, then he disappeared again so it would mean even more to me to find my sisters and possibly build a relationship with them.</p>
      <p>"I don't think if it will work but this is my last ditch attempt. It's pretty impossible to find people who you don't know in any way but I'm hoping the power of social media will work its magic so please share it around Plymouth."</p>
