      <h1>Barcelona stars’ agenda over the international break</h1>

      <h3>The last international break of 2019 commences this week and the Barcelona players are involved in some exciting fixtures.</h3>
      <p>16 Barcelona plays are called up for their respective national teams, including 5 from Barca B. While the South American teams have their friendlies, the European players play their final two Euro 2020 qualification matches.</p>
      <p>Leo Messi makes his return for the Argentina squad since his 3 months ban at the end of the Copa America campaign.</p>
      <p>Let us have a look at which Blaugrana stars are away and what their agendas are for the next couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>(<a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/1490123/the-agenda-for-barcas-international-players"><b>Fixtures</b></a> from FC Barcelona)</p>
      <h3>Marc-André ter Stegen</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Germany – Belarus (Saturday, November 16th, 8.45 pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
        <li>Germany – Northern Ireland (Tuesday, November 19th, 8.45 pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barcelona’s first-choice goalkeeper is likely to be benched by Joachim Low as the German coach still favors Manuel Neuer over the Barca star. Germany are still fighting to qualify for Euro 2020 with Netherland currently sitting at the top with Northern Ireland trailing closely behind.</p>
      <h3>Ivan Rakitic</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Croatia – Slovakia (Saturday, November 16th, 8.45 pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
        <li>Croatia – Georgia (Tuesday November 19, 6.00pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/barcelonas-out-of-favor-star-seeks-serie-a-job/"><b>Rakitic</b></a> will look for a rare start in the upcoming international break. Croatia sits at the top of Group E and will continue to perform in the two home Euro 2020 qualifier matches. Rakitic’s performance with Croatia might have an effect on his playing days with Barcelona or the interests of other European clubs.</p>
      <h3>Sergio Busquets</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Spain – Malta (Friday November 15, 8.45pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
        <li>Spain – Romania (Monday, November 18, 8.45pm CET) – Euro 2020 qualification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sergio Busquets is the only player representing the Blaugrana in the Spanish squad. Moreno’s side have already qualified for Euro 2020 and will continue to keep their unbeaten streak in the Euro qualifiers.</p>
      <h3>Arthur Melo</h3>

      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/06/the-concerning-omission-of-arthur-melo/"><b>Arthur</b></a> has been called up by Tite’s Brazil for their two friendlies over the international break. It will be interesting to see the Brazilian with his national squad as many claim that his performance here is much better than what he displays with Barca.</p>
      <h3>Luis Suárez</h3>

        <li>Argentina – Uruguay (Monday, November 18th, 8.15 pm CET) – Friendly</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Luis <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/07/champions-league-superstar-located-as-luis-suarezs-replacement/"><b>Suarez</b></a> has forced his way to play for Uruguay despite his physical problems at Barcelona this season. He recently struggled with injury over the last few weeks and only managed to return as a substitute in Saturday’s fixture against Celta Vigo. With Barcelona’s physicians concerning over the Uruguay skipper’s ability to remain fit during the international break, Suarez will face heavy criticism if he picks up an injury over the coming week.</p>
      <h3>Leo Messi</h3>

      <p>Barça’s <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/barcelona-president-preparing-for-post-messi-era/"><b>No.10</b></a> makes his return for La Albiceleste after serving a three-month ban for his Copa America Red Card and corruption comments. Messi will face two of his team-mates during the two friendlies, Arthur Melo for Brazil, and Luis Suárez with Uruguay.</p>
