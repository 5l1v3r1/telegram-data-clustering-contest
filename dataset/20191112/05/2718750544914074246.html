      <p>Oh lord, oh zoinks, the new <i>Scoob! </i>trailer does effectively balance a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/scooby-doo/">Scooby-Doo</a> origin story with action and adventure, but mechanical chainsaw aliens? These kids have school in the morning, and one of them is just a talking dog! In the new trailer for Warner Bros.’ cinematic reboot of the mystery-solving mutt and company, the gang’s all here, with Will Forte voicing Shaggy, Frank Welker voicing Scooby-Doo and Zac Efron, Amanda Seyfried, and Gina Rodriguez rounding out the cast as Fred, Daphne, and Velma, respectively.</p>
      <p>The trailer depicts how the timeless duo of Shaggy and Scooby were born (at the beach, over a sandwich) and seemingly how they will die (on a space ship, attacked by aliens). Is there any way those aliens are somehow just a grouchy lighthouse keeper or a miserly mine owner? You know, something more familiar? We won’t know until the film drops on May 15, but here’s hoping Scrappy-Doo doesn’t have to avenge his uncle’s untimely demise. </p>
