      <p>Nevertheless, in a conversation with<i> The Hollywood Reporter</i>, Feige revealed that it would actually be Ms Marvel, Moon Knight and She-Hulk that will show up in films, although it’s unknown whether they’ll fight alongside the Avengers in ensemble films or just as supporting players in other characters’ standalone films.</p>
