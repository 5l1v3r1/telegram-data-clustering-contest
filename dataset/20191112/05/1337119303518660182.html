      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:34:00+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Amazon will be opening a new, full-size grocery store in a neighborhood of Los Angeles, and it won’t be under the Whole Foods brand, the company <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-will-launch-new-grocery-store-as-alternative-to-whole-foods/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0b">confirmed to <i>CNET</i></a> this morning.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amazon.tal.net/vx/lang-en-GB/mobile-0/appcentre-ext/brand-4/xf-05f8700e066c/candidate/jobboard/vacancy/2/adv/">Job listings</a> describe the store, which will be in Woodland Hills, California, as “Amazon’s first grocery store.” Amazon also told <i>CNET </i>that the store won’t use the company’s cashierless checkout technology from its Amazon Go stores, so it seems this grocery chain will have new Amazon branding.</p>
      <p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> first reported on a new chain of Amazon grocery stores <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18246447/amazon-grocery-chain-launch-whole-foods-go-stores">in March</a>, and the report said the new chain would offer “a different variety of products” at a “lower price point” than Whole Foods. In October, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-grocery-store-plan-moves-ahead-with-los-angeles-leases-11569927601">publication reported</a> that the first stores in this new chain would open in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The Woodland Hills store will be opening in 2020, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/amazon-is-launching-its-own-grocery-store-in-los-angeles-next-year.html">Amazon confirmed to <i>CNBC</i></a>, which also reported that the store may be housed in what was once a Toys R Us, based on Google Maps data. Aside from its Amazon Go locations, Amazon also maintains Amazon Books and Amazon 4-Star physical retail chains.</p>
