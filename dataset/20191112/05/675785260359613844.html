      <h1>UK weather forecast: Half a month's rain to fall in a day after flood misery</h1>
      <h2>The Environment Agency still has five 'danger to life' flood warnings in force today, along with a Met Office rain warning for parts of the north-west and the midlands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:24:09+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Brits have been told to expect more heavy rain in a new warning threatening to bring more flood misery for much of the UK.</p>
      <p>The alert for Thursday warns of up to 60mm of rain in certain areas, meaning almost half a month's showers could fall in one day.</p>
      <p>Downpours have resulted in flooding across the country in recent days - and the Environment Agency still has five 'danger to life' flood warnings in force across Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>The situation in the north-east should ease this afternoon, although rivers to the south-west are expected to burst their banks today, the Met Office predicts.</p>
      <p>A yellow weather warning for this morning says flooding is likely in parts of the north-west and the midlands.</p>

      <p>The Met Office warning for Thursday states: "Periods of rain are expected to become widespread and locally heavy across parts of England and Wales through Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Over western areas, particularly the higher ground of Wales, some snow is also likely, with local accumulations of a few cm possible.</p>
      <p>"Rainfall totals of 15-30 mm are likely, with some spots, particularly higher ground, seeing isolated totals of 40-60 mm."</p>
      <p>The alert warns that flooding of some homes and businesses is 'likely'.</p>
      <p>The average total rainfall in the UK during November is 121mm, meaning some places could see two weeks of rain on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Helen Roberts, a meteorologist for the Met Office, told PA that the rain will move southwards away from Yorkshire this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts said there was an "improving picture for that part of the country" but warned there could still be some heavy rain this morning.</p>
      <p>She said: "What we've got is a band of rain moving across that part of the country, particularly first thing in the morning.</p>
      <p>"It's sort of gradually going to move its way southwards as the day goes on."</p>

      <p>Five severe flood warnings from the Environment Agency remain in place around Doncaster, warning of a danger to life in the areas around the River Don at Bentley, Fishlake, Kirk Bramwith, South Bramwith and Willow Bridge Caravan Site.</p>
      <p>Thirty-eight flood warnings are in place across the country, with 12 around the River Don.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has a yellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for rain in place until midday on Tuesday, covering parts of Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Sheffield.</p>
      <p>A yellow Met Office weather warning is also in place for North Wales and across the north of England for high winds today.</p>
      <p>Ms Roberts added that today will be a "windy day for all" with the possibility of showers in places, but many people will see some good weather.</p>
      <p>"The rain will move itself southwards as the day goes on. There will be a great deal of dry and bright weather," she added.</p>
