      <h2>Arsenal and Tottenham reportedly had bids turned down for 17-year-old midfielder who became Rennes' youngest ever assist provider this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:54:40+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:54</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are set to battle Barcelona for £26m-rated Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga, according to latest reports from France.</p>
      <p>Camavinga, who turned 17 at the weekend, became his club's youngest ever debutant last December and has played in every Ligue 1 game so far this season.</p>
      <p>He also became the league's youngest ever assist provider when he set up a goal in Rennes' victory over French champions Paris-Saint Germain back in August.</p>
      <p>Camavinga is contracted to Rennes until 2022, so they will want top price for their talent if he is to leave either in January or in the summer.</p>
      <p>But a bidding war could well ensue, with United, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and Atletico Madrid all tracking the defensive midfielder, according to French publication L'Equipe.</p>

      <p>And they are not the only clubs interested in Camavinga, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund all having been linked with bids over the summer.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> had <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-tottenham-failed-bids-rennes-18999588">bids turned down</a>, according to L'Equipe.</p>
      <p>The publication reported that both the Gunners and Spurs made approaches to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rennes">Rennes</a> about the services of Camavinga, but were given short shrift by the Ligue 1 club.</p>
      <p>L'Equipe said the offers from both Arsenal and Tottenham were believed to have contained a clause that would have seen Camavinga return to Rennes for a two-year loan spell.</p>

      <p>Camavinga was born in Angola and moved to France aged two and so can represent either country, as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
      <p>Rennes boss Julien Stephan said of Camavinga's performance against PSG back in August: "He played a very interesting match, indeed, like the whole team.</p>
      <p>"We are talking to him. He is someone who is also very intellectually gifted, who knows how to question himself, who knows how to ask the right questions.</p>
