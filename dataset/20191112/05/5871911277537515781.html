      <h1>Seahawks spoil 49ers' undefeated season in NFL's Game of the Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T05:32:47+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 05:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Monday night’s primetime showdown between the division rival 49ers and Seahawks did not disappoint, as four quarters of play was not even enough time to decide the result.</p>
      <p>And, not only that, the team that entered the game undefeated saw their run come to an end in front of the home crowd at Levi’s Stadium — with MVP award frontrunner Russell Wilson leading his team on a few masterful scoring drives to spoil the party.</p>
      <p>The 49ers jumped out to a 10-0 lead, but the Seahawks used a Jadeveon Clowney scoop-and-score to climb right back in the game, and cut the deficit to three.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t the only turnover the Seahawks defense would produce, either.</p>
      <p>Seahawks cornerback Quandre Diggs picked off a pass that deflected off Kendrick Bourne’s fingertips and returned it all the way to the red zone. The Seahawks finished off that drive with a Chris Carson touchdown from a few yards out, and all of a sudden, the Seahawks had a lead.</p>
      <p>But the Niners produced a turnover of their own for a score, then new kicker Chase McLaughlin drained a field goal from 47 yards out to send the game to overtime.</p>
      <p>And it wasn’t long before McLaughlin had a chance to be the hero, but he ended up proving the moment was, indeed, too big for him. He shanked a 47-yard field goal badly with a few minutes left in overtime, given the Seahawks the life they needed.</p>
      <p>As for Seahawks kicker Jason Myers, well, he did not miss, with no time remaining, from 42 yards out.</p>

      <p>That kick gave the Seahawks a 27-24 victory, and all of a sudden, Seattle trails San Francisco by just one-half game for the division lead.</p>
      <p>What. A. Game. Both teams trailed by double digits in the game, but only one could emerge victorious.</p>
