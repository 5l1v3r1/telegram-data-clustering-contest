        <b>An acute trust is investigating a “significant” gap between mortality rates for patients admitted at weekends and those admitted during the week – which it says could be partly due to lack of “wrap around” services in the community on Saturdays and Sundays.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Medway Foundation Trust has its overall hospital standardised mortality ratio drop dramatically from a high of 116.8 in the year to September 2018, to 106.2 in the year to July 2019, according to board papers.</p>
      <p>However over the same period the weekend rate has marginally risen to 117.7, while for weekdays the figure is just 101.9.</p>
      <p>On the HSMR, a score of 100 reflects the number of actual deaths matching what is statistically expected – a figure of more than 100 means more deaths.</p>
      <p>The ratio is higher for frail patients admitted at the weekend and has peaked at over 130, while for frail patients admitted in the week the figure has fallen from around 125 to 105.</p>
      <p>In February the trust changed the way <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trust-blames-coding-problems-for-high-death-rate/7024419.article">it coded some palliative care patients</a> – which appears to have been associated with a fall in weekday mortality rates but not affected those at weekends.</p>
      <p>Medical director David Sulch told <i>HSJ </i>in a statement the HSMR had fallen further since the board report, and was now 104. He added the main factor in the fall in the HSMR from the last quarter of 2018 was a reduction in mortality for frail patients admitted during the week, which he attributed to the reintroduction of an acute frailty service. Weekend mortality had not gone up in the last 18 months, he stressed.</p>
      <p>“However, we have not seen a reduction in mortality of particular groups of patients admitted at the weekend. We are looking closely to understand the reasons, which could be related to the reduced availability of wrap around services (both internally and externally) at the weekend,” he said.</p>
      <p>”The population admitted, for example, at the weekend are older and sicker with a greater need for palliative care services: it is possible that some people who could be managed at home during the week are defaulting into hospital because of the service provision (or lack of it) at the weekend, but that would not account for the whole of the difference we are observing however.</p>
      <p>“Our therapies and older persons’ care group is investigating this difference and is expected to report its preliminary findings to the trust’s mortality and morbidity committee later this month.”</p>
      <p>NHS Improvement is also due to carry out a review of various aspects of mortality at Medway FT, including palliative care coding and weekend death rates, this month. </p>
      <p>The trust was one of 14 trusts labelled as “Keogh trusts” in 2013, which were subject to investigation because of repeatedly higher than average mortality rates, led by then-NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh. At that time, the trust had an HSMR of 113. It was subsequently put into care quality special measures but, after a change of leadership, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/medway-nhs-foundation-trust/original-special-measures-trust-exits-regime/7016581.article">was taken out of the regime in 2017</a> and rated “requires improvement” by the Care Quality Commission.</p>
