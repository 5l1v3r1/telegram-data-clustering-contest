      <p>No information was provided about the circumstances leading to his hospitalisation.</p>
      <p>Last month, Carter was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/president-jimmy-carter-hospitalised-fall-191022121511782.html">admitted</a> to Emory University Hospital three weeks after suffering a minor pelvic fracture in a fall at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was released from hospital a few days after that accident.</p>
      <p>A previous fall earlier in October required <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/jimmy-carter-injured-fresh-fall-georgia-home-191007072408121.html">stitches</a> to Carter's face, but he resumed work soon after on a homebuilding project for the nonprofit group Habitat for Humanity.</p>
      <p>In May, the former Democratic president broke his hip, also at home, requiring him to undergo surgery.</p>
      <p>He was hospitalised briefly in 2017 for dehydration and was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2015.</p>
      <h3>Respected humanitarian</h3>
      <p>Carter, a former peanut farmer and Georgia governor, defeated Republican President Gerald Ford in 1976 to become the US's 39th president, serving a single four-year term in the White House.</p>
      <p>His presidency was overshadowed by an economic recession, an energy crisis and the taking of US hostages by Iran, but he also played a leading role in brokering the Camp David Accords leading to a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.</p>
      <p>He lost his 1980 re-election bid to Republican Ronald Reagan.</p>
      <p>After leaving office in 1981, Carter went on to become a noted humanitarian. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts towards finding peaceful solutions to international conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights and promoting economic and social development.</p>
      <p>He and his wife founded the Carter Center in 1982 to carry on their international and humanitarian work.</p>
