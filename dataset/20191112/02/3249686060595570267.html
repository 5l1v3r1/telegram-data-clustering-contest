      <p>This week on '<b>Dancing with The Stars</b>', it was 'Boy bands and girl groups week'! Hannah Brown - a former '<b>Bachelorette</b>' - took to the stage dancing a tango to <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/bts">BTS</a>'s "<b>Boy With Luv</b>"feat. <b>Halsey</b>. You can watch the performance above! We do know but it could have been a little bangtan magic that caused her to get a 49 out of 50 on this performance. Congratulations to Hannah and her partner. Tell us how you feel about the performance below.</p>
