      <p>Google has highlighted its intention to label slow sites in Chome, without laying out an exact plan for how it will go about doing it. <br/><br/>In a <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html">blog post</a>, the Chrome team said it would take gradual steps to apply an "increasingly stringent criteria", and this could eventually factor in items other than just page loading speed. <br/><br/>"In the future, Chrome may identify sites that typically load fast or slow for users with clear badging. This may take a number of forms and we plan to experiment with different options, to determine which provides the most value to our users," the Chrome team said. <br/><br/>The labelling of sites would take into account historical load latencies, the team said, and would use badges to highlight when a site is authored to be slow. <br/><br/>"Further along, we may expand this to include identifying when a page is likely to be slow for a user based on their device and network conditions," the team added.</p>
      <p>Google would provide updates on its plan in the future, it said, and is now pushing for developers to lower the loading speeds of their web pages. <br/><br/>"We hope this effort will encourage more sites on the open web to provide the best possible experiences to all users," the Chrome team said.</p>
      <p>In its <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-chrome-78-is-out-forced-dark-mode-doh-trials-no-more-xss-auditor/">latest release</a>, Chrome 78, Google introduced a new customisation menu for the new tab page, tab hover cards, and forced dark mode. <br/><br/>Over Halloween, Google <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/halloween-scare-google-discloses-chrome-zero-day-exploited-in-the-wild/">released an update</a> for Chrome that patched an actively exploited zero-day. <br/><br/>"Google is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2019-13720 exists in the wild," the company said at the time.</p>
