      <p>Trump's announcement came following a series of tweets in which he urged his millions of followers to "<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194014474375761924?s=20">read the transcript</a>," and <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194031678395686912?s=20">bashed</a> US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-CA).</p>
      <blockquote>"In order to continue being the most Transparent President in history, I will be releasing sometime this week the Transcript of the first, and therefore most important, phone call I had with the President of Ukraine," reads POTUS' <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194035922066714625?s=20">tweet</a>. "I am sure you will find it tantalizing!"</blockquote>
      <p>The American commander-in-chief's Monday tweet come hours after the US House Democrats released the <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=826">transcripts</a> of impeachment inquiry testimonies from Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson, both advisors to Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201909281076908809-us-envoy-to-ukraine-kurt-volker-resigns-from-post---report/">resigned</a> in late September after being named in the whistleblower report which launched the US House's impeachment proceedings into Trump.</p>
      <p>Earlier Monday, the transcripts of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper's testimony were <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=822">released</a> as well by the House committee chairs.</p>
      <p>US House Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry in September after it was revealed in a whistleblower complaint that Trump might have attempted to pressure Zelenskyy during a July 25 phone call into investigating activities of alleged misconduct by former US Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.Â </p>
      <p>The first public hearings in the inquiry are scheduled for Wednesday and Friday.</p>
