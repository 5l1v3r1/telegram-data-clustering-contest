      <h1>Intel's Cascade Lake CPUs Impacted By New Zombieload v2 Attack</h1>

      <p>The Zombieload vulnerability disclosed earlier this year in May has a second variant that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/intels-cascade-lake-cpus-impacted-by-new-zombieload-v2-attack/">also works against more recent Intel processors</a>, not just older ones, including Cascade Lake, Intel's latest line of high-end CPUs -- initially thought to have been unaffected. From a report:<i> Intel is releasing microcode (CPU firmware) updates today to address this new Zombieload attack variant, as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday -- known as the Intel Platform Update (IPU) process. Back in May, two teams of academics disclosed a new batch of vulnerabilities that impacted Intel CPUs. Collectively known as MDS attacks, these are security flaws in the same class as Meltdown, Spectre, and Foreshadow. The attacks rely on taking advantage of the speculative execution process, which is an optimization technique that Intel added to its CPUs to improve data processing speeds and performance. Vulnerabilities like Meltdown, Spectre, and Foreshadow, showed that the speculative execution process was riddled with security holes. Disclosed in May, MDS attacks were just the latest line of vulnerabilities impacting speculative execution. They were different from the original Meltdown, Spectre, and Foreshadow bugs disclosed in 2018 because they attacked different areas of a CPU's speculative execution process.</i> <b>Further reading</b>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/flaw-in-intel-pmx-driver-gives-near-omnipotent-control-over-a-victim-device/">Flaw in Intel PMx driver gives 'near-omnipotent control over a victim device'</a>.</p>
