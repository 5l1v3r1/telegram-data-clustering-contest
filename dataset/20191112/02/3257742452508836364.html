      <p>Goldman Sachs Bank CEO Carey Halio in a statement <a href="https://twitter.com/gsbanksupport/status/1194022629419704320?s=20">posted to Twitter</a> reiterated the Apple Card application process, which is performed in partnership with a third party, does not factor gender or other introduced biases into a final determination. <br/><br/>"We have not and never will make decisions based on factors like gender," Halio said in statement reproduced on Goldman's <a href="https://twitter.com/gsbanksupport">@gsbanksupport</a> account. "In fact, we do not know your gender or marital status during the Apple Card application process."<br/><br/>That said, the company is aware of customer discontent after claims of algorithmically institutionalized sexism <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/09/allegations-of-discrimination-spawn-investigation-into-apple-card-credit-lines">surfaced over the weekend</a>. Halio in the tweet instructs Apple Card holders to reach out if they received credit lines below expectations.<br/><br/>"If you believe that your credit line does not adequately reflect your credit history because you may be in a similar situation, we want to hear from you," Halio said. "Based on additional information that we request, we will re-evaluate your credit line." <br/><br/>An image of the statement was appended by text reading "We hear you #AppleCard." <i>CNBC</i> reported on the tweet <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/goldman-sachs-to-reevaluate-apple-card-credit-limits-after-bias-claim.html">earlier today</a>.<br/><br/>On Saturday, developer and tech industry insider David Heinemeier Hansson accused both Apple and Goldman of gender bias after being granted a credit limit some 20 times higher than that of his wife. Hansson and his wife file joint tax returns. Others, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, reported similar outcomes in a lengthy Twitter thread.<br/><br/>Goldman attempted to clarify the situation in a statement <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/11/goldman-sachs-denies-claims-of-apple-card-gender-bias">on Sunday</a>, explaining that Apple Card credit lines are evaluated independently. <br/><br/>On Saturday, the New York Department of Financial Services announced intent to open an investigation into matter.</p>
