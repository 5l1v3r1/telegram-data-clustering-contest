      <p>BERLIN (AP) — A human rights group says it has asked Norwegian prosecutors to open a criminal investigation against senior Syrian officials over allegations of torture and crimes against humanity.</p>
      <p>The Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights said Tuesday it filed the complaint together with four other groups on behalf of five torture survivors.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs want Norwegian prosecutors to investigate and issue arrest warrants against 17 senior members of Syria’s security apparatus allegedly linked to 14 detention facilities in the country.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the suspects are outside of Syria. The five victims are living in Norway.</p>
      <p>Similar preliminary proceedings are ongoing in France, Sweden and Austria. In Germany, the first such case is expected to go to trial next year.</p>
