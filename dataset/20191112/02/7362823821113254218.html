      <p>Former President Jimmy Carter has been hospitalized for a procedure to reduce pressure on his brain.</p>
      <p>Carter, 95, was admitted to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Monday, with an operation scheduled for Tuesday morning, according to a statement from The Carter Center.</p>
      <p>The statement said the pressure on his brain has been caused by bleeding “due to his recent falls”.</p>
      <p>“President Carter is resting comfortably, and his wife, Rosalynn, is with him,” the statement concluded.</p>

      <p>Carter, whose birthday was Oct. 1, is the longest-living U.S. president in history.</p>
      <p>The former president <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jimmy-carter-stitches-fall-georgia-home">suffered injuries in a fall at his home last month that required received stitches above his brow</a>. He also broke his hip after suffering a fall in his home this past May while readying to go turkey hunting.</p>
      <p>The former president announced in 2016 that he no longer needed radiation to treat cancer, which had spread to spots in his brain.</p>
