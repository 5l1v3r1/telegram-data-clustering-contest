      <p>(Nov 12): A recovery in Hong Kong stocks looked fragile as protests extended into Tuesday, disrupting road and rail networks.</p>
      <p>The Hang Seng Index rose just 0.3% as of 9:35 a.m. local time, following its sudden 2.6% loss on Monday that saw the city’s shares lose $118 billion in value. Local developers and landlords dropped after starting the session higher, with Wharf Real Estate Investment Co. down 2.1%. The Hong Kong dollar weakened.</p>
      <p>Monday’s tumble came after a rally in the city’s shares that had added $530 billion amid a liquidity-fueled surge in global equities. The buying momentum was so strong it had sent the Hang Seng gauge into overbought territory for the first time since April.</p>
      <p>Protests have escalated in violence after one student died last week falling from a garage during a police dispersal operation and another was shot by a policeman. Protesters also set a man alight. Monday’s clashes led to about 260 arrests and left nearly 100 people injured. - Bloomberg</p>
