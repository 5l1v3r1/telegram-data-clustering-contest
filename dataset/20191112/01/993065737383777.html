      <p>In recent years the British government has come under pressure from Tory MPs and groups representing military veterans to find a way to prevent soldiers being prosecuted for killings carried out in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The main difficulty for the government is that any form of amnesty for former security force personnel would also have to apply to paramilitaries.</p>
      <p>It is also crucial that those who killed while on duty in circumstances that are highly questionable are not placed outside the rule of law, which must be applied equally and fairly to all citizens.</p>
      <p>Senior figures in the Tory government have struggled with the concept that veterans cannot be treated differently from members of illegal organisations who carried out murder.</p>
      <p>Former secretary of state Karen Bradley faced calls to resign after saying that killings by the military and police during the Troubles `were not crimes.'</p>
      <p>She subsequently apologised but it displayed a certain attitude that failed to recognise the sensitivities around this issue, or acknowledge that soldiers - albeit a small number - have been convicted of murder through the courts.</p>
      <p>It also ignores the views of many bereaved families and victims, who are entitled to demand that the process of justice is applied to those they believe responsible for the deaths of loved ones.</p>
      <p>Now the Tory Party has proposed amending the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents, including deaths during the Troubles, which took place before the new law came into place in 2000.</p>
      <p>Defence secretary Ben Wallace denied it was an amnesty, saying: ``This is about repeated and vexatious claims.''</p>
      <p>It is not really clear how this plan would work in practice or what the implications would be for the Good Friday Agreement but it has already met with considerable resistance.</p>
      <p>TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney said the decision was 'very concerning' and pointed out the UK and Irish governments had agreed an approach on legacy and reconciliation in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Ulster Unionist and former soldier Doug Beattie said it was only a pledge to attract votes and he would not support it.</p>
      <p>This plan smacks of a desperate attempt by Boris Johnson to appease disgruntled veterans and their supporters during the election campaign.</p>
      <p>It is poorly thought through and would not be acceptable in Northern Ireland where legacy issues need to be dealt with properly and with due regard to the law.</p>
