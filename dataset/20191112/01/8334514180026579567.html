      <p>Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno was suspended three games on Monday for elbowing Colorado Avalanche forward Pierre-Edouard Bellemare two nights earlier.</p>
      <p>Foligno drew a five-minute charging penalty and a game misconduct for the hit. He left his skates near center ice as Bellemare approached and drove his left elbow into the opponent’s face.</p>
      <p>The league’s ruling means that Foligno is set to miss a Tuesday road game at Montreal, a Friday home game against the St. Louis Blues and a Nov. 19 home game against the Canadiens.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Buffalo, N.Y., native has one goal and six assists in 17 games this season. He has appeared in 858 games in 12-plus NHL seasons, producing 187 goals and 255 assists.</p>
