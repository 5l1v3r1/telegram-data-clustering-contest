      <p>Grace Millane's alleged killer claimed he was dying of cancer during a Tinder date with another woman, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old defendant stands accused of killing British backpacker Grace in New Zealand after the pair met through the dating app Tinder.</p>
      <p>He is currently on trial for her murder, although he claims she died by accident during rough sex.</p>
      <p>Another woman, who also went on a date with the man, branded him a 'sociopath' today and said he lied to her about having cancer.</p>
      <p>She also told the jury that he pretended to be related to a top New Zealand rugby star.</p>
      <p>The witness, a university student, previously told the court she thought she was going to die when he suffocated her as she gave him oral sex.</p>

      <p>She denied persistent attempts by the man’s barrister Ron Mansfield to suggest she had made up her story to explain her dealings with the man when she learned he had been charged with murder.</p>
      <p>“You’re attempting to turn this encounter into something quite different,” said Mr Mansfield. “You wanted to portray him in the worst possible light.</p>
      <p>“You wanted to portray yourself as a bit of a victim.”</p>
      <p>But she told the court: “It was one of the worst days of my life. You can’t take that away.</p>
      <p>“He would have seen me kicking and writhing, you can’t say that I was enjoying it.”</p>
      <p>The woman, whose identity is protected, said the man had pretended to be dying of cancer on the night of their Tinder date in November last year, just a month before Grace died in the same apartment.</p>

      <p>He also said he was the cousin of a New Zealand Rugby World Cup winner, she claimed.</p>
      <p>He even pretended to call the star and leave a phone message for him, she told the court.</p>
      <p>The man also allegedly boasted about a £266,420 business deal he had pulled off that day and allegedly told her he had been raped by a male relative but had enlisted members of a gang to chase the man away.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t believe a word he said,” she said.</p>

      <p>“A person who almost killed someone by suffocating them, then to claim to be in pain to make me feel sympathy to get me to stay...</p>
      <p>"There's a word for that - a sociopath.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mansfield referred to a huge archive of text messages the woman had exchanged with the man after the alleged suffocation incident, in which she suggested continuing their relationship and told him: “I hope you still want me.”</p>
      <p>The barrister suggested the man had got off her when she stopped performing oral sex and that her version was invented.</p>
      <p>“Can I suggest to you that if anything as horrific as this had happened you wouldn’t have engaged in 708 message with him in the following days would you?” said Mr Mansfield. “You could have just ghosted him.”</p>

      <p>But the woman told the court: “I was scared of him. I didn’t want him showing up in my life. It doesn’t make sense to you but I did what I felt I had to do to feel safe.”</p>
      <p>She said she had not told anyone about the incident until she was questioned by police five months later.</p>
      <p>“I was ashamed and embarrassed that I had put myself in a dangerous position,” she said.</p>
      <p>The defendant is accused of strangling Grace during sex on December 1 or 2 last year and burying her naked body in a suitcase in the woods.</p>
      <p>He denies murder and claims her death was accidental after she asked him to choke her during sex.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
