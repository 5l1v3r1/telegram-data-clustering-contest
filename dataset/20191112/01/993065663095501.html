      <p>A US CONGRESSMAN who acted as a go-between for Bill Clinton and Gerry Adams during the peace process will not seek re-election in 2020.</p>
      <p>New York congressman Peter King said in a Facebook post he wanted "flexibility to spend more time" with his children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Republican has spent 28 years in Congress. He is known for his hard-line stance on immigration and crime.</p>
      <p>A proud Irish-American, he was closely linked to Irish republican fundraising group Noraid in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>In 2011, King likened the IRA to the African National Congress and the Zionist Irgun in Israel.</p>
      <p>"The fact is, the IRA never attacked the United States. And my loyalty is to the United States," he said.</p>
      <p>He described the Troubles as “a dirty war on both sides” .</p>
      <p>In the 1990s, he played a key role in peace talks which led to the Good Friday agreement, acting as a go-between for President Clinton and then Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams.</p>
      <p>In 2009, it was reported that then President Barack Obama offered Mr King the chance to be US ambassador to the Republic but the congressman declined.</p>
