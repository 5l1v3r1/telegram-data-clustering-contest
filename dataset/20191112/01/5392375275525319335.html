      <p>The Galaxy Fold has recently been released in the Chinese stronghold. <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung’s</a> first batch of the foldable smartphone has gone sold out in just a couple minutes after the start of sales. Today, the company kicked off the second batch of Galaxy Fold units and once again it has <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/456/209.htm">sold out</a> in a couple of minutes.</p>
      <p>The South-Korean company decided that the 11.11 big sales event in China was a great opportunity to put more units of its foldable smartphone on the table. However, just like in the first time, Samsung didn’t disclose the actual number of units sold. The device is being sold for a high price tag of above $2,000. So we really doubt that we have record-breaking sales here. However, it’s interesting to see how Samsung’s foldable device is performing in the Huawei Mate X’s stronghold.</p>

      <p>The Huawei Mate X is currently the Galaxy Fold major rival in the foldable smartphone scene. This particular niche of devices will win another member from Samsung in the coming weeks – The Galaxy W20. It is a clamshell based foldable smartphone and will be  Samsung’s second attempt in the foldable segment.</p>
      <p>In the next year, the foldable smartphone segment will win additional competition from other smartphone manufacturers. For now, we will keep an eye on the Galaxy Fold news to see if it will be a hit for Samsung. Especially after all the problems with its launch.</p>
