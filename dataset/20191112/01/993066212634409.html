      <p>THIS is the man <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/09/news/man-convicted-over-menacing-online-communications-in-belfast-roma-intimidation-probe-1760952/">convicted for sending "menacing" online communications</a> following a police probe into exploitation and intimidation of south Belfast's Roma community.</p>
      <p>Daniel Serban is seen pictured with Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir while wearing the Lord Mayor of Belfast's chain of office.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old's conviction is understood to relate to the sharing online of images of intimidating posters put up in south Belfast last year.</p>
      <p>Posters had appeared on walls which named and made false allegations about two Early Years staff who worked closely with the Roma community.</p>

      <p>It came after whistleblowers had contacted the Belfast Trust alleging that a community organisation was charging Roma "large sums of money" for what should be free benefits advice – and "fraudulently filling out benefits applications without their consent".</p>
      <p>The trust in response moved its Early Years services from the organisation's Holylands offices to another venue, citing concerns of "exploitation and community control".</p>
      <p>The charity, the Romanian Roma Community Association of Northern Ireland (RRCANI), strongly denied the allegations. It has also insisted the organisation had no involvement with the intimidating posters.</p>
      <p>At the time the allegations began circulating online, Mr Ó Muilleoir tweeted his support for the group, dismissing the claims as "junk" and saying he was "proud to stand with RRCANI".</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Muilleoir had also written to the trust criticising the decision to move children's services from RRCANI.</p>
      <p>The South Belfast MLA later said in a statement that Sinn Féin is "opposed to all forms of racism, exploitation and intimidation" and called for a thorough police investigation.</p>
      <p>The picture of Serban wearing the mayoral chain was taken when Mr Ó Muilleoir was Belfast lord mayor around five years ago – long before last year's RRCANI controversy emerged.</p>
      <p>In a statement yesterday, Mr Ó Muilleoir said he had his picture taken as mayor with thousands of people.</p>
      <p>"I do not know Mr Serban and condemn any intimidation he or anyone else carried out against hard-working daycare workers," he said.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with information about this activity should do as I did by bringing all information to the PSNI."</p>
      <p>He said Sinn Féin "has not had any involvement or engagement with RRCANI since these malicious posters were distributed".</p>
      <p>Mr Ó Muilleoir, a former Stormont finance minister, is believed to be leaving politics.</p>
      <p>In 2017 he was Sinn Féin's Westminster election hopeful, but the party is not fielding a candidate in the constituency this time to make way for other anti-Brexit parties.</p>
      <p>Serban, of Tildarg Street in Belfast, was convicted in his absence last Thursday of improper use of an electronic communications network.</p>
      <p>A second man – Florin Bondor (32), of Thorndale Avenue in the north of the city – has been brought to court charged with the same offence.</p>
      <p>He denies the charge and the case at Belfast Magistrates Court has been adjourned until later this week.</p>
      <p>Both were accused of sending "by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that was of a menacing character" in October last year.</p>
      <p>Serban, a member of the Roma community in Northern Ireland, had entered a not guilty plea but was convicted on Thursday at Laganside courthouse in his absence. His case has also been adjourned until later this week.</p>
      <p>The PSNI last week confirmed its wider investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>"Our investigation into exploitation and criminality affecting the Roma Community, led by Criminal Investigation Branch in Belfast, is continuing," a spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>She thanked those who have come forward so far and appealed for anyone in the community with information to phone police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
