      <p><b>Jaguar Land Rover</b> doesn’t see a slinky silhouette and reduced off-road ability as being impediments for a <b>Range Rover</b>-branded product, while it also sees an opportunity for the eponymous <b>Range Rover</b> to go even further upmarket.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/land-rover/108346/new-2021-range-rover-crossover-to-put-design-and-luxury-ahead-of-off-road-ability"><i>Auto Express</i></a> reports the new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/range-rover/">Range Rover</a> crossover – referred to in the past as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/802133/land-rover-ev/">Road Rover</a> – will be the lowest and sleekest SUV ever to bear the Range Rover name, while the flagship Range Rover will be positioned to better rival the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bentley/bentayga/">Bentley Bentayga.</a></p>
      <p>On the new model line’s unorthodox design and more road-focused performance, Land Rover design director Gerry McGovern told <i>Auto Express</i>, “For me, what we’ve actually shown is the ability of the brand to stretch and be different. We always have been quite pioneering. Let me just put it this way – if people like Bentley and Rolls-Royce can do an SUV, why can’t Land Rover or Range Rover do a luxury car?”</p>

      <p>Both the upcoming fifth-generation <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/range-rover/range-rover/">Range Rover</a> and this new SUV will share the Modular Longitudinal Architecture, which will also be used for the next <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/768297/jaguar-xj-and-range-rover-to-feature-both-electric-petrol-drivetrains-report/">Range Rover Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/jaguar/xj/">Jaguar XJ</a>.</p>
      <p>The two SUVs will also use a wide range of powertrains, including plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid variants and the brand’s first all-electric powertrain, though not all will be available at launch. The Range Rover EV should arrive in 2022.</p>
      <p>The MLA architecture supports batteries as large as <b>100kWh</b>, capable of providing an electric range of around <b>482km</b>. Both SUVs will use electric motors on both axles, though the flagship SUV will likely use a larger battery.</p>
      <p>Though the new Range Rover model line will be the brand’s most rakish yet, the regular Range Rover’s design will take a more evolutionary approach.</p>
