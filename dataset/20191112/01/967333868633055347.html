        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The French energy giant Electricity of France (EDF) temporarily suspended the operation of the Cruas-Meysse nuclear power plant's three reactors in the Ardeche department after an earthquake in southeastern France, the company said in a statement.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Initial inspections at Cruas-Meysse NPP have not highlighted any apparent damage. However, vibration was recorded requiring additional preventive testing. Erring on the side of caution, EDF has decided to suspend operation of Cruas-Meysse units 2, 3 and 4 on a temporary basis in order to perform these tests", the statement read.</blockquote>
      <p>The EDF noted that nuclear power plants in Bugey, Saint-Alban and Tricastin continued to operate.</p>
      <p>The company also noted that the shutdown of the reactors began at 6.00 p.m. (17:00 GMT). The first reactor was halted for scheduled maintenance before the earthquake.</p>
      <p>The earthquake with a magnitude of 5.4 <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911111077279591-49-magnitude-earthquake-hits-southern-france-report/">occurred near the city of Montelimar in the southeast of the country</a> at 11.52 a.m. local time (10:52 GMT) on Monday. According to French media, tremors lasted about ten seconds and were felt in several other cities, including in Lyon, Montpellier and Avignon.</p>
