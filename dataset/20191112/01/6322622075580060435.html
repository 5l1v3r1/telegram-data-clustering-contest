      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): Cycle &amp; Carriage Bintang Bhd’s (CCB) shares surged 29.46% this morning after its controlling shareholder Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage Ltd (Jardine CCL) proposed to the board to undertake a selective capital reduction and repayment (SCR) at RM2.20 per share.</p>
      <p>At 9,02am, CCB rose 38 sen to RM1.67, valuing it at RM168.24 million.</p>
      <p>The proposed SCR will pave the way for the privatisation of the auto player, the share price of which has been downhill in the past few years to a 10-year low. The stock was last traded at RM1.29.</p>
      <p>“Upon the completion of the proposed selective capital repayment, Jardine CCL will own 100% equity interest in CCB and Jardine CCL does not intend to maintain the listing status of CCB on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia,”it said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Affin Hwang Capital Research CCB to “Buy’ at RM1.29 with a higher target price of RM2.20 (from 96 sen) the privatisation offer.</p>
      <p>In a note today, the research house said the privatisation exercise is a good opportunity for CCB’s shareholders to exit their investment.</p>
      <p>“We deem the offer price of RM2.20/share attractive,considering that CCB is still loss making and likely to continue facing a challenging retailing environment in the next few years.</p>
      <p>“We upgrade our target price and rating to reflect the privatisation offer,” it said.</p>
