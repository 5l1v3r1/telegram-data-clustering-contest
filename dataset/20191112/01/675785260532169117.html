      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Myles Stephenson 'to quit Rak-Su after jungle experience'</h1>
      <h2>Former X Factor winner Myles Stephenson has admitted that despite being single he is not ready to mingle among the creepy crawlies and find love with another campmate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-12T01:59:30+00:00">12 Nov 2019, 01:59</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Myles Stephenson has admitted that he would quit R&amp;B band Rak-Su if his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> experience presented him with new opportunities.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner has said that while he has enjoyed his time with the band, he doesn't want to be 'held back' if the ITV show opened new doors for him.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of entering the jungle, Myles said: "They are really supportive and they totally understand.</p>
      <p>"I would love to stay in the band but if other opportunities come along my way as well after this, you have to take it by the scruff of the neck.</p>
      <p>"They would do the same. I would never hold them back.”</p>

      <p>Despite this, Myles believes his Rak-Su band mates can’t wait to watch him and will look to have an influence on his time Down Under.</p>
      <p>“I know they will vote to try and make me do the trials,” he adds.</p>
      <p>Myles is one of this year’s Jungle bachelors he has ruled out finding romance in the Jungle.</p>
      <p>He has insisted he wants to embrace single life and he definitely doesn’t want to find love under the stars.</p>
      <p>Myles said: "I am single. I have just got out of a relationship but I think I want to be single for a bit and embrace single life!”</p>
      <p>He admits that he is excited about meeting I'm A Celebrity hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, especially as he is a massive fan of the Geordie duo.</p>

      <p>Myles said: “Going on I’m a Celebrity is going to be so much harder than doing The X Factor but I am so excited. I have watched it for years and it is something I have always wanted to do.</p>
      <p>"I am a massive fan of the show and Ant and Dec. They were the reason I was a Newcastle FC fan initially growing up! Spending time with them and potentially people you have idolised over the years is so exciting.”</p>

      <p>There could be plenty of time spent at the campfire for Myles as he describes himself as a ‘passionate’ cook, and promises to give it his best shot when trying to rustle up food from basic rations.</p>
      <p>“I love cooking and I cook every night if I am not touring,” he reveals. “My favourite meal is Beef Wellington or West Indian food. You don’t get much to mess around with in the Jungle but I will try my best.”</p>
