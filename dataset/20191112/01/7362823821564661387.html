      <p>"Today is Remembrance Day and also Veterans Day in the United States, a day to honour those who have bravely served in the Armed Forces," the caption read. "Thank you to all, for your service, sacrifice and commitment.</p>
      <p>"It has been an important week to recognise those who serve (and have served) as well as to acknowledge their families," the caption continued. "In 2014, The (now) Duchess of Sussex proudly went on @TheUSO tour with the Chairman of The Joint Chiefs of Staff, visiting troops in five countries: Spain, Italy, Turkey, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom.</p>
