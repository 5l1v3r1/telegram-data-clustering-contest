      <p>A PROMINENT member of Northern Ireland's Roma community who was arrested in a police probe into intimidation has been granted British citizenship.</p>
      <p>Nicolae Nicola (30) has been the public face of a south Belfast organisation called the Romanian Roma Community Association of Northern Ireland (RRCANI).</p>
      <p>RRCANI, based in the Holylands, has been at the centre of a PSNI probe into claims of exploitation and intimidation of the area's Roma community.</p>
      <p>RRCANI has strongly denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicola was arrested in February and police later sent a file to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) to consider the alleged offences of harassment and attempted intimidation.</p>
      <p>The PPS decided not to pursue a prosecution after concluding that its evidential test had not been met.</p>
      <p>Late last month, Mr Nicola attended a ceremony along with dozens of other people at the Lagan Valley Island centre in Lisburn as they formally received British citizenship.</p>
      <p>He updated his Facebook profile picture to show what appeared to be his "certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen".</p>
      <p>Decisions to grant British citizenship are determined by UK Visas and Immigration, which is part of the Home Office.</p>
      <p>Naturalisation applicants are subject to a 'good character' requirement, for which officials would consider factors such as previous convictions.</p>
      <p>A police spokeswoman said: "The PSNI is unable to comment on named individuals and no inference should be drawn from this."</p>
