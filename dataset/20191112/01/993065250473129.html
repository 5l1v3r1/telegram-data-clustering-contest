      <p>A MAN allegedly punched and kicked his 15-year-old son unconscious after discovering him selling drugs outside a north Belfast bar, a court heard yesterday.</p>
      <p>Police said the 40-year-old defendant is accused of stamping on the youth's head and rendering him temporarily unconscious during the incident on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be named due to reporting restrictions, faces charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing cannabis.</p>
      <p>He denies attacking his son and challenged the reliability of the case against him.</p>
      <p>Belfast Magistrates' Court heard claims that the teenager recalled being punched up to eight times and stamped on before losing consciousness.</p>
      <p>But a defence lawyer argued that the boy provided a different account at first.</p>
      <p>"At no point did he allege that he was knocked out," the solicitor insisted.</p>
      <p>District Judge Fiona Bagnall was told the accused initially phoned police to seek their help.</p>
      <p>"He had apprehended his son outside a bar in north Belfast selling drugs," the lawyer submitted.</p>
      <p>"He told him to come home with him, searched him and found a syringe on and he found drugs on him - the drugs were heroin."</p>
      <p>During cross-examination a police officer accepted reference had been made to a needle being discovered on the youth.</p>
      <p>Granting bail to the accused, Mrs Bagnall banned him from contacting either his son or ex-partner.</p>
      <p>She also imposed an exclusion zone and listed the case for further review in four weeks time.</p>
