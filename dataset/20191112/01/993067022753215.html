      <p>THE Orange Order did not respond directly to an invitation by Mary Lou McDonald to meet the institution and attend Twelfth celebrations.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, just weeks after becoming leader of Sinn Féin, Ms McDonald told The Irish News that she would be writing to the Orange institution requesting a meeting.</p>
      <p>She said she aimed to "speak to sections of society who wouldn't necessarily have had a dialogue or a relationship" with the party.</p>
      <p>"We need to stretch out the hand of friendship, go to places you're not necessarily comfortable or familiar with," the Dublin TD said at the time.</p>
      <p>When asked yesterday if the Orange Order had responded directly, Ms McDonald said it had not.</p>
      <p>She described it as a "great pity".</p>
      <p>The Sinn Féin leader said she was not trying to "persuade those that are British not to be British or those that are Orange not to be Orange".</p>
      <p>"I just think it’s important that there is at least a civility and dialogue between the leaderships of the great traditions on our island," she said.</p>
      <p>Last year Orange Order grand secretary Mervyn Gibson claimed there were "335 reasons" not to engage with the party – a reference to loyal order members killed by republicans during the Troubles.</p>
