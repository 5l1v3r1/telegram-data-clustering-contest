      <p>Fans of the South Korean group accused Roman of 'racism' and 'xenophobia' in September 2018 when he was talking about BTS' single IDOL - a collaboration with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicki-minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "That was BTS and Nicki Minaj, that noise you were just hearing there..."</p>
      <p>After he was called out on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Roman apologised and insisted he was "shocked and appalled" by some of the "offensive" messages he'd posted in the past.</p>

      <p>He insisted he'd cleaned up his account and deleted the offending tweets, telling followers he was "ashamed" and "truly, deeply and utterly sorry".</p>
      <p>Now, the prospective campmate has said that he would be willing to delete his social media completely.</p>
      <p>Roman said: "I love this programme so much. I love it when it kicks off with the first show and you see Ant and Dec arrive.</p>
      <p>“I will be happy to get rid of social media but the thing I will miss most is speaking to my parents and my girlfriend.”</p>
      <p>Roman has some famous parents, pop favourite and former EastEnders star Martin Kemp and Shirlie, of Wham! Pepsi and Shirlie fame.</p>
      <p>He said there is mixed emotions about his time coming up in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Roman said: "My Dad loves it. He is ready to find the worst freeze frame possible of my face and put it out on social media! Mum will say she hates it up until the day I get in there.</p>
      <p>"Once she sees the show, understands it and grasps I am in there, I think she will be alright. She is really nervous though!”</p>

      <p>He is happy to crawl around with spiders and creepy crawlies but put Capital Radio’s Roman Kemp in a coffin with cotton wool and he will most definitely freak out.</p>
      <p>Roman admitted: “Some of the fears I have got are odd.</p>
      <p>"I have got a strange fear of cotton wool. Why am I scared? It’s the texture and sound of it. I can’t even talk about it without getting scared and I definitely can’t touch it!”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know when this fear first started but the only way I can describe it is like a nail going down a chalkboard – it has that effect on me. I hate it so much that if I am in a coffin with cotton wool, then that is going to be the worst thing ever for me!”</p>
      <p>“I am fine though with things like insects and spiders!”</p>
