      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 12 — Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi apologised yesterday after he called the assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in which Riyadh admitted responsibility, a “mistake.”</p>
      <p>“There's no forgiving or forgetting what happened to Jamal Khashoggi &amp; I was wrong to call it a 'mistake,'” Khosrowshahi tweeted yesterday morning as he walked back his remarks Sunday in an interview with Axios.</p>
      <p>“I said something in the moment I don't believe. Our investors have long known my views here &amp; I'm sorry I wasn’t as clear on Axios.”</p>
      <p>Khashoggi, a columnist for <i>The Washington Post</i>, was strangled and dismembered at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, prompting harsh criticism of the country and de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia, through its sovereign wealth fund, is the fifth largest shareholder in the ride-hailing company, and the fund's governor, Yasir al-Rumayyan, sits on its Uber's board of directors.</p>
      <p>The Uber chief's comments caused an uproar in the United States.</p>
      <p>“I think that government said that they made a mistake,” he said in the interview Sunday, likening the incident to a fatal crash of a self-driving Uber vehicle that killed a pedestrian in March 2018.</p>
      <p>“I think that people make mistakes and that doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven,” Khosrowshahi said, after the Axios reporter pressed him on the comparison between an assassination and a traffic accident.</p>
      <p>The reporter confirmed that the executive called him shortly after the interview to “express regret for the language he used” about the Khashoggi murder.</p>
      <p>Khosrowshahi downplayed the kingdom's role in Uber, saying “they're just like any other shareholder” investing in a publicly-traded company. “And they're a big investor just like you could be a big investor.”</p>
      <p>Uber's went public in May but the share offering has been a huge disappointment to investors, falling to US$27 (RM111) yesterday compared to the IPO price of US$42. And documents filed Friday with showed Uber's boss sold 21 per cent of his shares for some US$547 million. — AFP</p>
