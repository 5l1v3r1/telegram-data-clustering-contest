      <p>State law says the maximum allowable solitary confinement term is 30 days. Officials then have to conduct a review.</p>
      <p>Starting in 2009, Vermillion was put in solitary at Westville Correctional Facility. Attorney Maggie Filler of the Chicago-based MacArthur Justice Center said Vermillion was given more time without an explanation.</p>
      <p>“Most people who enter prison are one day going to get out,” Fill said. “And they’re going to be living in free society. So it’s incumbent upon us to make sure that the prison experience is more rehabilitative than it is just purely destructive.”</p>
      <p>Vermillion described his conditions in solitary as a cold “concrete tomb.” He had no direct contact with others.</p>
