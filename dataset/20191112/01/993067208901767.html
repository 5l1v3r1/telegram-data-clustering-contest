      <p>AN SDLP assembly member and a former Eurovision singer are opening a pub in Co Tyrone.</p>
      <p>West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan is launching The Railway Bar and Lounge in Strabane with performer Ryan Dolan.</p>
      <p>They have set up a hospitality company as co-directors and their pub premises is undergoing a refit ahead of a grand opening.</p>
      <p>Mr McCrossan is the SDLP's Westminster election candidate for West Tyrone and is also the party's Brexit spokesperson.</p>
      <p>The SDLP said that while he "is involved in other projects" he remains "totally committed to the people of West Tyrone".</p>
      <p>The Railway Bar replaces the old Sweeno McGintys pub on Railway Street in the town.</p>
      <p>Images posted on its Facebook page show the refurbishment work under way, which they hope will give the bar "relaxing, cosy and fresh new surroundings".</p>
      <p>No date has been set for its launch, but the pub is in the process of recruiting bar and floor staff.</p>
      <p>In a message on the page, Mr McCrossan and Mr Dolan said: "Thank you for the many messages of support, well wishes and many suggestions.</p>
      <p>"We are looking forward to seeing you soon."</p>
      <p>Mr Dolan (34) represented Ireland at Eurovision in 2013 with the song Only Love Survives.</p>
      <p>He progressed through the semi-finals of the annual song contest, but came last in the final with just five points.</p>
      <p>In April, the pair set up a publicly registered company called White Strand Investments with an address at a domestic property in Strabane.</p>
      <p>It has been recorded in Mr McCrossan's MLA register of interests, where it is described as a "hospitality business".</p>
      <p>The venture emerges as Mr McCrossan in September returned to university part-time amid Stormont's continued absence to study a postgraduate business course.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old law graduate is studying a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) at Queen's University Belfast.</p>
      <p>The West Tyrone representative said he believes the two-year course will help him "up-skill" to better represent his constituents.</p>
      <p>He said it "won't in any way affect my duties and obligations as an MLA".</p>
      <p>The north has not had a fully functioning devolved assembly since power-sharing collapsed in early 2017, and since then several MLAs have moved to other roles.</p>
      <p>Ex-DUP minister Simon Hamilton left politics to become chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, while Sinn FÃ©in's Michaela Boyle gave up her West Tyrone assembly seat after being elected to Derry and Strabane council.</p>
      <p>Former Green Party leader Steven Agnew also stood down as a North Down MLA to head a renewables industry organisation.</p>
      <p>An SDLP spokesman said: "Daniel McCrossan is a full-time MLA, working seven days a week and available to constituents in his office Monday to Friday.</p>
      <p>"Mr McCrossan is involved in other projects but is totally committed to the people of West Tyrone and the very busy local services he provides for his constituents."</p>
