      <p>TORONTO -- A daycare worker in the United Kingdom is accused of being a prolific sexual predator with some victims being as young as two, police said.</p>
      <p>Under British law, the suspect at the centre of the case can’t be named, but authorities said a male worker in Torquay, U.K. was charged with sexual assault.</p>
      <p>As many as 100 families have been alerted by police that their child may have been victimized.</p>
      <p>The alleged crimes took place at the Jack and Jill Childcare nursery school and have shaken the quiet community along England’s southwest coast.</p>
      <p>Police said the suspect had access to more than 100 young children -- some barely old enough to walk.</p>
      <p>There’s no evidence to suggest the case involves child pornography, investigators said. Police said the suspect is believed to have acted alone.</p>
      <p>The case appears to have been prompted by the parents of a child who filed an abuse complaint with police. This led to authorities watching approximately 250 hours of footage from inside the facility.</p>
      <p>“As a result of that review, we have now identified a number of children aged two years and over who we believe to be potential victims of further contact offenses," police chief inspector James Stock said at a press conference.</p>
      <p>The suspect is under strict bail conditions until a court appearance later this month. He’s also left the area, but that's done little to comfort for parents.</p>
      <p>One mother who didn’t want to appear on camera has a child who attended the daycare and said her trust has been shaken.</p>
      <p>"That nursery is fantastic. It's like a family. We trusted our children being there and we haven't had any doubts, so it's a huge, huge shock,” she said.</p>
      <p>The case has also been alarming for neighbours.</p>
      <p>"It's just really shocking, it's worrying and upsetting that that could happen," a neighbour said.</p>
      <p>Another woman echoed those thoughts, adding, "I feel for the families."</p>
      <p>On the door of the school is a notice saying the facility is closed and its license has been temporarily suspended. It reads, “the purpose of the suspension is to allow time to investigate our belief that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm.”</p>
