      <p>Game designer and Silent Hill fan Zero Trace Operative has spent the last five months recreating the opening of the first game in the Silent Hill series in first-person. This concept demo is playable now, and although it's only about four minutes long it's a powerful hit of nostalgia for anyone who spent a chunk of 1999 being terrified of foggy streets and air-raid sirens.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://zerotraceoperative.itch.io/silenthill/devlog/107678/silent-hill-remake-demo-the-journey">ZTO's blog about this demo</a>, the assets are traced from model extractions rather than being ripped directly from the actual game, but they're still eerily familiar, even in this new perspective.</p>
      <p><a href="https://zerotraceoperative.itch.io/silenthill">You can download the Silent Hill Remake demo from itch.io</a>. ZTO has no plans to continue work on this fan tribute, and considers it complete as it stands.</p>
