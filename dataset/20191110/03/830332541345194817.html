      <h1>‘Boondocks' character replaced with Kanye West in MAGA hat</h1>
      <h2>Photo has been taken down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T03:30:31+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alaa Elassar, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Some might call Kanye West a character. But to someone on the internet, he's not a very good one.</p>
      <p>An unidentified person replaced the photo of Uncle Ruckus, a racist character in the popular animated series "The Boondocks," with a picture of Kanye wearing a red "Make America Great Again" hat.</p>
      <p>So when Google searching "The Boondocks," or "Uncle Ruckus", you get a photo of Kanye instead.</p>
      <p>While its unclear when exactly the photo was replaced, it was taken down Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In the show, Uncle Ruckus is a black character -- and a white supremacist who often goes on racist rants against black people,</p>
      <p>In one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X6lqD5gZdg">episode</a>, Uncle Ruckus says, "The key to happiness is to eliminate all black women from your life."</p>
      <p>The character, voiced by Gary Anthony Williams, also said he didn't consider himself black and applied ointment with bleach to lighten his skin.</p>
      <p>"I start each day by thanking the white man for the sunrise, for the land I walk on, for the air I breathe," the character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjumUKsToJQ">says</a>.</p>
      <p>To put it simply, racist slurs and antiblack ideologies are Uncle Ruckus' main personality trait.</p>
      <p>Kanye, himself, has faced critics for his support of Trump, and his MAGA hat, which he said made him feel like "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/politics/kanye-west-donald-trump/index.html">Superman</a>".</p>
      <p>The rapper, who <a href="https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989179757651574784?lang=en">called</a> Trump his "brother," also has a history of offhanded remarks, like the one time he said slavery was a choice.</p>
      <p>"When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... For 400 years? That sounds like a choice," Kanye <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/entertainment/kanye-west-slavery-choice-trnd/index.html">said</a>, during a TMZ interview.</p>
      <p>He also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/opinions/kanye-west-oval-office-meeting-clay-cane/index.html">spoke</a> out against putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, and he called Malcolm X unrelatable and criticized Obama for failing to reduce the murder rate in Chicago.</p>
