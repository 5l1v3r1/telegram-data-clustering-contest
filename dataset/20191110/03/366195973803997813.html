      <p>Last month, TOBi graced our ears with his "Beige" track, following up on this year's <i>STILL</i> debut album. Now, the Nigerian-Canadian rapper and singer has doubled back to share his newest "Faces" track. Teaming up with producers Sango and Wax Roof for the cut's backdrop, TOBi delivers on yet another smooth offering that finds him vacillating between life's thrills and introspective dips.</p>
      <p>“When Sango sent me the beat, the words immediately manifested naturally and effortlessly because it was exactly what was on my mind, TOBi tells The FADERofthenew release. "I walk into so many different rooms and spaces that I’ve learned to deal with the unfamiliar faces by keeping myself grounded regardless of who I’m in front of.”</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics</b></u><br/><br/>All these new faces <br/>Dead presidents and strangers <br/>Real ones gon make it <br/>Penthouse from basement <br/>God made you amazing <br/>Take time with you baby</p>
