      <h1>Aaron Cruden homecoming complete for 2020 Super Rugby season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T03:18:48+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 03:18</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>After a few years in the wilderness, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/montpellier/players/aaron-cruden/">Aaron Cruden</a> has come back home.</p>
      <p>The 50-test <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> first five-eighth has signed on for another stint with the Chiefs, signing with the club on a one-year deal.</p>
      <p>Cruden, 30, returns to the club from French side Montpelier, having already played in more than 80 matches for the Hamilton club between 2012 and 2017.</p>

      <p>The team’s new head coach Warren Gatland said he was excited to welcome Cruden back.</p>
      <p>“As a player, he has a proven ability to create opportunities with his boot and can spark up an attack from anywhere on the park. We are fortunate and privileged to have him return and I will look forward to coaching him in the coming season.”</p>
      <p>Cruden’s signing likely signals the end of the Chiefs’ No 10 experiment, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs/players/damian-mckenzie/">Damian McKenzie</a> set to return to fullback.</p>
      <p>Cruden returns with fond memories of the club, and was a key director of their back-to-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> titles in 2012 and 2013.</p>

      <p>His was the second major signing announced by a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> franchise for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season, with English representative centre <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/joe-marchant/">Joe Marchant</a> agreeing to join the Blues.</p>
      <p>Marchant joins the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/auckland">Auckland</a> club on a sabbatical from parent club Harlequins, and was expected to help fill the gaping hole in the side’s lineup left by the departures of Ma’a Nonu and Sonny Bill Williams.</p>
