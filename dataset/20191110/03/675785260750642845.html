      <h1>Billy Joe Saunders knocks out Marcelo Esteban Coceres to retain world title</h1>
      <h2>Saunders made his United States debut as he fought on the undercard of the YouTuber fight between KSI and Logan Paul in Los Angeles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T03:13:49+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Billy Joe Saunders' bid to win over America looked set to end in jeers until he pulled out a late stoppage to retain his world title.</p>
      <p>The super-middleweight had vowed to use his opportunity on the undercard of KSI's rematch with Logan Paul to expose his talent to a new audience.</p>
      <p>But after a string of knockouts earlier in the night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Saunders had bored the crowd into silence - barring the occasional booing.</p>
      <p>He finally clicked into gear however in the penultimate round, dropping Marcelo Coceres three times before the fight was waved off.</p>
      <p>Saunders admitted his performance was not up to scratch.</p>
      <p>He said: “There’s no excuse, that performance was not worthy of Canelo or any of the other big names.</p>

      <p>“I knew by round nine that I had to get him out of here. My timing wasn’t right, my head wasn’t right, nothing was right.</p>
      <p>“I’m not one for excuses. I needed to let him gas out then attack. I’ve got the win and I’ve got to thank the American fans and I hope they tune in again because that wasn’t the best of me.”</p>
      <p>Saunders was defending his title for the first time having won it by beating Shefat Isufi at the home of Stevenage FC in May.</p>
      <p>The traveller has endured a troubled last 12 months having vacated his middleweight world title after failing a drug test before his clash with Demetrius Andrade.</p>
      <p>Saunders was then fined £100,000 after a video emerged in which he told a woman he would give her £150 worth of drugs to perform a sex act.</p>

      <p>He later joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom stable as he eyes fights against the best at either 160lb or 168lb.</p>
      <p>Argentina's Coceres does not fall into that bracket and the fact that Saunders only arrived in Los Angeles a week before the fight suggests he knew it.</p>
      <p>The Brit had promised to put on a spectacular show but the early stages suggested the fans - who had already proved to be impatient - would be in for a long night.</p>
      <p>Indeed, they were more interested in the arrival and departure of Jake Paul - Logan's brother - at ringside.</p>

      <p>The unbeaten but largely untested Coceres was at least light on his feet and proved elusive in the opening rounds.</p>
      <p>Saunders was limited to landing his southpaw jab and on more than occasion wandered low with his left hand.</p>
      <p>Coceres enjoyed his best spell to date in the fifth round as he attempted to pressure the champion.</p>
      <p>And by the halfway point he was slinging his right hand low as if no longer worried about what was coming back.</p>
      <p>Saunders continued to look sluggish but his more impressive start meant he was still heading for a points win.</p>
      <p>But he burst into life - and raised the crowd from their slumber in the 11th round.</p>
      <p>A body short sent Coceres down for the first time and a crunching uppercut did the same in the subsequent barrage.</p>
      <p>Both times the challenger rose but when he fell to the canvas for a third time, he was saved from further punishment.</p>
