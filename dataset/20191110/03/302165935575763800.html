      <p>BAGHDAD, Nov 10 — Taking vibrant spray paint to Baghdad’s grimy concrete walls, Iraqi artists protesting against the government—many of them young and female—are sketching out their vision for a brighter future.</p>
      <p>In plastic gloves covered in paint smudges, 20-year-old Fatima Hussam commands a team of artists-cum-activists producing today’s fresco.</p>
      <p>Their murals have transformed a monochrome tunnel leading into the main protest camp in Tahrir (Liberation) Square into a revolutionary art gallery.</p>
      <p>“We have plenty of artists in this country but nowhere they can express their art, so we decided to use Tahrir for an art revolution in addition to a national revolution,” says Hussam, her white veil covered in pink flowers.</p>
      <p>Among her works is a version of World War II-era feminist icon “Rosie the Riveter,” now with an Iraqi flag painted on her cheek and announcing in speech bubble: “This is what our women are like!”</p>
      <p>Iraq, where around 60 per cent of its 40 million people are below 25, remains a largely conservative country.</p>
      <p>Baghdad is more open-minded than the tribal south, where it is rare to see women interact with men who are not their relatives or spouses.</p>
      <p>But protests in the capital and Shiite-majority southern provinces have seen women break the taboo, joining thousands of demonstrators en masse to demand regime change.</p>
      <p>Hussam has joined them this week, with her older brother cautiously but proudly looking on as she paints.</p>
      <p>Her latest is an ode to fellow women taking part: a veiled woman holding a sign bearing one of the popular uprising’s many slogans: “I want my country.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Joy and colours’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Such slogans are 23-year-old Mohammad Abdelwahab’s inspiration.</p>
      <p>The young artist takes a brush daubed in white paint to a large black background in the tunnel, inscribing popular protest chants into the shape of a map of Iraq.</p>
      <p>“We are the generation of change—change for the better!” says Abdelwahab.</p>
      <p>Dozens of other young artists are working on their own pieces.</p>
      <p>One mural shows the three-wheeled rickshaw known as a tuk-tuk, now a beloved symbol of the protest movement for its role in ferrying wounded demonstrators to safety.</p>
      <p>Another displays the word “LOVE” spelled out by bloodstained hands—a testimony, the artist says, to those who have died facing off against security forces.</p>
      <p>Nearly 300 people have died since the protests first erupted on October 1, according to an AFP tally.</p>
      <p>Half of them lost their lives in an initial six-day wave of protests in early October, and the rest in deadly clashes with security forces or in fires set to party offices since rallies resumed on October 24.</p>
      <p>Authorities have acknowledged the protests but say that “infiltrators” embedded in them are looking to plunge the country back into instability.</p>
      <p>Iraq has only recently emerged from decades of back-to-back conflict, including a 1980s war with Iran, the US-led invasion in 2003 and a battle against the Islamic State group that ended in late 2017.</p>
      <p>Abdelwahab says the protest movement is about the next phase of Iraq’s future.</p>
      <p>“We’re not here to attack the state. We want to bring it joy and colours,” he insists.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A growing underground</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mission accomplished, says 38-year-old Mohammad Abbas.</p>
      <p>“In 16 years, I’ve never seen this place so beautiful. Our country really needed this,” marvels Abbas, who has driven down the same tunnel to get to work for years.</p>
      <p>“Usually, the walls are dirty and black,” he says.</p>
      <p>Baghdad, a sprawling city of nearly 10 million inhabitants, is usually choked off by traffic, smog and checkpoints.</p>
      <p>“Young people were able to achieve what the state hasn’t been able to do while spending billions on Baghdad,” says Abbas, on his way to more swelling protests above ground.</p>
      <p>Oil-rich Iraq is Opec’s second biggest producer, but one in five people live in poverty and youth unemployment stands at 25 percent, according to the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Public services including electricity, water provision and street maintenance are poor, and the country is ranked the 12<sup>th</sup> most corrupt worldwide by Transparency International.</p>
      <p>But the art developing underneath Tahrir is not just visual.</p>
      <p>Every afternoon, musicians bring their clarinets and flutes for impromptu concerts, as woodworkers sell key chains and other statuettes immortalising the tuk-tuk.</p>
      <p>“With few means, these artists send a peaceful message to the world,” says Ibrahim, 39, a bypasser.</p>
      <p>Through them, he says, “we’re telling the world that the Iraqi people are alive and well.” — AFP</p>
