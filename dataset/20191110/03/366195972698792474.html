      <p>Rapper Phora has returned to share his newest "Set You Free" track, a song penned as an ode to a victim of domestic violence as he attaches a matching clip to the track in its debut.</p>
      <p>"I wrote this song about a girl I knew who went through something I couldn’t do anything about," Phora revealed in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4guv76Jcn0/">post</a>. "I felt powerless, like I wanted to change the situation and free her from what she was going thru.. she was trapped, stuck, lost in a TOXIC situation she didn’t wanna be in.. I know that so many people are going thru the same thing, some even worse, so I wanted to put how I felt in a song to let her and the rest of the world know they deserve better than to be trapped in a toxic situation."</p>

      <p>I know you come with demons like the rest of us<br/>Got all these thoughts inside, just hopin' they don't get the best of us<br/>Look, you runnin' to the ones that hurt you most<br/>You rather hurt than face this world alone, but</p>
