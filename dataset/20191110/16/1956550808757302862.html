      <p><a href="https://www.timeoutmuscat.com/travel">Visitors</a> to Oman must apply for an eVisa before arriving in the Sultanate rather than getting a visa on arrival, it has been announced.</p>
      <p>The Royal Oman Police took to social media to say that visa on arrival is now “an exception to the rule and eVisas should be used wherever possible”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.timeoutmuscat.com/news">Visitors</a> must apply online by uploading a copy of their passport, a second passport-style photo of themselves, before paying OMR5.</p>
      <p>It will then take up to four days to be processed, and the visa allows you to stay up to 10 days in Oman.</p>
      <p>Citizens from 71 countries, including Australia, the United States, and members of the European Union, can apply for eVisas.<br/><br/>Citizens from other countries must apply in advance through their embassy.</p>
      <p>If you are a citizen of the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia you do not need a visa.<br/><br/>The news comes after it was announced that Omanis would be able to get a free visa to visit <a href="https://www.timeoutmuscat.com/travel/417383-free-evisas-granted-to-omanis-travelling-to-st-petersburg">St. Petersburg in Russia</a>.</p>
      <p>Oman is one of 53 countries who can get the free eVisa, including the EU member states, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.<br/><i>To apply for the eVisa to enter Oman, visit <a href="https://evisa.rop.gov.om/">https://evisa.rop.gov.om/</a></i></p>
