        <i>Conleth Hill jokes ‘there’s no proof’ to claims by co-star Emilia Clarke that he was behind gaffe</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Game Of Thrones actor Conleth Hill has denied being responsible for the show’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/08/see-you-latte-how-did-the-game-of-thrones-coffee-cup-get-missed">coffee cup</a> blunder.</p>
      <p>Viewers poked fun at the fantasy epic when a rogue container was spotted on a table during an episode in the final season this year.</p>

      <p>Emilia Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/31/emilia-clarke-spills-beans-on-game-of-thrones-coffee-cup-culprit">said co-star Hill, who portrayed the master of spies Lord Varys, had admitted being responsible</a>.</p>
      <p>Hill, however, told Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch: “I would need to have had Mr Man arms to leave a coffee cup there.</p>
      <p>“I took a bullet for Emilia Clarke and she touted on me.”</p>
      <p>“You know, there’s no proof that I did it. So accuse away!”</p>
      <p>And the actor quipped: “I’m just not making any comments until I have a lawyer … It definitely wasn’t product placement!”</p>
      <p>Clarke, who was seen as a culprit, previously told Jimmy Fallon’s US talk show: “We had a party before the Emmys recently and Conleth, who plays Varys, who’s sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he’s like, ‘Emilia, I have got to tell you something, love. The coffee cup was mine’.”</p>
      <p>The hugely popular fantasy epic finished its eight-season run in May, but many fans were left disappointed, signing an online petition calling for a remake of the last episodes with “competent writers”.</p>
