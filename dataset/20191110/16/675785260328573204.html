      <p>When you think of healthy eating and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/diet">dieting,</a> doughnuts might not be the first type of food that spring to mind.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> have pledged to join the fight against obesity and it seems one way in which the bakery chain is going to do this is by encouraging customers to eat different types of doughnuts.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/greggs-creates-its-first-diet-doughnut-by-adding-a-hole-cx90rzwsh">The Sunday Times,</a> the company plans to change shop displays, to guide people towards ring doughnuts instead of jam ones.</p>
      <p>This is because the ring-shaped sweet treats have a hole cut in the middle, meaning they possess fewer calories than the jam-filled option.</p>

      <p>Speaking at a recent childhood obesity conference in London, Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs, reportedly told the audience that ring doughnuts "take some of the calories out".</p>
      <p>He explained: "Ring <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food">doughnuts</a> are between 200 and 300 calories, the ball doughnuts are between 300 and 400 calories".</p>
      <p>He added: "People like big cakes, not little cakes... we know that we shouldn't be encouraging people to eat large cakes... but the problem is you have to go with demand."</p>

      <p>Broken down into numbers, a Greggs jam doughnut contains 245 calories, 12 grams of sugar and 10 grams of fat.</p>
      <p>In comparison the glazed ring doughnut from Greggs has 191 calories, 12 grams of sugar and 6.4 grams of fat.</p>
      <p>Worse than both of these is the triple chocolate doughnut, which contains 341 calories, an eye-watering 29 grams of sugar as well as 15 grams of fat.</p>
      <p>Similarly the cream finger doughnut has the highest fat content with 22 grams of fat, 335 calories and 8.1 grams of sugar.</p>
      <p>As well as encouraging customers to go for lower calorie doughnuts, Greggs also agreed to do several other things in response to the government's childhood obesity strategy.</p>
      <p>This includes offering healthy alternatives to cakes and pastries, such as salads and fruit.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Greggs said the company is "serious about customer health" and that the lower calorie items were not intended as "diet products" but simply offered customers a wider choice.</p>
      <p>She added: "Greggs has also reduced sugar by 20 percent across its sweet range."</p>
