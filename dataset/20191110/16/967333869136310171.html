      <h1>German FM Warns Against Undermining NATO After Macron Calls Alliance ‘Brain Dead’</h1>
      <h2>On Thursday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rejected French President Emmanuel Macron’s claims that NATO is experiencing “brain death”, praising the alliance as “a cornerstone” of the EU’s security.</h2>

      <p>In a column published by Der Spiegel magazine earlier this week, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas specifically warned that “it would be a mistake if we undermined NATO.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Without the United States, neither Germany nor Europe will be able to effectively protect themselves,” Maas argued.</blockquote>
      <p>He called for strengthening Europe's defence capabilities, adding, “that's why together with France, we are working hard to build a Europe that works much closer together in security policy.”</p>

      <blockquote>Maas also cautioned the EU and NATO not to play against each other, calling for the creation of “a strong and sovereign Europe”.</blockquote>
      <p>“But we need it as part of a strong NATO and not as its replacement,” he added.</p>
      <p>The remarks followed <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead">French President Emmanuel Macron’s interview with The Economist</a>, in which he claimed that NATO was experiencing "brain death" and referred to a lack of coordination and US unpredictability under President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quick to respond by saying that “the French president has found rather drastic words to express his views.”</p>
      <blockquote>“This is not how I see the state of cooperation at NATO,” she said, adding that “NATO remains a cornerstone of our security.”</blockquote>
      <p>She was echoed by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg who rejected Macron’s remarks and urged the US and Europe to "work together more than we have done for decades."</p>
      <h3>Macron Floats Idea of Creating ‘Real European Army’</h3>
      <p>In November 2018, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201812081070515998-trump-macron-army-proposal/">Macron insisted that the EU should have a “real European army”</a> independent of the United States and NATO to be able to defend itself from alleged threats emanating from Washington, Beijing and Moscow.</p>
      <p>The idea was supported by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, with Berlin and Paris starting to build a joint aircraft and combat system and inviting other European states to join.</p>

      <p>US President Donald Trump, in turn, criticised Macron's of building a pan-European military as "very insulting” , arguing that NATO countries should first pay their fair share of the alliance.</p>
      <p>Trump has repeatedly pressed NATO member states <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201807121066282873-trump-nato-spending-target/">to meet their annual defence spending obligations</a> in the alliance, even insisting that they raise their expenditures to 4 percent of GDP — instead of the existing target of 2 percent.</p>
