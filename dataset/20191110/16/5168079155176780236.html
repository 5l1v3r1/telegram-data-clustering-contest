      <h1>Bolivia: Morales warns of coup d'etat over police mutiny</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:12:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:12</time> by <a rel="author">DW</a></address>
      <p>DW<br/><br/>Bolivian President Evo Morales called for "urgent" talks with the opposition on Saturday, following days of unrest that included a mutiny among security forces.<br/><br/>"To preserve peace in our beloved Bolivia, I urgently call for talks with representatives of parties who have won seats in the elections," Morales said.<br/><br/>He also called on the pope, human rights defenders and international organizations to "join our complaint against anti-democratic groups that have launched a coup in Bolivia."</p>
      <p>The Bolivian president had warned on Friday that violent groups had launched a "coup d'etat" after a police mutiny was reported in several regions.<br/><br/>The president's remarks followed local media reports that police units in at least four regions had decided to rebel against the government.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"Sisters and brothers, our democracy is at risk due to the coup d'etat that violent groups have launched to undermine the constitutional order," he wrote on Twitter late on Friday.<br/><br/>Police join protests<br/><br/>In some cases, groups of officers joined the anti-government protests that have rocked the country since Morales won a strong but disputed victory in the October 20 elections.<br/><br/>Bolivian television broadcast footage of police shaking hands with demonstrators in the city of La Paz — a stark contrast to the previous three nights, when the two sides clashed.<br/><br/>Units in the southeastern city of Sucre and the opposition stronghold of Santa Cruz said they were also joining a rebellion launched by police officers in the central city of Cochabamba.<br/><br/>The police mutiny is the first sign that security forces are withdrawing support for Morales, who is South America's longest-serving president, having taken office in 2006.<br/><br/>After an emergency Cabinet meeting on Friday, the country's defense minister said the government had, for now, ruled out a military operation against the rebellious police teams.<br/><br/><b>Election irregularities rejected</b><br/><br/>Earlier on Friday, the country's electoral tribunal (TSE) rejected claims that vote count irregularities had been discovered in the poll, while protesters continued their demands for a new election.<br/><br/>The TSE referred critics to a report by the company Ethical Hacking, which had checked the electronic vote and did not find any "alteration of the data."<br/><br/>But the company’s head, Alvaro Andrade, said his firm did find "vulnerabilities" in the vote count, local media reported.<br/><br/>Carlos Mesa, who lost to Morales in the election, has denounced the vote as fraudulent, insisting the results had been manipulated during a 24-hour period when the electoral count was suspended.<br/><br/>The United States, Colombia, Brazil and Argentina have also called for a second-round runoff between Morales and Mesa.<br/><br/>Bolivia has since been consumed by weeks of protests and rioting by opposition groups and supporters of Morales. Three people have been killed and more than 300 injured.</p>
