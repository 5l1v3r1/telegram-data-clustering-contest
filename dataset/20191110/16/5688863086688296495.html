        <b>-After posting a good total, India were able to contain Bangladesh quite well at the start of the run chase and even got rid of potential danger man Mushfiqur Rahim for golden duck. But they gave rookie opener Mohammad Naim enough lifelines, including the missed run out chance by Yuzvendra Chahal. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Naim, who started his innings with a calm composure, was hardly thought of as the one to cause India any trouble. The hosts were able to send back Rahim, Soumya Sarkar, and Liton Das for cheap but Naim stayed on and used the opportunities smartly and capitalized on them. Soon he was on 57 off 36, taking Bangladesh closer to the target and India’s body language displayed pressure. </p>
      <p>Bowling to Naim, Chahal saw the batsman cut it away and the fielder at point, Deepak Chahar, fired a throw back to the bowler. Chahal, after collecting the ball, tried tried an underarm throw only to miss the stumps from almost point black range. The two batsmen were quick enough to make it to their respective creases by then. His captain was not too pleased with the effort as Rohit was seen falling to his knees following the botched attempt.</p>
