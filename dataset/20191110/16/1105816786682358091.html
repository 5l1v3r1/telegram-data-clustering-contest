      <p><b>ABU DHABI: </b>Yemen’s rebels will have a role in their country’s future, a United Arab Emirates (UAE) minister said on Sunday, voicing optimism that a recent peace deal between the government and southern separatists could lead to a wider solution.</p>
      <p>The comments were the latest conciliatory move in the long-running Yemen conflict, after the Iran-backed Houthis offered in September to halt attacks on Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Anwar Gargash, minister of state for foreign affairs in the UAE — a key member in the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen’s government against the Houthis — urged all sides to maintain momentum for a political solution.</p>

      <p>“Such an agreement must take account of the legitimate aspirations of all parts of Yemeni society. That includes the Houthis,” Gargash said at a political conference in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>“Houthi militias have wreaked havoc on the country, but they are a part of Yemeni society and they will have a role in its future.”</p>
      <p>The Houthi rebels have been fighting the internationally recognised government and its allies for more than four years in a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p>
      <p>But Gargash said he was hopeful that a power-sharing deal between the government and the secessionist Southern Transitional Council, inked in Riyadh last week, could pave the way for a wider peace deal.</p>
      <p>“The agreement solidifies the anti-Houthi coalition and provides a more robust basis for reaching a political solution,” he said. “Now we need to build on the momentum this has given us.”</p>
      <p>The so-called Riyadh agreement would see Yemen’s government return to Aden — the interim capital seized by separatists in August — and place the forces from both sides under the authority of the defence and interior ministries.</p>
      <p>Gargash’s comments came after a rally organised by the Houthi insurgents to mark the birthday of the Holy Prophet Muhammed (PBUH) on Saturday drew hundreds of thousands in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, a much larger crowd than last year.</p>

      <p>Rebel chief Abdulmalik al-Houthi addressed the crowd via a video message played on a large screen, while many chanted slogans in support of the insurgent leader.</p>
      <p>The Iran-backed rebels took Sanaa in 2015, after which Saudi Arabia, the UAE and their allies intervened in the conflict in support of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.</p>
      <p>Since then, tens of thousands of people — most of them civilians — have been killed in a conflict that has triggered what the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
