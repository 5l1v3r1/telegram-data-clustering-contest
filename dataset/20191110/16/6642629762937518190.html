      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/tunisia.html">Tunisia</a>'s Ennahdha party will nominate its leader, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/ennahda-rached-ghannouchi-stand-tunisia-parliament-polls-190722141938463.html">Rachid Ghannouchi</a>, as the speaker of the new Parliament, a party member said.</p>
      <p>"The party has decided to nominate Rached Ghannouchi as parliament speaker," Abdulkarim Harouni, head of the party's advisory body, told a news conference in the capital, Tunis, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He said the council has reiterated the party's right to appoint the new prime minister.  </p>
      <p>The announcement came a few days after two sources within <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/ennahda.html">Ennahdha</a> said the party may choose a candidate from outside its ranks to head the government. It previously decided one of its leaders should be prime minister because of the electoral mandate.</p>
      <p>But that was not accepted by potential partners: Attayar with 22 seats, Achaab's Movement with 16 seats, and current Prime Minister Youssef Chahed's Tahya Tounes party with 14.</p>
      <p>Only the conservative Karama coalition, with 21 seats, agreed.</p>
      <p>Following victory in last month's parliamentary election, Ennahdha will be the biggest party but with only 52 of 217 seats, forcing it to compromise to form a cabinet.</p>
      <p>The new Parliament is set to convene on Wednesday. </p>
