      <h1>Kelsey Grammer Is Still Listening, Says ‘We’ve Hatched a Plan’ for <i>Frasier</i> Reboot</h1>

      <p>We’re breaking out the lettuce and yolks to celebrate. A year after saying that TV writers have failed him <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/kelsey-grammer-hasnt-found-good-frasier-reboot-idea-yet.html">with their terrible ideas</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kelsey-grammer-comedy-voice-work.html">Kelsey Grammer</a> has confirmed a <i>Frasier </i>reboot is indeed moving forward with an intended airdate of summer 2020. While visiting <i>In Depth With Graham Bensinger </i><a href="https://people.com/tv/kelsey-grammer-says-frasier-reboot-ready-late-summer-2020/">last week</a>, Grammer said that while no network has taken in the Cranes just yet, he approved of an idea for the new season. “We’ve got it hatched. We’ve hatched the plan, what we think is the right way to go,” he explained. “We’re sort of on standby a little bit. Working out a couple of possible network deals that we’re circling. <i>Frasier</i> is sort of in a second position to that at this point. So there’s still stuff going on. But a revisit to <i>Frasier</i>, Frasier’s world is I think definitely going to come.”</p>
      <p>Grammer didn’t want to divulge specifics of the rebooted plot, only saying his character would be looking for love in a new city. “We’ll see how people respond to it because it’s not going to be the same place, it’s not going to be Seattle,” he added. “It’s not going to be the same Frasier, it’s going to be the man in his next iteration. Hopefully that’ll be something people like watching. But I think it’ll be funny.” Last year, while celebrating <i>Frasier</i>’s 25th anniversary with a panel discussion, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/kelsey-grammer-hasnt-found-good-frasier-reboot-idea-yet.html">Grammer said he would refuse</a> to do a reboot unless all of the show’s stars — David Hyde Pierce, Jane Leeves, and Peri Gilpin — were involved. (John Mahoney, who played the Crane patriarch, Martin, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/john-mahoney-frasier-appreciation.html">passed away</a> in 2018.) “In my own personal approach to what I’ve discussed with other people,” he said at the time, “is that I wouldn’t want to do it without these guys.” Wow, what Jack Russell Terrier erasure.</p>
