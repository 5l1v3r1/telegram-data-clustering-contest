      <p>Rangers U18s battered their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> rivals at Broadwood in the second round of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-cup">Scottish Youth Cup.</a></p>
      <p>The young Gers - with Kevin Thomson as a coach - stuck five past their bitter rivals with the likes of Leon King and Kai Kennedy grabbing goals.</p>
      <p>There were also strikes from Nathan Young-Coombes, Ross McCausland and Ciaran Dickson in a dominating win for Rangers.</p>
      <p>The closed-door game saw <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> take the lead through the highly-rated King.</p>
      <p>The youngster is wanted by the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Chelsea but put that aside to drill in the opener on 26 minutes.</p>
      <p>He picked up the ball at the edge of the box after Kennedy's cross was cleared and it gave the young Gers the lad at the break.</p>

      <p>Celtic looked to get back into it with a young side and Owen Moffat went close after a great run.</p>
      <p>But Rangers had a second when Kennedy drifted into the box and played it across the box for Young-Coombes to tap home.</p>
      <p>A third soon followed with McAusland drilling it low into the net before Kennedy got the goal his performance deserved.</p>
      <p>He curled one in from the corner of the box past the goalkeeper and there was still time for a fifth with captain Dickson smashed one into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Celtic, managed by Darren O'Dea, had a young side out but Rangers blew them away to continue their impressive form at youth level.</p>
