      <h2>Aston Villa latest | Villa supporters give their thoughts on the 2-1 defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux, as both sides head into the third international break of the season</h2>

      <p>Aston Villa remained three points above the Premier League relegation zone after losing 2-1 to Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Ruben Neves fired the hosts into a first-half lead, after <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> goalkeeper Jed Steer - who replaced the injured Tom Heaton in the starting XI - was</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gallery/aston-villa-injury-crisis-worsens-17233316">forced off early on.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez then tucked home a low ball from ex-Villan Adama Traore late on to all but seal the points, despite Trezeguet's stoppage-time response.</p>
      <p>The results sends Dean Smith's men into the international break on 11 points from 12 games, three ahead of 18th-placed Watford and Southampton in 19th.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves,</a> meanwhile, move up to eighth - although their points tally is only five better than Villa's at this stage.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Villa fans have been having their say on their side's seventh defeat of the campaign - and the absence of Jack Grealish with an injury...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>@TrezeguetSzn:</b> Lacked creativity without Jack. Lets hope he is back for Newcastle...</p>
      <p><b>JamesAV:</b> I want jack grealish back and I want it NOW</p>
      <p><b>James Finn:</b> I am a bit worried now, if I'm honest. We just don't have enough up front. And it's costing us now.</p>
      <p><b>@AVFCJosh_:</b> Decent second half today lads not good enough tho we go again utv</p>
      <p><b>avfcjames18:</b> Bad effort but we weren't helped with injuries UTV</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Rob Gould:</b> We need a goal scorer and need to play with two strikers</p>
      <p><b>@angelstears2128:</b> No team connection</p>
      <p><b>@jordanavfc9:</b> Absolutely embarrassing today. We were battered and outclassed for 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Taylor looked like a Sunday League player trying to defend against Traore. Fair play Wolves, you were a class above us.</p>
      <p>We've got to improve if we're gonna stay up. UTV</p>
