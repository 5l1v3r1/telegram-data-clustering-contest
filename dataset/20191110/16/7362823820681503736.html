      <p>Per <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/3-injured-after-getting-trampled-at-astroworld-festival/285-c60a1d0e-f36b-4c32-86d4-815906d584cb">KHOU</a>, fans attempted to break through the gates with bolt cutters. Houston police tweeted -- and then deleted -- that they would be "bringing additional officers" as the festival’s "promoters did not plan sufficiently for the large crowds and understaffed the event."</p>
