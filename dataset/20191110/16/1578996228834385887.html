      <p>The Kardashian family is celebrating Dream’s third birthday. Yes, Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna’s daughter is already three. Time is fleeting!</p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian <a href="https://people.com/parents/kim-kardashian-family-bash-celebrating-rob-kardashian-daughter-dream-3rd-birthday-photos/">posted photos</a> from her niece’s birthday party on Friday, which was also attended by Dream’s crew of cousins, including Khloe Kardashian’s daughter, True, and Kim’s children Psalm and Chicago. Both girls wore pale pink dresses for the occasion and celebrated with an elaborate <i>Trolls</i> birthday cake.</p>
      <p>While Rob Kardashian is the most camera-shy of the Kardashian bunch, he recently posted photos of him and his daughter for Halloween, where they both dressed as characters from the animated film, which apparently Dream is a <i>big </i>fan of.</p>

      <p>“Poppy Troll dressed up with Papa Troll for #Halloween,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Kardashian is no longer with Blac Chyna, and the two’s tumultuous relationship was well-documented through their respective social media accounts. However, Chyna recently opened up about co-parenting with Kardashian and said everything is going smoothly.</p>
      <p>“Co-parenting is good,” she said during an appearance on RuPaul’s talk show this summer. “With both of my baby fathers, we have a mutual agreement and everything runs smoothly. We’re all in a good place.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a29736257/rob-kardashian-ready-to-date-again/">According to E! News</a>, Kardashian is ready to get back out in the dating game. The star, who has struggled with his weight and mental health in the past, is reportedly in a good place now and excited to put himself out there.</p>
      <p>"Rob is single but would like to date. He wants to find someone to spend time with and share his life with," a source said. “He doesn't want to be single and has tried to meet someone. He’s starting to feel better about himself and is feeling more hopeful."</p>
