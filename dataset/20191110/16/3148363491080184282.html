      <h2>President Donald Trump challenged ABC News on Sunday for covering up accusations against billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</h2>

      <p>“ABC is as bad as the rest of them,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Journalistic standards are nonexistent today.”</p>
      <p>Trump shared a clip of Fox News reporter Jesse Watters blasting ABC News in a monologue about their “standards” after Project Veritas founder James O’Keefe revealed a clip of reporter Amy Robach expressing her frustration at the network for not airing her investigative work on Jeffrey Epstein three years ago.</p>
      <p>“What the hell are ABC’s editorial standards?” Watters said on his show Watters World, noting ABC News reported on uncorroborated accusations against Justice Brett Kavanagh from lawyer Michael Avenatti.</p>
      <p>“The press is so dishonest that we no longer have Freedom of the Press!” Trump concluded.</p>

      <p>White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley on Wednesday also ridiculed ABC News in an<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/06/white-house-mocks-abc-news-editorial-standards-that-blocked-jefferey-epstein-story/"> interview </a>with Breitbart News Daily.</p>
      <p>“For ABC to make the comment that it wasn’t up to our standards to put on television, I guess that doesn’t apply to Kavanaugh, I guess that doesn’t apply to Covington kids, I guess that doesn’t apply when you put up a video that and say ‘look at the shelling in Syria’ but it’s actually Kentucky,” Gidley said.</p>
      <p>Gidley also pointed to the so-called ABC News Brian Ross bombshell on the Russia report that actually shifted the stock markets before the news outlet had to walk back Ross’s reporting.</p>
      <p>“You want to succeed, you try to take down a president, facts or reporting or news reporting be damned,” Gidley said.</p>
