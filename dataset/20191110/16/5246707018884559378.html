      <p>If you tuned into Masahiro Sakurai's Terry Bogard video demonstration earlier this week, you'll probably <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/sakurai_says_fatal_furys_mai_isnt_in_smash_because_the_game_is_for_good_boys_and_girls">remember</a> the part when he mentioned <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> "is for good boys and girls", so the team decided to exclude the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/fatal_fury">Fatal Fury</a></b> character, Mai Shiranui.</p>
      <p>Although Nintendo's western translation made a brief joke out of this (see below), according to GameXplain, the Japanese broadcast made some additional comments – explaining how Mai wasn't included in order to keep the local 'All Ages' CERO rating intact.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Local translation:</b> <i>By the way, you may have noticed that a very important character from the</i> Fatal Fury series was not included. Yes, Mai Shiranui. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is for good boys and girls of many different ages, so we decided not to feature her. Please forgive us.</blockquote>
      <p>Although it was already pretty obvious why she was left out, the Japanese broadcast at least confirms the team wanted to keep the Switch entry within the lowest age rating, to make it accessible to as many players as possible. It wasn't simply about the "good boys and girls" who play it, but more to do with how the local rating board would react.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Are you disappointed Mai won't be appearing as a playable fighter or guest alongside Terry Bogard and the rest of the SNK crew? Share your thoughts below.</i>
