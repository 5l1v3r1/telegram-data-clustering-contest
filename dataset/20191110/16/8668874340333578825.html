      <h1>Cipriani slated after swapping Kingsholm poor showing for X Factor audience</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:21:52+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Gloucester flyhalf <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/danny-cipriani/">Danny Cipriani</a> is being slated online after driving away from a mediocre performance at Kingsholm to make an appearance in the audience on X Factor.</p>
      <p>In the first <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> match since the conclusion of an independent panel’s salary cap investigation, Gloucester failed to fire till late in the second half, ultimately falling to a 12 -21 home defeat.</p>
      <p>Cipriani – who has been in fine form for the Cherry and Whites since signing in 2018 – was singled out online for what many felt was a pretty ordinary performance.</p>

      <p>However, the criticism intensified when the former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> playmaker was spotted in the audience of the X Factor. The 32-year-old was filmed cheering on rugby themed trio ‘Try Star’ on the popular ITV show, just three hours after Saracens stuffed Gloucester.</p>
      <p>The X Factor: Celebrity is an alternative format of the popular British reality show X Factor. Rugby stars Ben Foden, Thom Evans and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/levi-davis/">Levi Davis</a> all feature as a rugby trio on the talent contest.</p>

      <p>Many users on social media questioned whether <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/gloucester/players/danny-cipriani/">Danny Cipriani</a> was fully focused on the match against Saracens. He would have had to have left Kingsholm stadium almost immediately after the match if he was to make the live shows for the X-Factor.</p>

      <p>Gloucester take on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse">Toulouse</a> next weekend in the <a href="https://www.epcrugby.com/champions-cup/matches/fixtures-and-results/"><b>Champions Cup</b></a> in a game where Cipriani will almost certainly feature at 10 for the men in cherry and white.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps">Wasps</a> 10 who,  joined the club last summer, was originally contracted until the end of the 2019-20 season. However, a new contract will mean that the England international fly-half will remain with Gloucester Rugby on a long-term basis.<br/>The 31-year-old enjoyed a stunning first season at Kingsholm. From his very first competitive appearance when he threw an eye-catching scoring pass to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/gloucester/players/charlie-sharples/">Charlie Sharples</a>, Cipriani has lit up the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> with a host of fine performances and was named Player of the Month last September.</p>
