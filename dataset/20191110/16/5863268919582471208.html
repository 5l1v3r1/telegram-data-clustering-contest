      <h1>Holy Prophet (PBUH) gave exemplary punishment for committing corruption: PM Khan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T16:33:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Sunday that Pakistan’s society was spoiled by giving NRO to corrupt people, whereas Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) gave “exemplary punishment” to those who had committed corruption.</p>
      <p>The premier addressed the International Rehmatul-lil-Alameen (PBUH) Conference in Islamabad under the auspices of Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony to observe 12th Rabi-ul-Awal.</p>
      <p>“The personality and character of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is a role model for youths to emulate for successful life,” he said.</p>
      <p>The theme of this year’s conference is ‘State of Madina and concept of modern Islamic Welfare State - in light of teachings of the prophet (PBUH).’</p>
      <p>“Similarly, a nation can become great only by following the golden principles of state of Madina […] it is a miracle that two superpowers of that time surrendered to state of Madina just six years after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away […] By following the idyllic rules of state of Madina, the Muslims ruled over the world for more than 1,000 years.</p>
      <p>He said his emphasis on creation of a state like Madina and urging the youth to learn from the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was due to his lifelong experiences.</p>
      <p>The premier said our government would bring reforms in education system to teach children the way the Holy Prophet (PBUH) transformed a tribal society into a great nation. He underscored the importance of holding research in our universities on the life and the principles of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). PM Khan said Pakistan, Malaysia and Turkey have decided to jointly create films depicting great Islamic leaders in order to familiarise our population with our great history.</p>
      <p>Khan stressed on the need to understand reasons of Muslims’ rise and fall in the history. Quoting Allama Muhammad Iqbal, he said Muslims gained success in the world when they followed the principles of state of Madina and went to decline when they forgot them.</p>
      <p>He said one virtue of Muslims that inspired others to embrace Islam was speaking truth. He said high moral values and character distinguishes a Muslim from followers of other religion.</p>
      <p>The PM said justice was another hallmark of the state of Madina which created a just society with equal rights for all and that injustice leads to ending of merit that plays a key role in decline of any society.</p>
      <p>“Those who plundered the nation’s wealth deserve no right to be spared […] no NRO or other relaxations can be given to these corrupt people.” He said the compassion is for poor and downtrodden segments of society and not for powerful and corrupt people. He said it was state’s responsibility to look after the weaker segments. He said for a state to function effectively, it needed revenues in the form of taxes to run the affairs efficiently. He said people have also the responsibility to play their due share in uplift of society.</p>
      <p>The PM also urged scholars to guide the government in transforming the country on the basis of Islamic principles.</p>
      <p>He expressed optimism Pakistan would become a great nation by following the principles of state of Madina.</p>
      <p>The event is being attended by religious personalities and scholars, and people from various walks of life. A large number of scholars from other Islamic countries are also attending the conference.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Noor ul Haq Qadri said that the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) brought justice, knowledge and enlightenment in the society which was trapped in darkness, ignorance and injustice.</p>
      <p>Addressing the conference, he said Allah took oath from all prophets regarding belief on Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) – who is the last prophet in the chain of prophethood. All prophets told their nations about the promised last Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) in their times.</p>
      <p>“Allah will grant high-level to those who mention the name of prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with reverence,” he said.</p>
      <p>The minister said PM Khan has a vision to transform Pakistan into a social welfare state on the pattern of state of Madina.</p>
      <p>He said the way the premier has raised voice at the United Nations and other world forums for respect and dignity of Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) was unprecedented.</p>
      <p>He said the research papers and articles to be presented in today’s conference would become the foundation of the setting up of a modern Islamic welfare state of Pakistan.</p>
