      <p>Ireland 13 - 15 Wales</p>
      <p>Ireland’s search for a maiden November Women’s International victory continues after they suffered an agonising defeat to Wales in the UCD Bowl on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Adam Griggs’ charges looked set to hold out for their first Autumn Series triumph in seven attempts when Ellen Murphy knocked over a 74th-minute penalty. However, there was enough time for Wales’ replacement scrum-half Keira Bevan to strike a decisive blow deep into second-half stoppage-time.</p>
      <p>Following a disappointing Six Nations campaign, Ireland were aiming to end 2019 on a high. Instead of opting for the posts off a succession of early penalties, out-half Murphy kicked to touch in a bid to create a set-piece platform.</p>
      <p>While this didn’t paid dividends, the hosts ultimately broke the deadlock on 19 minutes. Full-back Eimear Considine embarked on a weaving run through the heart of the Welsh defence and was hauled down just shy of the whitewash.</p>
      <p>The ball was quickly recycled to the left of the posts, where Cameroon-born prop Linda Djougang was on hand to power over for her first international try.</p>
      <p>Wales started to find their feet as the action progressed, but disciplined Irish defence ensured they were kept at bay until the interval.</p>
      <p>Whereas the opening period struggled to catch fire, a pulsating start to the second period brought much-needed life to the proceedings. Capitalising on impressive build-up play by Considine and Murphy, Skibbereen’s Enya Breen found herself in space on the left-flank.</p>
      <p>She feigned a pass out wide to Beibhinn Parsons - and evaded a Kayleigh Powell tackle - on her way to grabbing Ireland’s second unconverted try. Wales refused to give in, though, and immediately responded with a coolly-struck Robyn Wilkins penalty.</p>
      <p>Moving into the final-quarter, lively replacement Sioned Harries crashed over via a line-out move and Wilkins’ bonus strike brought her side back on level terms.</p>
      <p>Murphy’s routine place-kick looked set to hand Ireland a morale-boosting success only for Bevan to snatch the spoils with a last-gasp finish off an attacking maul.</p>
