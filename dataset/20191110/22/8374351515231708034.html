      <p>The national government’s financing increased in the first nine-months of the year due to higher borrowings from the domestic market, data from the Bureau of the Treasury showed.</p>

      <p>Based on the treasury report, the gross borrowings of the national government reached ₱917.28 billion in January to September this year, up by 34 percent compared with ₱683.24 billion in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Of that amount, ₱626.28 billion were sourced from local lenders, which jumped by 57 percent year-on-year from ₱399 billion. Offshore financing also slightly rose by two percent to ₱291 billion from ₱284.24 billion a year ago.</p>
      <p>Data from the treasury also revealed that domestic borrowings were mainly composed of fixed rate long-term IOUs with ₱331.9 billion, followed by retails bonds with ₱235.83 billion, and short-dated debt papers with ₱58.55 billion.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the biggest contributors to the end-September overseas financing were the sale of global bonds in January where the state raised ₱78 billion as well as the ₱77.66 billion worth of program loans tapped by the government during the period. The Duterte administration also sold ₱45.26 billion of Samurai bonds in August as well as Euro and Panda bonds in May that generated ₱43.49 billion and ₱18.86 billion, respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the government’s total projects loans in the first three-quarters already amounted to ₱27.69 billion. But in September alone, the national government’s financing nosedived by 98 percent to a mere ₱1.01 billion from ₱43.98 billion in the same month last year after the treasury settled more maturing obligations than the amount it borrowed.</p>
      <p>The government only borrowed ₱10.4 billion through the sale of Treasury bonds in September, lower than the ₱24.85 billion worth settled Treasury bills during the month. For this reason, the treasury registered a net payment of ₱14.45 billion.<br/>Overseas borrowings also declined by 45 percent in September to ₱15.46 billion from ₱29.53 billion in the same month last year.</p>
      <p>Last week, the treasury reported that the outstanding debt of the national government stood at ₱7.907 trillion at end-September lower by 0.4 percent compared with ₱9.939 trillion in the previous month.</p>
      <p>Of the total debt stock, 66.49 percent were borrowed domestically, while the remaining balance of 33.51 percent were sourced from external markets.<br/>But despite the drop, the end-September level was higher by 0.6 percent against the 2019 target of ₱7.853 trillion set under the 2020 Budget of Expenditures and Sources of Financing submitted to Congress.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the latest debt figure was higher by 10 percent than the ₱7.159 trillion registered in the same month last year.</p>
