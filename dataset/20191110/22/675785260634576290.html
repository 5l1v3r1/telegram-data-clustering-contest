      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Love Island star's trainer Nathan De Asha has dished the dirt on Michael's bodybuilding future and says he wants to 'win and dominate' this time round</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:07:29+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-griffiths">Michael Griffiths</a> ' former trainer has dropped a huge hint he could be competing in bodybuilding competitions again before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old gym-obsessed Liverpudlian had a lengthy history of competing in the sport before he entered the Love Island villa, but has since made no return due to a busy schedule.</p>
      <p>Now his trainer and close pal Nathan De Asha, 32, has lifted the lid to Mirror Online on Michael's life as a competitor and what his future could shape into.</p>
      <p>Speaking about former firefighter Michael's past experience at competing and if he's considering taking to the stage again, Nathan told Mirror Online: "I believe he is from what I gather."</p>

      <p>Michael trains at Prophecy Performance Centre in his hometown - where International Federation of Bodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB) pro De Asha is the gym owner.</p>
      <p>After his Love Island stint, Michael accumulated a rather busy schedule, working with different brands since leaving the hit ITV2 show - meaning he's laid off the training for a while as he isn't able to "fully commit".</p>
      <p>Nathan, nicknamed 'The Prophecy', confessed: "When I've spoken to him he said he'll get back to it when he's able to fully commit."</p>

      <p>While IFBB pro Nathan hasn't given a date Michael could potentially return, it's likely to be soon as the star has already shared his thoughts on competing to Nathan.</p>
      <p>"He doesn't just want to be another athlete up there he wants to win and dominate like he has in the past and like many of his pals at our gym do," Nathan added.</p>
      <p>Having just finished filming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ex-on-the-beach">Ex On The Beach</a> , it could be the perfect break for Michael to get back into training once again.</p>

      <p>With Michael's huge ego, it's no surprise he wants to "win and dominate" in future competitions and to perform at his best.</p>
      <p>Nathan continued: "If he has the time and in Liverpool, he will be with us at Prophecy Performance Centre, that's where he trains from.</p>
      <p>"He has access 24/7 to the gym as he has a set of keys, due to his schedule when he was a firefighter."</p>
      <p>It seems De Asha has a lot of faith in Michael, having seen him compete before.</p>

      <p>The pro bodybuilder said: "I think he will dominate his physique when he's fully training is awesome."</p>
      <p>When asked if it's something he was always going to go back to, Nathan unveiled: "I believe so you know. It's a passion and a hobby he's really interested in.</p>
      <p>"All his friends are from the same gym. We train at my gym Prophecy Performance Centre," referring to his personal trainer pals.</p>

      <p>Although Michael didn't mention his bodybuilding past on Love Island, he managed to keep up a daily gym routine alongside his pals in the villa, including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tommy-fury">Tommy Fury</a> .</p>
      <p>And having managed to keep in good shape, Nathan shared how he didn't see it being a problem for Michael to train again when he came out.</p>
      <p>"I don't see how leaving Love Island would affect him from training really, and doing what he enjoys, and his friends enjoy training together," he said.</p>

      <p>The reality TV star came 2nd when he competed in a Physical Culture Association show for pro men's physique on May 13 2018 - and he even bagged himself some cash.</p>
      <p>Michael himself has hinted at having another go at his hobby, as he posted a photo on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> shortly after his win with a lengthy caption - suggesting it'll be before the end of this year.</p>
      <p>It read: "It's Monday and time to start progressing to bring the best package to the stage yet 2019 is going to be a big year for building and I'm already looking forward to stepping back on stage."</p>

      <p>Nathan - now one of the world's most recognised bodybuilders - has turned his life around since he was jailed for encouraging Liverpool riots in 2011. He was widely condemned for his role in the L1 rioting.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> posts during the riots landed him behind bars after someone sent a print out of his rants to a police station.</p>
      <p>De Asha posted a string of statuses which whipped up enthusiasm for the trouble, as he encouraged his 855 friends to "terrorise police" and "hit town and get something out of it".</p>
      <p>Now he claims he is a changed man as he told Liverpool Echo: "I'm sorry for what I did. When I look back on it, my words were stupid, they were wrong. I'm not willing to ever do that or be in that place again."</p>
