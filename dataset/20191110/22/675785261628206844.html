      <p>A woman tricked into slavery by a cruel <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crime">pimp</a> has told how she brought down the sex trafficking gang boss.</p>
      <p>Julius Rigo - known by the nickname ‘Juicy’ - pimped out women for as little as £10 at a time on the streets of south Manchester.</p>
      <p>If they didn’t earn enough, he would starve them.</p>
      <p>The men under his control were beaten and forced to work long hours in a car wash, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tricked-sex-slavery-juicy-pimp-17226858">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>

      <p>All 13 were made to live in cramped and grotty terraces in Gorton and Levenshulme, Manchester.</p>
      <p>The slaves - all Czech nationals - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/evil-pimp-addicted-crystal-meth-20828766">tried desperately to shield children living at the properties</a> from the horrors they were exposed to.</p>
      <p>One victim - known by the pseudonym Sabina - was raped by Rigo and forced to sex work 12 hours a day.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Having known Rigo, 37, for many years, she trusted him to help her find work her in the UK.</p>
      <p>“He was my friend,” she says. “He said: ‘don’t worry, we will help you, together we will make something’.”</p>
      <p>But she says ‘Juicy’ started increasingly to gamble and fritter away money on the drug Pervitin - and he turned nasty.</p>
      <p>Sabina claims that on one occasion Rigo forced a man under his control to cut up and eat a pair of knickers because of a mix up over the laundry.</p>
      <p>She also alleges violence at the hands of the cruel gangmaster.</p>
      <p>Rigo was, she says, idolised by children as young as four living at the property who repeated the verbal abuse he would yell at his ‘girls’.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Sabina’s misery at Rigo’s hands only came to an end when she was picked up by immigration officers while working at a car wash.</p>
      <p>Having taken part in a ‘sham marriage’, she spent three months at Yarl’s Wood immigration detention centre where she eventually spoke to a solicitor who recognised her as a victim of modern slavery.</p>
      <p>It was only then that Sabina, and the other victims, started to speak to officers at Greater Manchester Police’s modern slavery unit.</p>
      <p>Rigo was this week jailed for 18 years by a panel of judges in the Czech Republic for human trafficking, rape, blackmail, threats to kill and bigamy.</p>
      <p>But without the evidence of Sabina and the other slaves, he might never have been caught.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t say sorry,” she says. “How can these people not say sorry?</p>
      <p>“Animals can never change.”</p>

      <p>Rigo’s wife, Darina Rigová, 32, was also jailed this week at the county court in Usti nad Labem, in Czechia.</p>
      <p>She was handed a nine year sentence for human trafficking for her part in the two-year scheme.</p>
      <p>Rigo’s accomplice Karel Ádám, 48, was convicted of human trafficking and jailed for six years.</p>
      <p>Julius’ brother, Josef Rigo, 33, was handed an 18-month prison sentence for blackmail which has been suspended for two years.</p>
      <p>A sex worker called Blanka Sárkoziová has been convicted of controlling prostitution.</p>
      <p>Sárkoziová, 42, of Walsall, West Midlands, was handed a two-year prison sentence suspended for three years.</p>
      <p>The case is one of the biggest modern slavery prosecutions in Greater Manchester Police history.</p>

      <p>Sabina’s hell at the hands of Rigo and his gang started back in 2014 when she moved to Manchester from Newcastle with her husband.</p>
      <p>She knew Rigo - himself a Slovakian - from the northern Bohemian coal-mining region of Most.</p>
      <p>All 13 of Rigo’s victims came from the area. All had either been homeless, were living in hostels, or were struggling for money in their home country.</p>
      <p>Rigo told Sabina - who believed he was a “good man” - that he would help her find work in Manchester.</p>
      <p>He found work for Sabina’s husband at a local car wash - but he was forced to hand over all his earnings.</p>
      <p>Sabina meanwhile was forced to work from 5pm until 5am as a prostitute.</p>
      <p>She would be dropped off on the streets of Longsight and Levenshulme, or at Crowcroft Park, to work.</p>
      <p>If she didn’t earn at least £500 each night she would face Rigo’s vicious temper.</p>

      <p>“When I first started living here half the time he would be nice and give me help,” she says.</p>
      <p>“I needed money to send back home.</p>
      <p>“He would say ‘don’t worry, I’ll give you some money’. But I never made even one penny from him. This happened for two and a half years.</p>
      <p>“I knew him from when he was young. In my country he was a good man, really. In England he started to take drugs, Pervitin, and playing too much at the bookies on the machines.</p>
      <p>“He turned into an animal. He was so much nasty and horrible.</p>
      <p>“He would get aggressive and not talk nicely to people.”</p>
      <p>When Sabina first started sex working Rigo would tell her “that’s your choice”.</p>
      <p>But she soon found herself working every day, from 5pm until 5am the following day.</p>
      <p>Sex was sold as cheaply as £10 for oral sex, or £250 for the whole night.</p>
      <p>All alone, Sabina faced both verbal and physical abuse at the hands of punters and, on one occasion, was even tied up.</p>
      <p>“Juicy didn’t care if I was safe,” she says.</p>
      <p>“If I didn’t make £500 a day he would not give me food or money. He would be angry.</p>
      <p>“He made me so scared of him.”</p>

      <p>Any extra money she made she would hide, desperate to keep it from Rigova, who would search her after each working day.</p>
      <p>One one occasion Sabina says she was dropped off at the West Midlands home of Sarkoziova.</p>
      <p>There she spent three weeks in Walsall being pimped out by Sarkoziova - a sex worker herself who used her expertise to set up Sabina on the website Adultwork.</p>
      <p>Sarkoziová is said to have made around £5,000 through her involvement in Rigo’s scheme.</p>
      <p>Police believe Július Rigo and Rigová made around 15.906.983 Kč - around £500,000 - through their criminal exploits.</p>
      <p>Throughout her two-and-a-half year ordeal, Sabina was living cheek by jowl with another 15 people in a grotty three-bed terrace on Hobart Street in Gorton.</p>
      <p>There she became close friends with a young woman who Rigo had tricked into coming to Manchester with her boyfriend and two young children.</p>
      <p>The teenager had no previous experience of sex work and had only just turned 18 when she arrived in the UK and was put to work.</p>

      <p>“She was a friend,” Sabina said. “I was a little bit motherly to her.”</p>
      <p>Sabina would also try her best to shield children living at the property from the horrors of the situation.</p>
      <p>“So many times they came to me and spoke to me like an aunty,” she says.</p>
      <p>Despite this, Sabina herself felt crippled by an overwhelming fear of Rigo - who also raped her.</p>
      <p>Trapped along with the other slaves, she feared the potential consequences if she tried to escape.</p>
      <p>To this day she still suffers from post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse she endured.</p>
      <p>“Still when I’m sleeping I have bad dreams and I wake up screaming ‘Juicy’,” she says.</p>
      <p>“When I take 100 times a shower, I still feel dirty.</p>
      <p>“I can change my name but my face can’t be changed and inside can’t be changed.”</p>

      <p>Eventually, Sabina started a relationship with a man who helped her escape Rigo’s clutches.</p>
      <p>But not before she was picked up by immigration officers at a car wash and taken to a detention centre.</p>
      <p>Sabina spent three months at Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre, in Bedford.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was in prison,” she says.</p>
      <p>It was there that she was able to speak to a solicitor who recognised her as a victim of modern slavary and she was then able to tell police in Manchester about her grim experience at the hands of Rigo and his gang.</p>
      <p>By Christmas 2017, Rigo and Rigova had fled the UK and headed back to the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>They married just weeks before their arrests for human trafficking.</p>
      <p>The wedding ceremony officially made Rigo a bigamist and would lead to his eventual conviction for that crime.</p>
      <p>The 13 people forced into labour by Rigo are now safe and have been getting support.</p>
      <p>Some went back to Czech Republic, others have stayed here in the UK where they are now living a life free from cruel Rigo.</p>
      <p>Kingpin Rigo will now serve his 18-year sentence back in the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>Sabina says: “I think he will die in prison for what he did.”</p>
      <p>She adds: “I just want any Czech people or anyone who comes here to know not to trust people because I trusted him. I would tell them just to be careful.</p>
      <p>“Still for me, even though he goes to jail now, I’m still so stressed. If I took 100 times a shower I feel inside I am still a dirty woman.”</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20829059.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_THP_CHPP_061119SLUG_2794JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>For Sabina, the jailing of Rigova brings a mixture of emotions.</p>
      <p>She feels that Rigova herself was frightened of Rigo.</p>
      <p>“Darina - she is scared too,” she says. “On the outside she was nice - like a stepsister. But Juicy would be angry and she was scared as well.</p>
      <p>“I felt a little bit sad about Darina.”</p>
      <p>Police say the prosecution against Julius and Josef Rigo, Rigova, Adam and Sarkoziova could not have happened without the help of Sabina and the other slaves.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Chris Nield, who led the investigation, has praised the bravery of the victims in this 'horrific' case.</p>
      <p>"Rigo is a disgusting individual who made their lives miserable,” he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm very very proud of the way the victims came forward to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>"They deserve the result they have been given but it's all down to their bravery."</p>
      <p>He added: “I hope this sends a clear message that we will not stand for modern slavery in Greater Manchester and our officers are absolutely committed to making sure that people who subject others to this horrific treatment are brought to justice.”</p>
      <p>For Sabina - who gave evidence to the court via videolink from Manchester - the scars of her experience remain.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but she has struggled to find work and can’t marry her current boyfriend due to her involved in a sham marriage.</p>
      <p>But she hopes her story will shed light on the issue of modern slavery in the UK.</p>
      <p>“I’m still stressed but I want to change my life and do good because that will give me power. I think new year new life,” she says.</p>
      <p>“If you do nothing people do more and more. And not just more but to different people as well.</p>
      <p>“I’m shocked about what’s going on in this country.”</p>
