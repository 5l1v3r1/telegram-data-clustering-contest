      <h1>Semedo injured &amp; Roberto suspended: Is it Moussa Wague time?</h1>
      <h2>Semedo's injury and Sergi Roberto's ban means it might be Wague time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:08:08+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author">sport.es</a></address>
      <p>Nelson Semedo's absence through injury - five weeks - and Sergi Roberto's suspension means Ernesto Valverde will need a new right back for the game at Leganes. In theory that should be Moussa Wague, who is the only other right sided defender in the squad.</p>
      <p>However it's been clear that Valverde isn't counting on the Senegalese defender. He has not played a single minute in the league. Along with Neto, he is the only player in that position.</p>
      <p>Wague, who is in the first team squad, was picked by Valverde to be Semedo's back up this season but the truth is he's been using Roberto there like in previous years.</p>
      <h3>Junior Firpo</h3>
      <p>At left-back there have been problems too, with Jordi Alba injured, although Valverde finally turned to Junior Firpo to play there in the 4-1 win over Celta Vigo.</p>
