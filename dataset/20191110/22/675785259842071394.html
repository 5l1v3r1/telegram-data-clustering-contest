      <h1>Unai Emery mocked by former club Sevilla as Arsenal woes continue</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery recently called for calm as Arsenal head into the international break with one win from seven in all competitions after losing at Leicester on Saturday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:22:18+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery's misery has been compounded after his former club Sevilla appeared to mock the under-fire <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager.</p>
      <p>The beleaguered Spaniard is under increasing pressure after the struggling Gunners were easily beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Two wins from 10 in the league has seen the pressure mount on Emery's position with "Emery Out" once again trending on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in the immediate aftermath of that game.</p>
      <p>And Sevilla, the team who Emery guided to three consecutive Europa League titles from 2014 before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, have rubbed salt in the manager's wounds.</p>

      <p>The Spanish club opted to post a video on their Twitter account on Sunday night and included Emery's comical "good ebening" catchphrase - which he often says in his press conferences - in the caption.</p>
      <p>It appeared to be a dig at their former manager, who faces an uncertain future as Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>But Emery has defended his team time and again and has asked for patience as the international fixtures promise to give him a little respite from growing criticism.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a coach, it's about continuing stronger and improving with our players," he said.</p>

      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay calm and to stay patient to improve and recover some confidence with some circumstances.</p>
      <p>"We are receiving criticism but I know that's my job. I've had lots of moments like that but I've recovered by working to get confidence, being together with the club and players.</p>
      <p>"I accept all (of the criticism). I accept the applause and I accept it when they criticise us. I know when we win, they are going to be happy and when we lose, they are going to be sad. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm and also keep improving things. Today we got one step ahead by being together and being strong defensively. But we lost because we were playing a very strong team in a good moment."</p>
