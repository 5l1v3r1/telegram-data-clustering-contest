      <p>Kyle and his band have a devoted following of indie rock fans.</p>
      <p>Since bursting onto the music scene with The View’s debut album, ‘Hat’s Off to The Buskers’ in 2007, Kyle and The View have written and released five studio albums, a handful of EPs and smash hit singles including ‘Same Jeans’ and ‘Wasted Little DJs’.</p>
      <p>More recently, he’s released his first solo album, ‘No, Thank You’ and his ‘Almost Pleasant’ EP dropped earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He has been compared to the Gallagher brothers. Recently, he said: “I still get a bit of a judder when I see Liam or Noel Gallagher.</p>
      <p>"We’re pals but it’s still weird talking to them. They’re just geniuses, the figureheads for an entire generation.”</p>
