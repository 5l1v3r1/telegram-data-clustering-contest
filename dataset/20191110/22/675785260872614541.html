      <h1>I'm A Celeb's Ian Wright dismisses Harry Redknapp's 'anger' fears as nonsense</h1>
      <h2>The former Arsenal star and football pundit has rubbished Harry's fears about his temper</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:15:02+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/</a></address>
      <p>Ian Wright has laughed off fears he will struggle to keep his cool in the balmy jungle.</p>
      <p>The footie star turned pundit, 56, is Ladbrokes’ 5-2 favourite to win I’m A Celebrity, which kicks off next weekend.</p>
      <p>But Harry Redknapp, who won the ITV show last year, told the Mirror he has worries Wrighty may lose his temper in camp and blow his chances.</p>
      <p>Told of Harry’s comments after touching down in Brisbane today, he said: “Was Harry doing one of those tours where he’s talking? He’s got to fill it up hasn’t he?</p>
      <p>“The thing is, we play golf but I didn’t lose my rag.</p>
      <p>“What’s he on about talking about losing my rag? I don’t lose my rag anymore.</p>

      <p>“I’m much older and wiser. To be honest, nothing gets me angry anymore. I’ve been looking forward to this for so long.”</p>
      <p>On being bookies’ favourite, the Arsenal legend agreed he had the “Wright stuff”.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner also arrived in Australia yesterday – but was stony-faced and refused to answer almost every question, including if she would be joined by any of the Kardashian clan.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old will be the oldest member of camp and earn £500,000 – believed to be one of the biggest-ever fees.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, hosts Ant and Dec were reunited in Australia for the first time in two years as Ant prepares for his comeback, posting a selfie with: “G’day.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at Brisbane Airport, Ant said: “I can’t wait.”</p>
      <p>Ant and girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett then went for some lunch with Dec, 44, and wife Ali on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>Ant, 43, took a year off after his drink-drive conviction, with Holly Willoughby stepping in.</p>
