      <h1>D-Day hero surprised by friends, family with party on 95th birthday</h1>

      <p>A British <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/world-war-two">World War II</a> veteran who received the Chevalier de la Legion d’Honneur for his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/heroism">bravery</a> as a teenager celebrated his 95th birthday Sunday with a surprise party.</p>
      <p>Hubert Miller was just 19 when he stormed the Normandy beaches to help liberate German-occupied France in June 1944 along with thousands of other Allied soldiers.</p>
      <p>Hubert, who was awarded the highest French order of merit three years ago for his brave actions that day, served in the British Royal Artillery regiment during the war.</p>

      <p>As the nation remembered its war dead Sunday, the day took on an extra poignancy for Hubert as it fell on his 95th birthday.</p>
      <p>The sprightly great-grandfather attended his local remembrance service as he does every year before his family surprised him with a birthday party at his home.</p>
      <p>Proud son Ian, 52, said: "We started the day with a skype call to my sister Julie in Australia and his great-grandchild who he has never met.</p>
      <p>"Then we went to the remembrance service and took him for a coffee, where all his friends were waiting to surprise him.</p>
      <p>"He's amazing, he's such an inspiration.</p>
      <p>"He has had a couple of strokes and a few heart problems, but he has not let that get him down.</p>
      <p>"He's always telling jokes and making people laugh and is very popular."</p>

      <p>After retirement, he would volunteer as a driver for Age UK and Help the Aged charities and would often be driving people younger than him around as part of his duties.</p>
      <p>Ian added: "He was driving until he was 91 and still lives independently in sheltered housing.</p>
      <p>"For his 90th birthday, we flew to Australia to visit my sister.</p>
      <p>"While people his age are struggling to go on coach trips, he's been flying to Tenerife.</p>
      <p>“He’s one of the oldest surviving Normandy veterans in the area.</p>
      <p>“Every year we go to church for the Remembrance service and we always know it’s going to be around his birthday.</p>
      <p>"Obviously this year it’s on his birthday, but it was only this week I twigged his birthday was the same day so we wanted to do something special for him.</p>
      <p>"It's extra special as it is in the year of the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>
