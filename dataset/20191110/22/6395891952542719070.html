      <p><b>BUCHAREST, RomaniaÂ (AP)</b> - Exit polls from Sunday's balloting showed a runoff will be needed Nov. 24 to decide Romania's presidential contest.</p>
      <p>Official results are not expected before Monday, though two exit polls found center-right President Klaus Iohannis collecting nearly 40% of the votes, followed by Viorica Dancila, the recently ousted prime minister, with around 22%. A candidate needs more than 50% of the votes to win the election outright.</p>
      <p>"Exit polls show that millions of Romanians in the country and abroad voted for our project, for a normal Romania," said Iohannis, who is seeking a second five-year term.</p>
      <p>He said that all Romanians, including those who voted for Dancila, wanted the same thing from the country's leaders: "Public money used correctly for schools, hospitals and highways, stable pensions" as well as institutions that serve the citizens and just laws that are "respected by everybody."</p>
      <p>Pollster IRES had the center-right Iohannis capturing 38.7% of the votes and Dancila, of the Social Democratic Party, taking 22%. The poll by CURS-Avangarde showed Iohannis garnering 39% and Dancila, 22.5%.</p>
      <p>Both exit polls had Dan Barna, of the center-right Save Romania Union, winning slightly more than 16% of the votes.</p>
      <p>None of the remainder of the 14 candidates were seen getting more than around 8% of the votes. Voter turnout, without yet counting ballots cast by some of the 4 million Romanians working and living abroad, was close to 48 percent.</p>
      <p>The presidential campaigns were overshadowed by the country's political crisis, which saw a minority government installed just days ago.</p>
      <p>A member of the European Union since 2007, Romania has been struggling to contain its state budget deficit, which is projected to reach 4.4% of GDP next year, well above the EU limit of 3%. Poverty is also widespread. According to a World Bank study last year, over 25% of Romania's people live on less than $5.50 a day.</p>
      <p>Over the past three years, as Romania has had four prime ministers and endured massive anti-corruption protests, Iohannis has cultivated the image of a staunchly pro-European leader with a calming influence.</p>
      <p>Iohannis is a former leader of the National Liberal Party, which last week formed a minority government led by Prime Minister Ludovic Orban.</p>
      <p>While lacking an executive role, Romania's president has significant decision-making powers, including involvement in matters of national security and foreign policy. The president also can reject party nominees for prime minister and government nominees for judicial appointments.</p>
      <p>Dancila's Social Democratic government was ousted last month after losing a no-confidence vote in parliament amid corruption scandals and accusations that it wanted close control over the judiciary. However, she has tried to cast herself as a social reformer.</p>
      <p>"I voted against austerity, against the cutting of pensions and salaries . (for) a Romania where citizens do not fear tomorrow," Dancila said after voting Sunday.</p>
      <p>Romania is also facing a growing labor shortage and widespread disappointment among its youth with the current political elite.</p>
