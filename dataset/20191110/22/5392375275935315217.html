      <p>Gboard: Google’s Android keyboard suggests suitable GIFs for emojis<br/>4 (80%) 2 votes</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/google">Google</a> is constantly improving its services which makes it absolutely important for Android users. According to the latest reports, the company has updated Gboard. Now, when we type using Gboard, it proposes appropriate GIF animations on request for your written emojis. This makes writing with the Google keyboard even more interactive.</p>

      <p>When you access the emoji keyboard, we now have a new “Suggestions” bar that prompts you to “Tap an emoji to get suggestions.” Selecting a character will load related GIFs and stickers for you to insert into any conversation.</p>
      <blockquote>Suggests GIF / Sticker content for you when you select emojis on the emoji keyboard.</blockquote>

      <p>You can swipe across Gboard translate results to chose an appropriate sticker. If there is no result for your request, you get the response “No suggestions here… try a different emoji”. At the top-right of the display, you can access Gboard’s main Preferences page. Here, you can disable “Emoji browsing suggestions”</p>
      <p>As of now, this feature is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin">Gboard 8.8 beta</a>. The emoji translator feature is not widely available for now thus not every user can access it. If you can not access the feature, just be patient, it will eventually become active.</p>
