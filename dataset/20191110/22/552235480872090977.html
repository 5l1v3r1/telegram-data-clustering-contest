      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:31:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Stewart, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stephen-stewart/</a></address>
      <p>Labour MP <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labour-mp-keith-vaz-faces-20743223">Keith Vaz</a> has announced his retirement from Parliament after 32 years in the wake of a cocaine scandal that sullied his reputation.</p>
      <p>The news comes just weeks after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/misconduct-allegation-against-commons-speaker-12586622">Commons Standards Committee</a> recommended he should be handed a six-month suspension for causing "significant damage" to the reputation of the House.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old was found to have expressed a willingness to purchase cocaine for others during an encounter <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/keith-vaz-drugs-probe-police-9245247">with male prostitutes.</a></p>
      <p>Vaz - the MP for Leicester East - faced calls to step down, including from within his own party, while he was also under threat of having the Labour whip removed.</p>
      <p>He announced his retirement on Sunday evening, saying he will not stand in next month's General Election.</p>
      <p>Vaz added the people of Leicester "will always be in my heart".</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said: "I have decided to retire after completing 32 years as the Member of Parliament for Leicester East.</p>
      <p>"In that time I have won eight general elections. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my constituency since I came to the city in 1985.</p>

      <p>"I want to thank the people of Leicester East for their absolute loyalty and support."</p>
      <p>Party leader <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/infowars-unit-attacked-jeremy-corbyn-20849892">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said: "Keith Vaz was among the pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987.</p>
      <p>"I was proud to support his selection and incredibly proud when he won, taking the seat from the Tories.</p>
      <p>"Keith has made a substantial and significant contribution to public life, both as a constituency MP for the people of Leicester and for the Asian community across the country.</p>
      <p>"He has helped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics."</p>
      <p>Corbyn added: "His work in Parliament has been exemplary as Britain's first Asian-origin minister, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, a campaigner on diabetes issues and most recently trying to help the peace process in Yemen."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>During the committee hearing in October, the Commons disciplinary body said his explanation that he may have been given a "spiked" drink and that he was suffering from amnesia was "not believable and, indeed, ludicrous".</p>
      <p>A statement on Vaz's website said he was admitted to hospital on the day the committee's report was published.</p>
      <p>It said he had been receiving treatment for a "serious mental health condition" since details of the encounter were published in the Sunday Mirror in 2016.</p>
      <p>MPs had endorsed the recommended suspension without a formal vote.</p>
