      <p>The latest crossover costume for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/street-fighter-5/37984"><i>Street Fighter 5</i></a><i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/arcade"><i>Arcade</i></a><i> Edition </i>comes from Capcom’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/monster-hunter/679">Monster Hunter</a> franchise and … hmmm … I don’t know ‘bout that.</p>
      <p>The look somehow expects us to see Blanka costumed as the giant dragon Nergigante. Fearsome and bestial for sure, but what in the world is going on here?</p>
      <p>Here is a good reply:</p>

      <p>This getup is coming Nov. 22 and will be available until Dec. 20. Presumably, one will acquire it by the usual method of completing unlock missions, begun with Fight Money.</p>
      <p>The current timed alternate costume available in <i>SF5AE </i>is Poison’s Lady outfit from <i>Devil May Cry 4</i>. Players have another two weeks to pick up her look.</p>
