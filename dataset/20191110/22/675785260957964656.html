      <h1>Arsenal players have two major reservations about Unai Emery as pressure increases</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal endured another disappointing defeat this weekend to leave them fighting to secure a place in the top four</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:49:12+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>A number of Arsenal players are believed to have reservations over boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Emery has found himself under increasing pressure at the Emirates after this weekend's 2-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Mirror Sport reported the Spaniard is not under immediate threat of the sack with the board remaining 100 percent behind the boss.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> may well have to finish in the top four for Emery to keep his job but there are reportedly concerns from within the dressing room.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7670551/Arsenal-wont-panicked-sacking-Unai-Emery.html">The Mail reports</a> there is a real disappointment among players with Emery's conservative approach to matches.</p>

      <p>That comes on the back of the defeat at Leicester, with Arsenal playing with a back five, and two holding midfielders.</p>
      <p>It is also suggested there is another concern - about Emery's ability to communicate clearly with his players.</p>
      <p>The manager is now in his second season at the club but those issues have persisted since he was appointed last summer.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, striker Alexandre Lacazette has admitted the Gunners are low on confidence going into the international break.</p>
      <p>“We miss confidence and we need the international break," he said.</p>
      <p>"I hope we are going to come back well. We need to work more than we do now to find confidence.</p>
      <p>“We are very disappointed, we had chances in the first half. We couldn’t score and you need to take your chances in this type of game.</p>
      <p>“We have to work again and keep working everyday. But I think we didn’t play so bad, we just missed our chances in the first half.”</p>
