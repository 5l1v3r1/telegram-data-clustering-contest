      <p>LYON: Fiji winger Josua Tuisova impressed on his first Lyon appearance since the Rugby World Cup as the French Top 14 leaders hammered La Rochelle 45-17 on Sunday (Nov 10).</p>
      <p>Tuisova, 25, who scored twice as the Pacific Islanders were knocked out of the competition at the pool stages in Japan, played a part in three of his new side's five tries against last season's fellow semi-finalists.</p>

      <p>Lyon's Pierre Mignoni handed club debuts to Tuisova and France's Demba Bamba who missed the opening eight rounds of the campaign due to their international committments.</p>
      <p>His La Rochelle counterpart Jono Gibbes started four players who participated at the World Cup including Tuisova's compatriot Levani Botia.</p>
      <p>The visitors, who are yet to win away from Stade Marcel-Deflandre this season, crossed for the first try of the game through France prop Dany Priso after six minutes.</p>
      <p>Dylan Cretin scored for the home side before fly-halves Ihaia West and Jonathan Wisnewski traded penalty goals and Lyon led 11-10 after 23 minutes.</p>
      <p>Mignoni's outfit took control of the fixture with Baptiste Couilloud's first of two tries after a powerful run by Tuisova and further Wisnewski efforts at the posts for a 24-10 advantage at the break.</p>
      <p>Tuisova, who joined Lyon after six campaigns with Toulon, then set-up Couilloud for the scrum-half's double. Wisnewski converted the extras and the top of the table side led 31-10 after 44 minutes.</p>
      <p>La Rochelle's only second-half response came as Geoffrey Doumayrou scored two minutes later.</p>
      <p>With less than half an hour to play it looked as if Tusivoa would finally get on the scoreboard after he ran in from a Cretin off-load but the Fiji winger selflessly chose to pass to Ngatai in the in-goal area for Lyon's fourth try of proceedings.</p>
      <p>Former France international Mathieu Bastareaud was replaced with 23 minutes to go in his final Lyon appearances before he joins New York's Rugby United.</p>
      <p>Lyon clinched the bonus point with six minutes to go as loose forward Loann Goujon smashed through Jeremy Sinzelle for his first try of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Later on Sunday Stade Francais and Racing 92 meet in the Parisian derby with both clubs in the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>On Saturday champions Toulouse hammered Clermont 34-8 in a re-run of June's final.</p>
