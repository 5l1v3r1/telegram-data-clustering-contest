      <h1>Neil Lennon hints at new Celtic deal for Jonny Hayes as Hoops star makes John Kennedy boss claim</h1>
      <h2>Hayes isn’t shocked to hear the Parkhead coach being linked with the vacant post at Hibs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:39:31+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:39</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>Jonny Hayes has not got a shred of doubt <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-kennedy">John Kennedy</a> will one day be his own man in the dugout.</p>
      <p>And the Hoops ace is hoping when the time comes that it will be in the Celtic Park hotseat.</p>
      <p>Hayes isn’t shocked to hear the Parkhead coach being linked with the vacant gaffer’s job along the M8 at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> .</p>
      <p>Kennedy has a rock-solid reputation in the game and has been a major part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> ’s success story in recent years.</p>
      <p>He has built a body of work on the training ground having started with the youths following his career-ending injury.</p>
      <p>He joined Ronny Deila’s backroom team and then landed a prominent role alongside <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> .</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman was keen to take him to Leicester but Kennedy stayed put to remain part of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> ’s staff and Hayes reckons the coach will resist the chance to branch out for himself by taking the Easter Road job.</p>

      <p>The wideman said: “I can’t see it myself. It’s obvious he’s going to be a manager one day. The work here he does, he’s been enormous behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>“He was a great player but he’s an outstanding coach. He’s Celtic through and through as well, so I can’t see him leaving. At least I hope not!”</p>
      <p>Hayes – man of the match in the 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> – revealed Kennedy has played a huge part in making him feel comfortable as a makeshift left-back.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d played there before but it’s hard trying to learn a new position and picking it up as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>“I feel I am learning every time I play there but it’s great to be able to bounce questions off John.</p>
      <p>“He’s a fantastic coach who really knows the defensive side of the game.</p>
      <p>“He’s been a real comfort blanket for me and I always talk to him about it after the games. He reassures me and gives me confidence.”</p>
      <p>Kennedy provides the confidence but it’s skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> who gives this Celtic side their inspiration.</p>

      <p>The Hoops were running on fumes against Well yesterday following their stunning win against Lazio in Rome just three days earlier.</p>
      <p>Hayes reckons Brown’s fitness almost defies belief after he managed to drag shattered Celts to another key win against the sturdy Steelmen.</p>
      <p>He added: “The captain leads by example. But the workrate week in week out of the likes of Browny, Callum McGregor and Ryan Christie, it’s second nature at this stage.</p>
      <p>“Especially as some of the players have been playing 60 games a season for the last three or <br/>four years.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The captain has got a bit of Benjamin Button about him!</p>
      <p>“He has proved people wrong with how fit he is. His determination in games is incredible. We look up to him.</p>
      <p>“The squad is a fit and strong squad. We have no qualms about playing two or three games a week.</p>
      <p>“It was good to have a home game – with all the supporters there in a packed stadium and with a good football pitch you don’t need any extra incentive to go and perform on the back of Thursday night.</p>

      <p>“It was a good result for the club but we came back to a home game in front of a full house. All the motivation we needed was there.</p>
      <p>“Obviously three points was the most important thing. But it was important we put on a decent display as well on the back of Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“The manager made sure that we didn’t dwell on that.”</p>
      <p>Hayes was thrilled to play a part in the win but admitted his man of the match display was motivated by his task to win over his son rather than the desire to secure a new deal.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old’s contract is up at the end of the season and he would love to finish his career at Parkhead.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Boss Lennon also hinted an offer could be in the post but Hayes is only thinking about keeping his youngster happy.</p>
      <p>He added: “My son at home is my biggest critic.</p>
      <p>“I got back in from Rome at 5am and he woke me up at 8am to tell me I was at fault for a couple of free-kicks! When you get that at home everything else pales into insignificance.</p>

      <p>“I’ve got two young kids to provide for and that’s my motivation, whether it’s here, there or anywhere.</p>
      <p>“I take my football day by day, I don’t think about the future. What will be will be.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, I was just happy to be out there playing football, as long as we won.</p>
      <p>“We finished the last run of games on a defeat and we wanted to make sure that didn’t happen again today.</p>
      <p>“I thought we played well right from the first whistle. It was thoroughly deserved. I knew when I signed here I was going to be in and out sometimes.</p>
      <p>“I know how the squad works here but I won’t complain. I’ve cherished every minute I’ve had on the pitch since I got the injury.</p>
      <p>“I’m always there when the manager calls.”</p>
