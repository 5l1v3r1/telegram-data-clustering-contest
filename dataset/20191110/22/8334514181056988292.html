      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Spain’s far-left Unidas Podemos party, who failed to form a coalition government with the Socialists after last April’s elections, said on Sunday he was still hopeful of reaching a government deal following Sunday’s repeat election.</p>
      <p>Pablo Iglesias said he was ready to start talks with the Socialist Party of acting Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez as soon as on Monday.</p>
      <p>The two parties, however, do not have enough seats for a parliamentary majority and would need to negotiate support with other forces in a highly fragmented lower house.</p>
