      <p>Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has shown that he can make unbelievable plays using a variety of different arm angles, and footwork as well.</p>
      <p>As a former baseball player, like Russell Wilson, he can make plays that few other signal-callers can.</p>
      <p>He showed that during Sunday’s game against the Titans, making Tennessee pay on a pivotal play that extended the Chiefs’ lead to two scores. Mahomes sensed the pressure, but still managed to jump up in the pocket and threw a dime touchdown pass to Mecole Hardman for the 63-yard touchdown.</p>
