      <h1>Blake Austin lifts the lid on his unexpected wing debut for Great Britain</h1>
      <h2>Warrington stand-off had never played on the wing before Saturday's defeat to New Zealand in Christchurch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T22:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Stott</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/blake-austins-fancy-footwork-turning-14097204">Blake Austin</a> has opened up about his nightmare start in the Lions' third successive <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/new-zealand-23-8-great-20845846">tour defeat</a>.</p>
      <p>But the Warrington half-back, who was controversially used on the wing, insists he was happy to play there.</p>
      <p>He said: "I had never played there before but I believe I was the best man with where we are as a squad.</p>
      <p>"I was confident but I am pretty disappointed with how it panned out. I could have done a slightly better job."</p>
      <p>Austin - one of six halves in the squad - was asked to debut on the wing after Ryan Hall and Zak Hardaker pulled out injured.</p>

      <p>Wayne Bennett's decision caused uproar among fans who were already fed up after seeing two earlier poor Lions defeats.</p>
      <p>It was a move that looked like backfiring spectacularly when Austin was caught out badly twice in the opening 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>He dropped a high kick from dangerman Shaun Johnson and then caught another kick but was dragged into touch.</p>
      <p>On the back of that mistake, the Kiwis pounced for their opening try and took a stranglehold that the Lions could not break.</p>
      <p>Austin said: "It is not easy for the team when you start with a couple of errors like that, it makes for a tough night.</p>
      <p>"The first one slipped through my arms - it wasn't really a challenging one at all and I thought I was comfortable.</p>

      <p>"The second one I managed to grab and then got dragged into touch. It's a tough way to start the match.</p>
      <p>"But it's a game of footy and I never shy away from a challenge. I would have liked to have done a bit better but we will move on."</p>
      <p>Austin recovered from his bad start and ended up as one of the team's stronger ball carriers.</p>
      <p>There was another howler at the end, when he fluffed a gilt-edged try scoring chance, but Bennett still gave him big raps.</p>
      <p>The under-pressure coach said: "He was really good for someone who has not carried the ball much. I thought he was quite outstanding."</p>

      <p>The Lions need to beat Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby next Saturday to avoid a disastrous tour whitewash.</p>
      <p>Bennett has called up Leeds winger Ash Handley as emergency cover, meaning Austin could get a spot in the halves.</p>
      <p>But two of the squad's other halves, George Williams and Jake Trueman, have been told that they will also get a game having not been selected so far.</p>
      <p>Austin said: "I am not sure what will happen but obviously I would love a chance in the halves.</p>
      <p>"There are a few other guys who are chomping at the bit for a chance to run in the halves so we will see how we go."</p>
      <p>Hooker Josh Hodgson scored Great Britain's only try, meaning they have scored just three tries in three tour games.</p>
