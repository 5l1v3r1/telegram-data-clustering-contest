      <p>The investigation is in it early stages, however, police say that based on initial information, the incident appears to have been targeted.</p>
      <p>The Surrey RCMP General Investigation Unit is in charge of the investigation and the area surrounding the scene is expected to be cordoned off for a significant amount of time.</p>
      <p>Officers are interviewing witnesses and canvassing the area for further information and evidence.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information who has not already spoken to police is asked to contact the Surrey RCMP at 604-599-0502 or, to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers, at 1-800-222-8477 or www.solvecrime.ca, quoting file number 2019-174809.</p>
