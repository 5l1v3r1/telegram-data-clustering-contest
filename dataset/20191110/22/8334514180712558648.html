      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - The leader of Spain’s centre-right Ciudadanos party, Albert Rivera, on Sunday said there was “no excuses” for his party’s collapse in a general election.</p>
      <p>Ciudadanos won 10 seats on Sunday, down from 57 in a previous election in April.</p>
      <p>Rivera said his party’s executive committee would meet on Monday and that he would then call a party congress, where the members and activists would decide on Ciudadanos’ future.</p>
