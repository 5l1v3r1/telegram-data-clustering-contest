      <h1>Scots boy, 5, battered at hotel kids’ club in Turkey as bullies caught on CCTV running riot</h1>
      <h2>Harley Irvine was held and beaten by up to six older boys for up to an hour and the family say the children were left unsupervised after they left their son in the hotel staff’s care.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Derek Alexander, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/derek-alexander/</a></address>
      <p>Bullies subjected a five-year-old boy to an attack at a luxury hotel's kids’ club which left him bruised and traumatised, CCTV footage shows.</p>
      <p>Harley Irvine was held and battered by up to six older children at the play area after his mum, Rachel Irvine, and dad, Stuart Anderson, put him in staff’s care.</p>
      <p>The parents were left shocked when they saw Harley’s multiple injuries –including footprints on his body and marks under his chin – when they took off his top at bedtime.</p>
      <p>Rachel, 33, choked back tears when she saw the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-mum-fights-life-greece-20824633">Turkish</a> hotel’s security recording of Harley being repeatedly hit by his tormentors – other guests’ children, thought to be aged between eight and 10.</p>

      <p>The 10-minute clip included images of Harley being punched, kicked, pushed and held during the ordeal.</p>
      <p>He is seen being restrained against a metal railing with his arms held behind his back as he is being assaulted.</p>
      <p>At one point, Harley managed to run off and told his mum he hid in a toilet cubicle to escape the attack.</p>
      <p>However, he was targeted again the moment he re-emerged.</p>
      <p>His parents fear the beating at the resort’s Lollipop Kids’ Club may have lasted up to an hour – the length of time he was there.</p>
      <p>The horror incident happened last month, on the final day of the family’s stay at the five-star Sueno Hotel Deluxe in Antalya’s Belek resort.</p>

      <p>Rachel and Stuart say that tour provider <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/dozesn-scots-holiday-makers-suing-20759436">Jet2</a> and travel agency Barrhead Travel, who sold the all-inclusive, 14-day holiday, have failed to respond adequately to their complaint, which was lodged when they returned to their home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh’s</a> Craigmount area.</p>
      <p>They say that for almost four weeks following the incident, Harley – a pupil at East Craigs Primary School – became withdrawn and cried whenever Rachel left him.</p>
      <p>Thompsons Solicitors is launching a legal action against the two firms on the family’s behalf.</p>
      <p>Rachel said: “Harley was traumatised for weeks after the attack. He was very clingy and emotional.</p>
      <p>“One minute, he’d be laughing and the next, he’d be crying. He’d also cry whenever I left him. There has been an improvement but he has said he doesn’t want to go on holiday again.”</p>

      <p>The couple – who booked the £5000 family holiday as their honeymoon after getting married last year – claim hotel management became hostile after the parents filmed a copy of the CCTV footage on a mobile phone and then demanded an investigation.</p>
      <p>It is claimed the children were left unsupervised as a young female employee “played on her phone” instead of monitoring their behaviour.</p>
      <p>The parents also claim Harley was not offered first aid by the hotel after his injuries were revealed. Rachel added: “Harley wanted to go to the kids’ club because it was our last night and there were lots of games.</p>

      <p>“He was excited to be going but when we picked him up, he was very quiet and withdrawn.</p>
      <p>“I noticed a red lump on his arm and he said he ran into a wall. But when we got him back to our room to get ready for bed, we noticed other marks that looked like footprints on his body when he took off his T-shirt.</p>
      <p>“He was too scared to tell us what happened so Stuart and I went to the club and demanded to see the CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>“What we saw was heartbreaking. Harley could be seen raising his hands, pleading with the boys to stop hitting him. His pockets were also searched before being hit again.</p>

      <p>“I was only allowed to watch 10 minutes of the footage but we think the attack happened for much longer, maybe the full hour he was there.</p>
      <p>“A security guard said it was ‘boys being boys’ but this was extreme bullying and an assault which happened while children were supposed to be under the supervision of hotel staff.</p>
      <p>“The club had three employees in the club when we dropped Harley off. But when we returned, there was just one young woman in her 20s. Harley said she sat at her desk playing on her phone. There was a screen in front of her showing the area. Had she been paying attention, she would have seen what was going on.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“We’ve been left in limbo by Barrhead Travel and Jet2 despite being told the matter would be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>“We’ll never use a kids’ club again after this. Parents should be able to drop their children off and know that they’re safe.”</p>
      <p>Stuart revealed that resort employees, including management, became unfriendly to them after the incident.</p>
      <p>Staff who had previously been helpful started to ignore the family, including 16-year-old daughter Megan, and even followed them when they went to the communal toilets.</p>
      <p>Stuart said a senior manager branded them “horrible people” when he learned they had evidence of the attack and at one point tried to blame Harley for triggering the incident.</p>

      <p>He also said Harley’s attackers, who were believed to be German, were allowed to continue using the kids’ club after the assault.</p>
      <p>Stuart said: “We wanted to get the police involved but were told it was pointless because the incident involved minors.</p>
      <p>“At the very least the hotel should have offered us support. Instead, they turned against us. We were followed everywhere we went, even to the toilets.</p>
      <p>“Until Harley was attacked, staff would offer us lifts on a buggy whenever they drove by, but that stopped.</p>
      <p>“A manager looked at the footage, pointed at Harley on the screen and said he’d hit one of the boys.</p>
      <p>“When he found out we had the footage, he threw his hands in the air and said, ‘You’re horrible people’, and walked away. From that point, they wanted us out of the hotel. Luckily, we left the next day.”</p>

      <p>The family’s lawyer, Stewart White, said: “What happened to the Irvines is every parent’s worst nightmare. For an incident like this to happen to their young child is disgraceful.”</p>
      <p>Cengiz Golmez, manager of the hotel, claimed staff offered to get Harley medical treatment but his parents refused.</p>
      <p>He added: “The other families involved complained that the Scottish boy hit their children.</p>
      <p>“I offered to help but the boy’s mother was looking for money to be taken off their bill as compensation. I couldn’t do this.”</p>
      <p>Barrhead Travel said: “Our team are supporting Ms Irvine and her family while an investigation is ongoing, in accordance with ABTA’s guidelines.”</p>
      <p>Jet2 said: “It would be inappropriate for us to make any comment at this time.”</p>
