      <p>TURKEY, Texas (KABC) -- Yet another gender reveal went awry when it ended in a plane crash in West Texas last month. The pilot's crop-duster stalled out after dumping hundreds of gallons of pink water during a couple's gender reveal celebration, according to a newly released report.<br/><br/>One passenger suffered minor injuries when the plane crashed Sept. 7 near the town of Turkey, about 260 miles northwest of Dallas. A National Transportation Safety Board report released Thursday says the pilot dumped about 350 gallons of pink water from the aircraft, which then stalled and crashed.<br/><br/><a href="https://abc7.com/pink-or-blue-some-gender-reveal-parties-take-dangerous-turn/5664443/"><b>RELATED: Gender reveal parties grow increasingly popular, but some take dangerous turn</b></a><br/><br/>Two people were on board the plane, even though it was only built for one, according to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector. The pilot said there were no failures or malfunctions with the plane before the crash.<br/><br/>Gender reveal parties for expecting parents have grown in popularity but mishaps can be deadly.
