      <p>Michael Milne’s second goal of the night at 8:08 of the third period stood up as the game-winner on Saturday night, leading the Winnipeg Ice to a 5-4 decision over the visiting Regina Pats.</p>
      <p>Isaac Johnson also had two goals for the home team, which improved to 10-7-1-0. Carter Massier responded with a two-goal effort for the Pats, who fell to 2-12-2-0.</p>
      <p>Johnson opened the scoring with a breakaway goal just 54 seconds into the contest. Ty Kolle put Regina on the board but Johnson responded to give Winnipeg a 2-1 lead after 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>Massier and Drew Englot scored back-to-back goals to open the second period, giving the Pats a 3-2 lead. Milne got one back with 2:16 left in the second and Nino Kinder gave the Ice a 4-3 edge 6:30 into the third.</p>
      <p>Milne added the eventual game winner just 1:38 later.</p>
      <p>Massier made it 5-4 midway through the third but that’s as close as Regina would get.</p>
      <p>Max Paddock took the loss for the Pats, who were outshot 38-34. Ex-Pat Dean McNabb picked up the win.</p>
      <p>Regina went 1-for-2 on the power play. Winnipeg was 1-for-6.</p>
      <p>The Pats’ next action is Saturday night at the Brandt Centre versus the Prince Albert Raiders.</p>
