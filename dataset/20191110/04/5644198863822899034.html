      <p>Beierlorzer lasted only 11 matches after joining this season from Jahn Regensburg, with Cologne having won just two league games.</p>
      <p>"I regret that we are forced to take this step because we value Achim Beierlorzer very much," said Cologne sports director Frank Aehlig in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless the expected sporting success has not materialised so far and it is our task to give everything we have so that the club reaches its goals."</p>
      <p>Cologne, promoted last season, are on seven points, three ahead of bottom club Paderborn and two behind Mainz 05 who sit in the relegation playoff spot.</p>
