      <h1>Lib Dems target Stephen Gethins of SNP in Scotland's closest general election seat</h1>
      <h2>North East Fife was won by the Gethins by just two votes in 2017 and it is expected to be a bellwether constituency on December 12.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>The Lib Dems have insisted they can snatch Scotland’s closest seat back from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/snp-vow-keep-trumps-hands-20834773">SNP</a> with their hard-line anti-Brexit policy.</p>
      <p>North East Fife was won by the Nationalists’ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/labour-delegates-vote-support-jeremy-20161395">Stephen Gethins</a> by just two votes in 2017 and is expected to be a bellwether constituency on December 12.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/glasgow-councillor-offered-join-lib-20824734">Lib Dem</a> Wendy Chamberlain is adamant her party’s decision to back revoking Article 50 altogether and also reject a second independence referendum is winning fans on the doorstep.</p>
      <p>She said: “North East Fife was a Liberal Democrat seat until 2015 and we have gone up nationally in the polls across Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Yes, the SNP have done so as well but I hope we can win because the impression I am getting on the doorstep is that people are very positive about our message.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“The way I explain our Brexit policy is to make clear that we would only cancel Brexit if we won a majority.</p>
      <p>“Would we really expect Jo Swinson to go to Brussels to get a deal she didn’t want to then campaign against it? So that is how I rationalise it on the doorstep.</p>
      <p>“I became the candidate in June 2018 so it is not a case of this being a recent selection.</p>
      <p>“I have been working in the seat with the Lib Dem councillors and Willie Rennie since then.</p>
      <p>“So we have done a good body of work to set us up for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/uk-general-election-2019-dates-20823801">this campaign</a>. I hope I have good recognition when people open the door to me and people are well aware of the two-vote margin.”</p>
      <p>The SNP sneaked by the Lib Dems with 13,743 votes to their 13,741 in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Tories also polled more than 10,000 votes and Tony Miklinski will again fancy his chances this time around.</p>
      <p>But Gethins has insisted the SNP’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-deadline-day-comes-goes-20797182">anti-Brexit</a>, pro-EU position will see him increase his share of the vote.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “It is increasingly clear, given the cross-party endorsements I have received and for the work that the SNP has been doing to stop Brexit at Westminster, that this time people who want to stop Brexit are consolidating behind the SNP at this election. That is the message we are getting on the doorstep in North East Fife.</p>
      <p>“I have been delighted to receive the endorsement of so many voters that previously voted Liberal Democrat, Green and for other parties but who are now backing the SNP for the first time in this election.</p>
      <p>“We have an opportunity to stop the Tories and stop their dangerous and damaging Brexit at this election.</p>
      <p>“But we can take nothing for granted and I will be fighting for every single vote in the run-up to the election.”</p>
      <p>North East Fife was held by Lib Dem Menzies Campbell from 1987 until Gethins seized the seat after he retired in 2015.</p>
      <p>The SNP has backed a second referendum on EU membership and also wants a referendum on Scottish independence next year.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems, by contrast, have rejected any referenda next year after saying that if leader Swinson was to become prime minister, she would simply revoke Article 50 and cancel Brexit altogether.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Swinson has also rejected an independence referendum for Scotland.</p>
      <p>But a former Fife Lib Dem provost last week said she was backing Gethins in his bid to keep hold of the constituency.</p>
      <p>Frances Melville, who was Lord Provost of Fife from 2007 to 2012 while a Liberal Democrat councillor, stunned her party by backing Gethins in his bid to keep hold of the seat.</p>
      <p>She insisted Gethins had “brought others together across the political divide to oppose Brexit and the damage being done by Boris Johnson’s out-of-control Government”.</p>
      <p>She added: “At this critical time, we need someone with his experience and approach for the good of everyone here.</p>
      <p>“People need to understand just how important EU membership is to North East Fife and Scotland as a whole.”</p>
      <p>In a sign of how seriously the Lib Dems are taking the race, Swinson chose the constituency’s Auchtermuchty to declare her vow not to back a second independence referendum last week.</p>
      <p>She said she did not believe there should be another referendum, even if the SNP wins a majority at the next Holyrood election.</p>
      <p>Johnson had made the same commitment during a visit to Moray the day before.</p>
      <p>Swinson said: “Nicola Sturgeon wants to take Scotland out of the UK and I believe that would cause additional chaos on top of the challenges we are already facing. We should learn the lessons of Brexit, not try to repeat the mistakes.”</p>
      <p>Asked if she would oppose an independence referendum in all circumstances, even if the SNP wins a majority, Swinson added: “I do not wish to add chaos on top of an already chaotic situation and that is what IndyRef2 would do. We are in a situation here in Scotland where we’ve had this constitutional obsession for eight years.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Lib Dem leader Rennie, who is the MSP for North East Fife, has also moved to explain his party’s unionist message by claiming “scunneration factor” has left people exhausted with constitutional division.</p>
      <p>Scotland voted in favour of the UK staying in the EU by 62 per cent to 38 per cent – with all 32 council areas backing Remain.</p>
      <p>Fife, by comparison, leaned slightly more towards Leave, with just 58.6 per cent backing Remain.</p>
