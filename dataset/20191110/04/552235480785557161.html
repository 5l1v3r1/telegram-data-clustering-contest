      <h1>Celtic fan's terror after being stabbed in back by masked Lazio thug in Rome ambush</h1>
      <h2>Conor Weir was knifed while in the Italian capital by a Lazio hooligan following Thursday night's Europa League victory.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T04:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McGivern, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcgivern/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fan has told how he was ambushed and stabbed by Lazio hooligans as he celebrated his team’s win in Rome.</p>
      <p>Conor Weir, 20, was with friends at a McDonald’s near the Vatican hours after Thursday night’s match when a car pulled up and masked thugs jumped out.</p>
      <p>He was stabbed in the back and the yobs fled.</p>
      <p>Conor, of Bo’ness, West Lothian, was rushed to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> in an ambulance.</p>
      <p>He phoned his dad Derek from there on Friday morning to tell him what happened and was due to arrive home last night.</p>
      <p>Derek said: “The first I heard of it was when Conor rang. His phone had been off overnight while he was getting treatment.</p>

      <p>“He said he’d gone to a McDonald’s at the end of the night with his pals and a car pulled up and guys with masks and hoods on jumped out. They stabbed him and then got away in a car.</p>
      <p>“The whole thing was over very quickly. Conor was treated in hospital and the doctors were happy to release him the next day.</p>
      <p>“He hasn’t wanted to make a big deal out of it.”</p>
      <p>Another source said of Conor: “The last thing he was looking for was aggro. Conor and his mates were getting to the end of their night and weren’t expecting any bother.</p>
      <p>“Their digs were quite close to the Vatican and they’d gone for a McDonald’s on a big street so they didn’t think that would be a likely location for getting jumped.</p>

      <p>“It was obviously planned because the guy who stabbed him had a hood up and a mask on. The knife had a short blade and didn’t pierce any important areas.”</p>
      <p>Conor – who works for wood panel makers Norbord Europe in Cowie, Stirlingshire – was attacked on the Viale Giulio Cesare, in the Prati area of Rome.</p>
      <p>He was the third Celtic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/football-fans">fan</a> to be stabbed in the city.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, two were knifed at a bar three miles away on Via Nazionale.</p>
      <p>Lazio “ultras” also targeted Hoops supporters who had to walk into the city centre after the game – which <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-match-reports/lazio-1-celtic-2-olivier-20834529">Celtic won 2-1</a> – when their shuttle bus broke down. At least 12 Italian fans were arrested.</p>
