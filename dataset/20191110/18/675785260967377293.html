      <h2>The telly personality, 39, admitted 'my body likes being curvy' after she spent her younger years being her thinnest ever due to stressful relationships and work</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:10:45+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kelly-brook">Kelly Brook</a> has admitted she loves her new curves as she's finally happy with her body following years of being "skinny and miserable".</p>
      <p>The presenter, 39, has finally found confidence in loving herself after a huge "wake-up call" two years ago at a red carpet event.</p>
      <p>The telly personality had spent some time out of the spotlight and turned to a rather quiet life in the countryside.</p>
      <p>She made her debut appearance when she stepped in front of the cameras again but was left shocked as photographers were shouting at her to "breathe in".</p>
      <p>And although it was a rude gesture, Kelly wasn't phased and took it as her motivation to shed some weight.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10287555/kelly-brook-life-begins-at-40/">The Sun</a> : "Well, I'm glad they told me! They actually thought they were doing me a favour, but yeah, it was a bit of a shock.</p>
      <p>"But they knew me as skinny, and all of a sudden I'd turned up with bigger boobs, a bigger bum, bigger arms - just a lot bigger, so I think it was a shock for them as well!"</p>

      <p>The model said she was aware she had crept up to a size 16 as she enjoyed regular hearty pub lunches and fulfillment in her personal life while living in Kent.</p>
      <p>Brook said it "dawned on me" and thought she had do something about her weight even though she felt the same.</p>
      <p>And since then, she has made several lifestyle changes, lost two stone and she is going to slim down to a size 12.</p>
      <p>The gradual process has seen Kelly running up to three times a week and following a SlimFast eating plan to achieve her "Size Sexy" as she approaches her 40th birthday later this month.</p>

      <p>The star admitted she would never want to go back to her tiniest waistline because they were some of her "saddest" years.</p>
      <p>Now Kelly is in love with her body.</p>
      <p>She added: "My body likes being curvy. It would be really difficult for me to be a skinny girl cos it’s not my shape or who I am and I’m not going to aspire to be something that’s unattainable."</p>

      <p>Kelly confessed relationships were hard because she was constantly travelling, saying she kept the weight off due to the anxiety and stress of always being on the go.</p>
      <p>As time has moved on, the beauty is happy with her beau Jeremy Parisi.</p>
