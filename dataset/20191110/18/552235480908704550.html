      <h1>Liverpool 3 Man City 1 as Andy Robertson's stunning assist helps Reds stretch lead at top</h1>
      <h2>Jurgen Klopp's men enjoyed a crucial win over their Premier League rivals.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:29:16+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have stretched their lead at the top of the Premier league to eight points after a 3-1 win over rivals <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> .</p>
      <p>Goals from Fabinho, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane helped the Reds to a crucial three points in the title race.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva grabbed a consolation for City in the second half, but it was too little, too late for the away side.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> 's men bolted out the blocks as Brazilian Fabinho opened the scoring with a long-range screamer, despite claims of a Liverpool hand ball in the build up.</p>

      <p>The Anfield side doubled their lead thanks to Salah and it was engineered by Scotland's own <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> .</p>
      <p>The left-back put in a stunning cross for the Egyptian forward as he steered the ball past Claudio Bravo.</p>
      <p>Jordan Henderson did his best Robbo impression as he put in an exquisite ball for Mane who gave <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> a three-goal advantage.</p>
      <p>City pressed forward in the later stages as they desperately looked to get back in the game.</p>

      <p>Silva handed Pep Guardiola's side a lifeline with a neat finish into the bottom right corner.</p>
      <p>Guardiola was then enraged on the touchline as his side were denied a penalty when the ball struck Trent Alexander-Arnoold's hand inside the area. But the referee wasn't interested as Liverpool picked up the victory.</p>
      <p>Klopp's side are now eight points clear of Leicester City in second, with Man City nine points adrift in fourth spot.</p>
