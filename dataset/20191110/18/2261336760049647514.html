      <blockquote>Well done Volkov .<br/>Let’s go now and please don’t turn this down again. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UFCMoscow?src=hashtag_click">#UFCMoscow</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UNCROWNEDCHAMP?src=hashtag_click">#UNCROWNEDCHAMP</a></blockquote>
      <p>“The Predator” was one of the fighters offered to step in as dos Santos’ replacement against Volkov. But Ngannou, however, turned it down, citing 18 days was too short for him to get ready.</p>
      <p>“‘In 18 days.’ Really? For what purpose?” Ngannou told TMZ Sports in a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/24/20930294/ufc-mma-news-interview-heavyweight-francis-ngannou-alexander-volkov-heavyweight-fight">late-October interview</a>. “What is the goal for this fight because it’s a step down for me. We’re talking about what, a title shot guarantee, a contract renegotiation, what? ‘No, we’re not talking about that. Just a fight.’</p>
      <p>“So we think about it and we’re like, what is the purpose to risk to go to the fight without a training camp because it’s just 18 days.”</p>
      <p>Volkov bounced back from late TKO loss to Derrick Lewis at UFC 229 in October 2018. He now holds a record of 31-7 (with 23 wins by stoppage).</p>
