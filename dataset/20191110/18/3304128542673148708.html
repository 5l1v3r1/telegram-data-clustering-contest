      <p>Two people died on Sunday morning and 10 others left with serious injuries after a 14-seater matatu collided with a lorry at Kapiti area on the Nairobi-Mombasa Highway.</p>
      <p>Reports indicate the matatu driver was trying to overtake another vehicle when he collided with the oncoming lorry.</p>
      <p>However, a section of residents stated that the accident occurred after the driver of the lorry was forced to come to an abrupt stop by traffic officers. He is said to have lost control of the vehicle before ramming into the matatu.</p>
