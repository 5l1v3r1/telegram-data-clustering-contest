      <p>LONDON -- The British royals made a public appearance Saturday <a href="https://abc7.com/society/prince-harry-addresses-rumors-of-rift-with-brother-william/5642090/">amid rumors of a rift among the so-called "Fab Four."</a></p>
      <p>The Queen, her two grandsons and their spouses gathered for reflections at London's Cenotaph in honor of Remembrance Day, a British holiday dedicated to war heroes from the United Kingdom and its allies.</p>
      <p>This sighting comes shortly after Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, revealed their struggles with public life and Harry's relationship with his brother William.</p>
      <p>"We're brothers. We'll always be brothers. We're certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, and he will always be there for me," Harry said during his South African trip.</p>

      <p>Harry and William were seen entering The Cenotaph separately, with Harry and Meghan on Queen Elizabeth's left and William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seated directly to her right.</p>
      <p>Yet this is not unusual, as these events are often arranged by the seniority of the royals' positions.</p>
      <p>Remembrance Day ceremonies continued into Sunday.</p>
