      <p>Your clothes put up with a lot of abuse from daily wear. In fact, it's your favorite items that often suffer the most from fuzz build-up and pilling. Luckily, the<a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/the-fabric-shaver-i-trust-on-my-favorite-sweaters.html"> best fabric shavers</a> work wonders on your well-loved clothes and can have you looking your best in no time at all.</p>
      <p>When choosing the most effective fabric shaver for your garments, keep in mind that they generally come in two options: manual or electric. If you're unsure of which type you'll need, think about what kind of treatment your clothes require, and how delicate your items are.</p>
      <p>Manual shavers tend to be more gentle on fabrics and come in blade-less varieties that are extra gentle on delicate fabrics. Additionally, because they don't need batteries to operate, a manual shaver won't run out of juice no matter how often you use it. Electric fabric shavers, on the other hand, are typically faster and more efficient. They come in a wide range of speeds and blade sizes you can choose from, and if you have a little cushion in your budget, you can also pick a sweater shaver with additional features such as an extra long cord or a high-quality blade material.</p>
      <p>No matter which fabric shaver you choose, affordable or professional-quality, electric or manual, your clothes will really benefit from more regular attention and care. Here are of the<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/59-dope-things-on-amazon-prime-that-have-a-cult-following-7978567"> best fabric shavers</a> to freshen up your wardrobe.</p>

Along came this lil baby. Not only is my duvet cover basically brand new, but I have found a new hobby. I’m depilling everything. Sweatshirts, leggings, blankets, socks, anything that looks like it needs some love. It does the job quickly and leaves everything looking fresh."</p>
