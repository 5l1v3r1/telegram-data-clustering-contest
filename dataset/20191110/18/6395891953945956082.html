      <p><b>ROMEÂ (AP)</b> - A roadside blast wounded five Italian military members Sunday in northern Iraq as they returned from a mission aimed at helping Iraqi troops combat the Islamic State group, Italian military officials said.</p>
      <p>The Italian Defense Ministry said three of the wounded were in "grave condition" after the explosion.</p>
      <p>Rear Admiral Fabio Agostini said the five -- three members of the navy and two of the army -- are part of a special forces team that was traveling back after a mission aimed at finding IS refuges.</p>
      <p>Agostini told Italian Rai state TV that Iraqi armed forces members were also injured in the blast but didn't say how many.</p>
      <p>An Iraqi security official said the bomb exploded next to their vehicle as they were traveling just outside Kirkuk, wounding six Italian soldiers.</p>
      <p>The discrepancy in the number of wounded wasn't immediately explained.</p>
      <p>Italy's wounded were evacuated by U.S. military helicopters to hospital in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>One Italian soldier lost a leg to amputation due to injuries from the bomb and another suffered serious internal injuries, Italian Gen. Nicola Lanza de Cristoforis told state TV.</p>
      <p>Iraq declared victory against IS militants two years ago, but the group continues to stage insurgent-type attacks across the country, particularly in northern Iraq.</p>
      <p>Italy currently has more than 800 regular soldiers and some 80 special forces in Iraq.</p>
