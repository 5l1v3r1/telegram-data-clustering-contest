      <p>The midfielder was over the moon to have scored and explained how his finish had been influenced by advice from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> teammates on the training ground.</p>
      <p>He revealed: "(I'm) Very happy. We just needed to come here, we knew it was going to be a difficult game and I'm delighted we managed to get the result.</p>
      <p>"We needed to let the game settle down and by scoring that enabled us to get that and we needed just to go from there.</p>
      <p>"I was really pleased (with the goal) because the the boys have been saying I just side foot it so they have been telling me to put my foot through it and I managed to do that."</p>
