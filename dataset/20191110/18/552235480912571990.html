      <h1>Kris Boyd predicts whopping Alfredo Morelos Rangers transfer fee but urges striker to make key improvement</h1>
      <h2>The 23-year-old is on fire and Boyd insists his old team can name their price for the in-form Colombian.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:28:06+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:28</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Kris Boyd is certain <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> could be sold for a Scottish transfer record - but only next summer.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> striker insists the Colombian will go for a figure north of £20million but doesn't believe the Ibrox side can afford to sell him in January even if a mammoth offer comes in - echoing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> 's defiant stance.</p>
      <p>Boyd is certain Morelos' ability coupled with the astronomical Premier League fees is evidence a huge sum would be needed to secure his signature.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old hit his 22nd goal of the season at the Tony Macaroni Arena to help Rangers beat <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> 2-0.</p>

      <p>It wasn't his best performance in a blue shirt but he continued to display his battling qualities in a tireless display.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kris-boyd">Boyd</a> urged him to get better in one key area.</p>
      <p>He said: "When you see some of the transfers down the road, the numbers are crazy but for me, strikers are very hard to come by and especially ones who are scoring goals.</p>

      <p>"I've said it, Rangers can't accept anything for him in January. This season in terms of how he has improved - not only his goalscoring but his all round play - he's been excellent. I don't think it was particularly his best game for Rangers today but he was involved in everything going forward.</p>
      <p>"The only wee criticism I have of Alfredo Morelos is when he's in front of goal and has no time, his instincts are brilliant. See when he has time, he overthinks things.</p>
      <p>"Overall right now he's in the form of his life and to answer the question, it would be in the summer and it could be anything. Anything in terms of north of £20m because he can score goals and it is very difficult to get a striker who can do that right now in world football.</p>
      <p>"Strikers right now in world football are about asking problems, stretching the back four and playing one up front. He can do the lot. He's shown it in Europe. There's the criticism of him against Celtic as well but I know how hard it is to score against Celtic and when that comes, there will be more money added on."</p>
