      <p><b>BOWNE TOWNSHIP, Mich.Â (AP)</b> - Quick-thinking hunters in central Michigan have rescued two deer who literally became locked in battle.</p>
      <p>WOOD-TV reports that insurance agent Mark Johnson spotted the rutting bucks in a field with their antlers entangled. He figured the eight-point bucks would die from exhaustion or starvation if they stayed stuck.</p>
      <p>Video of Wednesday's rescue on WOOD-TV's website shows Johnson's friend, Brad Lyons, eventually deploying a specialized branch saw to cut part of an antler. That enabled the bucks to pull away and run off.</p>
      <p>The rescue came a week before firearms deer season. Johnson, Lyons and another acquaintance who showed up to help are all hunters and in other circumstances the bucks would have been prized trophies.</p>
      <p>What they got from the encounter instead was a good story to tell and a chunk of sawed-off antler.</p>
