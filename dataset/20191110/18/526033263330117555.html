      <p>Bernard J. Tyson, chairman and CEO of Kaiser Permanente, died in his sleep on Sunday, the company confirmed to ABC News in a statement. He was 60.</p>
      <p>"An outstanding leader, visionary and champion for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/quarter-us-healthcare-spending-waste-report/story?id=66371897">high-quality, affordable health care</a> for all Americans, Bernard was a tireless advocate for Kaiser Permanente, our members and the communities we serve. Most importantly, Bernard was a devoted husband, father and friend. We all will miss his tremendous presence in our lives," the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Gregory A. Adams, executive vice president and group president, was named interim chairman and CEO, effective immediately, the company said.</p>
      <p>Tyson was regarded as a trailblazer by many as one of the few African American CEOs of a massive U.S. company.</p>

      <p>Although not a Fortune 500 company because Kaiser Permanente is a not-for-profit organization, the company's operating revenue would place it at No. 42 on the Fortune 500, Fortune magazine <a href="https://fortune.com/2017/09/27/kaiser-permanente-ceo-health-tech/">reported in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>There are currently only four black CEOs at Fortune 500 companies, <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/elc-increase-number-black-ceos-nation-largest-public-companies/">Black Enterprise reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Tyson appeared on Time's list of the world's most influential people and other lists including Modern Healthcare's list of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-spends-health-care-countries-fare-study/story?id=53710650">influential people in the industry</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to his role at Kaiser Permanente, Tyson served on several corporate boards, including those for the American Heart Association and the tech firm Salesforce.</p>
