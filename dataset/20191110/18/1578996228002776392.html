      <p>Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart are definitely still together, and they posted the make-out photobooth shot to prove it. Reinhart posted some photobooth photos to Instagram showing her cuddling up with her boyfriend and <i>Riverdale</i> co-star writing, “The sequel.”</p>

      <p>After a rumored split this summer, the couple is very much back on and appears to be better than ever.</p>
      <p>“Cole and Lili are in a great place right now,” a source <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1082354/lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouse-show-pda-on-date-and-are-in-a-great-place">told E! News</a> last month. “The two of them are very happy together. They’re getting along so well both on and off the set. They’re often openly affectionate and loving with one another.”</p>
      <p>Sprouse and Reinhart took to Instagram to deny the rumors of a split, posting their joint <i>W</i> Magazine cover.</p>
      <p>“BREAKING: A reliable source has confirmed that none of you know shit,” Reinhart wrote.</p>
      <p>Sprouse echoed the sentiment writing, “UNPRECEDENTED: Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart consume the flesh of ‘reliable sources’ to fuel their bacchanalian sex cult.”</p>
      <p>Despite this, a source told E! News that the couple briefly split as filming picked back up on <i>Riverdale</i>.</p>
      <p>“Lili and Cole broke-up earlier this summer. The two are not living together this season,” a source shared this summer, adding that they were “intentionally keeping their distance from each other.”</p>
      <p>“Right now, it's unclear where things stand,” the insider added. “But it seems [like] they could be heading back in the direction of getting together.”</p>
      <p>Apparently that was very much correct.</p>
