      <h2>The Manchester City boss was incensed and took his frustrations out on Geoff Shreeves, demanding to know "Why wasn't [the penalty] given?"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:01:14+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola and his entire Manchester City backroom staff surrounded Geoff Shreeves demanding to know "Why wasn't [the penalty] given?" at half time against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>That's according to Sky Sports reporter Shreeves, who described Guardiola as "livid" at the decision that went against his side in the first half at Anfield.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> opened the scoring through Fabinho in just the sixth minute after hitting City on the break. But the goal came around 20 seconds after Trent Alexander-Arnold clearly handled the ball in his own area, prompting Man City players to appeal to the referee.</p>
      <p>VAR went back to the check on the incident, but the goal stood, much to the disbelief of the Man City team - and in particular Guardiola.</p>

      <p>The Premier League later explained that the ball touched Bernardo Silva's hand before Alexander-Arnold's, which is why play wasn't brought back and no penalty was awarded.</p>
      <p>But according to Shreeves, Guardiola wasn't happy about this and demanded to know why the spot-kick wasn't awarded at the half time break.</p>
      <p>"Pep Guardiola is livid," said Shreeves on Sky Sports. "His entire backroom staff surrounded us at half-time to ask 'Why wasn't it given?'. To say they are unimpressed is an understatement."</p>

      <p>Guardiola and City's day got worse from there as Liverpool piled on the misery.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah made it two seven minutes later before Sadio Mane netted a header after the break to make it three.</p>
