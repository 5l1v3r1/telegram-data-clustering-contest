        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The hiring of Gao is the first creative development of the new series since it was announced by Marvel’s Kevin Feige at Disney’s D23 Fan Expo.</p>
      <p>With numerous animation credits such as Nickelodeon’s <i>The Mighty B!</i> as well as her work on <i>Rick and Morty</i>, Gao is an accomplished writer who won an Emmy for her work on <i>Rick and Morty</i> episode ‘Pickle Rick’.</p>
      <p>She also wrote episodes of HBO’s <i>Silicon Valley</i> and wrote and executive produced a comedy pilot for ABC titled <i>Lazy Rich Asians,</i> which shot this year.</p>
      <p>She-Hulk was the last major character co-created by Stan Lee. Given her powers after receiving an emergency blood transfusion from her cousin, Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk, She-Hulk is attorney Jennifer Walters. Unlike Banner/Hulk, she was able to keep her intelligence and personality when she transitioned into her green alter-ego.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/rick-morty-season-4-confirmed-early-2020-release-2565066">the UK release date for season 4 of <i>Rick and Morty</i> has been confirmed.</a></p>
      <p>The new series will come to Channel 4 in the UK in January 2020, and it’ll be split into two parts containing five episodes each.</p>
