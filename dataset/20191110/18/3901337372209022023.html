      <p>Prior to Aubameyang's appointment in north London, the most recent African star to be named permanent captain of his club was Ivorian legend Kolo Toure, who wore the armband for Manchester City during the 2009/10 campaign.</p>
      <p>City were also previously captained by former Algeria international Ali Benarbia, who had played for the likes of AS Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain prior to his move to Manchester.</p>
