      <p>DHAKA: Cyclone Bulbul lashed Bangladesh overnight, killing six people and leaving relatives in a desperate search for 36 missing fishermen, though prompt evacuations saved many lives and the worst was over, officials said on Sunday (Nov 10). </p>
      <p>About 30 people were injured and around 6,000 homes were partially or fully damaged, authorities said.</p>

      <p>Five of the six victims were killed by falling trees, including a 52-year old woman who had spent the night in a shelter. </p>
      <p>She returned home on Sunday and was killed when a tree crashed on her house. Another victim, a 60-year old fisherman, had refused to evacuate.</p>
      <p>Two fishing boats have not yet returned and relatives have been unable to contact the men on board, said Anwar Uddin, a local public representative in the southern Bhola district.</p>
      <p>No major damage was immediately reported in camps in southeast Bangladesh where hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Myanmar are living.</p>
      <p>Around 2 million people from all of Bangladesh's 13 coastal districts huddled in about 5,558 shelters on Saturday night. Outside, wind speeds rose to between 100 and 120 kmh and some low-lying coastal areas were flooded.</p>
      <p>Wind speeds have now come down to between 70 and 80 kmh, authorities said.</p>
      <p>"It may take couple of days to get a normal situation," Enamur Rahman, junior minister for disaster management and relief, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>About 1,200 predominantly domestic tourists were stuck at the Saint Martin island in the Cox's Bazar district, Rahman said.</p>
      <p>"All of them will be rescued," he said.</p>
      <p>The cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal can last from April to December. In 1999, a super-cyclone battered the coast of India's Odisha state for 30 hours, killing 10,000 people.</p>
      <p>India's eastern states of West Bengal and Odisha have received heavy rainfall since early Saturday and there were reports of hundreds of trees being uprooted.</p>
