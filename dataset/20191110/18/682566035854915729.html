      <p>Cape Town -<b> Black Leopards</b> piled more misery on<b> Cape Town City </b>with a 2-1 victory at Thohoyandou Stadium in Thohoyandou on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With Benni McCarthy having been sacked as City boss on last Sunday night, the Citizens would have been looking to respond but despite being on the front foot for much of the encounter, they found themselves on the wrong end of the result.</p>
      <p>In the third minute, Cape Town City striker Kermit Erasmus had the first attempt on goal when he unleashed an effort towards goal but it was comfortably dealt with by Leopards goalminder Jonas Mendes in the end.</p>
      <p>Robert N'gambi opened the scoring for Leopards in the 18th minute with a beautifully taken long-range strike.</p>
      <p>Lidoda Duvha survived a scare in the 27th minute when Edmilson's deflected cross looked as if it might catch Mendes off guard but the goalkeeper sorted out his feet in time to make the save.</p>
      <p>City were pushing hard for an equaliser but the hosts were breaking on the counter-attack with one such break forcing City keeper Sage Stephens in to action.</p>
      <p>City brought Fagrie Lakay on for Siphelele Mthembu at the half-time break as City interim coach Vasili Manousakis looked for more attacking impetus up front.</p>
      <p>Bradley Ralani, who was guilty of missing several golden opportunities in City's last match, found his scoring boots in the 50th minute to equalise for the visitors with a stunning strike from 25 yards out.</p>
      <p>Absa Premiership top-scorer for 2018/2019 Mwape Musonda was looking a threat but wasn't getting enough service from his Leopards teammates. Meanwhile, Lakay was looking menacing with his pace for the Citizens.</p>
      <p>In the 70th minute, Lesedi Kapinga played the ball through for Musonda, who fired just wide of the target.</p>
      <p>The hosts restored their lead in the 84th minute when Musonda played the ball through for Lesedi Kapinga, who buried the ball past Stephens and in to the back of the net for a lead they would preserve until the final whistle.</p>
