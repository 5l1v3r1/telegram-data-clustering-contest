      <h2>Another teenager also critically injured in shooting minutes after separate explosion</h2>

      <p>A 15-year-old boy has been killed when a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gunman">gunmen</a> opened fire at a pizzeria minutes after an explosion in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/malmo">Malmo</a>.</p>
      <p>Another teenager is in a critical condition following the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/shooting">shooting</a> in a busy square in the southern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Sweden">Swedish</a> city.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported seeing the attackers fleeing on bicycles after the shooting took place at about 9pm on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Just moments earlier, a bomb placed under a car was detonated in another part of the city, destroying the vehicle and damaging others, although there were no reports of injuries.</p>
      <p>Police in Sweden said it could not yet say whether the two incidents were linked and did not identify suspects in either case.</p>
      <p>Jacob Bjorkander told Swedish newspaper <i>Sydsvenskan </i>that he had been cycling near the pizza restaurant with his two young children the night of the shooting.</p>

      <p>He said: “It’s regrettable, absolutely awful, and lacking in any respect.</p>
      <p>“This should be the end of it. It’s gone too far. People should be out on the streets showing what they think, that we don’t want this in our town.”</p>
      <p>Explosions and shootings in the past few years in Malmo, Sweden’s third-largest city, have been linked mainly to organised crime and feuding gangs.</p>
      <p>However, Swedish news agency TT said five fatal shootings and 29 explosions, including Saturday’s incidents, have taken place in Malmo this year - figures substantially lower than during all of 2018, according to police statistics.</p>
      <p>Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, chairwoman of the local municipality council, told Swedish broadcaster SVT she was concerned Saturday’s events would escalate the spiral of violence seen in past years in Malmo, a city of some 320,000 residents.</p>

      <p>She said: “It is every parent’s nightmare to lose a child. It’s been a heavy and black night in Malmo.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been in this situation before with similar events. This is what the police have warned about, namely an escalation of cruel and reckless violence in Malmo.”</p>
      <p>Ulf Kristersson, leader of the centre-right opposition Moderate Party, urged Social Democrat prime minister Stefan Lofven to act quickly to curb the violence.</p>
