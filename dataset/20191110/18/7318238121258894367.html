      <p>An original Second World War C-47 aircraft, also known as Dakota, dropped 750,000 poppies over the Battle of Britain memorial in Kent on Sunday as part of Remembrance Day services.</p>
      <p>In the UK, "remembrance poppies" traditionally commemorate the military personnel who died during the war.</p>
      <p>Nationwide ceremonies take place every year on the nearest Sunday to the anniversary of the end of World War I at 11 a.m. on Nov. 11, 1918.</p>
      <p>In London, thousands of military personnel, veterans and members of the public gathered in the streets around the Cenotaph to honour those killed in that war and subsequent conflicts.</p>
