      <p>Don Cherry is under fire for scolding immigrants who don’t wear poppies on national television.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/don-cherry-under-fire-for-scolding-immigrants-who-don-t-wear-poppies-1.4678623">85-year-old said on Saturday on his weekly Coach's Corner segment</a> as part of Hockey Night in Canada that he's less frequently seeing people wearing poppies anymore to honour fallen Canadian soldiers.</p>
      <p>He singled out those he believes are immigrants in Toronto, prompting a swift online backlash.</p>

      <p>"You people ... you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that," Cherry said.</p>
      <p>"These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."</p>
      <p>Many people outraged by the comments have called for Cherry to be fired, labelling him as a disgrace. </p>

      <p>"I refuse to accept your anti-immigrant rhetoric on the @hockeynight platform," Shireen Ahmed wrote. </p>
      <p>"It's time for Don Cherry to stop lecturing and start learning about the diverse and compassionate country we live in together," Toronto city councillor Josh Matlow wrote on Twitter. </p>
      <p>“We are deeply grateful to our Veterans and welcome new Canadians with support and respect."</p>

      <p>Mississauga mayor Bonnie Crombie also weighed in on Cherry's remarks, saying "new immigrants enrich our country."</p>
      <p>"For @CoachsCornerDC to say that 'you people' do not respect or our veterans is despicable. We’re proud of diverse cultural heritage and we‘ll always stand up for it," Crombie tweeted.  </p>
      <p>Some people are defending Cherry, saying his controversial comments were "right on the money".</p>
