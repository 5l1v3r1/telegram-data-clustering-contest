      <p>Former <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chief-election-commissioner">chief election commissioner </a>T N Seshan, who led the game-changing electoral reforms in the country in the 1990s, died here on Sunday following a cardiac arrest. He was 86.</p>
      <p>The legendary Seshan was not keeping good health for the past couple of years and he passed away at about 9.30pm, a senior police official told <i>PTI.</i></p>
      <p>Known for his no-nonsense attitude, he was largely confined to his home here for the past several years due to old age.</p>
      <p>Former CEC SY Quraishi said on Twitter,"Sad to announce that Shri TN Seshan passed away a short while ago. He was a true legend and a guiding force for all his successors. I pray for peace to his soul."</p>

      <p>Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said, "Sad that former <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chief-election-commissioner">Chief Election Commissioner </a>TN Seshan has passed away in Chennai. He was my father's classmate at Victoria College Palakkad â€” a courageous &amp; crusty boss who asserted the ElectionCommission's autonomy &amp; authority as no CEC before him had done.</p>
      <p>A pillar of our democracy."</p>
