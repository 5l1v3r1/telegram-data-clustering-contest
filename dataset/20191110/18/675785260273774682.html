      <p>A mum who spent £1,000 a month on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/takeaways">takeaways</a> and meals out has lost more than three stone in just 14 weeks and overcome her "horrific" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/back-pain">back pain</a> .</p>
      <p>Corrie D'Silva, 40, has shed an amazing four dress sizes after taking a standard against her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weight-loss-success-stories">weight</a> by ditching her expensive eating habits and nightly bottle of wine for healthy homemade meals and exercising with a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/personal-trainer">personal trainer</a> .</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two from Sandbach, Cheshire, started piling on weight in September 2016 after getting married and recovering from a severe back injury.</p>
      <p>She was on medication after back surgery to cut out disks that were bulging into her spine and doctors told her she would never be able to train at the gym again. At her heaviest, Corrie reached 13st 5lbs and began wearing a size 16.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>However, she has managed to lose more than three stone in just three months to weight 10st 2lbs and fit into a slender size eight after starting a mixture of strength and cardio training, which has also strengthened her back to help avoid further injuries.</p>
      <p>Corrie, who runs her own mortgage broking business with husband Nick, regularly indulged in food and drink at networkoing events, ordered pizza or Thai takeaway several times a week or ate ready meals because she didn't have time to cook.</p>
      <p>Corrie said: "Back then, I really lacked confidence and my back injury became an excuse not to exercise.</p>
      <p>"After surgery I suffered from horrific pain and doctors told me to take it easy, meaning I could no longer train and could only go swimming and do yoga.</p>
      <p>"It didn't just have a physical effect on me, it also had a mental effect because I didn't like myself.</p>
      <p>"The turning point for me was when we moved house in May 2019. I realised I was so busy with the children and my business that I had picked up bad habits.</p>
      <p>"I was doing damage to myself by snacking on crisps and sausage rolls and drinking a full bottle of wine to myself every night, and felt exhausted when I should have been enjoying my new house.</p>
      <p>"My husband Nick and I liked to socialise a lot and we would probably spend the best part of £1,000 a month just on eating out and drinking, along with buying takeaways.</p>

      <p>   </p>
      <p>"At networking events I would have a three course meal at an Italian or steak restaurant, and we'd buy Dominoes or Thai takeaways a couple of times a week. On top of that I would drink wine and gin when out socialising.</p>
      <p>"I had the realisation that my back would end up in worse pain if I carried on and I wanted to make positive changes for my health and children."</p>
      <p>Despite being told by doctors not to train, Corrie got a personal trainer and began to eat healthier in May 2019.</p>
      <p>Her initial weight loss goal was two stone, but she massively surpassed that by training twice a week, doing strength workouts including shoulder presses and sled drags.</p>
      <p>Corrie ditched the takeaways and ready meals in favour of healthier options such as vegetable soup for lunch and salmon for dinner - and even gave up drinking for the 14 week programme.</p>
      <p>Although she still attended networking events for her job, she usually ate beforehand and refrained from drinking.</p>
      <p>Corrie said: "At first I was really worried about training because of my back issues, but I gave it a go with my personal trainer and the initial results were phenomenal. I regained confidence and had lots of support.</p>
      <p>"My personal trainer took my back injury into consideration and I underwent physio at the same time. Now my back is a lot stronger.</p>
      <p>"My physiotherapist can see the impact my weight loss and training has had when looking at my back, and can tell it's not under as much strain anymore.</p>

        <figcaption>She says her weight loss journey has been a life changing experience (Image: contributed)</figcaption>

      <p>"After surgery I had to lie down for two weeks straight and I was disappointed when doctors told me I wouldn't be able to train, because that meant I wouldn't be able to get back to the weight that I was before.</p>
      <p>"At the end of my transformation, I felt like the person I always wanted to be. It was amazing to get myself back and I felt mentally better too.</p>
      <p>"It's been a life changing experience for me and I felt like my personal trainer wrapped me up in cotton wool for three months and genuinely cared about my progress.</p>
      <p>"My fitness venture has rubbed off on my children and husband too - it feels great to be able to get out more and be active with them. and it's given me a different lease of life.</p>
      <p>"I now see pictures from when I was heavy and miserable and I feel embarassed - having come from a place in hospital after the surgery I thought 'this isn't who I want to be, there's more out there for me'.</p>
      <p>"My message to others is that if you have an injury and want to lose weight, training and exercise is so beneficial for your mental and physical health, and you've just got to want it and make that change."</p>
      <p>Corrie is still on her weight loss journey, and is currently enjoying a maintenance programme at the gym to keep herself on track.</p>
