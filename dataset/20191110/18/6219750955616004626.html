      <p>These days becoming an entrepreneur is a popular idea, yet what does it mean to “be an entrepreneur?” Do you have to be the founder of a startup? Work for a special unit inside a company? Go to work for a unicorn? In other words, what does it really take to become an entrepreneur?</p>
      <p>If you are a start-up trying to get traction or an established company trying to launch new products and services, what you are trying to do is grow. With top-line growth as the objective, you are—implicitly or explicitly—doing something new to create value for customers and this requires thinking and behaving like an entrepreneur.</p>
