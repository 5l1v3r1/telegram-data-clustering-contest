      <p>Five candidates, including two former prime ministers under deposed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, have been selected to run in Algeria's December presidential poll, the country's constitutional council confirmed Saturday.<br/><br/>Twenty-three candidates had registered for the election which comes as Algeria has been mired in months of street protests demanding an overhaul of the entire political system.<br/><br/>Kamel Feniche -- head of the constitutional council, which validates candidates for the election -- said Saturday that only five of those candidates have been selected to run in the December 12 polls, confirming a decision announced by the elections authority a week ago.<br/><br/>Protesters are opposed to any Bouteflika-era figures taking part in the election, fearing the elite will use the poll to choose his successor.<br/><br/>Among the five cleared to run, Bouteflika era prime ministers Ali Benflis and Abdelmadjid Tebboune are considered the front-runners.<br/><br/>Benflis, 75, served as a premier under Bouteflika from 2000 to 2003 and ran as his main opponent in the 2004 and 2014 elections.<br/><br/>Tebboune, 73, was a senior civil servant and served as Bouteflika's communications minister when he came to power in 1999.<br/><br/>Among the other candidates is Azzedine Mihoubi, leader of the Democratic National Rally party (RND) which was the main ally of the former president's party.<br/><br/>Islamist former tourism minister Abdelkader Bengrina, whose party backed Bouteflika, and Abdelaziz Belaid who belongs to a youth organization that supported the former president, are also in the race.<br/><br/>The election to find a successor to Bouteflika -- who was forced to resign in April under pressure from the protest movement -- was originally planned for July.<br/><br/>But the date was postponed due to a lack of viable candidates.</p>
