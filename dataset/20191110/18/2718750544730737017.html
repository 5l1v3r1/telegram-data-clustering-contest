      <p>Forky himself, also known as the one and only Tony Hale, came by this year’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/vulture-festival-2019-highlights.html">Vulture Festival</a> to tell us all about the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/toy-story-4-the-inside-story-of-forky.html">world’s favorite trash toy</a>. But before the big event, he stopped by our video studio to talk to comedian Jamie Loftus about how Forky finally reached his full potential later in life. It turns out there’s exactly <i>one</i> grown-up job that’s perfect for a fork with big wiggly arms. He also shared what it was like to make the leap from <i>Veep</i> to voice acting, and he was even gracious enough to help Jamie’s dad learn who just any celebrities are at all. Seriously. He knows none.</p>
