      <p>As of 11 p.m. Sunday, Nakri's center is right above the shores between Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa provinces, with a maximum wind speed of 60 kph, said the National Center for Hydro - Meteorological Forecasting.</p>
      <p>It then moved west at 10-15 kph, and is expected to be above the Central Highlands Monday morning. Nakri would cause heavy rain in localities from Thua Thien-Hue to Binh Thuan provinces and the Central Highlands, the center added.</p>
      <p>In Phu Yen, Nakri has fell several trees in its Tuy Hoa Town. About 59,700 families in the town experienced blackouts. Authorities are on standby for the night, said Vo Ngoc Kha, chairman of the Tuy Hoa People’s Committee.</p>
      <p>In Khanh Hoa's Van Ninh District, rough seas were observed as Nakri approaches, producing waves 5-6 meters in height. Two people, Bui Van Het, 41, and Tran Huu Son, 33, were rescued by district authorities after they were trapped in their vessels in Van Phong Port Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain and strong winds have also caused blackouts among 540 families in Ninh Tan Commune of Ninh Hoa Town. Power is expected to be restored Monday morning, said authorities.</p>
      <p>In Nha Trang Town, no human casualties were reported, though blackouts occurred, said Deputy Chairman of the Khanh Hoa People’s Committee Nguyen Dac Tai.</p>
      <p>Central Vietnam, home to popular tourist destinations like Nha Trang and Quy Nhon, was hit by storm Matmo last month. It felled hundreds of trees, damaged many houses and caused widespread flooding in Phu Yen, Binh Dinh and Quang Ngai provinces.</p>
      <p>Vietnam is hit by up to 10 tropical storms during the southwest monsoon between July and October. There were nine last year.</p>
