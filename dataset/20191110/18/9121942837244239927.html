      <p>HONG KONG (AP) — Police in Hong Kong shot a protester as demonstrators blocked subway lines and roads during the Monday morning commute.</p>
      <p>Online video showed a police officer collaring one protester and then shooting another who approaches in a video posted on Facebook by video outlet Cupid Producer.</p>
      <p>The officer fired again as a third protester approached.</p>
      <p>Police said that only one protester was hit and is undergoing surgery.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred in a crosswalk at a large intersection strewn with debris that had backed-up traffic.</p>
      <p>Protesters blocked intersections around the city. Public broadcaster RTHK said that a fire was set inside a train at Kwai Fong station and service suspended at several stations.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, police fired tear gas and protesters broke windows at a shopping mall in anti-government demonstrations across Hong Kong amid anger over a student activist’s death and the arrest of pro-democracy lawmakers.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong is in the sixth month of protests that began over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability. Activists say Hong Kong’s autonomy and Western-style civil liberties, promised when the former British colony was returned to China in 1997, are eroding.</p>
      <p>The territory is preparing for Nov. 24 district council elections that are viewed as a measure of public sentiment toward the government.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy lawmakers accuse the government of trying to provoke violence to justify canceling or postponing the elections.</p>
