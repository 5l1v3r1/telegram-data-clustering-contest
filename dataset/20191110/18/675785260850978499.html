      <h1>Pep Guardiola refuses to discuss handball in build-up to Liverpool opener against Man City</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola was furious at the failure to award his side a penalty before Liverpool broke and opened the scoring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T18:52:30+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola confronted referee Michael Oliver at the final whistle after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> were denied key decisions after more VAR controversy.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said to the referee “thank you very much” after the highly-charged title clash but insisted he was not being sarcastic about the officials.</p>
      <p>City boss Guardiola angrily remonstrated with fourth official Mike Dean on the touchline waving two fingers in the air as he clearly believed his side were denied two big penalty appeals.</p>
      <p>But Guardiola refused to condemn the officials after the game and also warned his players to stay off social media to complain about two separate handball appeals against Trent Alexander-Arnold, the first of which came just 22 seconds before <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>’s first goal.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said: “No, it was not sarcastic. It was thank you so much. I said the same thing after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> game. ‘Thank you so much.’ Most of the time, I go over to the referees and my colleagues and I say good luck all the time.</p>

      <p>“Mike Riley, his people, you have to ask them. Talk about the game, ask them. I’m here to talk about the game. Every time I’m being asked why one day it’s handball, the next day it’s not. Don’t ask me. Ask to them.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t have regrets, if the players know I’m not happy then I tell them but I told them at half time and full time: ‘Heads up guys, don’t use social media to give your thoughts about what happened in some departments. Talk about football and how good it was.’”</p>
      <p>But Guardiola insisted that the title race is not over even though City are now nine points behind leaders Liverpool and was full of praise for his team’s display.</p>
      <p>He added: “I think we showed in the most difficult stadium in the world right now, the reason why we are champions. One of the most proud performances I ever leave with in my career.</p>

      <p>“We have three teams in front of us, maybe they have more chance to win the Premier League than us but hopefully we can sustain this mentality and try it. In the end, if it’s not enough, we will congratulate, Liverpool, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> or <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and move forward for the next season.</p>
      <p>“Nine points is a lot, they lost just one game last season, 12 games, 11 victories and one draw but nine points is not easy and yet it’s November. Is it their year? My colleague Jurgen (Klopp) can explain better than me.”</p>

      <p>City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan added: “I saw the incident again in the dressing room afterwards and for me, obviously, it’s a penalty - but if you ask a Liverpool player they would say ‘You can give it but it’s maybe a 50-50 stuation.’</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s easy to judge and I’m not here to make a statement on that, but there were a few situations where I thought maybe we could have had a decision for us. It didn’t happen and there’s nothing you can do.”</p>
