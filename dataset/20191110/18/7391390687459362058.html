      <p>One month after she announced their separation, <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-attends-travis-scott-astroworld-festival/">Kylie Jenner attended Travis Scott's Astroworld</a> music festival, and it was reportedly a family event. "Kylie flew to Houston with a group of friends. She returns to LA this morning," a source told <i>People </i>on Sunday. "It was important for her to support Travis' festival. They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi."</p>
      <p>As portrayed in his Netflix documentary, <i><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10856726/">Look Mom I Can Fly</a></i>, Stormi frequents his concerts and has attended the festival before with Jenner. The one-year-old's mom <a href="https://twitter.com/KylieJenner/status/1179770902625415171?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1179770902625415171&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Ftv%2Fkylie-jenner-breaks-silence-travis-scott-split%2F">announced her split from the rapper</a> via Twitter on Oct. 3. "Travis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi," she wrote. "Our friendship and our daughter is priority."</p>
      <p>So, it looks like Jenner and Stormi flew out to support their family and nothing more, except to maybe dance and have some fun. According to <i>The Houston Chronicle</i>, <a href="https://www.chron.com/entertainment/music/article/Video-Kylie-Jenner-is-front-row-for-Spanish-14823662.php">Jenner danced in the front row </a>during Spanish singer Rosalía's performance (surrounded by security guards) and the singer even dedicated a song to her.</p>

      <p>Later, Jenner's brother-in-law Kanye West made an appearance, per <i>People</i>, and performed "Can't Tell Me Nothing" and "Follow God," a song from his latest album <i>Jesus is King</i>.</p>
      <p>On the day their breakup was announced, a source told <i>People</i> that <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-breaks-silence-travis-scott-split/">"there is absolutely hope"</a> that Jenner and Scott will make amends. And Jenner's actions echo that. On Saturday, Scott received a custom, giant flower arrangement that spelled out "ASTROWORLD" and social media immediately erupted in speculation that it was Jenner's doing.</p>
      <p>He shared a picture of it on his Instagram Story. “Love u that I really do,” he wrote over the top. He paired it with a red heart and a butterfly emoji — the latter is known as an unofficial symbol of their relationship. They have <a href="https://people.com/style/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-matching-tattoos/">matching butterfly tattoos</a> on their ankles, and according to <i>People</i>, Scott has gifted her with butterfly-themed jewelry in the past.</p>
      <p><a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-flirt-hang-out-not-in-relationship-source/">Rumors of a Jenner-Drake fling</a> have recently circulated, however, according to <i>People</i>, the two are just friends. "She has been hanging out with Drake. Mostly together with other friends as well," a source told <i>People</i>. "She has known Drake for a while. They are not in a relationship. It mostly seems like they have chemistry, flirt and hang out. Nothing too complicated."</p>
      <p>Still, she plans on continuing <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-happy-travis-scott-around/">to spend time with Scott</a> as the holidays approach. "He still might need knee surgery in L.A. and then he will recover at Kylie’s too," another source told <i>People</i>. “And as special holidays are coming up, they will continue to spend a lot of time together. They both seem great together."</p>
