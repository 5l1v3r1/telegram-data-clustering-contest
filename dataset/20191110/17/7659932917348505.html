      <p>The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, said Sunday about 500 or 600 US troops will remain in Syria to counter ISIS militants.<br/><br/>President Donald Trump recently approved an expanded military mission to secure oil fields across eastern Syria. His decision locked hundreds of US troops into a more complicated presence in Syria despite his pledge to bring them home.<br/><br/>Milley told ABC's "This Week" that pressure must be maintained on ISIS militants still in the region.<br/><br/>"There are still ISIS fighters in the region. And unless pressure is maintained, unless attention is maintained on that group, then there is a very real possibility that conditions could be set for a reemergence of ISIS," he said in his first interview since taking his role as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<br/><br/>"If I do my math and I look at the new troops going in and those going out, it could be more than 700 who remain," said "This Week" co-anchor Martha Raddatz.<br/><br/>Milley responded: "Well, there'll be less than a thousand for sure, and probably in the 500-ish frame, maybe six. But it's in, that it's in, that area. But we're not gonna go into specific numbers because we're still going through the analysis right now."<br/><br/>It's unclear whether Milley's prediction of keeping 500 to 600 American troops there includes the roughly 200 who are at the al-Tanf garrison in southern Syria.</p>
