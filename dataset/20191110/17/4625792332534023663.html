      <h1>Swalwell claims House Democrats have ‘evidence of an extortion scheme’ by Trump over Ukraine</h1>

      <p>House Democrats have seen “evidence of an extortion scheme” throughout their impeachment investigation, according to California Rep. Eric Swalwell.</p>
      <p>During a Sunday interview on CBS's <i>Face the Nation</i>, Swalwell claimed President Trump’s request of Ukrainian leaders to investigate Joe Biden was tantamount to extortion.</p>
      <p>“It’s important that the president has due process. And evidence is not a conclusion. We have evidence from the depositions we’ve done to warrant bringing [impeachment] forward.” Swalwell said. “Evidence of an extortion scheme using taxpayer dollars to ask a foreign government to investigate the president’s opponent.”</p>
      <p>The president has denied any wrongdoing, calling the call "perfect" and urging Americans to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">read the transcript</a> and decide for themselves.</p>
      <p>Swalwell noted that he wants Republicans to be able to suggest witnesses so both parties feel as though the president was treated fairly throughout the impeachment process.</p>
      <p>“It is important that the Republicans be afforded the opportunity to suggest witnesses we should call, and we determine whether that is relevant,” Swalwell said. “The facts are just as important as the process behind the facts, as far as what, if anything, goes over to the Senate.”</p>
      <p>Swalwell explained that he believes the witnesses who have testified have been “fairly consistent” with their claims against the president. He later added that he wants Republicans to be able to call witnesses but doesn’t “see any relevancy” in bringing forward Biden or his son, as <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/republicans-seek-public-testimony-of-hunter-biden-and-anonymous-whistleblower-at-impeachment-hearings">some Republicans have suggested</a>.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to revisit conspiracy theories,” Swalwell stated. “If people have relevant information to this investigation and the president’s conduct, of course, we want to hear from them.”</p>

      <p>Swalwell, 38, had a brief presidential run that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/eric-swalwell-becomes-first-2020-hopeful-to-drop-out">ended earlier this year</a> when he decided to run for reelection for his House seat. He serves on the House Intelligence Committee under Chairman Adam Schiff.</p>
      <p>House Democrat Jackie Speier echoed his claim to have seen extortion evidence, telling ABC's <i>This Week</i>, "This is a very strong case of bribery."</p>
