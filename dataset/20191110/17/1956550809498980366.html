      <p>The RTA has announced a major plan to massively upgrade three of the main Dubai Metro Red Line stations in New Dubai.</p>
      <p>Work on upgrades to three stations running through the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/dubai-marina">Dubai Marina</a> end of the city will begin imminently, and the RTA’s director-general and chairman Mattar Al Tayer, said that it’s part of a five-year plan to improve metro and marine transport stations across <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/travel">Dubai</a>, making it a lot easier to get out and about and check out all the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">things to do in Dubai</a> year-round.</p>
      <p>Improvement work will begin first at Dubai Internet City, DAMAC Metro Station and the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/dubai-marina">Dubai Marina</a> tram station, which is intended to handle the growing number of users making the most of the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/412296-using-public-transport-in-dubai">public transport</a> network across Dubai during peak commuting hours.</p>
      <p>Dubai Internet City will get a new entrance, so too will UAE Exchange station at the end of the Red Line.</p>
      <p>“The plan will kick off by improving Dubai Internet City, DAMAC Properties and UAE Exchange. It also encompasses improving the infrastructure around five other stations – Al Rashidiya, GGICO, Al Qiyada, Noor Bank and Financial Centre Station - and two marine transport stations - Dubai Water Canal, Sheikh Zayed Road," said Al Tayer.</p>
      <p>The RTA has also said that 40 stations and stops will be improved over the course of the next five years, with 2025 the goal for the completion of all metro station improvements.<br/><br/>For more on public transport in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/412296-using-public-transport-in-dubai">Dubai click here.</a><br/><i>For more information, visit <a href="http://www.rta.ae/">www.rta.ae</a>.</i></p>
