      <p>TEHRAN: Iran has discovered a new oil field containing 53 billion barrels of crude, President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday (Nov 10), a find that would increase Iran's proven reserves by over a third.</p>
      <p>The field covers 2,400 sq km and is located in Iran's southwestern province of Khuzestan, Rouhani said in a speech aired on state TV.</p>

      <p>"This is a small gift by the government to the people of Iran," he said.</p>
      <p>The 80m deep field stretches nearly 200km from Khuzestan's border with Iraq to the city of Omidiyeh, Rouhani added.</p>
      <p>The find would add around 34 per cent to the OPEC member's current proven reserves, estimated by energy giant BP at 155.6 billion barrels of crude oil.</p>
      <p>Iran is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and sits on what were already the world's fourth-biggest oil reserves and second-largest gas reserves.</p>
      <p>But it has struggled to sell its oil since US President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran.</p>
      <p>The remaining parties to the accord - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - have worked to save it by avoiding US sanctions, but their efforts have so far borne little fruit.</p>
