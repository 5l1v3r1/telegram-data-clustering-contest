      <h1>High drama at Sandy Park as Bristol pull off remarkable fight back</h1>

      <p>Bristol completed a remarkable recovery by scoring a last-minute try through Dan Thomas to beat Exeter 20-17 and move top of the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>The visitors had trailed 17-0 at the break but rallied to stun the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> at Sandy Park and make it three wins from four at the start of the season.</p>
      <p>With time up, Bristol won a penalty which <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/callum-sheedy/">Callum Sheedy</a> kicked to the corner and from there the Bears forwards built up a head of steam to crash over the line.</p>
      <p>The countless replays appeared inconclusive but the try was awarded and, after Sheedy slotted over the conversion, Bristol were able to celebrate a superb comeback victory which sends them top.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sam Simmonds and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/nic-white/">Nic White</a> scored Exeter’s first-half tries with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/joe-simmonds/">Joe Simmonds</a> converting both and adding a penalty.</p>
      <p>Piers O’Conor was Bristol’s other tryscorer with Sheedy finishing with two penalties and two conversions as the visitors scored 20 unanswered points after the interval.</p>
      <p>The opening 15 minutes were a poor advertisement for Premiership Rugby as both sides struggled to bring any continuity to their game.</p>

      <p>Basic handling errors abounded with possession being swapped from side to side, which belied the excellent playing conditions.</p>
      <p>Eventually Chiefs managed to string a few passes together and took the lead through a 14th-minute try from Sam Simmonds.</p>

      <p>Henry Slade, on his first game back from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> World Cup duties, skilfully evaded a couple of defenders and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-simmonds/">Sam Simmonds</a> was on hand to drive over from close range for a try that his brother Joe converted.</p>
      <p>That breakthrough was the catalyst that Exeter needed as they became increasingly dominant and, following some accurate handling, they picked up a second try.</p>
      <p>A splendid off-load from Slade created space for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/stuart-hogg/">Stuart Hogg</a> before the full-back sent Tom O’Flaherty racing down the right flank. When the wing was hauled down, White saw a gap to dart over.</p>

      <p>Joe Simmonds converted again before adding a simple penalty for Exeter to lead 17-0 at the interval.</p>
      <p>At that stage, it looked an uphill task for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> to reverse their fortunes as apart from a couple of lively runs from wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/luke-morahan/">Luke Morahan</a>, they hardly struck a blow in a one-sided first half.</p>
      <p>Four minutes after the restart, they received some encouragement when Sheedy kicked a wide-angled penalty but normal service was immediately resumed as Chiefs pinned their opponents in their own 22.</p>
      <p>The hosts appeared to have extended their lead when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/alex-cuthbert/">Alex Cuthbert</a> forced his way over only for the TMO replays to show the wing had put a foot in touch just before grounding the ball.</p>

      <p>England squad members <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/luke-cowan-dickie/">Luke Cowan-Dickie</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/jack-nowell/">Jack Nowell</a> were brought on as Exeter sought to increase their firepower, but it was Bristol who scored next when Sheedy kicked his second penalty after Hogg was penalised for not releasing.</p>
      <p>Sheedy’s penalties were the only scores of a dull third quarter as the game continued to struggle for entertainment but, with 17 minutes remaining, White was yellow carded for a deliberate knock-on and Bristol took full advantage when Morahan’s speed created a try for O’Conor.</p>
      <p>Sheedy’s conversion brought Bristol to within four points before the late drama saw replacement flanker Thomas touch down to earn the visitors a scarcely believable victory.</p>
