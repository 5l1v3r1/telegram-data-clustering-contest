      </p>
      <p>The Brazilians made five changes from their goalless draw with Baroka in midweek, after bringing on the likes of Rivaldo Coetzee, Sphelele Mkhulise and Lyle Lakay to refresh the team, while Arrows made only one change, with Lindokuhle Mtshali coming to the fray.</p>
      <p>With the rain pouring from the start of the match, the sides were going at each other with pace but it was Sundowns that got a clear chance in the tenth minute to open the scoring after Thapelo Morena went through on the right side but his low shot was saved by goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda.</p>
      <p>Steve Komphela's army nearly broke the deadlock with 14 minutes remaining of the first stanza after Knox Mutizwa went clear through on goal, but his low strike missed the bottom corner by inches.</p>
      <p>However, Masandawana eventually broke the deadlock with five minutes remaining of the first stanza after Morena turned home Tebogo Langerman's low cross at the near post.</p>
      <p>Steve Komphela's troops had the upper hand early in the second stanza and they finally equalised around the hour-mark after goalkeeper Denis Onyango spilled a long range strike from Danny Phiri into the back of the net.]</p>
      <p>Arrows continued to put Mosimane's troops under pressure, which resulted in the second goal with 17 minutes remaining thanks to Mutizwa, who slotted a low shot into the bottom corner following a superb cross from Devine Lunga.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians were falling apart in the last ten minutes after Abafana Bes'thende were awarded a penalty for Motjeka Madisha's tackle on Seth Parusnath in the box. Mutizwa stepped up and fired a powerful strike past Onyango from the spot-kick to make it 3-1.</p>
      <p>Andle Jali reduced the deficit with three minutes remaining after unleashing a first-time strike at the near post past Sibanda from Mosa Lebusa's clever back-heel.</p>
      <p>Trevor Mathiane was the hero for Arrows after putting in a superb last-ditch tackle to deny Lyle Lakay the equaliser in second-half stoppage time as the hosts held on for the win.</p>
