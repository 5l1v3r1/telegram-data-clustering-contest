      <h1>Steven Gerrard tells Gary Holt to 'check his facts' as Rangers boss continues war of words</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox boss was delighted with his team's performance in West Lothian but had a message for his opposite number.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:42:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard is adamant <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a> misunderstood his comments asking for refereeing protection in the lead up to their 2-0 win over Livingston.</p>
      <p>The Livingston boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gary-holts-blast-rangers-boss-20852496">slammed Gerrard</a> in our sister title <i><b>The Sunday Mail</b> </i>for the remarks, accusing him of "naivety".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Gers</a> gaffer insists there was nothing disrespectful to Holt's side in his suggestion and that his opponent needs to revisit what was actually said.</p>
      <p>Rangers were comfortable throughout the game and should have won by more than the winning margin of two after a strong performance</p>
      <p>And Gerrard was keen to stress that he was attempting to make a wider point about the way head injuries are treated in our game.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sky, he said: "I don't think any of my players will be aware of the comments. I think Gary needs to check what I said.</p>
      <p>"I didn't say it was an elbow, I said it was a forearm and that he led with the arm.</p>

      <p>"I also defended (Ricki) Lamie and said he wasn't a dirty player, so he needs to check his facts before he replies.</p>
      <p>"All I said was that we had quite a few head injuries and had the physio on a lot. I asked for protection for my players and his players and eveyone else in the league for that matter so that's all I said.</p>
      <p>"If he has a problem with that, fine, no problem but that's all I said."</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the game itself, Gerrard was delighted with a diligent performance on a tough pitch.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was a really strong performance. We have come here and competed very well. At the right times we have shown really good quality.</p>
      <p>"The first goal, with Scott's pass and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/joe-aribo">Aribo</a> 's finish, the two of them have come into the team today so very pleased for them both.</p>
      <p>"Buff's was very good. He showed great strength and he's dug one out into the corner. It's an excellent finish.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were dominant throughout and I'm really pleased."</p>

      <p>While Gerrard was satisfied with the team performance he also singled out goalscorers <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> and Joe Aribo for special praise.</p>
      <p>"He deserves all the credit he gets. He's a superb centre forward. This season he's come back and really focused on his football.</p>
      <p>"We have seen that week in, week out and if we provide service for him he will keep getting goals.</p>
      <p>"It's important that we keep talking about him for the right reasons and we have been so far this season."</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>"He was on the end of a nasty injury last time but he's recovered well. I spoke to him yesterday about coming here and playing. He's been training ever so well, he's fresh today coming in and he showed that in his performance. I thought he was outstanding."</p>
      <p>Ryan Kent limped off in the second half with an injury but the manager allayed fears that it could be a serious issue.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's a bad dead leg and one that he's tried to run off but it was just getting stiffer and stiffer.</p>
      <p>"You could see he wasn't running properly so with good substitutes we changed it."</p>
