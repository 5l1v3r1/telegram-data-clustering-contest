      <p>Manchester City will be out to end Liverpool's unbeaten in the Premier League when the two sides clash in an eagerly awaited clash at Anfield - Here's how they line up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Liverpool v Manchester City</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 10 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Anfield</p>
      <p>The match is set to get underway at 18h30.</p>
      <p>The Citizens have already lost twice this season and they can’t afford to drop further points especially against their rivals after coming from behind to beat Southampton 2-1 last weekend.</p>
      <p>City come six points adrift of the Reds and their concern will be the unavailability of goalkeeper Ederson, who was ruled out with a thigh injury, as his replacement Claudio Bravo will be making his first Premier League start in 18 months.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool are yet to lose a league match so far this season, with their 1-1 draw Manchester United towards the end of October being the only blemish.</p>
      <p>The Reds will be without defender Joel Matip who has not recovered from a knee injury, although Dejan Lovren will line-up alongside Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s only league defeat last season came at the hands of Man City at the Etihad Stadium, after the sides played to a goalless draw in the first round clash in October 2018 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Citizen don't have the best of records at Anfield, having lost tasted victory in Merseyside back in 2005.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Liverpool: </b>Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Henderson; Mané, Salah, Firmino.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester City: </b>Bravo; Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Angeliño; Rodri, Gundogan, De Bruyne; Bernardo, Sterling, Agüero.</p>
