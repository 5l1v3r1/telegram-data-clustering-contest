      <h1>Fans fume as VAR fails to spot Trent Alexander-Arnold handball before Liverpool goal</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool broke seconds after the handball with Fabinho finding the back of the net with a stunning effort at Anfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:05:35+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>VAR was once again a controversial talking point, this time in Liverpool's Premier League title crunch match with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold clearly handled the ball in his own area early on in the first half at Anfield, prompting protests from the Citizens' players, including boss Pep Guardiola on the touchline.</p>
      <p>But the appeals were ignored, and in the melee, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> went on the attack and hit the back of the net through Fabinho.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian running onto a loose ball on the edge of the area to thunder a shot past Claudio Bravo, who is filling in for the injured Ederson.</p>

      <p>VAR took a look at the incident following the goal, and there were suggestions play could be brought back and City awarded a penalty.</p>
      <p>But after the check, the game resumed with the Liverpool goal standing and City restarting from the centre cirle.</p>

      <p>Reacting to yet another confusing passage in play, caused by VAR, one Man City fan tweeted: "How is this not handball? I demand an explanation. We've been robbed. VAR is a joke."</p>
      <p>Another added: "VAR is an absolute joke. Should have been a pen before the first goal and the second goal was arguably offside."</p>
