      </p>
      <p>Goalmouth scrambles are brilliant. Brilliant like a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2016/sep/10/brilliant-the-fast-show-archive-in-pictures"> Paul Whitehouse Fast Show sketch</a>, all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rzCGEOcbrw&amp;list=PL8F41E21F64EAA86A">hyperactive and confused </a>and overwhelmed by infectious energy.</p>
      <p>They’re <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/20/the-joy-of-six-football-goalmouth-scrambles">not brilliant in a pure footballing sense</a>, that much is self-evident. They are not a celebration of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/worldcup2006blog/2006/jun/15/brazilarentinterestedinpla">jogo bonito</a> or a reflection of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/29/barcelona-gospel-of-guardiola">totaalvoetbal</a>, but in an era where our understanding of how the game should be played is approaching orthodoxy there is a visceral brilliance to these infrequent moments of mob rule. All the tactical ephemera that makes modern football so sophisticated can’t deny the physics of a ball in motion being chased by a pack of single-minded athletes in an arbitrarily enclosed space. Sporadic anarchy in an increasingly ordered universe. Football’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/jan/08/rick-wakeman-interview-prog-rock-punk">punk gatecrashing a prog solo</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the A-League season began, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/08/a-league-2019-20-season-preview-team-by-team-guide">Perth Glory were among the favourites</a> to compete for silverware. They evolved into a winning machine last season under Tony Popovic and despite some significant departures from the premiership-winning squad the replacements appeared more than capable of filling the breach. So far it isn’t going according to plan.</p>
      <p>Defensively, the absence of Shane Lowry and Matt Spiranovic has made Glory’s spine less rigid, prompting Popovic to jettison his preferred three-man defence in favour of a flat back four. Further forward, ball movement is not so slick. In transition there isn’t the focal point Andy Keogh used to provide, nor the sympatico of movement he shared with Chris Ikonomidis and Joel Chianese that would stretch defences and create undefendable space. In more considered build-up play there is plenty of circulation from side to side, but a lack of finesse when the ball is delivered forward - a problem commonplace in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/a-league">A-League</a>.</p>
      <p>After 85-and-a-half minutes against Newcastle Jets on Saturday, Glory’s indifferent start to the season was threatening to become a mini-crisis. One-nil down, and with star signing Bruno Fornaroli substituted for a 16-year-old, inspiration was in short supply. Then, with play unfolding innocuously in Newcastle’s half, Juande spotted an intelligent overlapping run from right-back Ivan Franjic and dinked the ball in his direction. It precipitated a game-changing, possibly season-defining scramble.</p>
      <p>A weary Johnny Koutroumbis could have shut the party down before it started but he failed to make the clearing header. However, he did enough to prevent Franjic collecting the ball in his stride, forcing an awkward extra touch. That was all the invitation Nikolai Topor-Stanley required to leave his man and hurl his Dothraki-like frame between Franjic and the ball. It was on.</p>
      <p>A good scramble needs a critical mass of bodies. Too few and it’s merely a showcase for ineptitude, too many and the sought-after pinball effect descends into the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5_YTSQpIuE">Kirkwall Ba game</a>. When Franjic attempted the first effort on goal there were 11 players inside the penalty area with reinforcements on the way.</p>
      <p>Topor-Stanley’s first block was superb, as was his wherewithal to avoid a handball, before he somehow contorted his body into a second diving tackle without regaining his footing. Nothing attracts a crowd like a crowd and protagonists were now entering the scene from all angles like AAMI Park seagulls. It was becoming a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jul/17/phil-mitchell-trump-coldwar-steve-twitter-mashups-mcfadden-brexit-britain">McFadden’s Cold War</a> interpretation of El Clasico, the Jets in their blaugrana stripes, Glory in Real white, players parking images of chalkboards and memories of third-man runs to allow room for System 1 behaviour to take over. See ball, kick ball.</p>
      <p>Improbably, the brief melee spat out a pass so perfect for the onrushing Chris Harold it suggested divine intervention (clearly it wasn’t, because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/robbie-fowler-at-times-you-can-never-win-when-you-go-into-management">His hands are full up in Brisbane</a>). A few blades of grass to the right of the penalty spot the substitute side-footed a shot that was deflected by the blur that was a charging Matt Millar, sending the ball cannoning against the crossbar and back into the teeming soccer sea. Koutroumbis was first to react but his flailing header could not divert the ball out of play. Instead it landed at the feet of Diego Castro, the one man on the pitch singularly equipped to cauterize the situation.</p>
      <p>Castro didn’t try to belt the stitching from the leather and send the ball into orbit. He didn’t require a touch to bring an awkwardly looping ricochet under control. In a split second he sized up the scene, eschewing the obvious option of the poorly guarded near post, instead redirecting his shot across the six-yard box and into the far corner, in the process wrongfooting the despairing Glen Moss and nutmegging Lachlan Jackson.</p>
      <p>Twelve seconds elapsed between the right-footed interventions of the first and last Spaniards in the passage. Eight players touched the ball at some point while 15 contributed to the chaos. It wasn’t pretty, it wasn’t sophisticated, but, in its own way, it was brilliant.</p>
