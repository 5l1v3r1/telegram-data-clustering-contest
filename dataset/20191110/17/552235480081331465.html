      <h2>The Parkhead side maintained their lead at the top of the Premiership with a comfortable victory against the Steelmen.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:47:16+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon says he's not surprised Celtic fans are enjoying a 'love affair' with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremie-frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a> after his side's 2-0 win over Motherwell.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old summer signing has been an instant hit with the Parkhead faithful after another stellar display against the Steelmen.</p>
      <p>And the Northern Irishman says everyone is guilty of falling head over heels for the former Manchester City man.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> said: "I'm not surprised, I think there's a bit of a love affair going on with him and everyone. We're just really enjoying him and you can see that energy and quality he brings to the team.</p>
      <p>"He's having a fantastic time of it and long may that continue.</p>
      <p>"It's not just about individuals, the team and the squad have been outstanding for the last six or seven weeks."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> didn't put in a vintage performance as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> was on target once again, but Lennon was happy with the three points after an emotional night in Rome midweek.</p>
      <p>He added: "It was comprehensive, we defended well and we created some brilliant opportunities as well.</p>
      <p>"We were in control of the game and off the back of Thursday it's another brilliant result.</p>
      <p>"Since the Livingston game, we've won every game in every competition, so our response has been absolutely magnificent."</p>
      <p>Lennon singled out Jonny Hayes who received the man of the match award and had a hand in Celtic's second goal as Richard Tait netted an own goal from the Irishman's dangerous cross.</p>

      <p>He said: "He's had a great couple of days. But we're not surprised by it. We watch him in training every day, we watch his fitness levels. He's a great player to have and he can do a number of roles for us.</p>
      <p>"I'm delighted with his contribution as I was on Thursday night. He was outstanding today and the two full backs did a great job to give us width. I'm delighted with Olivier too, both lads who came in did a great job."</p>
      <p>Celtic go into the international break top of the Premiership ahead of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> on goal difference as their rivals dispatched Livingston.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>And Lennon says he is welcoming the break after a full on few weeks.-</p>
      <p>He added: "I think some of them need the rest. Obviously a few are away on international duty where you will be waiting by the phone and you hope they get through it OK and are successful. Some of them look forward to going away with their countries and going home to seeing their families.</p>
      <p>"But for the rest of the group, it's a welcome break because it's been full on now for a few weeks."</p>
