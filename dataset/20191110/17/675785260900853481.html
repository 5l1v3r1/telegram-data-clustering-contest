      <h1>Chilling last moments of US family of 9 who were 'shot at point blank range'</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:25:09+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>The tragic family of nine <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crime">"slaughtered"</a> by suspected drug cartel were killed in a "point-blank assassination".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mexico-massacre-leaves-12-members-20813263">Rhonita Maria LeBaron, 33, was killed with her six-month-old twin babies</a> , Titus and Tiana, and two other children - Crystal, eight, and Howard, 10.</p>
      <p>Other family members were allegedly taken hostage eight miles up the road in Sonora, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mexico">Mexico</a> .</p>
      <p>Relatives feared Rhonita and her children were alive and trapped when their bullet-riddled SUV was allegedly set on fire and exploded.</p>
      <p>Another mum, Christina Johnson, 31, is said to have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/american-mum-bravely-saved-baby-20814202">saved her seven-month-old baby girl, Faith,</a> after she was shot multiple times.</p>
      <p>Now new harrowing detail has emerged about the shootings, which were believed to be at point-blank range.</p>

      <p>One Mexican federal official close to the investigation said "some of the victims [were shot] at point-blank range".</p>
      <p>And an American federal investigator said: "They were taken out of their cars and shot.</p>
      <p>"It’s kind of disturbing that the FBI has had no access to the crime scene, which is probably a disaster already because the Mexicans have allowed families to remove the bodies. Any evidence that could have been gathered is probably destroyed."</p>

      <p>But the American federal source added: "We’ve been saying all along that the Mexican government just doesn’t want to investigate anything related to drug trafficking.</p>
      <p>"They will go to any extreme to cover everything up.</p>
      <p>"It’s completely corrupt, and it’s only going to get worse."</p>
      <p>Heavily-armed troops <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mourners-attend-heavily-guarded-funeral-20838195">stood guard at the funeral</a> yesterday.</p>

      <p>The cemetery in the La Mora Mormon community in Sonara was full of grieving relatives.</p>
      <p>They gathered from both sides of the US-Mexico border, including states such as Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, North Dakota and Utah.</p>
      <p>Pallbearers lowered into the ground three simple wooden coffins built by family members and adorned with white, red and orange flowers.</p>
      <p>Kenneth Miller, whose daughter-in-law and four grandchildren died in the attack, said he hoped the tragedy would draw attention to the thousands of drug cartel victims in Mexico.</p>
      <p>"This is happening because we are dual citizens," Mr Miller said, referring to the Mexican government's support following the attack.</p>
