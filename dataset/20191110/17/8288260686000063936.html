      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa reaction | Nuno Espirito Santo has his say on the Premier League win at Molineux on Sunday afternoon as his players eased to three points</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:12:48+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Ruben Neves and Adama Traore have been praised for their decisive displays against Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Neves gave <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> the lead at Molineux with a wonderfully taken strike from the edge of the box, while Adama Traore had a hand in both goals.</p>
      <p>Traore, who has been called up to Spain’s senior team for the first time, won the free-kick which led to Neves’ goal before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adama-traore-wolves-aston-villa-17233482">carrying the ball 70 yards to tee up Raul Jimenez for the clincher</a> .</p>
      <p>And Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo heaped praise on the pair following the 2-1 victory over <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> .</p>
      <p>On Neves, he said: “He played really well, really well. Defensively he managed the ball with good passing between Joao and him - really, really good.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Joao Moutinho cut the ball back perfectly for Neves’ goal in a routine straight off the training ground. “We work on a lot of things,” added Nuno. “But they pass it good and finish it in the right way. The credit is for them. It’s the decision of Joao - he has the knowledge to do it.”</p>
      <p>Traore, playing against his former club, was excellent on the right of Wolves’ front three and completed a staggering 10 of the 11 dribbles he attempted.</p>
      <p>The winger’s assist for Jimenez takes his tally to 10 goal contributions (two goals, eight assists) for the season.</p>
      <p>“He’s playing very well,” Nuno said. “He’s sticking to his tasks and helping the team. He’s unique, he gives you these moments that only he can produce.”</p>
