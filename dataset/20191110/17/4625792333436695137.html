      <h1>‘Stink to high heaven’: Graham warns the whistleblower is likely a ‘deep state’ friend of Schiff</h1>

      <p>Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina claimed revelations that the whistleblower could be from the “deep state” may change the public’s outlook on impeachment.</p>
      <p>During a Sunday interview on Fox News, Graham explained the whistleblower’s connection to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and members of the Obama administration make the impeachment effort “stink to high heaven.”</p>
      <p>“When you find out who the whistleblower is, I’m confident you’re gonna find out it’s somebody from the deep state,” said Graham. “You’re gonna find out that they had interactions with Schiff. This thing's gonna stink to high heaven, and the only reason we don’t know who the whistleblower is, that it hurts their cause.”</p>
      <p>Eric Ciaramella, a 33-year-old career CIA analyst, was identified by RealClearInvestigations<i> </i>as the alleged whistleblower. Ciaramella has not been confirmed as the whistleblower, but he did serve under both the Obama administration and the Trump administration as a National Security Council adviser on issues relating to Ukraine and Russia.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-and-whistleblower-still-work-together-on-u-s-policy-towards-ukraine"><i>Washington Examiner</i><u> reported</u></a> that Ciaramella currently works as a deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia on the National Intelligence Council, reporting to the director of national intelligence.</p>
      <p>Ciaramella had a close relationship with several members of the Obama administration, including John Brennan. He even <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alleged-whistleblower-eric-ciaramella-was-biden-guest-at-state-department-banquet"><u>attended a State Department banquet</u></a> as a special guest of Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Graham said the House impeachment effort has nothing to do with finding the truth about Trump’s conduct.</p>

      <p>“They're not trying to find the truth here,” said Graham. “If you really we wanted to know the truth about why Joe Biden said what he did about the prosecutor, ‘If you don’t fire this guy, we're gonna cut off the money,’ well, let’s find out. Was Hunter Biden in the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-advisers-knew-in-2018-his-ukraine-comments-would-be-an-issue">crosshairs of the prosecutor</a>? This is not about Schiff finding the truth, this is about Schiff trying to destroy the Trump presidency.”</p>
      <p>He added, “If you think Schiff is looking for the truth, you shouldn’t be allowed to drive anywhere in America because that’s a ridiculous concept.”</p>
