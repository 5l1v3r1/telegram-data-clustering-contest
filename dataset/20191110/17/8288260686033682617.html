      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa reaction | Claret and blue faithful have picked out this positive on a poor day overall for Dean Smith's side at Molineux</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:56:54+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans have been reacting to Ezri Konsa's tweet after his debut today.</p>
      <p>The £12 million summer signing from Brentford made his first Premier League start in the 2-1 defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> at Molineux, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> 's third straight loss in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He partnered Tyrone Mings at centre-back, but wasn't able to help his side get a positive result in the West Midlands derby.</p>
      <p>Villa's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-news-grealish-17233998">cause wasn't helped by injuries</a> , with first choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton and captain Jack Grealish also out of the clash.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>So Konsa <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-aston-villa-reaction-17233833">was handed a debut in tricky circumstances</a> and that told with Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez on the scoresheet for Nuno Espirito Santo's side, with Trezeguet netting a consolation in injury time.</p>
      <p>Konsa took to social media after the match, tweeting: "Disappointed with the defeat this afternoon but proud to make my full Premier League debut.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for all the support today... we go again after the international break."</p>
      <p>And the claret and blue faithful responded.</p>
