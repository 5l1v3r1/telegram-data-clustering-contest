      <h3>UW sweeps Oregon</h3>
      <p>Kara Bajema had 20 kills and 15 digs and Sam Drechsel added 17 kills and eight block assists as No. 14 Washington (19-5, 10-4 Pac-12) completed a season sweep of the Oregon schools with a 25-16, 22-25, 25-13, 25-23 win at Oregon State (9-16, 3-11).</p>
      <p>“A lot of courageous swings from both of them,” UW coach Keegan Cook said about Drechsel and Bajema. “Even after making an error, coming back and taking another big swing. Sam’s been playing great of late, and we’ve asked Kara to take some big swings out of the back row and she’s delivered for sure.”</p>
      <h3>More volleyball</h3>
      <p>• No. 24 Washington State also completed a sweep of the Oregon schools, beating the Ducks in Eugene 25-20, 25-15, 16-25, 26-24. <b>Pia Timmer </b>had 10 kills to lead the Cougars (21-5, 10-4 Pac-12).</p>
