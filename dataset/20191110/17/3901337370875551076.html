        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Manchester United 3-1 Brighton and Hove Albion</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 10 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Old Trafford</p>
      <p>Manchester United moved up to seventh spot in the Premier League standings after registering a 3-1 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Anthony Martial retained his spot in the side, while Daniel James, Andreas Periera, David de Gea and Brandon Williams were re-called for the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>The home side got the scoring underway after 16 minutes as Periera marked his 50th appearance for the club with a deflected effort from close range.</p>
      <p>The lead was doubled three minutes later as Harry Maguire managed to get on the end of Fred's in-swinging free-kick, but the goal went down as an own goal after Brighton's Davy Propper deflected the ball into his own net.</p>
      <p>Brighton, meanwhile, offered nothing going forward in open play for most but only looked threatening on a couple set-pieces as De Gea was largely untested in the opening 45 minutes.</p>
      <p>The visitors managed to pull one back on the hour mark as Lewis Dunk profited from poor marking to nod past a helpess De Gea to give Brighton some hope.</p>
      <p>However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side restored their two-goal advantage minutes later as Rashford found the back of the net to take his tally to six goals in seven games after some good work by Martial.</p>
      <p>With United comfortably leading, Solskjaer then re-shuffled his pack as Jesse Lingard replaced Pereira, who had been denied just moments before being taken off.</p>
      <p>Rashford should have bagged the home side's fourth goal in the 89th minute after being played in by Martial, but the striker dragged his effort wide of the mark as the encounter finish 3-1 at Old Trafford.</p>
