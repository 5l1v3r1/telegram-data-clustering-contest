      <h1>Slaughtneil beat Dunloy to win third Ulster Hurling Championship in four years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:18:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author">Diarmuid Pepper</a></address>
      <p>Slaughtneil have overcome Dunloy Cuchullains to get their hands on the Four Seasons Cup for the third time in four years.</p>
      <p>The Derry champions defeated Antrim’s Dunloy by 1-15 to 0-10 in today’s Ulster Hurling Senior Club Championship final at Pairc Esler.</p>
      <p>And while an eight-point victory may look comfortable on paper, Slaughtneil were forced to dig deep to see off the Antrim champions.</p>
      <p>In the first half both goalkeepers proved their worth and pulled off acrobatic saves when a goal seemed certain.</p>
      <p>With little more than five minutes on the clock, a smart handpass was fed into Slaughtneil's Brendan Rogers. He found a gap in the Dunloy defence and drove the ball towards the bottom corner of the net from close range.</p>
      <p>But Dunloy ‘keeper Ryan Elliot was up to the challenge, extending his hurl to tip the sliotar around the post and out of play.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the field, Slaughtneil's Oisin O’Doherty made an equally good save. O’Doherty was due to start on the bench but from himself starting between the sticks instead.</p>
      <p>On the 17th minute, he had to be at his best to divert a Ronan Molloy shot onto the post and away from goal.</p>
      <p>At the end of the first half, Slaughtneil lead 0-8 to 0-6 but soon after the restart their task was made somewhat easier.</p>
      <p>In the 38th minute, Dunloy’s Neil Elliot received his marching orders for a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>However, Dunloy kept battling and with a quarter of the game remaining they were still in contention, trailing 0-8 to 0-11.</p>
      <p>But as the game was about to enter the final 10 minutes, Slaughtneil were awarded a penalty.</p>
      <p>Cormac O’Doherty struck the penalty and found the back of the net, giving Slaughtneil a 1-11 to 0-8 lead.</p>
      <p>Dunloy tried their best to bounce back and scored the next two points.</p>
      <p>But Slaughtneil struck over four unanswered points to pull away from Dunloy and finish out the game with a scoreline of 1-15 to 0-10.</p>
