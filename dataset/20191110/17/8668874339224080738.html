      <p>A thoroughly dominant display by Premiership new-boys <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish">London Irish</a> delivered a valuable 36-11 bonus-point win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> Tigers at the Madejski Stadium.</p>
      <p>The points came from everywhere for the Exiles, with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/oli-hoskins/">Oli Hoskins</a>, wing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/ben-loader/">Ben Loader</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/ruan-botha/">Ruan Botha</a> getting over in the first half and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/stephen-myler/">Stephen Myler</a> adding seven points with the boot.</p>
      <p>Tigers had two first-half penalties to show for their efforts and got a late score for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/jonah-holmes/">Jonah Holmes</a>, but Irish continued to run riot after the break as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/highlanders/players/waisake-naholo/">Waisake Naholo</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish/players/tom-parton/">Tom Parton</a> secured the five-point victory.</p>
      <p>Hoskins got the first after just eight minutes as he took the ball off the back of a rolling maul and burrowed over from close range.</p>

      </p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/tom-hardwick/">Tom Hardwick</a> penalty got the visitors on the board after 15 minutes, but Irish had their second try at the quarter-way point, Loader taking the ball from 22 metres out and touching down despite a last-gasp attempt to hold him up.</p>

      <p>Both sides struggled to create further opportunities before the break but after Myler added three points with a penalty, a terrific breakaway score for the hosts on the stroke of half-time was capped off by Botha for a 22-6 lead.</p>

      <p>The Tigers started the second half the better of the two sides but could not make their dominance count, best exemplified when Hardwick’s pass sailed way behind <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/adam-thompstone/">Adam Thompstone</a> as opportunity knocked.</p>
      <p>Leicester’s best chance came as Hardwick made a great line-breaking run and offloaded inside to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/leicester/players/noel-reid/">Noel Reid</a>, but with the line at his mercy he just could not hold onto the ball and the knock-on cost a valuable opportunity.</p>

      <p>The hosts put the game out of reach with just over 15 minutes to go as fly-half Myler showed great awareness and creativity to kick the ball out to the right wing where the onrushing Naholo got the benefit of the bounce.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> international, on his first appearance for Irish, just about kept his feet away from the touchline before barrelling over his opposite number to score in the corner.</p>

      <p>Leicester pushed for a late consolation but a knock-on allowed Parton to scoop up the ball and sprint from inside his 22 to score under the posts and seal the bonus point.</p>
      <p>Holmes would get a late try as the clock turned red but it was far too little too late for Tigers, who finish the weekend bottom of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> after Bath’s victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/northampton">Northampton</a> Saints.</p>
