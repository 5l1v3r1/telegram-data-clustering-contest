      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-1 Aston Villa reaction | Jed Steer and Matt Targett added insult to injury for Dean Smith and he has discussed his side's injury worries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:27:31+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith has revealed the extent of Aston Villa's injury crisis.</p>
      <p>The boss was dealt a triple blow before kick-off at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> knowing Tom Heaton and Bjorn Engels joined Jack Grealish on the treatment table.</p>
      <p>Heaton</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gallery/aston-villa-injury-crisis-worsens-17233316">will now withdraw from the England squad with a calf injury</a>
      </p>
      <p>while Engels pulled up at Bodymoor with a bruised hip.</p>
      <p>As for Grealish, the skipper continues to struggle with a bleed on his calf.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>During the game, replacement stopper Jed Steer was forced off after just five minutes with an Achilles sprain - and left Molinuex to have a scan.</p>
      <p>Left-back Matt Targett added insult to injury, too, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wolves-aston-villa-premier-league-17233086">having been forced off with blurred vision</a> after taking a knock to the head.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the injury disruption, Smith said: "Yeah, Tom Heaton's been struggling with a calf so I knew he was going to pull out of the game. Jack was always 50/50. Bjorn (hip) came to see me yesterday morning so I always knew we were struggling with that.</p>
      <p>"In the game, you get Jed Steer going down after three minutes on his first Premier League start with an Achilles injury but, for me, it still doesn't affect your desire to go and win a header, a tackle, a second ball and just help your teammates out and I didn't think we did that first half."</p>

      <p>Smith added: "What the international period will do will enable them to be fit for the Newcastle game. I'm not too sure about Jed Steer, I'll wait for the prognosis on his Achilles injury."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> boss confirmed that Tyrone Mings is fine while lamenting making two substitutions within the first 45 minutes, fuming: "Making the two substitutions in the first half stopped me doing three at half time!"</p>
