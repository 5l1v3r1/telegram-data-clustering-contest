      <p>Antalya -Â England's <b>Tyrrell Hatton</b> held his nerve to emerge triumphant after a rare six-man playoff in a gripping, floodlit conclusion to the <b>Turkish Open</b> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Hatton parred the fourth extra sudden-death hole to deny Austria's Matthias Schwab his first European Tour title in the most agonising fashion.</p>
      <p>That pair were tied on 20-under par at the end of the four days along with South African Erik van Rooyen, French duo Benjamin Hebert and Victor Perez, and American Kurt Kitayama.</p>
      <p>Hebert, Perez and Van Rooyen fell by the wayside after the first play-off run up the 18th, failing to match their three play-off rivals' birdie fours.</p>
      <p>Hatton, Schwab and Kitayama all parred the next attempt to find an outright winner, but Kitayama's par at the third play-off hole saw him head back to the clubhouse, leaving Hatton and Schwab to hop in their buggies and head back down to the 18th tee.</p>
      <p>For the last time, as it turned out with Hatton making par to Schwab's bogey to deny the 24-year-old Austrian his first ever title having led the tournament since Thursday's first round.</p>
      <p>This was Hatton's fourth title and it came with a handsome (1.56 million ($1.992 million, 1.808 million euros) cheque.</p>
      <p>"It's so surreal," he said. "I can't actually believe that I won.</p>
      <p>"It's been quite a difficult year in terms of things happening off the course, but in the last month I feel like I've really found my game again."</p>
      <p>Hatton had begun the final round four shots off the lead, but ended the last man standing in the Turkish twilight.</p>
      <p>He had muscled his way into the play-off with a closing birdie, and had to chip in to keep his title hopes alive after the first trip back up the last.</p>
      <p>This was the first six-man play-off on the European Tour since the 2003 Alfred Dunhill Championship.</p>
      <p>Schwab, who had led by three strokes overnight, is still waiting for a maiden European Tour title after posting his 10th top-10 finish of the season.</p>
      <p>"It was a close call. I had some good looks and good chances coming down the stretch in regular play, and didn't take advantage of them," said the world number 102.</p>
      <p>"I think it's still a second-place finish, which is obviously not too bad, but yeah, at the moment, it's not too great."</p>
      <p>In-form Scot Robert MacIntyre and India's Shubhankar Sharma finished two shots outside the playoff on 18-under.</p>
