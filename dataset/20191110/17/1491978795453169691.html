      <p>Hundreds of homes in Fishlake near Doncaster have been flooded after the River Don burst its banks, with many parts of the village are under almost a metre (3ft) of water and only accessible by boat or tractor. About half of the 700 residents were forced to evacuate as seven severe flood warnings were in place in South Yorkshire with a potential danger to life.</p>
