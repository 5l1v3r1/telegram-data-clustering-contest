      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lauds Man Utd's best performance of season against Brighton</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United moved up to seventh in the Premier League table with a 3-1 victory over Brighton at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T17:27:45+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 17:27</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed his “exhilarating and entertaining” Manchester United side after their goal glut against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>Solskjaer said he did not know how his United side failed to score more after what he described as their best performance this season.</p>
      <p>United moved up to seventh with strikes from Andreas Pereira, Marcus Rashford and an own goal from Brighton's Davey Propper, with Lewis Dunk scoring for the visitors.</p>
      <p>“That was our best performance of the season,” said Solskjaer. 'It was an excellent performance from the lads. When you see them going forward, it's a joy to watch.</p>
      <p>“How it didn't end up five, six or seven, we don't know, but it was exhilarating and entertaining and great to see the boys enjoy themselves.</p>

      <p>“These six weeks since the last international break, when we started against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , we've had five wins and a defeat.</p>
      <p>“Losing at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> was disappointing, but we've had loads of answers to what we're trying to do.</p>
      <p>“It's been great these two games, with loads of attacking play. We should have had more goals, but the intentions are there and they're enjoying themselves</p>
      <p>“They young players are performing and learning. They've had some tough lessons, but they've learned from them.</p>
      <p>"The table doesn't really matter at the moment. We need to keep improving, keep winning games and see where it takes us.”</p>

      <p>United winger Dan James said: “The high press paid off, that’s what we have been about all season, playing with energy right from the start.</p>
      <p>“We were a little bit edgy when they scored and it was good to score again on the break. But we could have scored seven or eight goals.”</p>
      <p>Rashford missed an open goal from a James delivery, moments after making it 3-1, but the Wales winger said: “Marcus normally scores a lot of those goals, but thankfully when he missed we were already 3-1 up.”</p>
      <p>The only downside for United was an ankle injury to Scott McTominay, which saw the midfielder taken off on a stretcher late on.</p>
      <p>McTominay will have a scan today but is unlikely to go on international duty with Scotland, while the full extent of the damage to his injured ankle is assessed.</p>
