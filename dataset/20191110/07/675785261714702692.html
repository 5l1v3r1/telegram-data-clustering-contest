      <h1>Man Utd predicted line-up for Premier League visit of Brighton</h1>
      <h2>United hoping Scott McTominay and Victor Lindelof recover from injuries but Mason Greenwood will be taken out of limelight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of midfielder Scott McTominay ahead of Sunday's Premier League clash against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">McTominay's</a> ever-present record this season is in doubt after a foot injury forced him off after 75 minutes of Thursday's 3-0 Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>However, he told reporters after the game that he "should be fine" - and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will hope he is the correct as the Scot has been one of United's best performers so far this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> desperately need a win after picking up just three from their 11 Premier League games so far this season, with the Red Devils down in 14th place in the table, just five points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>However, Solskjaer is likely to take Mason Greenwood back out of the limelight despite the teenager having put United on course for their comprehensive Europa League win over Partizan Belgrade at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>That was Greenwood's first start in five weeks - a period in which he dropped down to play for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy - as Solskjaer focuses on developing the teenage talent correctly.</p>
      <p>"Mason is going to have a very big career, but sometimes is not the right time to play him," former United striker Solskjaer said.</p>
      <p>"He knows why he hasn't played as much. We're taking our time with him.</p>
      <p>"It's been a difficult period. Anthony (Martial) has been away, to put all the weight on his shoulder wasn't right either.</p>

      <p>"I think we are finding the right balance between playing him, resting him and training him. He needs to learn the man's game.</p>
      <p>"He's gone up from the Under-18s last year, now he's training with the first team every day and you can't just turn that switch on and off.</p>
      <p>"You've got to perform every day if you are going to be accepted by a group like this."</p>
      <p>Solskjaer will be hoping Lindelof can recover from a knock that forced him to miss the match against Partizan.</p>

      <p>United captain Ashley Young is suspended while Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Axel Tuanzebe are not expected back until after the international break.</p>
      <p>Brighton will be without defender Adam Webster, who could be out until Christmas following an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>The Â£20million summer signing from Bristol City damaged his ligaments in Brighton's win against Norwich last weekend.</p>
