        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 10 – Gatundu South Member of Parliament Moses Kuria has questioned the relevance of the Building Bridges Initiative after chaos erupted during the Kibra by-election affecting former Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale and Kimilili Member of Parliament Didmus Barasa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In one of his social media posts, the MP says that the violence that happened in Kibra and saw two politicians stoned and kicked out of the area raises eyebrows on the importance of BBI.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“That this happened in the handshake bedroom speaks volumes about the Building Battalions Initiative,” said Kuria.</p>
      <p>He further condemned the violence adding that the handshake that transpired between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga was to resolve matters amicably.</p>
      <p>“The handshake was meat to resolve issues such as electoral violence,” he added.</p>
      <p>Kuria’s sentiments were echoed by Deputy President William Ruto has challenged ODM to renounce politics that lean towards violence and intimidation and instead embrace a development-focused strategy.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a P<i>ublic Baraza</i> in Gilgil Constituency, Saturday, the Deputy President claimed that ODM emerged victorious in the Kibra by-election that took place on November 7, 2019, because of an organized militia and violence sponsored by the Raila Odinga-led party.</p>
      <p>“When we were going into the Kibra By-election, we did so, in the firm belief that elections are decided on policies and votes cast, but we saw a situation where the election was dictated by violence, mayhem, and intimidation carried out by organized gangs.”</p>
      <p>“We are asking our counterparts in ODM, to tell us as Kenyans, when they will shift from this culture of electoral violence and start focusing on an electoral strategy that is based on peace, development, and policies,” Ruto posed.</p>
      <p>The DP claimed that ODM Party Leader Raila Odinga used the same instruments as terror organizations as their main strategy for winning Thursday’s mini poll.</p>
      <p>Kuria and Ruto’s sentiments come at a time when BBI taskforce waits to hand it over the BBI findings to President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p>
      <p>The team concluded its outcomes and had mentioned waiting for the President’ Invitation for handing over the report after collecting the views from Kenyans countrywide.</p>
      <p>The BBI initiative was launched in March 2018 with the aim of creating a united nation that came after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga shook hands on March 9, 2018.</p>
      <p>BBI was recognized for assisting in the implementation of shared objectives and was officially gazette on May 31<sup>st</sup>, 2018.</p>
      <p>The team commenced their task from the first week of June 2018, and in May 2019, had their term extended by five months.</p>
