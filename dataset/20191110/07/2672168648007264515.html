      <p>(Colombo, AFP) - Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe looks set to lose his job after next week’s presidential election, with the two leading candidates declaring Thursday they will dump him.</p>
      <p> Main opposition candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Sajith Premadasa from Wickremesinghe’s ruling United National Party (UNP) are in a close race ahead of the November 16 polls and both said they would appoint their own PMs if they win.</p>
      <p> "I will appoint a new prime minister who can command the majority of parliament," Premadasa, 52, said in a televised address on Thursday.</p>
      <p> His remarks appeared to seal the fate of Wickremesinghe, 70, who is nominally the leader of the UNP but faces a revolt within the ranks of the party hierarchy.</p>
      <p>But Wickremesinghe has responded expressing the law by saying whoever commands the majority of parliament will be prime minister.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa earlier also vowed to replace Wickremesinghe — who has been plagued by accusations of cronyism and incompetence amid his failure to prosecute politicians accused of corruption — with his brother Mahinda.</p>
      <p> Rajapaksa is a former secretary to the defence ministry between 2005 and 2015 when his brother was president.</p>
      <p> Under a recent constitutional amendment, the office of prime minister was given extensive powers to decide on cabinet appointments and to run the day-to-day affairs of the government.</p>
      <p> Mahinda Rajapakse failed to win office for the third term in 2015 and a new constitutional provision on term limits bars him from running for the presidency again.</p>
      <p> Under the new constitutional provision, the president cannot sack the prime minister unless through a vote of no-confidence in parliament.</p>
      <p> Premadasa, the son of president Ranasinghe Premadasa who was assassinated by suspected Tamil Tiger rebels in 1993, has called for a clean up of his own party and vowed to purge key ministers of Wickremesinghe’s government.</p>
      <p> Some 15.9 million people are eligible to vote at the Nov. 16 election.</p>
