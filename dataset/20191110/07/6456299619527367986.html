      <h1>Struggling 'Terminator' Movie Has An Even Worse Second Weekend</h1>

      <p>"The news just keeps getting worse for <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>," reports CinemaBlend: <i>It had <a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/19/11/03/181227/third-terminator-reboot-bombs-at-box-office">a disappointing opening last week</a> and a sharp drop in its second weekend at the box office. It also had <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484369/ouch-terminator-dark-fate-had-a-huge-second-weekend-drop">the worst Friday-to-Friday drop of any other Terminator sequel in the franchise</a>... According to Forbes, it made only $2.8 million on Friday, November 8, marking a 73% drop from opening day on November 1...<br/><br/>[A]t this point, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> is only expected to make just over $10 million this weekend, which would be a drop of 65% from last weekend. That is pretty big considering <i>Dark Fate</i> only started with a $29 million opening weekend. To go back to <i>Terminator Salvation</i>, that movie opened to $42.5 million 10 years ago, so even a slightly bigger week-to-week percentage drop gave it more money than <i>Dark Fate</i>... <br/><br/><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> cost between $185-$195 million to make, not including marketing costs. According to Deadline, the movie <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/terminator-dark-fate-linda-hamilton-harriet-motherless-brooklyn-weekend-box-office-1202774477/">will have to make $470 million worldwide to break even</a>. If it were making a killing at the international box office, that might happen. But it's not exactly crushing overseas either. Going into this second weekend, the film was only at $135 million worldwide, with $94M of that from the foreign box office. That's a lot more than domestic, but the addition of this weekend's numbers, and whatever comes next week and beyond, probably won't be enough to hit that break even point... [E]ven if you too think you know where James Cameron was going with his Terminator trilogy plans after <i>Dark Fate</i>, it's unlikely now that those plans will see the light of day.</i> <br/>Forbes calls it "a sign that making a better sequel <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/09/box-office-james-cameron-and-tim-millers-terminator-dark-fate-starring-linda-hamiton-and-arnold-schwarzenegger-faces-judgment-day-with-74-friday-drop-as-dc-films-joker-nears-1-billion-and-angelina-jolie-in-walt-disneys-maleficent-mistress-of-evil-tops-400-million/">couldn't save a franchise for which general audiences stopped caring decades ago</a>... [I]t's an example of the studios looking at the threat posed by video-on-demand and streaming and giving theatrical audiences exactly what they don't want."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, they write, the movie <i>Joker</i> has become the most profitable comic book movie of all time, earning $958.7 million worldwide on a budget of just $62.5 million.</p>
