      <h1>Wife stands by soldier husband after watching video of him shoot dead Taliban prisoner</h1>
      <h2>Video footage played in court showed Royal Marine Alexander Blackman - author of Marine A: The Truth About The Murder Conviction - shooting a captured but injured Taliban insurgent in the chest in Afghanistan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/emma-jones/</a></address>
      <p>The first time Claire Blackman watched the video of her husband shooting dead a Taliban insurgent, they were in court – and he would soon be convicted of murder.</p>
      <p>But as the nation argued about whether Sgt Alexander Blackman, now 45, was a national disgrace or a national hero, she never wavered in her backing for the man she knew as ‘big softie Al’.</p>
      <p>Her ­support would go on to save his life as he ­wrestled with despair on suicide watch in prison.</p>
      <p>The grainy footage she saw shows him in the ­middle of scrubland in Helmand ­Province, firing his pistol into the chest of a horrifically injured fighter at point-blank range.</p>
      <p>‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***,’ the Royal Marine can be heard muttering.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It was without doubt disturbing viewing and the key piece of evidence which resulted in him being found guilty.</p>
      <p>With that, Al – known during the trial as Marine A – became the first ­British ­serviceman or woman to be convicted of ­murder on a b­attlefield since the Second World War.</p>
      <p>Born in Brighton, he had served in the Royal Marines for 16 years, ­completing six operational tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, which, over the years, was a country he got to know well.</p>
      <p>What he describes now as a ‘moment of madness’, changed his and his family’s lives for ever.</p>
      <h3>Battlefield</h3>
      <p>He was well used to seeing the effects of bombs on the battlefield, but this day was different.</p>
      <p>An Apache helicopter had opened fire and, as they checked on the wounded, the sergeant was informed that one particular insurgent was badly injured.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He explains what he saw...</p>
      <p>‘I looked at him,’ Al recalls.</p>
      <p>‘What scant signs of life there had been were barely ­perceptible – I watched him for the longest time, the lads increasingly jumpy around me. Other insurgents were close by and we were out in the open, we were targets.</p>
      <p>‘A thought that had been growing in me began to ­solidify – there was no way this insurgent could make it back to any military hospital alive – I could see his lungs through his wounds.'</p>
      <p>‘The chain gun on the Apache helicopter wasn’t a weapon that anything as frail as a ­human body could ever survive. It was a ­wonder he had lasted this long.</p>
      <p>'His life seemed already gone.'</p>
      <p>‘We moved the man to wait for the helicopter to get him to ­hospital, but, sure that any last breath in his body had dwindled away, I took to the radio and ­reported he’d died.'</p>
      <p>‘And then I shot him.’</p>

      <p>Al was used to the procedure that followed.</p>
      <p>The ­operation wrapped up over the next couple of days and the ­excitement of ­returning home to Claire was ­bubbling.</p>
      <p>Once he landed home after this ­particular stint, though, his ­behaviour started to shift.</p>
      <p>‘Initially I felt so relieved to be back with my family,’ he explains.</p>
      <p>‘But walking around ­Weymouth town centre, I heard Claire ask, “Why?” – I realised it was ­because she’d seen my eyes ­darting down, my gaze focusing on the ground beneath my feet with every step I took.'</p>
      <p>'I was here, in ­England, yet I was ­looking for IEDs ­everywhere.'</p>
      <p>'l was eventually ­diagnosed with “adjustment disorder”.’</p>
      <p>'If he’d stayed in the war zone any longer, he could have degenerated to the point where he had a lasting post-traumatic stress disorder.'</p>

      <p>He’d seen the way it debilitated others.</p>
      <p>He’d seen the way it could colour a life.</p>
      <p>At once he felt fortunate that his time in ­Helmand had come to an end.</p>
      <h3>The arrest</h3>
      <p>A year later, on a lazy Saturday morning, Al and Claire’s lives were turned upside down by a knock at the door.</p>
      <p>‘A policeman was stood at the door,’ Al says.</p>
      <p>‘He said, “Sgt Blackman, I’m arresting you on suspicion of war crimes”.'</p>
      <p>'They also had a warrant to search my home.'</p>
      <p>'I calmly let them in.'</p>
      <p>‘I was certain I hadn’t done anything to ­warrant military police searching my home.'</p>
      <p>'Claire looked very confused and panic only set in when they took my old ­BlackBerry phone and asked me to get in the car down to the station.’</p>
      <p>The officers explained they had video evidence that he had committed a war crime in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>He froze in silence.</p>
      <p>When he was shown the video, and heard the abusive words he’d muttered, he struggled to place the day in his mind.</p>
      <p>What happened next was his worst nightmare.</p>
      <p>‘The police dropped me home and I had to tell Claire what had happened,’ says Al.</p>
      <p>‘She listened patiently in silence, but as I told her the story there was dissociation in my head, as though it wasn’t me there that day.’</p>
      <p>An in-depth trial followed, where his legal team suggested that Claire did not watch the ­footage – filmed on a headcam – when it was shown in court.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Her husband was anxious about her reaction, admitting, ‘I was nervous, it’s not my finest hour – there was a worry she would see me in a different way.’</p>
      <p>But Claire, 47, did not waver for a second in her love and respect for him.</p>
      <p>She insists, ‘I never had to ask why – rightly or wrongly, I honestly didn’t.'</p>
      <p>'While it was not pleasant viewing, I didn’t feel it was my place to judge.’</p>
      <p>She stood by him as the public debate raged, but after a two-week trial he was ­sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in jail.</p>
      <p>When Claire visited him, he told her he’d understand if she wanted to walk away from their relationship and get on with her life.</p>
      <p>‘It isn’t right, Claire,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘You shouldn’t have to do this... not for me – I’d never hold it against you.’</p>
      <p>But her hand tightened on his, and she told him, ‘I never want to hear about it again, do you hear?'</p>
      <p>'I never want to hear you offer ­anything as stupid again – I’m here, aren’t I?’</p>
      <p>Al has written a book, Marine A: The Truth About The Murder Conviction, describing his ­experience.</p>
      <p>In it, he talks about prison being the darkest time of his life, revealing, ‘I was on suicide watch for a couple of months. I was ­depressed... with lots of time alone to dwell on things.’</p>
      <p>At a military prison in Colchester, Essex, he slept under strip lights, and was observed through a one-way mirror.</p>
      <p>He was told to keep his arms above the covers and woken by intercom if he did not to ‘make sure that I was still alive’.</p>
      <p>In a civilian cell, he continued to be checked, and a service light was turned on every ‘15 minutes, half hour, hour’.</p>
      <p>‘Knowing I had Claire really did save me,’ Al says solemnly.</p>
      <h3>Combat stress</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>On top of his conviction, he was also ­dishonourably discharged from the Army.</p>
      <p>But after more than three years in ­prison – and with the help of a ­campaign that raised £800,000 – his murder ­conviction was ­reduced on appeal to ­manslaughter.</p>
      <p>New evidence had shown he had ­adjustment disorder, a form of combat stress.</p>
      <p>He had not been given a mental health assessment before his trial.</p>
      <p>His 10-year ­minimum term was cut to seven years and he was freed in April 2017.</p>
      <p>‘Tears are a great release,’ says Claire.</p>
      <p>‘There were times I wanted that feeling, but it just didn’t happen.'</p>
      <p>'At first it was too hard even to cry.'</p>
      <p>'Almost the day he came home it felt as if it hadn’t ­happened, it went back to being us.’</p>
      <p>Now the couple are trying to put the incident behind them, enjoying walks with their dog Dave in Somerset.</p>
      <p>Buying the dog was one of the first things they did on Al’s release.</p>
      <p>He’s helped him open up about his experiences.</p>
      <p>They considered ­taking further action against the sentence, but decided not to.</p>
      <p>‘We have to let go of it, there’s no anger, it doesn’t keep you warm at night, it doesn’t make you a better person, it just consumes you,’ says Al.</p>
      <p>Instead, they are intent only on ­pursuing peace and contentment.</p>
      <p>Al is happily ­retired, although he is a trustee of the ­charity Go ­Commando, which supports Royal ­Marines and their ­families, and has done work with a company helping ­veterans find employment.</p>
      <p>But he will never forget his experiences of war.</p>
      <p> Just as – whatever our views of this tragic case – we must never forget the thousands who have sacrificed their lives, limbs or mental health to keep us safe.  </p>
