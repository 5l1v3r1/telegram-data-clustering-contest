      <h1>Iconic Tunnock's brand changes colour for charity</h1>
      <h2>A batch of the 'Teacake' has gone the colour purple for the month of November.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T07:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shirley Bartynek, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/shirley-bartynek/</a></address>
      <p>Tunnock’s have changed colour for November’s Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
      <p>A limited-edition batch of Tea Cakes have ditched their distinctive red and silver foil to be wrapped in purple.</p>
      <p>The biscuits have been donated to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland (PCS), who picked up over 1000 purple tea cakes from Tunnock’s factory in Uddingston.</p>

      <p>Owner Sir Boyd Tunnock said: “The colour purple symbolises the fight against pancreatic cancer and we were only too happy to ditch our distinctive red and silver branding to highlight such a good cause.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had members of staff affected by pancreatic cancer and wanted to do all we could to help raise awareness.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t mind telling you we had a bit of bother sourcing exactly the right colour of foil for the biscuits. It was important to us that we got the correct shade of purple.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, our suppliers were on the case and able to help.”</p>
      <p>The prized purple possessions come in a standard Tunnock’s box containing 36 tea cakes, and a total of 28 boxes were collected by the charity.</p>
      <p>This is the third year Tunnock’s have supported PCS with their specially wrapped tea cakes.</p>
      <p>Fiona Brown, development manager of PCS, said: “Everyone loves Tunnock’s Tea Cakes. Their branding is famous all over the world, and we’re honoured to have our very own limited edition biscuits. Many of our supporters and fundraisers will be enjoying some of these purple wrapped treats with their tea.”</p>
      <p>The colour purple is associated with pancreatic cancer across the globe and on Thursday, November 21, World Pancreatic Cancer Day, Scottish landmarks will also be lighting up purple to help shine a light on the cause. In previous years the Kelpies in Falkirk and Edinburgh Castle have adopted the colour, and many people choose to play their own purple part at home.</p>
      <p>Fiona explained: “Using the colour purple is an effective way of starting conversations about pancreatic cancer – people talk about why landmarks are lit purple, share pictures on social media and this helps support much needed awareness for a disease that’s been left in the dark for too long.</p>
      <p>“We would love to see lots more purple in Scotland this November and encourage people to reach out to local landmarks and businesses to ask for their support.”</p>
      <p>PCS is dedicated to the people of Scotland whose lives have been touched by pancreatic cancer and associated tumours. They are committed to raising awareness, enhancing education, healthcare, research and support for patients and families in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Of all the major cancers, pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rates and these numbers have barely changed in the last five decades.</p>
      <p>Around 800 people a year are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Scotland. With a predicted increase of 49 per cent by 2027, PCS are determined to stop pancreatic cancer becoming the second=largest cause of cancer death.</p>
      <p>There is currently no standard screening test or early detection method for pancreatic cancer, though research is being conducted in these areas. Knowing the symptoms and risks remains key to an early diagnosis to give patients the best chance of survival.</p>
      <p>To support the charity’s vision to make the 2020’s the decade of change, PCS have recently launched the ‘Pan Can Clan’ to bring together a growing and inspiring community of people committed to the cause.</p>
      <p>Fiona said:“All our fantastic supporters play a key role, and that includes the many Scottish businesses, such as Tunnock’s, who embrace our belief that together we can make a difference.”</p>
