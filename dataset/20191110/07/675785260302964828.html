      <p>This week has seen both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-mothercare-hundreds-jobs-risk-20806590">Mothercare</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-mamas--papas-collapses-20842391">Mamas &amp; Papas</a> enter administration.</p>
      <p>But, as well as raising questions about whether anyone in Britain is still having babies, it's left people asking themselves what shoppers can do so they're not left out of pocket.</p>
      <p>Well, it turns out there's a remarkably simple step you can take that offers you an awful lot more power than you would have otherwise.</p>
      <p>Meet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/clever-consumer-law-your-your-18358196">section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act</a>.</p>
      <p>This is how it works, the rights you get and what you need to do to make sure it applies to your purchases.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There’s loads of ways to pay for things when you go shopping. But paying for goods or services with a credit card (or certain other types of credit agreement), gives you statutory protection if something goes wrong under the Consumer Credit Act.</p>
      <p>This means that you can ask the card provider to give you a refund if the goods or services you’ve paid for don’t turn up or are ‘misrepresented’ (in other words, what you’ve been sold isn’t what you were told it would be).</p>
      <p>These claims are made under what’s known as ‘section 75’ of the Consumer Credit Act (section 75 is the section of the act that applies to purchases like this).</p>
      <p>This is an incredibly useful piece of legislation that many people don’t know about. In theory, you can make a claim if the seller goes bust, or if you’ve only partially paid for the goods on a credit card.</p>
      <p>It’s not all straightforward though. Claims made under section 75 have to meet certain criteria and are looked at on a case by case basis by the card provider.</p>
      <h3>How do I know if I’ve got rights under section 75?</h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>If you pay for goods or services on a credit card that cost between £100 and £30,000, the credit card provider is jointly responsible, along with the supplier of the goods or services, for any breach of contract or misrepresentation.</p>
      <p>This can involve goods not turning up, items that are damaged or don’t do what they are supposed to do or situations where you’ve been misled by the supplier.</p>
      <p>You don’t need to complain directly to the supplier either – but we strongly recommend you do. In fact, make the same complaint using Resolver and cut and paste the same information.</p>
      <p>You’re even covered if you’ve only paid for a deposit for something on your credit card – as long as the deposit cost between £100 and £30,000.</p>
      <p>In cases like this you’re still covered for the whole value of the item in question. So if you pay a £200 deposit for a sofa that costs £2,000 on your credit card and the rest in cash, if the firm goes in to liquidation the card provider would in theory have to pay you the full £2,000.</p>
      <p>In fact, the wording around deposits is pretty unclear, so in theory, even if you’d paid a pound on deposit you might be covered.</p>
      <p>‘Might’ is the key word in that sentence! It’s likely a card provider would fight any claim on a deposit under £100 – and some specify a limit in their terms.</p>
      <h3>Rules and quirks you need to know</h3>

      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>There are a number of other conditions that must apply before you make a claim:</li>
        <li>The card provider must be based in the UK, though you can complain about purchases made to businesses overseas.</li>
        <li>You are only covered if you buy direct from the supplier, not a third party. This is known as the debtor-creditor-supplier relationship and it’s enormously complicated. If in doubt, put a claim in anyway.</li>
        <li>Debit card payments, cheques and transfers are not covered by the Consumer Credit Act, though you may be able to make a ‘chargeback’ if there’s a dispute with a debit card payment.</li>
        <li>Though section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act is a great piece of legislation when it comes to consumer rights, it is still open to interpretation. So though it makes sense to pay for items on a credit card, just in case something goes wrong, it does not guarantee that you’ll get your money back.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>A few other quirks</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Much as we love the Consumer Credit Act, it’s pretty old (1974 originally) and though it’s been updated a few times, the way it’s worded doesn’t always fit with the way we live and shop today.</p>
      <p>For example, you may not be covered if you’re paying for something using an ‘electronic payment system’ like PayPal.</p>
      <p>Many people have a credit card as the main way of paying through these websites. But the credit card companies dispute that the law covers this.</p>
      <h3>Misrepresentation</h3>
      <p>The tricky part about the law is the bit where it says the goods or services being ‘misrepresented’. That’s a pretty broad term and it’s why there are lots of section 75 complaints.</p>
      <p>There is a real grey area when it comes to goods being misrepresented or just not meeting hour expectations.</p>
      <p>For example, complaints about timeshares crop up loads when it comes to section 75. In these cases, it’s really important to explain why you’ve been misled when making a complaint.</p>
      <h3>Buying through third parties</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Most frustrating of all is the dreaded ‘debtor-creditor-supplier’ rule. Of all of the money-related things I have to explain this one is particularly tricky to summarise! Here goes…</p>
      <p>To paraphrase the law, in order to have the protection of section 75 you have to buy direct from the supplier of goods.</p>
      <p>If you go through a third party, you’re not covered as this ‘breaks the chain’. The most common example of this is paying for concert tickets.</p>
      <p>If you buy direct from the venue and spend over £100 then you’re covered. But if you buy through a third-party ticket agency, you’re not.</p>
      <p>In addition, many of the online shops we use don’t actually provide the goods or services themselves.</p>
      <p>So if you use a holiday booking firm to buy a flight and a hotel, you’re not buying direct from the online company.</p>
      <p>This ‘breaks the chain’ and you’re not covered. The simple answer? Use these sites to find the deals you like then buy direct if you can or ask the provider of good or services to match or beat the price.</p>
      <p>Seems simple? Well, what if you buy from a third-party ticket agency that is the appointed ‘seller’ of the tickets for the venue or artist? In theory, you should be covered.</p>
      <p>But in practice, you might not be as it’s still a third party. Yikes.</p>
      <p>The same goes for any form of online shopping that aggregates a list of options from other retailers. In theory, buying from Amazon Marketplace might not be covered (though Amazon has its own complaints process).</p>
      <p>And as I mentioned, using your credit card through money transfer services like PayPal is currently considered to ‘break the chain’ too.</p>
      <p>Finally, there are whole untested areas. Buying through comparison sites is – in theory – also not covered. In practice, the services (insurance, banking, etc) aren’t ones that people are usually able to make section 75 claims about. But the services are diversifying, so watch this space.</p>
      <p>Our tip is to use online sites to compare deals then book direct to ensure you’re covered.</p>
      <h3>Key exceptions to section 75</h3>

        <figcaption>Don't be caught out (Image: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>Goods for 'your benefit':</b> If you buy a flight on your card for yourself, your covered under section 75. If you buy one for your partner, then you aren't.</p>
      <p>This is because the goods must be for 'your benefit'. This leads to all kinds of arguments (some a bit dodgy/saucy) that the items bought for partners bring them pleasure so therefore they're for the cardholder's benefit.</p>
      <p><b>Deposits:</b> If you buy a car for £10,000 but pay a deposit of £100 on your card, your card provider is liable for the full amount in the event of a successful section 75 claim.</p>
      <p>Only the rules aren't clear if the deposit has to be over the £100 minimum payment to qualify or not.</p>
      <p>At the moment, there is no one answer to this one. So one retailer might pay out in full if you've paid a £2 deposit, whereas others might refuse unless you've paid £100 or over.</p>
      <p><b>Timeshares:</b> Some services and goods are ambiguous. For example, if you buy a timeshare, you've technically got what you paid for.</p>
      <p>But what if it's fundamentally not what you were sold (in a different place, not built yet, falling apart?) Loads of complaints of this nature occur each year.</p>
      <p>The problem arises because the law uses the term ‘misrepresented’ to qualify for section 75 protection – and that’s widely open to interpretation.</p>
