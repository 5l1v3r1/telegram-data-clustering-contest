      <p>Australia needed their number two to step up in the wake of Ash Barty’s shock defeat by Kristina Mladenovic, and the Croatia-born 26-year-old duly delivered with a rousing 6-4 7-5 win on debut in front of a baying crowd of 13,841.</p>
      <p>Smashed 6-1 6-1 by Mladenovic in the opening singles on Saturday, a transformed Tomljanovic soaked up huge pressure against the French veteran Parmentier to sustain Australia’s bid for a first Fed Cup title in 45 years.</p>
      <p>Mladenovic had earlier pulled France 2-1 ahead with a brave 2-6 6-4 7-6(1) win over world number one Barty.</p>
      <p>France team captain Julien Benneteau then withdrew Caroline Garcia from the second singles, entrusting Parmentier to seal the final. But it was not to be.</p>
      <p>Garcia was crushed 6-0 6-0 by Barty on Saturday after Tomljanovic endured a similarly torrid 6-1 6-1 loss to Mladenovic in the opening singles.</p>
      <p>Mladenovic’s inspired win over Barty snapped the Australia’s run of 15 consecutive Fed Cup wins.</p>
      <p>“Julien and all the crowd and my team mates, we kept on fighting every single point,” the emotional 26-year-old said courtside.</p>
      <p>“That’s the way I love to play my tennis.</p>
      <p>“Ashleigh’s world number one, she’s just a huge champion. I lost the first set but then it was about details.</p>
      <p>“I just kept believing because I felt I was just out there fighting and giving a hard battle and I’m just so proud how I kept pushing and obviously won at the end.”</p>
      <p>Battling the crowd and one of the cleverest all-court opponents in the game, Mladenovic stumbled on the road to victory as Barty broke back twice in the decisive set.</p>
      <p>But the French number one served up a storm in the tiebreak and collapsed in relief after Barty finally surrendered with a forehand slapped into the net.</p>
