      </p>
      <p>The two ended the final round of the tournament tied at 2-under par 286 leading to a playoff at the par-4 16th, the par-5 17th and the par-4 18th.</p>
      <p>For his achievement in Uganda, Indiza took home Sh153,000 and claimed maximum Road to Magical Kenya Open 2020 ranking points (50) to top the ranking with a total of 240.6 points.</p>
      <p>This marks the fifth time, this season, that a Safari Tour tournament has been won by a different player; marking a departure from last season where Greg Snow dominated the top spot on the podium.</p>
      <p>On his part, Shah recorded his best finish at a Safari Tour tournament; picking up Sh102,000 in prize money and 48 Road to Magical Kenya Open 2020 ranking points to see him rise to 18th place up from 31st in the last round.</p>
      <p>At the 16th, Indiza held par as Shah recorded a double bogey. And so, it was advantage Indiza, At the 17th, Indiza made birdie, extending his lead, while Shah held his nerve for par.</p>
      <p>At the final hole of the playoff, Indiza holed a double bogey, setting up a nervy ending, but was relieved to see Shah record a similar score effectively putting him out of contention.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Indiza had recovered from a disappointing third day to post a round of 1-under par 71. He carded 37 on the first nine; having holed two birdies and having dropped three shots.</p>
      <p>He had a better back nine, holing three birdies and dropping only one shot to card a back nine total of 34.</p>
      <p>On his part, Sujan posted a round of 1-over par 73 – having carded a first nine score of 36 courtesy of a single birdie and a lone bogey; and a back nine score of 37 courtesy of a lone bogey at the 11th and having held par on the rest of the holes.</p>
      <p>The victory marks Indiza’s second Safari Tour Golf Series win; having picked up his maiden victory at the final leg of last season’s tournament at the Karen Country Club.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nyali Golf Club’s Mathew Wahome shot an impressive round of 4-under par 68 – the joint lowest score of the tournament – for a tournament score of 1-under par 287 which was enough to see him clinch third spot.</p>
      <p>Mathew, who only made his professional career debut at the start of this season’s Safari Tour series in Nyali in August, carded a total of 34 on the first nine after holing four birdies and dropping only two shots. On the back nine, he played bogey free; holing two birdies for another 34.</p>
      <p>Kenyan players displayed a strong performance – comprising of 12 of the 20 players and finishing no worse than 15th. Action in the Safari Tour Golf Series resumes in a fortnight at the Great Rift Valley Lodge and Golf Resort from the 23rd to the 27th of November.</p>
