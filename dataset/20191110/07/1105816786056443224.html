      <p><b>SAINT PETERSBURG: </b>Police in Saint Petersburg on Saturday arrested a prominent Russian historian on suspicion of murdering a former student after he was hauled out of a river with a backpack containing a woman’s arms, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Local media in Saint Petersburg reported that university professor Oleg Sokolov was drunk and fell into the river as he tried to dispose of body parts.</p>
      <p>Police reportedly then went to Sokolov’s home where they discovered the decapitated body of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24, with whom he had co-authored a number of works.</p>

      <p>“A 63-year-old man was rescued from the River Moika,” investigators said in statement.</p>
      <p>The arms of a woman were discovered in his backpack, the statement said, adding that the detained man was suspected of murder.</p>
      <p>Investigators did not name the man but police speaking to <i>AFP</i> identified him as Sokolov.</p>
      <p>The historian is the author of books on French statesman and military leader Napoleon Bonaparte and had acted as a historical consultant on several films.</p>
      <p>He received France’s Legion d’Honneur in 2003.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was also a member of France’s Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (ISSEP), but on Saturday the society announced in a statement that he had been stripped of his position on its scientific committee.</p>

      <p>“We learn with horror … the atrocious crime of which Oleg Sokolov is guilty…,” it said.</p>

      <p>ISSEP was founded by Marion Marechal, the niece of Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party and a former deputy of the party.</p>
