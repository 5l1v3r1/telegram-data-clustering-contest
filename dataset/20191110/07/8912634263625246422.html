      <p>DUBAI: Saturday night saw the UK’s Olajide William Olatunji, known as KSI, win out over American entertainer Logan Paul in a much-anticipated boxing match in Los Angeles’ Staples Center.</p>
      <p>After months of trash talk and media hype, England’s KSI won the battle to see who is the king of social media with a split decision six-round victory over Paul.</p>
      <p>The re-match — last year’s bout ended in a draw — ended with the famously antagonistic pair declaring respect for each other, before KSI quashed hopes that he would go for a trilogy of matches, saying “it is done. I’m on to the next thing.”</p>
