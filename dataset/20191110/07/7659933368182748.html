      <p>Former Hezbollah Secretary General Sobhi al-Tufaily attacked Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, accusing him of being the “greatest protector” of corruption in Iraq and Lebanon.<br/><br/>In a video circulated on social media, Tufaily asked: “Isn’t it shameful to accuse those who are complaining of oppression of being agents of foreign countries?”<br/><br/>“Are those killed on the streets agents? You claim to be the leader of Muslims, not just Iranians. Does such a leader accept to kill the hungry and protect the corrupt and the criminals?”<br/><br/>“No less than 250 people were killed and 11,000 wounded. Those who killed them are your gunmen. Your gunmen in Lebanon have also killed us,” continued Tufaily.<br/><br/>“Just yesterday, your gang killed unarmed innocents and burned their tents,” he said of attacks against Iraqi protesters.<br/><br/>On Lebanon, he said: “Thieves have been robbing it since 1972 and your group has been supporting them. They have filled the country with corruption.”<br/><br/>“Does our religion teach us to be dirty, corrupt and murderous thieves?”<br/><br/>“What do you call the money that you have spent in Syria,” Tufaily added.</p>
