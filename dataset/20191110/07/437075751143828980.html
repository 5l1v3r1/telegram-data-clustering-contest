        <b>Boks win: Unity or farce?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modidima Mannya says the idea that rugby is a symbol of unity of new SA is a fallacy as the Springboks emblem continues to represent Afrikaner supremacy.</li>
        <li>Yonela Diko says EFF’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi’s dismissal of progress made since our first win in 1995 offends in the greatest of senses the people who fought for where were are.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>The ugly side of politics</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing is as divisive to the ANC as is elective conferences, where contestations for positions pits comrade against comrade, argues Benzi ka-Soko.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time for the DA to end this hypocrisy</b>
      </p>
      <p>The official opposition cannot win national elections without a great proportion of black votes. Maimane was aware of the need to get black votes, but in the process he lost the white right-wing votes to the FF+, writes Omry Makgoale.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Let’s support good ideas and run with them</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gayle Edmunds argues that instead, while we use the 16 Days of Activism to highlight the enduring desire of men to harm women and children, let’s also support smart ideas that create ways for women to be economically independent and to get access to the services that support them emotionally.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We are on the back foot on digital privacy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Social media platforms collect and use our data in ways that are veiled to us, writes Litha Hermanus.</p>
