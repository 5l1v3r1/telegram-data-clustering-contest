      <p>Britain’s KSI has won his six-round cruiserweight bout against fellow YouTube personality Logan Paul in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The fight at the Staples Centre was won by the Watford man in a split decision – 55-56 57-54 56-55.</p>
      <p>The pair first fought last year in Manchester but a “majority draw” was declared after six rounds.</p>
      <p>“Last time I was scared to fight,” said KSI, whose real name is Olajide Olayinka Williams JJ Olatunji, after the match.</p>
      <blockquote>He couldn’t deal with my jabs<cite>KSI</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“This time I just went in. I just kept going and going.”</p>
      <p>“He couldn’t deal with my jabs. I got him.”</p>
      <p>KSI – who has more than 20 million YouTube subscribers – was earlier forced to clarify comments he made ahead of the highly anticipated match, saying that he did not want to kill Paul.</p>
      <p>The social media star took part in pre-fight banter with Paul at a press conference on Thursday, where he said to his rival: “You’re going to f****** die.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t intend to kill Logan physically tomorrow, I only intend to kill his youtube career and spirit,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>“After this fight, I still want Logan to be alive and well.”</p>
      <p>Paul – who has 19.9 million YouTube subscribers – did not touch gloves with his rival at the end of the match.</p>
      <p>Their bout at Manchester Arena last year sold out to 20,000 fans and drew an audience of 2.5 million live viewers and more than 19 million subsequent views, making it the biggest internet event in history.</p>
      <p>It was also named the most popular white-collar boxing match of all time.</p>
      <p>However, viewers were left dissatisfied with the outcome of the fight.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s fight had been expected to notch one million viewers on London-based pay-per-view service DAZN.</p>
