      <p><b>Amaravati</b>: An argument for Rs 2 resulted in the murder of a young construction worker in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. <br/><br/>According to police, 24-year-old Suvarnaraju, a construction worker, went to a local cycle shop for inflating his cycle tyres late on Saturday evening. After filling, pump owner Pilli Samba Murthy asked for two rupees as charge. Suvarnaraju said he didn't have money and entered into argument with shop owner Samba. He allegedly manhandled Samba for abusing him. <br/><br/>Samba's friend Appa Rao, who was present there, got angry. He picked up an iron rod and hit on Suvarnaraju head indiscriminately till he collapsed bleeding. <br/><br/>Locals rushed Raju to Kakinada government general hospital, where he passed away while undergoing treatment. <br/><br/><br/>The incident happened in Valasapakala village under Kakinada rural block. The police registered a murder case against Appa Rao and Samba, who is being interrogated. <br/><br/>Kakinada rural Sub-inspector Govinda Raju told <i>Mirror </i>that police were on the hunt for Appa Rao, who is absconding.</p>
