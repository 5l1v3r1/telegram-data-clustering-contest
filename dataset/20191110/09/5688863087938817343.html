        <b>Unai Emery maybe the bookmaker’s favourites to be the next manager sacked but the Arsenal board has backed their manager to perform and will wait till the summer to make a decision. The North London giants have had their worst start in over 37 years and currently sit eight points off the top four.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Unai Emery was appointed to help <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/arsenal">Arsenal</a> find their way back into the Champions League, the Spaniard did relatively well in that margin. However, the Gunner’s performances towards the end of last season and their performances since then has caused a few problems for the former PSG boss with many fans and critics calling for his head. Yet despite that, the Athletic has reported that the Arsenal board back their manager 100% and will wait till the summer.</p>
      <p>The report also went on to add that the Spaniard will be in charge of the club after the international break and that he has the total support of the board of directors and executives. Also with Luis Enrique and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/jose_mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> linked as potential replacements, the Athletic revealed that there has been no contact established with any successor and the club are not considering a change of head coach despite the Spaniard's performances.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard does have a three-year deal to his name but reports have indicated that he has a break clause in his deal at the end of the second year. However, with Arsenal on their worst run since the 1982/83 season and the club winless in their last five games, including losses to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/leicester_city">Leicester City</a> and Sheffield United, the noise to sack Emery has grown. But the Athletic added that the board believes that there has been a clear sign of improvement and will stick to their guns.</p>
