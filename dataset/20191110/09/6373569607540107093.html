      <p>Firefighters were called to carry out an "emergency rescue" after a collision left a man trapped in a car.</p>
      <p>Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service received a call from the police at around 1.45am today (Sunday, November 10) to reports that a "car had collided with a wall, trapping the driver" on Ferndale Road in the <a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/all-about/weston-mill">Weston Mill</a> area of<a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/"> Plymouth.</a></p>
      <p>When firefighters arrived on scene it was quickly established that a "snatch rescue" had to be carried out due to the "medical condition of the casualty". A snatch rescue is where "immediate extrication" needs to be carried out.</p>
      <p>Crews from Camels Head and Crownhill were sent to the incident and the man was taken to <a href="http://www.plymouthlive.com/all-about/derriford-hospital">Derriford Hospital.</a></p>
      <p>A fire service spokesperson said: "Crews from Camels Head and Crownhill in Plymouth were mobilised following a request from the police to assist after a car had collided with a wall trapping the driver.</p>
      <p>"Due to the medical condition of the casualty the crew had to carry out an immediate extrication shortly after arriving, alongside ambulance paramedics, whereby they were conveyed to hospital via land ambulance.</p>
      <p>"Once extricated crews made the vehicle and scene safe, before leaving duty of care with the police."</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have been contacted about the collision and we are awaiting further information.</p>
