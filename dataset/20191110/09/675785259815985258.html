      <h1>Brendan Rodgers aims transfer dig at Liverpool ahead of Man City showdown</h1>
      <h2>Brendan Rodgers shipped 151 goals in 123 Premier League matches in charge of Liverpool but has shorn up the defences at Celtic and Leicester - who have only conceded eight goals this season</h2>

      <p>Brendan Rodgers has taken a pot shot at Liverpool's owners for not allowing him to boast a defence to succeed.</p>
      <p>Northern Irish manager Rodgers was the Reds' boss from June 2012 until he was sacked in October 2015 - during which time he led the club to seventh, sixth and second place finishes in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>During his tenure at Anfield, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were known for having a less than solid back line - with 151 goals conceded in 123 Premier League matches in charge.</p>
      <p>Rodgers was seemingly given funds to make defensive signings having splashed £20million on centre back Dejan Lovren, £15m on Mamadou Sakho and Nathaniel Clyne and £9m on keeper Simon Mignolet.</p>

      <p>The former Swansea manager has since turned Celtic and now <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , who have shipped only 16 goals since he took over in February, in solid defensive sides.</p>
      <p>And Rodgers has backed his record and hit out at Reds chiefs for not backing him.</p>
      <p>"I think if you look when I was in Scotland [with Celtic] we had defensive records as well," Rodgers said.</p>
      <p>"At Liverpool of course we were very good going forward, you have to ask did I have the players to defend how we’d want to defend?</p>

      <p>"I think now at Liverpool they obviously invest a lot of money to get those types of players in.</p>
      <p>"Here I’ve got a top-level centre-half in Jonny Evans, a young player in Caglar [Soyuncu] beside him who’s amazing. We’ve got a top European goalkeeper."</p>
      <p>The Foxes are currently second in the Premier League table, but Rodgers has dismissed any thoughts of mounting</p>
      <p>Rodgers said: “I suppose we have thrown a hand grenade right into the middle of the top four.</p>
      <p>“But we're not thinking about the title race. We're thinking about developing a team and improving the players. That is our only focus.</p>
      <p>“Our job is to hope to be in the top four. I said when I came here that it would be great to play European football.</p>
      <p>“Huge credit goes to the players. They are playing with confidence and they are playing with steel.”</p>
