      <h1>Strictly producers 'ditch Michelle Visage from arena tour' in last minute snub</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing's contestants are hitting the road next year for a tour, but some of the cast have been left out</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michelle-visage">Michelle Visage</a> will not appear on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> 's glitzy arena tour next year after reportedly being snubbed by producers.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/strictly-producers-snub-favourite-michelle-20850448">Daily Star Sunday</a> , the contestant, 51, was given the news over email after telly bosses decided they didn't need her.</p>
      <p>A Strictly insider told the publication: "Michelle was approached by the producers working on the tour a while ago."</p>
      <p>"They talked her through the dates and asked if she could be available.</p>
      <p>"But then suddenly she got an email saying she wasn’t needed. The message was short and blunt."</p>
      <p>After the 51-year-old telly star was told she wasn't going to be included on the tour, the source told the publication Michelle was obviously "upset."</p>
      <p>They added: "The tour is a chance for the celebs to cash in on their success on the show.</p>
      <p>"Michelle is going to miss out on all of that."</p>

      <p>The decision is likely to disappoint many Strictly fans as the mother-of-two continues to fight for the Glitterball trophy with partner Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>The judge on RuPaul's Drag Race was the first contestant to reach a lofty score of 39 when she performed the foxtrot on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> .</p>
      <p>In last weekend's show the couple once again flew close to the top of the leaderboard when they netted 34 for their stunning Paso Doble.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictly-come-dancing-week-eight-20848549">last night's show</a> , Michelle and Giovanni danced the American Smooth to I Just Want To Make Love To You by Etta James and received a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>The judges praised the star for her sexy housewife performance.</p>
      <p>Former Strictly champion <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/stacey-dooley-returning-strictly-come-20071928">Stacey Dooley</a> , 32, is making her comeback to the dance floor as she returns as the new host of the live tour.</p>
      <p>Stacey will be joined for 32 shows around the country by many of the celebrities and professional dancers from the current series of the BBC One show.</p>
      <p>The tour will open in Birmingham on January 16, before travelling to Aberdeen, Leeds, Manchester, Dublin, Belfast, Glasgow and Nottingham, before ending at London's O2 Arena on February 9.</p>
