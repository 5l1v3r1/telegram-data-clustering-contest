      <p>Perhaps inspired by the enormous statue of hippo from the ballet scene in Walt Disney's 1940 classic cartoon movie Fantasia, Glee the golden retriever decided to try a few dance moves with a real ballerina in New York's Madison Square Park, a brief walk down Broadway from the bright lights of Times Square.</p>
      <p>While every dog has its day (considerably more than 15 minutes of fame), Glee may not be cut out for Swan Lake. Perhaps she prefers a duck pond instead.</p>
