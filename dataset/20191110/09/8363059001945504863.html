      <h1>Marvel's She-Hulk and Moon Knight Shows Just Landed Their Leaders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:00:22+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Germain Lussier</a></address>
      <p><i>She-Hulk</i> and <i>Moon Knight</i> may be <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/moon-knight-and-she-hulk-are-heading-to-disney-and-all-the-other-marvel-streaming-news-from-d23/">two of the newest shows</a> Marvel Studios announced for Disney+, but the studio has already begun putting together their creative teams.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rick-morty-scribe-write-marvels-she-hulk-1253300">The Hollywood Reporter</a> broke the news that Jessica Gao, who won an Emmy for the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/the-10-most-important-rick-and-morty-episodes-so-far/">“Pickle Rick” episode</a> of <i>Rick and Morty</i>, has been hired to develop and write the <i>She-Hulk</i> show, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rick-morty-scribe-write-marvels-she-hulk-1253300">while Jeremy Slater</a>, best known for <i><a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/hang-onto-your-pea-soup-the-exorcist-may-be-coming-to-t-1754634094">The Exorcist</a></i> and <i>Umbrella Academy</i>, will do the same thing on <i>Moon Knight</i>.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been chasing <i>She-Hulk</i> for SO long. This is the definition of a dream come true,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ChairmanGao/status/1192917519545163776">Gao tweeted</a>, confirming the news.</p>
      <p>Disney+ launches in the U.S. this Tuesday, November 12, and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/disney-uk-launch-date-31st-march/">in the UK at the end of March</a>, but it’ll do so without any Marvel shows. In fact the first one, <i>The Falcon and Winter Soldier</i>, just started shooting in the past few days. It’s <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/everything-we-learned-from-marvels-hall-h-panel/">slated to drop in autumn 2020</a>, followed by <i>WandaVision</i> and <i>Loki</i> in Spring 2021, <i>What If...</i> in summer of 2021, and <i>Hawkeye</i> in autumn 2021.</p>
      <p><i>She-Hulk</i> and <i>Moon Knight</i>, along with <i>Ms. Marvel,</i> are likely to be part of the next phase after that – so, around about 2022. That should give Slater and Gao (<a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/the-ms-marvel-live-action-tv-show-is-a-go-at-disney/">as well as Bisha K. Ali</a>, who is attached to <i>Ms. Marvel</i>) ample time to write what’s tantamount to three or four Marvel Studios movies broken into smaller parts. Projects of that size don’t come fast, cheap or easy, which is why we’re hearing about these hires maybe three years before we see the shows.</p>
      <p>Each of the new hires may also give us a hint at what the shows will hold. Gao’s proficiency with sharp humour suggests the show could potentially have a more meta, fourth-wall-breaking tone like the <i>She-Hulk</i> comics of the past. And Slater’s work (which also includes co-writing the Josh Trank <i>Fantastic Four</i> films) tends to have a more grounded, hard-edged take on fantastic elements, which fits <i>Moon Knight</i> well.</p>
      <p>Really though, that’s just generalisation and guesswork. Not even Slater and Gao really know what exactly these shows will be yet. But we’re obviously very interested to find out.</p>
