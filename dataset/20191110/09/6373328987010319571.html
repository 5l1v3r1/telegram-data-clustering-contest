        <b>The world of YouTube and boxing collided once again this week as KSI took on Logan Paul, though the American lost the match after using an illegal move. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The two vloggers, who have more than 40 million YouTube subscribers between them, first went head to head last summer in Manchester, UK.</p>
      <p>British YouTuber KSI, whose real name is Olajide ‘JJ’ Olatunji, took the win following the majority draw amateur bout, but the pair decided to head back into the ring for a rematch last night, November 9. In the end, however, the result remained the same as KSI won on a split decision.</p>
      <p>
        <b>See how Paul’s brother Jake reacted to the result here:</b>

      <p>The match received main event status on sports subscription service DAZN as the pair drew a huge crowd to the Staples Center in Los Angeles, where the YouTubers were commended for putting on a good show.</p>
      <p>They underwent a six-round cruiserweight bout, but KSI’s win was surrounded in controversy as referee Jack Reiss deducted two points from Paul for holding and hitting KSI while he was down; a move which is illegal.</p>
      <p>The decision made all the difference when it went to the scorecards, with two judges scoring the match 57-54 and 56-55 for KSI while the third had it 56-55 for Paul.</p>

      <p>Logan’s brother, Jake Paul, watched the match from the side of the ring. Following KSI’s win, Jake made it clear he was not happy with the result.</p>
      <p>In footage caught by <i>iFL TV</i>, Jake ranted about how the match was ‘rigged’ as he accused KSI of dining with DAZN chief Joe Markowski the day before the YouTubers stepped into the ring.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Addressing reporters, Jake said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>With that decision, that’s just b*llsh*t.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I’ve been in this sport for a year now and, I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but all this sh*t is f*cking rigged.</blockquote>

        <b>Jake continued:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>You see people wining and dining each other, people at the Staples Center. Who was at the Staples Center last night with KSI? Joe Markowski.<br/><br/>This sport is rigged, that’s for sure.<br/><br/>The short amount of time I’ve been here, I’ve heard multiple stories about people paying stuff off, choosing fights, what time people sign contracts.</blockquote>

      <p>Jake went on to say he wasn’t trying to make excuses for his brother’s loss but that he was ‘just saying’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Behind The Gloves</i>, as per <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/boxing/ksi-vs-logan-paul-result-fight-who-won-jake-paul-reaction-latest-news-highlights-a9196991.html"><i>Independent</i></a>, Jake said the commission should ‘contest the two-point decision’.</p>
      <p>Paul declared his intention to ‘contest the commission’ following his loss, claiming he thought the illegal move was ‘a legitimate knockdown’.</p>
