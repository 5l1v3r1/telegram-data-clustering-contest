      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 10 — PayHalal, the Shariah-compliant payment gateway by Souqa Fintech Sdn Bhd has signed a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Brunei-based Multipro Resources Sdn Bhd (MRSB).</p>
      <p>In a statement, Souqa Fintech chief executive officer, Ja’afar Rihan said PayHalal and MRSB have mutually agreed to form an alliance to tap on each other’s strength.</p>
      <p>PayHalal according to him would provide the necessary Shariah-compliant e-commerce platforms for MRSB and its group of companies to operate their diverse investments.</p>
      <p>These include halal endeavours in the supply chain facilitation, certifications and compliances, financial services, online and offline trade hubs and marketing, as well as marts and convenience stores.</p>
      <p>“We hope to be of assistance to MRSB in providing Shariah-compliant e-commerce platforms and services that will give both businesses and customers, especially but not limited to Muslims, a peace of mind in their everyday dealings.</p>
      <p>“We in turn, also hope to be able to stretch our wings, as the world’s first Shariah-compliant payment gateway, and tap into other markets beyond ASEAN’s consumer base in the foreseeable future,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ja’afar added that this agreement would allow the company to penetrate the ASEAN+3 markets of China, Japan and South Korea. — Bernama</p>
