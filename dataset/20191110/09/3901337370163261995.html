      <p>Orlando Pirates head coach Rhulani Mokwena has explained why he will not call out Ernst Middendorp for the 'thuggish behavior' in the Soweto derby.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/orlando-pirates/rhulani-slams-middendorp-chiefs-after-thuggish-behaviour/667143">Rhulani Slams Middendorp &amp; Chiefs After 'Thuggish Behaviour'</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Following the defeat to Chiefs on Saturday, Mokwena was left fuming in his post-match interview and accused Middendorp of encouraging thuggish behaviour.</p>
      <p>Chiefs did finish the game with 10 men after Erick Mathoho received a red card for an off-the-ball incident with Abel Mabaso late in the second half.</p>
      <p>When asked by SuperSport if he will approach Middendorp on this issue, Mokwena replied, "I mean we have an opposition coach that encourages the players do to such things, it can't be! I've been raised properly as a person, I've been taught to respect my elders, so I leave Middendorp, I think he's old enough to understand that, that sort of behaviour can't be condoned.</p>
      <p>"It spoils the image, I mean it really brings the PSL, football into disrepute.</p>
      <p>"The whole time he's encouraging his players to do some of these things. It can't happen. It's not right."</p>
