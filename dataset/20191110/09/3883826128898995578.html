        <b>A Conservative election candidate has stepped down over historic social media posts about a Labour MP and Colonel Gaddafi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Antony Calvert, who was standing to be MP for Wakefield, also made comments about food poverty, as reported by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/conservative-candidate-for-wakefield-quits-over-comments-ridiculing-feminism-and-food-banks-v9bkc79fd">the Sunday Times</a>.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old said the Facebook posts were more than 10 years old.</p>
      <p>Mr Calvert said his comments were "certainly not intended to cause any offence".</p>
      <p>In one post, Mr Calvert is said to have written that if former Libyan dictator Gaddaffi wanted to walk the streets unrecognised "he should surely have fled to Bradford".</p>
      <p>He is also accused of criticising the appearance of Mary Creagh - who has been Wakefield's MP since 2005.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Mr Calvert said: "Over the last 24 hours a number of very historic posts from my personal Facebook timeline have featured in the news media.</p>
      <p>"While I would prefer to stand and fight the assertions, these comments represent neither my views nor those of the Conservative Party."</p>

      <p>Mr Calvert's decision to stand down came days after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50341292">Tory candidate Nick Conrad</a> stood down for historic comments in which he said women should "keep their knickers on" in a conversation about rape.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50344324">Labour candidate Gideon Bull resigned</a> in Clacton, Essex, after it emerged he had used the word "Shylock" during a private meeting.</p>
