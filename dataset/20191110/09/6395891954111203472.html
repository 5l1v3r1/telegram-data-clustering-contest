      <p><b>HONG KONGÂ (AP)</b> - Protesters smashed windows in a subway station and a shopping mall Sunday and police made arrests in areas across Hong Kong amid anger over a demonstrator's death and the arrest of pro-democracy lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is in the sixth month of protests that began in June over a proposed extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances. Activists complain the government is eroding the autonomy and Western-style civil liberties promised when this former British colony returned to China in 1997.</p>
      <p>Authorities closed the subway stop in the Sha Tin district in the northeast after protesters broke windows and damaged a ticket machine. Reporters saw police arrest three men at a residential complex elsewhere in Sha Tin but the reason wasn't clear.</p>
      <p>In Tuen Mun in the northwest, about three dozen people dressed in black, the symbolic color of the protests, stormed through the Citywalk shopping mall. Most were peaceful but one used a club to smash windows while others overturned tables in a restaurant. Spectators on the street outside shouted "Cockroaches!" at police.</p>
      <p>In Tsuen Wan in the west, police fired tear gas and took away four men and one woman suspected of vandalizing shops, the newspaper Apple Daily reported.</p>
      <p>Inside the Festival Walk shopping mall in Kowloon Tong, reporters saw a man lying on a public walkway beside a small pool of blood with police standing over him. His condition and the reason for possible injuries were unclear.</p>
      <p>There were brief shoving matches between police and shoppers, some of whom thrust their fists into the air in a gesture of defiance. Police pointed cans of pepper spray at spectators and reporters.</p>
      <p>Activists are demanding the resignation of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam.</p>
      <p>The protests have added to downward pressure on Hong Kong's economy. It already was struggling with declining global economic growth and the U.S.-Chinese tariff war.</p>
      <p>The territory of 7.5 million people tumbled into its first recession since the global financial crisis after economic activity shrank 3.2% in the quarter ending in September.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, police announced the arrest of six lawmakers on charges of obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the extradition bill. All were freed on bail.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, protesters mourned the death Friday of a university student, Chow Tsz-Lok, who fell from a parking garage when police fired tear gas at protesters.</p>
      <p>The circumstances of the death are unclear, but many accuse police of using heavy-handed tactics, including widespread use of tear gas and pepper spray. Police denied pushing the 22-year-old student during last Monday's incident or delaying emergency treatment.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is preparing for district council elections Nov. 24 that are viewed as a measure of public sentiment toward the government.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy lawmakers accuse the government of trying to provoke violence to justify canceling or postponing the elections.</p>
      <p>Violence erupted late Friday when protesters took to the streets following memorial events for the student in multiple locations.</p>
      <p>There have been only a few fatalities during the unrest, including some reported deaths by suicide and a man who fell to his death while hanging pro-democracy banners on a building.</p>
      <p>More than 3,300 people have been arrested since the start of the protest movement.</p>
