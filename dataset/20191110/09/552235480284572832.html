      <h1>Niklas Dorsch 'a Celtic transfer target' as Neil Lennon eyes former Bayern Munich youth</h1>
      <h2>The Germany U-21 international currently plays with Heidenheim in the country's second tier.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:22:56+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic are reportedly interested in a January move for former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bayern-munich">Bayern Munich</a> youth Niklas Dorsch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> hopes to use the carrot of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> knockout football to lure new recruits to Parkhead in the New Year.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/09/old-firm-turn-focus-title-new-faces-asneil-lennon-steven-gerrard/">The Telegraph</a> , the Hoops are considering a bid for the Heidenheim star.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old spent two years with Bayern, making one senior appearance before leaving on a free in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Germany U-21 international's contract with the 2. Bundesliga side runs until June 2021 but Lennon could seek to make him his first January signing.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss insists the club are in a strong position as the winter window approaches.</p>

      <p>He said: “I think we’re quite relaxed about things.</p>
      <p>“We now have European football after Christmas and there is already an opportunity for the team to win a trophy.</p>
      <p>“The players are full of belief and playing well, and it’s very rare that clubs spend big money in January.</p>
      <p>“But we’re in a good position to fend off any offers for our players we want to keep anyway.</p>
      <p>“So, without tempting fate, we can move into January in a very strong position.</p>
      <p>"The early qualification is excellent for the club.</p>
      <p>“For one thing, it takes away the anxiety of playing on Thursdays and Sundays.</p>
      <p>“While we still want to finish on top of the group, there won’t be the same stress levels in the European ties and we can rotate a bit more.</p>
      <p>“When you look at us having nine fixtures in December, that will help. We need to balance that.</p>
      <p>“But in terms of signing players in January, us being in the knockout stage is a huge carrot for players.”</p>
