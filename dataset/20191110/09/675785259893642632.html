      <h1>Jermaine Jenas predicts Liverpool vs Man City and effect result will have on title race</h1>
      <h2>The BT Sport and Match of the Day pundit identified a key factor which could play a part in the outcome</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jermaine-jenas">Jermaine Jenas</a> thinks <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> will have enough to beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on their own patch on Sunday to crank the pressure up on the league leaders.</p>
      <p>The Reds go into the clash six points ahead of the defending champions as they welcome City to Anfield.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men are yet to lose in the Premier League so far this season, as they chase their first title in 30 years.</p>
      <p>But it took two late goals for Liverpool to squeeze past Aston Villa last week, and Jenas feels they may have ran out of luck for the visit of Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>"They've answered all the questions with these late goals so far," Jenas said. "But how many of those can they keep getting through?"</p>

      <p>Liverpool's season has been rocked by an injury to regular starter Joel Matip, who has been ruled out for several weeks, and Jenas feels that could prove pivotal.</p>
      <p>"The [Aymeric] Laporte injury was big, it was huge. Matip now I think is just as bad for Liverpool as Laporte was for City; which is why Liverpool are starting to leak more goals.</p>
      <p>"I think City will beat them this weekend, then the dynamic completely changes."</p>

      <p>Asked how such a result could shape the rest of the season, Jenas added: "It's just how they react to it, how they respond.</p>
      <p>"Getting beat, going into an international break, and then how that sits, how they deal with the pressure."</p>
      <p>A win would see City pull within touching distance of Liverpool in similar fashion to how they began to claw back a seven-point deficit with victory over the Reds at the Etihad in January of last season.</p>

      <p>But Jenas feels this campaign will not have the same outcome.</p>
      <p>"I've been Liverpool most of the way, since the start of the season. Something tells me that Liverpool are going to do it this year.</p>
      <p>"I do think they will have enough to get over the line."</p>
