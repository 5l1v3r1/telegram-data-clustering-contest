      <p>Hongqi will initially carter to wealthy Chinese buyers, who traditionally aspire to own Rolls-Royce, with its new flagship model.</p>
      <p>Rolls-Royce could soon come under pressure at the top end of the luxury market from a little-known Chinese brand.</p>
      <p>Domestic market-focused carmaker Hongqi, which in <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/ex-rolls-royce-design-director-now-part-of-china-faw-group-409629"><b>2018 poached Rolls-Royce design chief Giles Taylor</b></a>, is planning an attack on the pinnacle of luxury motoring that will eventually go global.</p>
      <p>As part of the FAW Group, one of China’s biggest car manufacturers, Hongqi aims to achieve this by leveraging a rich cultural and historical heritage that includes making official government limousines, like the popular L5 (above).</p>
      <p>Now settled into his role as global vice-president of design and chief creative officer in Munich, Taylor told our sister publication, Autocar UK, of plans to build a flagship luxury car that would target affluent Chinese buyers who would traditionally aspire to own a Rolls-Royce. “We’re picking up young customers with extreme wealth – they want to buy Chinese,” said Taylor of the Hongqi brand, which was revived last year.</p>
      <p>But, Taylor insists, rather than cloning Rolls-Royce, any Hongqi flagship designed under his stewardship will have its own distinct identity.</p>
      <p>“We have to find a new Chinese, innovative and digital way of crafting new Hongqi vehicles that stand alone,” he said, so they cannot be “accused of being a copy of Rolls-Royce. We’re not going to do that.”</p>
      <p>Taylor cited Chinese culture as the inspiration for a new brand identity, and confidently added that Hongqi “will become the number-one luxury brand in China”.</p>
      <p>He added: “I think there’s a richness in the Chinese culture, whether it’s through ancient sculpture, fashion, calligraphy – there’s a rich mine to tap into to bring not just a Western answer, but a Chinese answer.”</p>
      <p>While design DNA is key, Taylor also sees innovation as a strength of Chinese brands and recognises an appetite for it.</p>
      <p>“I see China as far more thirsty for innovation,” he said. “If you look at the customers… they expect innovations, but also design innovations.”</p>
      <p>Taylor believes that, rather than undercut Rolls-Royce on price, a new Hongqi limousine could challenge the British brand on content and innovation – and come with a suitably hefty price tag.</p>
      <p>He said: “I come back to the artistic culture of China. We’ll use those crafted traditions in a way that will be beautiful and elegant and attract people in their own ways.”</p>
      <p>Taylor acknowledges that competing in the luxury space will be a tall order in markets such as Europe and the Middle East where premium brands are long established.</p>
      <p>“To bring the Chinese ‘Rolls-Royce’ out of China will always be a challenge because the 114-year brand legacy of Rolls-Royce has been cultivated and crafted and enhanced decade on decade,” said Taylor.</p>
      <p>“We need to work out a way of carefully crafting its brand persona and platform outside of China, and that will take time.” Taylor nevertheless believes that the opportunity is enormous. He concluded: “With Hongqi, we’re starting somewhere fresher. But in many ways, sometimes the shackles of heritage are constraining. So there are positives and negatives in bringing a new luxury brand out of China.”</p>
