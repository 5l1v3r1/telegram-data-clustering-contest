        <b>Goa Cricket Association(GCA) secretary Vipul Phadke has revealed that they have sent in a letter to the BCCI seeking approval to replace arrested cricketer CM Gautam. Meanwhile, the Cricket Association of Mizoram(CAM) has also written to the board asking them to allow a replacement for Abrar Kazi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amidst the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Goa and Mizoram found themselves in trouble with seasoned cricketers Gautama and Kazi in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) corruption scandal. Both the Goa board and the CAM have written to the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> seeking approval to replace the arrested cricketers Abar Kazi and CM Gautam, both allegedly involved in KPL spot-fixing case. Meanwhile, the CAM are already considering a few all-rounders for Kazi’s spot. </p>
      <p>“The association has terminated his (Kazi’s) contract already and a letter has been sent to the board seeking its permission for a replacement,” unveiled a top CAM official.</p>
      <p>The Goa Cricket Association have already terminated Gautam's contract as soon as the news of his arrest came out and named Darshan Mishal as the new captain for the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy.</p>
      <p>“We have written to the board seeking approval for replacement. We are waiting to hear from them,” Vipul Phadke was quoted as saying by Sportstar.</p>
      <p>It has been confirmed by BCCI officials, according to Sportstar, that BCCI secretary Jay Shah will have a final take on the letters received from the GCA and CAM. </p>
      <p>"Since it's a special case, the decision has to come from the secretary and there should be clarity on the matter in the next few days," the official revealed.</p>
