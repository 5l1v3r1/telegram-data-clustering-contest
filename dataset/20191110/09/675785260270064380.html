      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T09:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Fowler, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robbie-fowler/</a></address>
      <p>It's insane that I played in the last Manchester City team to win at Anfield. No - make that surreal.</p>
      <p>When you consider the teams they’ve had in the meantime - and the money spent on them - it’s almost criminal.</p>
      <p>I only stumbled on that stat this week (in the Mirror). I had no idea the last win was in 2003, so I was curious about the game, and the teams who played that day.</p>
      <p>It may surprise you to know, but us footballers as a rule don’t tend to have photographic recall of every game we’ve played. I remember we won, I remember Nico Anelka scored a couple, and…well, that’s about it.</p>
      <p>I didn’t even remember that I had a hand in the winner in stoppage time. I couldn’t have told you the line-ups until I checked. When I did, what struck me was how far both teams have progressed since.</p>

      <p>Okay, you may expect that of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">City</a> , because it was before the money was spent. We had a decent enough side, though I admit me and Nico never, ever clicked together, so even up front where we had international quality it didn’t quite work.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> had some great players then, but as a team absolutely a million miles away from this one now. And I think that’s the key feature of the game this weekend. Liverpool aren’t just a proper team, they’re a frightening one.</p>
      <p>Both teams are, obviously. If you’d said to me back then City would be the most feared team in the world, I’d have laughed at you, but that’s where they are. Liverpool aren’t far behind, though.</p>
      <p>They’re relentless. It’s like that Duracell bunny. Look at the game last weekend - I reckon they won in the end because they just wore Villa out, exhausted physically and mentally.</p>

      <p>I think that’s the biggest difference - not only between 2003 and now, but even the last couple of years and now. The late goals they score, it’s not luck, it’s a sign of brilliance.</p>
      <p>We’ve witnessed it in the past with the great Liverpool sides, with Manchester United and Chelsea, and City themselves. Watching Klopp’s over the past year I’d say they’re now close to that bracket - but they do have one big problem…</p>
      <p>It’s Manchester City. Their biggest problem is not anything within the team, but being around at the same time as City.</p>
      <p>Yet I’m tempted to say now, that this season City have a problem too, and that’s Liverpool. Maybe that’s why Pep Guardiola seems to be a little bit obsessed with them right now.</p>

      <p>I use the word advisedly though, because too much is being made of it. Look, people obsess about Liverpool, as as much as city as a football team. We’re not a city apart, but there is something about it that stands out, makes people love it and hate it.</p>
      <p>Guardiola knows he has a proper rival, the Real Madrid now to his Barcelona. But I think there’s been a lot of rubbish talked about his obsession. Liverpool are top, ripping it up, so what are you going to ask City’s manager about? Liverpool, obviously.</p>
      <p>He’s asked all the time. If he answers, they’re in his head. If not, he's disrespectful. Are they in his head? A little bit. But if United would be top, it would be them. That’s the nature of football - you’re always defined by your closest rivals.</p>
      <p>This could be one of the great rivalries, like United and Arsenal in the 90s and early 2000s. We should enjoy it while we can.</p>
