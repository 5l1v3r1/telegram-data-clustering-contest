      <p>Protesters in Hong Kong have smashed windows in a subway station and a shopping centre following the arrest of pro-democracy politicians.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong is in the sixth month of protests that began over a proposed China extradition law and have expanded to include demands for greater democracy and other grievances.</p>
      <p>Authorities closed the subway stop in the north-eastern district of Sha Tin after protesters broke windows and damaged a ticket machine. Police in riot gear stood guard but there was no indication of arrests.</p>
      <p>In a separate incident, about three dozen protesters stormed through a shopping centre in the north-western district of Tsuen Mun. Most were peaceful but one protester used a club to smash windows while others overturned tables in a restaurant.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the newspaper Apple Daily showed video on its website of police in riot gear arresting a man in the western district Tsuen Wan. The newspaper said police took away four men and one woman suspected of vandalising shops.</p>
      <p>Activists complain that the government of Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Beijing are eroding the autonomy and Western-style civil liberties promised to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to China in 1997.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, police announced the arrest of the six politicians on charges of obstructing the local assembly during a raucous May 11 meeting over the extradition bill. All were freed on bail.</p>
      <p>The arrests were made a day after protesters mourned the death of a university student who fell from a car park when police fired tear gas at protesters.</p>

      <p>The circumstances of the death are unclear, but many accuse police of using heavy-handed tactics, including widespread use of tear gas and pepper spray. Police denied pushing the student during the incident on Monday or delaying emergency treatment.</p>
      <p>The territory is preparing for elections on November 24 that are viewed as a measure of public sentiment towards the government.</p>
      <p>Pro-democracy politicians criticised the government clampdown as an attempt to provoke violence following the student’s death to justify cancelling or postponing the elections.</p>
      <p>Violence erupted late Friday when protesters took to the streets following memorial events in multiple locations to mark the student’s death.</p>
      <p>More than 3,300 people have been arrested since the start of the protest movement.</p>
