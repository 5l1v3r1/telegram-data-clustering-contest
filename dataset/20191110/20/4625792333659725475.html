      <h1>Giuliani may have identified secret friend 'Charles' with accidental text</h1>

      <p>Another accidental message sent to a reporter may have revealed the identity of Rudy Giuliani’s unknown friend “Charles.”</p>
      <p>In late October, Giuliani, 75, butt-dialed an NBC reporter and left <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-butt-dials-nbc-reporter-while-talking-about-money-problems-and-biden"><u>a three-minute voicemail</u></a> in which he could be overheard talking to another man about a pending fraud case. Giuliani was overheard <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/rudy-giuliani-butt-dials-nbc-reporter-heard-discussing-need-cash-n1071901"><u>saying</u></a>, "You know Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence."</p>
      <p>The comment was made at the beginning of the recording, and without additional context, it was unclear who Charles was. A <u><a href="https://www.salon.com/2019/11/10/who-is-rudy-giulianis-friend-charles-an-accidental-text-may-have-outed-his-identity/">report</a></u> from Salon, however, found that Charles Gucciardo may be the individual Giuliani was referring too.</p>
      <p>The Salon reporter was tipped off to Giuliani’s ties to Gucciardo after being sent an accidental text message from Giuliani that included what appeared to be an eight-character password.</p>
      <p>The reporter returned Giuliani’s message to notify him that he had accidentally sent the password to the wrong contact. Shortly after, the reporter received a call back from someone named Christianné Allen.</p>
      <p>Allen, 20, was a Liberty University communications student hired by Giuliani to handle his messaging. Given that it’s unusual for someone with as much status as Giuliani to hire a 20-year-old to run his communications effort, the reporter tried to figure out how the two may have met.</p>
      <p>When digging through Allen’s social media, the reporter found that she had worked for Gucciardo Law, a personal injury firm owned by Gucciardo. Other social media posts revealed that the two had met when Allen was at a high school conference with Gucciardo’s son.</p>
      <p>Gucciardo was recently featured in a <i>New York Times</i> report because he gave $500,000 to a company called Fraud Guarantees, which was run by Giuliani’s clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Parnas and Fruman were <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/authorities-arrest-pair-who-helped-giuliani-in-ukraine-sleuthing"><u>recently arrested trying to fly</u></a> to Vienna, a common connection point for flights to Ukraine, for illegal campaign contributions.</p>
      <p>When Gucciardo cut the checks to Fraud Guarantees, the company had no prior clients or customers. In his accidental voicemail, Giuliani claimed that “Charles” had a “hard time with a fraud case 'cause he didn't do any due diligence.”</p>
      <p>Giuliani’s accidental text that prompted Allen to reach out to the reporter led him to be tied to Gucciardo via his 20-year-old assistant, although the identity of “Charles” has yet to be confirmed.</p>
