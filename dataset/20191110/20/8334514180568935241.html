      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Neither the right nor the left was likely to win a clear majority in Spain’s repeat parliamentary election on Sunday, according to an early tally of results released by the interior ministry with just over 20% of votes counted.</p>
      <p>Further political stalemate appeared likely as votes scattered between mainstream and outlier parties.</p>
      <p>The early count does not necessarily reflect the final outcome as it comes primarily from small towns.</p>
      <p>As this stage, the far-right Vox emerged as the third most voted party, a huge jump from the last election in April, which then marked the first time a far-right party won seats in Spain in over four decades.</p>
      <p>The Socialists of acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez led with about 29%, followed by the conservative People’s Party, pegged at around 20%. Centre-right Ciudadanos were seen winning 5.5%. Far-left Unidas Podemos fetched 10% so far in the election.</p>
