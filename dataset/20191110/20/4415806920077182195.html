      <p>An endurance athlete from Dorset has become the first person to run a marathon in every country in the world after completing a 26.2 mile run in Athens.</p>
      <p>Nick Butter set off on his mission to run the famous distance in all 196 United Nations-recognised countries on January 6, 2018, finishing with the Athens Classic Marathon on November 10, 2019.</p>
      <p>The 22-month challenge was inspired by Kevin Webber, a fellow runner who Mr Butter describes as having had “a huge impact on me and how I live my life” after the pair met during a race in the Sahara Desert.</p>
      <p>Mr Webber was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014, and according to Mr Butter was told he could have just two years to live.</p>
      <p>Five years later, Mr Webber joined his ultra runner friend, who has used the marathon challenge to raise money for Prostate Cancer UK, at the 196th finish line.</p>

      <p>“The feeling of crossing that finish line was like many other finish lines, in the sense that I’m tired and I want a drink and want to be go bed,” Mr Butter said after his final marathon.</p>
      <p>“The elation of finishing that run with Kevin and everyone else behind me was just so amazing. I wasn’t really sure what I was going to feel like when I finished.</p>
      <p>“I feel a bit numb, I’m not really sure what’s going to happen next and I am so, so ready to chat with Kev and have a proper conversation about everything that’s happened in the last few years because we haven’t had time to catch up.”</p>
      <p>Mr Butter also thanked supporters, including his mother and father who organised his flight bookings for him.</p>
      <p>So far he has raised more than £65,000 of his £250,000 target for Prostate Cancer UK.</p>
