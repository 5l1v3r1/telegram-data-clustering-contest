      <p>PHOENIX – Ten more bodies were discovered <a href="http://bit.ly/2K8dsjs">buried in Rocky Point</a>, the Attorney General’s Office in the Mexican state of Sonora announced Saturday. The discovery brings the total number of human remains recently uncovered in the area to 58.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2019/10/27/mass-grave-mexican-mothers-rocky-point-sonora/2478925001/">Forty-two bodies were initially discovered in a mass grave</a> near the beach resort town approximately 200 miles from Phoenix. Last weekend, the group Searching Mothers of Sonora said <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/11/04/armed-men-scare-off-mothers-searching-bodies-near-rocky-point/4158550002/">it discovered six additional bodies</a> and that <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/11/04/armed-men-scare-off-mothers-searching-bodies-near-rocky-point/4158550002/">armed men forced them to abandon their search</a>.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, experts from the attorney general’s Scientific Forensic Intelligence Lab, accompanied by staff from the Mexican Association for Clinical Research, completed the excavations in five graves.</p>
      <p>The 10 newly discovered sets of human remains appear to be complete bodies.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 18 autopsies that have been conducted so far have been processed by an anthropologist working with the National Commission for the Search of Missing Persons. <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/11/02/1-body-returned-and-18-autopsies-completed-rocky-point-mass-grave-site-puerto-penasco-mexico/4146059002/">One body has been returned to family members</a>, according to the state.</p>

      <p>Lupita Orduño, spokeswoman for the Sonora Attorney General's Office, has previously said it was too early to come up with theories on why the bodies were buried in a mass grave because they first had to determine how they died or were killed.</p>
      <p>Anyone who believes a family member of theirs is among the dead may make a complaint and <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/10/29/families-puerto-penasco-share-dna-identify-bodies-mass-grave/2501079001/">complete a DNA test</a> at one of the Attorney General’s Departments of Expert Services. These are located in the towns of San Luis Rio Colorado, Caborca, Nogales, Agua Prieta, Hermosillo, Guaymas, Ciudad Obregón and Navojoa.</p>
      <p>Residents of other towns who are interested in this process should contact the Sonora Attorney General’s Agency of Public Ministry. </p>
      <p>It is crucial for families to present official identification and at least two direct family members, such as parents, children or siblings.</p>
      <p>The Sonora state attorney general is able to continue its work thanks to the support of high-profile medical and criminal experts, as well as groups like <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2019/10/25/mass-grave-13-bodies-found-near-rocky-point-puerto-penasco/2455865001/">the Searching Mothers of Sonora</a>, “women who have turned their pain into strength to recover their ‘treasures,'” the office wrote in a statement.</p>
