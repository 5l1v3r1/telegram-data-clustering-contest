      <h1>Yelling at dogs leaves them scared for the long-term, study reveals</h1>

      <p>Even treats aren’t as much fun for traumatized <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/pets">pups</a>.</p>
      <p>A heartbreaking new study finds that screaming at dogs scares them for the long-term — and patience is a far superior method for training them, <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-dog-is-a-precious-angel-and-you-should-never-yell-at-her">Science Alert reports</a>.</p>

      <p>Researchers — led by biologist Ana Catarina Vieira de Castro of the Universidade do Porto in Portugal — recruited 42 dogs from schools that used reward-based training, and 50 dogs from aversion training schools.</p>
      <p>During the study period, pups taught with yelling and leash-jerking were found to be more stressed, with higher levels of cortisol found in their saliva.</p>
      <p>“Our results show that companion dogs trained using aversive-based methods experienced poorer welfare as compared to companion dogs trained using reward-based methods, at both the short- and the long-term level,” the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/823427v1">researchers write</a> in the paper published by biology news service bioRxiv.</p>

      <p>“Specifically, dogs attending schools using aversive-based methods displayed more stress-related behaviors and body postures during training, higher elevations in cortisol levels after training, and were more ‘pessimistic’ in a cognitive bias task,” researchers found.</p>
      <p>Pups that experienced calm, gentle teachers, however, performed better at tasks researchers assigned to them, such as locating a bowl with sausage in it — in a roomful of empty-but-sausage-smeared bowls.</p>

      <p>More harshly trained canines were slower to locate the treat bowl, which authors interpreted to show that their experiences had made them more depressed, less hopeful hounds.</p>
      <p>The biologists also analyzed dogs during training to look for “stress behaviors” such as lip-licking, paw-raising, yawning and yelping.</p>

      <p>“Critically, our study points to the fact that the welfare of companion dogs trained with aversive-based methods appears to be at risk,” the researchers conclude.</p>
