        <b>The army chief in Bolivia has urged President Evo Morales to step down amid protests stemming from his disputed re-election last month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The call comes hours after Mr Morales agreed to call a new election after international monitors called for the result to be annulled.</p>
      <p>The Organization of American States (OAS), which monitored the elections, found "clear manipulation".</p>
      <p>Mr Morales has denied wrongdoing and previous calls to resign.</p>
      <p>General Williams Kaliman told reporters on Sunday: "After analysing the conflicted domestic situation, we ask the president to resign his presidential mandate to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability, for the good of our Bolivia."</p>
      <p>He added that the military had ordered "operations in the air and on land to neutralise armed groups acting outside the law".</p>

      <p>Opposition leader Carlos Mesa - who came second in last month's poll - had also urged Mr Morales and his vice-president to rule themselves out of the new election.</p>
      <p>Nor should they preside over the electoral process, he said.</p>
      <p>"If you have an iota of patriotism, you should step aside," Mr Mesa said at a news conference.</p>
      <p>Mr Morales had already come under increased pressure on Sunday, with several political allies resigning, some citing fears for the safety of their families.</p>
      <h3>What did the OAS say?</h3>
      <p>In its preliminary report on Sunday, the OAS said it had found "clear manipulations" of Bolivia's voting system and it could not verify the result of the 20 October race.</p>

      <p>During the audit, it said it found physical records with alterations and forged signatures, and evidence of wide-scale data manipulation.</p>
      <p>The international body concluded it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the 10% margin required for a victory. It recommended that a new electoral commission be set up before a fresh election could take place.</p>
      <h3>How did Mr Morales respond?</h3>
      <p>The president was first elected in 2006.</p>
      <p>In his announcement on Sunday, he said the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TES) would be overhauled before the poll, with parliament choosing its members.</p>
      <p>Bolivia's attorney general has now ordered an investigation into the conduct of TES members.</p>
      <p>Mr Morales, who is Bolivia's first indigenous president, told reporters that he had made the decision "to reduce all tension".</p>
