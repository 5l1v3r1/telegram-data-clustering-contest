      <h1>Britain should be prouder of Lewis Hamilton - he is one of our greatest ever sportsmen</h1>
      <h2>SAM QUEK COLUMN: Despite his latest F1 world title win, Lewis Hamilton continues to be under-appreciated in his home country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:42:50+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Quek</a></address>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton was recently crowned Formula 1 champion for the sixth time and is one of this country’s greatest ever sportsmen.</p>
      <p>But is the Mercedes racer under-appreciated? Under celebrated? Even disliked? And, if so, why?</p>
      <p>Hamilton is brilliant. Developed from a young age, he was always a motorsport champion in the making and is fulfilling that promise to be one of Formula 1’s greatest ever.</p>
      <p>Yet, in winning his six world championship, there didn’t seem to be the outpouring of celebration that you might expect in Britain.</p>
      <p>Piers Morgan took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to complain that Alastair Cook has already been knighted, whereas Hamilton had only yet received an MBE.</p>

      <p>Morgan, no fan of Cook, made the point that Hamilton’s achievements were far more impressive.</p>
      <p>I would argue that that point doesn’t even hold within cricket. James Anderson’s achievements easily match Cook’s and he is also yet to be knighted. Timing can be everything with the Queen’s honours list.</p>
      <p>However, the truth is that Hamilton is under-appreciated and that’s because the public don’t see him as ‘British’ enough. The public just don’t connect with him in the same way they do with other sporting stars.</p>
      <p>Hamilton is flash and more likely to be seen at Paris Fashion Week than doing a feature on Football Focus about his support of his local football team.</p>

      <p>Unfairly, I may add, Hamilton is perceived as more ‘International’ than ‘British’. He has also said one or two things in the media that have drawn criticism and that hasn’t helped; but which sporting star hasn’t said something at some point that has annoyed everyone?!</p>
      <p>I think Hamilton is treated a little unfairly, but this won’t last forever. There have been many other stars who have taken longer to get the public’s full appreciation.</p>
      <p>Lennox Lewis, due to his Canadian accent, had a similar challenge but he was eventually given the right level of praise he deserved. Once upon a time, Andy Murray wasn’t even that popular!</p>
      <p>It will come to Hamilton in good time. His PR people will need to play their part in this as well and some well-placed roles in Sport Relief never harmed David Beckham!</p>
      <p>Lewis Hamilton is someone that Britain should be enormously proud of. He is a credit to his sport and an incredible talent.</p>
      <p>When he is said and done with his driving career, his achievements will take an awful long time to be beaten by another British driver. Let’s fully appreciate him but he need not worry, it will come to him eventually.</p>
