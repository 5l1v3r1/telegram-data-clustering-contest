      <p>Strictly star Mike Bushell has finally got the boot from the show after surviving three dance-offs.</p>
      <p>The BBC sports presenter and his partner Katya Jones saw off competition from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/watch-coronation-streets-catherine-tyldesley-20738528">Catherine Tyldesley</a> , Viscountess Weymouth and David James in the head-to-head deciding dances in previous weeks.</p>
      <p>But this time, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> judges opted to save Michelle Visage and her partner Giovanni Pernice, who danced an American smooth.</p>
      <p>Bushell, 53, failed to impress with his paso doble on Saturday night, with Bruno Tonioli saying he "felt something" following the matador-inspired routine, before adding: "It was indigestion."</p>
      <p>Despite his exit, Bushell said he was "not going to stop dancing", adding that the experience has "changed me completely".</p>
      <p>"I have lost a stone-and-a-half. I'm a guy in his 50s, I'm mentally sharper, I feel able to deal with pressured situations thanks to the dance-offs!," he said.</p>

      <p>He added: "I didn't think I'd get this far so I have already booked a hotel in Blackpool for next weekend's show, so I'm still coming along."</p>
      <p>The BBC Breakfast sports host praised "amazing teacher" Jones for making "you believe that anything is possible" and for performing "miracles".</p>
      <p>Jones said her partner "can leave with your head held up" adding: "I'm so sorry I couldn't take you to Blackpool."</p>
      <p>Judges opted to save RuPaul's Drag Race judge Visage but Bushell was also praised for "putting up a very good fight".</p>
      <p>Anneka Rice, James Cracknell and Dev Griffin have also been voted off the BBC One show, while Will Bayley had to withdraw following an injury.</p>
      <p>Bushell and Jones will appear on Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two with Rylan Clark-Neal on Monday at 6.30pm on BBC Two.</p>
