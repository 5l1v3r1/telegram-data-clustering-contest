      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Two Massachusetts teens have been arrested for stealing a car and taking police on a dangerous car chase.</p>
      <p>Police in Worcester say the two 17-year old males were driving a car without headlights on Saturday evening when an officer spotted them.</p>
      <p>After running the license plate, the officer determined the vehicle was stolen and turned on his emergency lights and siren.</p>
      <p>The driver fled. Police say he weaved through oncoming traffic, ran red lights and stop signs and crashed into two pursuing police cruisers before eventually striking a parked car.</p>
      <p>The driver faces assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, resisting arrest, receiving a stolen motor vehicle and multiple reckless driving charges.</p>
      <p>The passenger also faces criminal charges. The two haven't been identified because they're juveniles.</p>
