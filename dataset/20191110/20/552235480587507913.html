      <h1>Cumnock looking for new manager after Paul Burns resigns</h1>
      <h2>The former Queen of the South midfielder quit after a disappointing start to the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:57:09+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-junior-football-association">Cumnock</a> are looking for a new manager after Paul Burns resigned today.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old called it quits following yesterday's 3-2 defeat at West Region League One Girvan in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.</p>
      <p>Burns had been in charge of his hometown club for just under a year and was still a regular in the matchday squad.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, the former Queen of the South midfielder has been unable to turn around the fortunes of 'Nock who lie in 12th place in the West Region Premiership.</p>
      <p>A club statement issued this afternoon read: "The club have accepted the resignation of manager Paul Burns.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We would like to thank Paul and his backroom staff for their efforts since taking over last season."</p>
      <p>Burns is the third boss of an Ayrshire top-flight club to leave the dugout in the last fortnight.</p>
      <p>Liam McGuinness stood down as boss at Kilbirnie Ladeside while Jonathan Baillie called time on his Troon reign last weekend.</p>
