      <p>A lorry driver has been jailed after causing serious injury in a crash, with dashcam footage showing his vehicle smashing into the back of one car before colliding with others.</p>
      <p>Police said David Price, 65, of Chapel Lane, Manby, Lincolnshire, was on Thursday sentenced to 18 months in prison for causing serious injury by dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>Price pleaded guilty and was also handed a 29-month driving ban when he appeared at Nottingham Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Police on Sunday released dashcam footage of the crash on June 8 2018, which shows Price driving on the A17 at Newark and failing to react in time to the queuing traffic ahead.</p>

      <p>The driver of the Clio suffered serious injuries including a bleed on her brain, a broken back, broken neck, broken arm, broken ribs and a broken nose.</p>
      <p>The Leeds University student needed a number of operations for her injuries and had to withdraw from university, police said.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Audi also suffered significant injuries, police added.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Police said as Price approached the queuing traffic he was driving at about 55mph and collided with the back of the Clio at 49mph.</p>
      <p>Newark and Sherwood Police Inspector Heather Sutton said police released the dashcam footage to warn drivers to pay attention when behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>"Price's dangerous driving caused catastrophic life-changing injuries within the space of a few seconds," she said in a statement.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It could all have been avoided if he had paid attention when behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>"Now he has time to reflect on the consequences of his actions in prison."</p>
