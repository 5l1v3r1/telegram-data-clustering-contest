      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) — A University of Alaska Fairbanks student has launched a protest campaign against the school’s mandatory meal plans for undergraduates living on campus.</p>
      <p>The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported Sunday that 19-year-old freshman Brennan Lippert says mandated meal plans are an extra financial burden for students who already pay high costs.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman says the university requires undergraduate students residing on campus to buy a meal plan, with the exception of undergraduates in on-campus family housing.</p>
      <p>The school began requiring freshmen to live on campus this year.</p>
      <p>Lippert has carried a sign on campus reading, “Mandatory Meal Plans are a Scam,” while gathering student signatures on a petition.</p>
      <p>Lippert says acceptable changes include allowing students to opt out of meal plans and providing another campus residential option without a meal plan.</p>
