      <h1>Check out 20 minutes of hack and slash Druid gameplay in Diablo 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:03:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/lauren-morton/" target="_blank">Lauren Morton</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-everything-we-know/">Diablo 4</a> has finally been confirmed and although we don't have a release date yet, that isn't stopping Blizzard from showing off some pretty polished gameplay. Game Informer has already posted gameplay of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPTOEGU04X4">Sorceress</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DFgQ81vzGg">Barbarian</a> classes, and have now tested out the Druid.</p>
      <p>In the video below you can see three Druid characters playing together alongside multiple wolf companions. Game Informer highlights how shapeshifting as a Druid feels fluid with attacks that kick off immediately as skills are triggered rather than hanging behind any transformation animation. </p>
      <p>Also noted is a slight change in how the summoned wolf companions work. The animals are always present once the skill is unlocked, rather than using a skill to call them. Instead, the activated skill will focus the Druid's wolves on their target. </p>

      <p>You can head to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/video-feature/new-gameplay-today/2019/11/08/new-gameplay-today-diablo-ivs-druid-class">Game Informer</a> to watch this gameplay without commentary if that's more your speed.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-4-offline-mode/">Diablo 4 isn't coming any time soon</a> according to Blizzard, so it may be that this rush of class previews is the most we'll see of the game for a while.</p>
