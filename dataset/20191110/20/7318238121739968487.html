      <p>Over 13,500 people marched in Paris on Sunday against Islamophobia, in a controversial protest that created tensions on the left and attracted criticism from the French government and right-wing parties. Smaller protests were also held in other French cities like Marseille and Toulouse.</p>
      <p>Protesters waved banners reading slogans such as "Yes to religious criticism, no to hate of the faithful" and "stop Islamophobia". Marchers chanted "Solidarity with women wearing the hijab."</p>
      <p>The march left Paris' Gare du Nord at 1 p.m. and made its way south to the capital's Place de la Nation. In the procession were marching social rights groups such as the French collective against Islamophobia.</p>
      <p>Left-wing leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon attended, the only French party leader to do so, and one of the few elected officials from his far-left party La France Insoumise and of the Green Party who marched.</p>
      <p>Left-wing MP Clementine Autain, of Melenchon's party, tweeted that she attended to overcome "hate, rejection and stigmatisation of Muslims" while Greens Senator Esther Benbassa <a href="https://twitter.com/EstherBenbassa/status/1193504277429444609">praised</a> a "calm, good fun, citizen march".</p>

      <p>The call to march was published on 1 November in the French newspaper "Libération", four days after the attack on a mosque in Bayonne, southwestern France, and as the country's public debate has pondered over the French concept of "laïcité" (secularism) and the hijab for weeks.</p>
      <p>"We came to raise the alarm, to say that there is a level of hate that we shouldn't cross", Larbi, a 35-year-old entrepreneur, told the AFP.</p>
      <p>"We want to be heard, to stand for an open society, we don't want to be moved aside", Asmae Eumosid, 29, an engineer who wears the hijab, told the AFP.</p>
      <p>"Nonsense is being said about Islam and Muslim women these days. Muslims are being stigmatised and ostracised", she added.</p>
      <p>As night fell, marchers sang the French national anthem, <i>La Marseillaise.</i></p>

      <p>In Marseilles, a few hundred people marched, among them Muslim families as well as union members and left-wing activists. "We are all the Republic's children", the crowd chanted.</p>
      <p>Claudine Rodinson, a 76-year-old pensioner marching with the Lutte ouvrière union, told the AFP that she didn't understand how the left "had lost all dignity" in the current debate: "A scandalous propaganda is being spread against Muslims, that conflates terrorism and Islam", she said.</p>
      <p>The notion of "Islamophobia", as well as the identity of some of the march's organisers, led a part of the left to dissociate with the movement. The Socialist Party has said it will organise a march against racism soon.</p>
      <p>As well as Melenchon, Ian Brossat, an official of the Communist Party at the Paris mayoralty, attended the march and told the AFP that in France there currently is a "climate of hate against Muslims". "We can't stand idly by", he said, criticising far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who said that the march was a "protest hand in hand with Islamists".</p>
      <p>Several members of the French government also had harsh words for the march, which the Secretary of state for youth, Gabriel Attal, described as "unbearable".</p>
      <p>Elisabeth Borne, the French minister for Ecological transition and solidarity, said that the march was "pitting people against each other" and criticised its "ambiguities".</p>
