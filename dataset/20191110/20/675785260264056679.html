      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:11:52+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Thomas George, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A cancer sufferer terrified his young son won't remember him when he's gone has made a desperate call for a stem-cell donor.</p>
      <p>Two months after Tom Cameron and his wife Chloe experienced the happiest day of their lives when baby Otto was born, they received some life-altering news.</p>
      <p>Tom visited his GP after a period of coughing to be told he had a tumour in his chest that was a rare form of cancer, stage four primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma.</p>
      <p>In the following 17 months the operating theatre practitioner was twice cleared of the disease only for it come back each time, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/im-afraid-son-never-know-17231125">the Manchester Evening News reported.</a></p>
      <p>Now as he faces a bleak medical outlook, Tom is searching for a stem-cell match and hoping he can have potentially life saving transplant.</p>
      <p>If he doesn't, he fears Otto may grow up without a dad.</p>
      <p>"We are desperately hoping a donor is found soon because it is my best chance of giving Otto a future," the 31-year-old said.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"He is 19 months old now so he is bouncing around, but when I've been in hospital he can't visit. I've not been able to see him for weeks on end.</p>
      <p>"If I die in the next six to twelve months, I'm afraid he will never know who I am."</p>
      <p>Tom first noticed something was wrong when he couldn't shift a cough and was struggling to talk to patients at his work.</p>
      <p>When he noticed a lump in his neck he visited his GP.</p>
      <p>The doctor sent the Poole, Dorset man for an X-ray which showed he had a tumour later tests proved was cancerous.</p>
      <p>"It's put everything on hold," he said.</p>
      <p>"When you have a child, you have plans about what type of parent you are going to be. I've not been able to do any of that."</p>
      <p>Tom immediately quit his job and embarked on a course of chemotherapy.</p>
      <p>The cancer refused to budge until January, when doctors at King's College Hospital in London tried a pioneering new treatment on him.</p>
      <p>Tom was given CAR-T cell therapy, which helps a person's immune system fight cancer.</p>
      <p>After ten weeks of treatment in the capital, he was handed a major boost when doctors told him the cancer had disappeared.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But his recovery did not last long.</p>
      <p>Two months later, he returned for another scan and was told the cancer had returned.</p>
      <p>"We were absolutely devastated," Tom said.</p>
      <p>"It came completely out of the blue.</p>
      <p>"I was feeling the best I had been since my diagnosis. I went into the consultation with no symptoms at all.</p>
      <p>"We had just taken Otto up to Manchester for the first time to see family and we had hope of things returning to normal."</p>
      <p>Tom met his partner Chloe seven years ago while travelling in New Zealand.</p>

      <p>They had planned on having another child after Otto was born in March 2018, but those plans - as well as the rest of their lives - were put on hold by the cancer.</p>
      <p>As doctors told Tom palliative care looked like his only option, he spent the summer planning his funeral.</p>
      <p>In one final roll of the dice, a consultant told him about an immunotherapy drug.</p>
      <p>The treatment, unavailable on the NHS, costs £3,500 every three weeks. But with the help of family, friends and even total strangers, Tom managed to raise an impressive £35,000 to cover the costs.</p>
      <p>So far, it has proved a success and, in September, doctors told Tom he was cancer-free once more.</p>
      <p>However, the drug will only work for so long and Tom's best chance at beating cancer altogether is a stem cell transplant.</p>

      <p>So far Tom has not found a stem cell match within the 2% of the UK population that are registered as donors.</p>
      <p>He said: "This drug is keeping the cancer at bay for now, but it has a limited lifetime. The cancer is going to come back at some point.</p>
      <p>"We never thought we would get to this point but a stem cell transplant is my best hope for a cure.</p>
      <p>"It would mean everything to get this treatment and try and return to a normal life.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of people in my situation whose families are going through the same worries, and they are trying to their lives back on track."</p>
