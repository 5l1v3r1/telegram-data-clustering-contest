      <h1>Instagram is set to make a big change to the way you see 'likes'</h1>
      <h2>Instagram's chief executive Adam Mosseri said the test would now be expanded to parts of the US from next week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:42:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A trial which hides "likes" on Instagram is to be expanded to the United States.</p>
      <p>The social media giant began hiding users' likes in countries including Ireland, Italy and Australia earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The move was aimed at removing "pressure" and stopping the platform feeling "like a competition".</p>
      <p>Instagram's chief executive Adam Mosseri said the test would now be expanded to parts of the US from next week.</p>
      <p>He said: "We've been testing making likes private on Instagram in a number of countries this year. We're expanding those tests to include a small portion of people in the US next week. Looking forward to the feedback!"</p>

      <p>The trial began in Canada in May and has also been rolled out to Brazil, Japan and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Instead of the number of likes on a particular post, the platform instead shows that the post has been liked by one user name "and others".</p>
      <p>It does allow users to see how many likes they have received on their own posts.</p>
      <p>Instagram has previously said that measurement tools for businesses would not be affected by the trial.</p>
