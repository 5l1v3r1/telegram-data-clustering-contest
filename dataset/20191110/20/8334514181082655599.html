      <p>(Reuters) - Shakhtar Donetsk’s Brazilian midfielder Taison was sent off in a Ukrainian league match against visitors Dynamo Kiev on Sunday for reacting to racist insults from the crowd.</p>
      <p>A video of the incident showed that Taison stuck his finger up at a section occupied by Dynamo fans and then hoofed the ball into the stands.</p>
      <p>Taison, 31, who has featured six times for Brazil and has played in Ukraine since 2011, reacted with disbelief and left the field in tears.</p>
      <p>The campaign group FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe) said on Twitter that Taison’s team mate and follow Brazilian Dentinho reported the insults to the referee and a stadium announcement was made.</p>
      <p>Following UEFA-recommended protocol, the referee then took the players to the dressing-room for five minutes, FARE said, before dismissing Taison and restarting the game which Shakhtar won 1-0.</p>
      <p>The third step of the protocol would have been to abandon the match.</p>
      <p>“Third step not activated, victim of racism sent off,” said FARE, which added that Dynamo fans also mocked a club campaign by displaying posters which said “Like to racism.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, Dynamo Kiev were ordered by UEFA to play two European matches behind closed doors after four black spectators were attacked at their stadium during a match against Chelsea.</p>
