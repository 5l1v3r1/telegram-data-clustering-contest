      <h1>Jarvis Landry, Baker Mayfield get into heated argument during game (Video)</h1>

      <p>The Browns have been one of the most disappointing teams in the NFL this season, and it appears the team’s struggles on the field are beginning to take a toll on its players.</p>
      <p>Odell Beckham Jr. hasn’t shied away from voicing his displeasure over a lack of targets, and fellow receiver Jarvis Landry appeared to follow suit during Sunday’s game against the Bills.</p>
      <p>Landry was seen going off on Mayfield on the sideline during the contest. It appeared that the receiver was doing most of the talking, while his quarterback was listening.</p>

      <p>Not the season Browns fans and players expected, that’s for sure.</p>
