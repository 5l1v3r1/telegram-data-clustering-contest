      <p>The April election was the first time a far-right party won more than one seat since Spain returned to democracy in the 1970s.</p>
      <h3>NEWCOMER RISING FAST</h3>
      <p>Founded in 2013 by former members of the mainstream conservative People’s Party, Vox is anti-Muslim, nationalist, anti-feminist, Eurosceptic, socially conservative, economically liberal, and staunchly pro-Spanish unity.</p>
      <p>It got its first foothold in office last December, winning 12 parliamentary seats in a regional election in Andalusia.</p>
      <p>Vox is aligned with the broader populist movement that has also risen swiftly in other European countries, notably Austria, Denmark, France, Germany and Italy.</p>
      <h3>CATALONIA AND BEYOND</h3>
      <p>One of Vox’s founding aims was “recentralisation”: rewriting the constitution to abolish regional autonomy and parliaments, a theme that has struck a chord with many after a failed independence bid by Catalonia in 2017 and unrest in the northeast triggered by jail sentences for separatist leaders last month.</p>
      <p>Positioning itself as vehemently anti-secessionist, it has berated the caretaker Socialist government for making deals with separatists to win their backing in parliament over the past year, and for failing to maintain order in Catalonia.</p>
      <h3>FRANCO AND “SPANISH REBIRTH”</h3>
      <p>Vox has also capitalised on its opposition to the recent exhumation of Fascist leader Francisco Franco - whose legacy still divides opinion 44 years after his death.</p>
      <p>Vox’s rhetoric plays with notions of a Spanish “rebirth”, with party leader Santiago Abascal referencing founders of fascist ideology, and Francoist sympathisers have joined its ranks.</p>
      <h3>PACTS WITH MORE MODERATE RIGHT</h3>
      <p>Following April’s election, Vox struck pacts with the People’s Party and centre-right Ciudadanos to govern major municipalities, including Madrid or Murcia, loosely based on their first regional pact in Andalusia. A GAD3 poll showed Vox got more votes in Murcia than any other party.</p>
      <p>Vox successfully lobbied to remove the former Madrid mayor’s signature programme - a low-emissions zone in the exceptionally polluted capital - from the governing pact.</p>
      <p>Economically, Vox’s manifesto has been ultra-liberal: halving the highest income tax rate to 15%, reducing corporate tax, and abolishing wealth and inheritance taxes. It also proposes to partially privatise Spain’s pension system.</p>
      <h3>CAMPAIGN STAR</h3>
      <p>Several opinion polls identified Abascal as the winner of Monday’s final pre-election debate as he delivered parts of his campaign message - on immigration, Spanish unity and wasteful public spending - largely unchallenged by his four rivals.</p>
      <p>Spain's election board had blocked Vox from participating in debates before the April eletcion, so that Abascal was addressing such a large audience for the first time, as 8.2 million viewers tuned in.(Full Story <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-spain-election/spain-pulls-far-right-vox-party-from-pre-election-debate-idUKKCN1RS22G">here</a>)</p>
      <p>Abascal, 43, is a career politician from the Basque country. Echoing U.S. President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration rhetoric, he has called for a wall to be built around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla and paid for by neighbouring Morocco.</p>
      <p>“I am a supporter of discrimination,” he told 7TV Andalucia in 2017.</p>
      <h3>OTHER VOX PROPOSALS</h3>
      <p>* Intensify diplomatic efforts to return Gibraltar to Spain</p>
      <p>* Repeal the law that bans Franco-era symbols and envisages compensation to dictatorship’s victims</p>
      <p>* Ban medical procedures such as gender change and abortion under the public health system</p>
      <p>* Repeal the law on gender violence</p>
      <p>* Pass a law to protect bullfighting</p>
      <p>* Deport illegal immigrants and any legal immigrants who commit a crime</p>
      <p>* Shut “fundamentalist” mosques</p>
