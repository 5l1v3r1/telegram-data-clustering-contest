      <p>PORT ELIZABETH, South Africa:Â Rugby World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi returned to his South African roots Sunday (Nov 10), holding the trophy as an open-top bus crawled through the streets of a Port Elizabeth township.</p>
      <p>It was in Zwide, 17 kilometres north of the coastal city, that the Springbok colossus first handled a rugby ball on a gravel, often wind-swept school sport field.</p>

      <p>Port Elizabeth was the fourth leg of a national victory parade tour that began in Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto Thursday and continued in Durban and East London.</p>
      <p>The celebrations of the 32-12 final victory over England in Japan last weekend will conclude Monday when the team drive through the streets of Cape Town, a rugby hotbed.</p>
      <p>Among those who greeted Kolisi and his victorious teammates Sunday on a wet, windy day under a slate grey sky was Eric Songwiqi, a schoolteacher and first coach of the would-be Springbok.</p>
      <p>"Siya handled a rugby ball for the first time on a gravel sports field at Emsengeni primary school in Zwide township," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>"The boys would hurriedly eat their food during the school break, then ask me for the rugby ball so that they could play.</p>
      <p>"I recall Siya being a small boy with thin legs, but strong. He oozed passion whenever he had the ball.</p>
      <p>"I saw this diligent, well mannered and disciplined boy with great passion and enthusiasm for rugby and I knew he would go far.</p>
      <p>"I am not surprised that he captains the Springboks. I could see leadership qualities in him even at the tender age of 12. He was focused."</p>
      <p>Songwiqi said Kolisi, born to teenage parents in June 1991, loved rugby more than his school books.</p>
      <p>"You could see the zeal and hunger even though it was on a rough, hard, gravel pitch," said the coach.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"I PLAYED A PART"</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I feel great that my product is doing well and the moment he lifted the William Webb Ellis trophy, I felt that I had played a part in the win."</p>
      <p>Kolisi was spotted at a tournament when only 12 and won a scholarship to an elite Port Elizabeth school, where his rugby skills were honed.</p>
      <p>After representing South Africa at under-20 level, he joined Cape Town-based Super Rugby team the Stormers and made his Springbok debut six years ago against Scotland in Nelspruit.</p>
      <p>Last year, coach Rassie Erasmus took over a Springbok squad that had become an embarrassment, especially following a first loss to European rugby minnows Italy.</p>
      <p>Among his first decisions was to make loose forward Kolisi the first black Test captain of the Springboks after 60 whites had skippered a team that excluded black players for 90 years.</p>
      <p>The gamble appeared to have backfired when visiting England raced to a 21-point lead in Johannesburg in the first match of a three-Test series.</p>
      <p>But Kolisi and his teammates did not panic, clawed back into contention with a string of tries and won a thriller 42-39.</p>
      <p>South Africa won seven internationals and lost seven in 2018, but the groundwork had been laid for a dramatic improvement this year.</p>
      <p>An ultimately convincing victory over pre-match favourites England in the World Cup final was the 10th in 12 matches this season.</p>
      <p>Travelling to Port Elizabeth also marked a homecoming for Erasmus, who turned 47 this week. He was born in Despatch, a motor manufacturing town 30 kilometres northwest of Port Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, loose forward Francois Louw has become the second member of the Springbok squad to officially announce his retirement, after legendary prop Tendai 'The Beast' Mtawarira.</p>
      <p>Known as 'Flo', the 34-year-old based in England was capped 76 times and came off the bench in the final.</p>
