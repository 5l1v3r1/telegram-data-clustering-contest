      <h1>Steven Gerrard acclaims 'stunning' Rangers performance as Gary Holt offers a 'cuddle' during post-match drink</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers boss attempted to put his war-of-words with Gary Holt to one side and focus on the football.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T20:33:45+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard told Gary Holt to get his facts straight after hitting back at the Livingston boss following his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> side’s “outstanding” win at Almondvale.</p>
      <p>Gerrard watched as goals in either half from Joe Aribo and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> earned an impressive 2-0 win in West Lothian and kept the Light Blues just a goal behind rivalsa Celtic at the Scottish Premiership summit.</p>
      <p>A war of words exploded beetween Gerrard and Holt on the eve of the clash with Gers boss Gerrard calling for referee protection after Aribo needed 20 stitches to a head wound following a challenge by Ricki Lamie in the previous clash.</p>
      <p>Writing in his exclusive column in our sister paper the Sunday Mail, Holt blasted back and slammed Gerrard for his comments, calling him naive and claiming legendary Gers boss Walter Smith would never have made such comments.</p>
      <p>But the Gers boss - who allayed any fears over Ryan Kent’s injury after he was substituted with a dead leg in the second half - said: “If and when he watched the press conference, he got a few things widely wrong.</p>
      <p>“I have no problem with Gary’s comments and he is entitled to his own opinion and whatever he wants to say but he needs to read or look at my press conference properly.</p>

      <p>“Not once did I say Lamie elbowed my player, I said he led with his forearm. All I asked for in the press conference is protection for all players across the league and across the board and I said we had to stand up to the physical challenge of Livingston, and that is what we did today. And we did it ever so well.</p>
      <p>“I shook his hand before the game and shook it afterwards. Look, it is not about me and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gary-holt">Gary Holt</a> . It is about how good Rangers were today.</p>
      <p>“We came here, tough place to come, tough challenge. But we showed a different side to us today. We dug in when we had to, we competed when we had to, in the air and on the floor.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“At times we played some stunning football. That is all I am interested in right now. It was outstanding from start to finish.</p>
      <p>“I thought we totally dominated and controlled the game. You saw a different side to us today; we were tough all over the pitch and at the right times we played some quality stuff.</p>
      <p>“So I am very pleased. I am not interested in what people want to write and headlines about me and Gary Holt.”</p>
      <p>Despite the row, Holt extended an invite to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Gerrard</a> for the traditional post-match drink shared by managers. he said: “The door is always open. Hopefully he can come in and I can give him a cuddle!</p>

      <p>“I always shake hands and I always wish the opposition the best for the game. I am a big enough boy to accept defeat as well as victory so I congratulated him.</p>
      <p>“They thoroughly deserved the win. I can’t put up a fight and say that there was anything naughty or nasty or anything bad, I just thought they were better in certain areas and we never cost them problem.</p>
      <p>“It’s the toughest day at the office I have had since I came in. I just felt we were a wee bit more reactive than proactive and we were waiting on someone making something happening.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Against a team like Rangers I don’t think you can do that. I can’t fault the effort and the energy levels and the commitment but we didn’t hunt in packs.</p>
      <p>“We went in ones and twos and were passive in certain areas and that is disappointing. If you give a good side time to play then they will hurt you.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on Kent’s injury Gerrard said: “He has a bad dead leg. I am sure he will be fine in two or three days. He tried to run it off to see if it would loosen off so I decided to put Shay on. I thought he did really well.”</p>
