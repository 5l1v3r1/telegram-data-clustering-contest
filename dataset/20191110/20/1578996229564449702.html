      <p>“Um. Here’s a really bad, aggressive, and totally sober 😂😳🙏🏻 version of breaking free,” she wrote on Instagram to accompany the video. “Yep. That happened lol it hurts my ears but also makes me laugh lol 🤷🏻‍♀️ the “ooo yeah”. Dear lord lol 🤦🏻‍♀️🤘🏻”</p>
      <p>While Hudgens is embracing her Disney star past, she recently opened up about the struggles she faced in her career due to her start in <i>High School Musical</i> for <i>Wonderland</i> Magazine.</p>
      <p>“After <i>High School Musical</i>, there were a lot of projects coming in that were very similar, with the same sweet, girl-next-door characters which people knew I could do, and could have been easy things to do just to work,” she said. “But we said no. We needed to move away from that, to find a part that allowed people to see me for something else. I’m really happy with the way we held out, and how we were to be able to make myself a little more diverse.”</p>
      <p>Still, Hudgens appreciates her start as Gabriella Montez.</p>
      <p>“People may remember me for that part for the rest of my life,” she said. “It’s special when you’re able to leave something behind that can contribute to someone’s life with positive effect. <i>High School Musical</i> has done that, and continues to do that, for children all over the world. The fact that I can be a part of something that hopefully inspires kids to be fearless, follow their dreams and not be afraid of going after what they’re truly passionate about… That’s an amazing thing to have as a legacy.”</p>
