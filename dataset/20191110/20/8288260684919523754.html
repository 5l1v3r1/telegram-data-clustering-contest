      <p>An armed mugger has been jailed for 10 years after attempting to rob two Arsenal footballers of luxury watches worth £200,000.</p>
      <p>Harrow Crown Court heard that Ashley Smith and his accomplice did not count on the bravery of Bosnian defender Sead Kolasinac, in fighting back.</p>
      <p>His teammate Mesut Ozil then drove them from the ambush as the would-be robbers pursued them on a stolen moped and threw stones, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Smith, 30 - who was described by judge Ian Bourne QC as a prolific "career criminal" who was well known to police - was out on licence for a 42-month sentence for burglary in 2017 when he tried to carry out the street robbery on the Arsenal stars.</p>
      <p>He had been released in connection with a burglary offence in January.</p>

      <p>Smith, of Archway, north London, had previously pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery just feet from Kolasinac's home in Hampstead, north west London, on July 25.</p>
      <p>The judge said Smith, who appeared in court by videolink, had a "leading role" in the "very serious" attempted robbery with Jordan Northover, 26.</p>
      <p>The would-be robbers used a stolen moped, were dressed in helmets and dark clothing to try and conceal their identities.</p>

      <p>Smith and Northover had been circling the area and on the look-out for a victim when they targeted the players.</p>
      <p>Full-back Kolasinac, 26, had arranged to meet Ozil, 30, who was in a car with his newlywed wife, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The judge said that Kolasinac, nicknamed The Tank, "must have been terrified by the events which took place immediately outside his house".</p>
      <p>Smith and Northover were "armed and dangerous" and were using a knitting needle and a pointed screwdriver as weapons, according to the judge.</p>
      <p>He said: "Between them they produced these weapons which they threatened Mr Kolasinac with, a long pointed blade which was thrust in the victim's direction and made contact with him.</p>

      <p>"The two of them had not counted on Mr Kolasinac fighting back and he behaved incredibly bravely."</p>
      <p>At this point Mr Kolasinac may have felt the robbers would have done "anything they needed to obtain the watches", the judge noted.</p>
      <p>The weapons were described as a 10-12 inch long screwdriver with a thin steel coloured spike and a smaller darker instrument that was probably about six inches long.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard that footage showed Mr Kolasinac attempting to engage with the culprits, but he was able to get in the car which was then driven away by Ozil.</p>
      <p>The judge noted: "But that was not the end of it. The two men pursued the car along the high road and attempted to stop the vehicle, throwing stones at the car."</p>
      <p>The players managed to flee, but the stones caused "significant" vehicle damage.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The judge added that "fortunately for justice" an alert member of the public later saw the moped being parked in Boreham Wood and called police.</p>
      <p>Officers were able to trace the defendants and arrest them.</p>
      <p>Northover is to be sentenced at a later date which has yet to be set.</p>
