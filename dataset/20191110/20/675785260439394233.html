      <h1>Nate Diaz clarifies retirement rumours after issuing social media statement</h1>
      <h2>The UFC star suggested he had retired following his controversial defeat to Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244</h2>

      <p>Nate Diaz has denied suggestions he will retire from MMA on the back of his defeat to Jorge Masvidal last weekend.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old missed out on the opportunity to the claim the "BMF" belt as he lost by a controversial third-round TKO at UFC 244 on November 2.</p>
      <p>Diaz was forced to stop by the doctor after suffering cuts to his eye during the fight at Madison Square Garden, with many fans feeling that the ruling had been unfair.</p>
      <p>Although both fighters initially made clear that they would welcome a rematch, the Californian later indicated he was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/mma/nate-diaz-hints-retirement-amid-20830417">ready to walk away</a> from the Octagon.</p>
      <p>In a post to his official <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4joEhVg6Aa/">Instagram account</a> , Diaz wrote: "F*** a rematch this s*** was over before it started.</p>

      <p>"I'm going on tour. Peace out fight game."</p>
      <p>Diaz's statement led to widespread speculation he was retiring from the sport, but the welterweight fighter has now dismissed those claims.</p>
      <p>"Who said I was retired? I'll fight tonight," Diaz told <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28044596/nate-diaz-said-was-retired-fight-tonight">ESPN</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the same publication <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/27921252/nate-diaz-fighting-nick-diaz-army-headlining-msg">before the fight</a> , the UFC star had previously stated: "I'll fight forever. I'm never going to retire, that's for sure."</p>

      <p>Diaz is currently serving a medical suspension as result of the injuries he sustained against Masvidal, with the American requiring 25 stitches above and below his eye.</p>
      <p>That means he will not be able to return to the octagon until February at the earliest, and it remains to be seen who his next opponent will be.</p>
      <p>Since Diaz's defeat, Masvidal has kept the door open to a rematch and there has been excited talk of a potential third fight with old rival <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>Diaz beat the Irishman in their first meeting at UFC 196 in March 2016, but McGregor avenged the defeat months later at UFC 202.</p>
