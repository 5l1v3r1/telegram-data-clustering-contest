      <p>MULTAN (Dunya News) – Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Sunday asked India to end use of pellet guns, ‘black law’ and imposition of curfew in occupied Kashmir.</p>
      <p>In his talk to the media in Multan, the minister stated that there were contradictions in the Supreme Court of India’s verdict [regarding the demolition of 460-year-old Babri Mosque in 1992]. “The land is being tightened for the minorities in India,” he said.</p>
      <p>Regarding former premier Nawaz Sharif’s ailment, the foreign minister offered prayers for his rehabilitation. However, he asked Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to file his grievance at an “appropriate place” about his father Asif Ali Zardari’s sickness.</p>
      <p>Mr Qureshi referred to remarks made by All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen or AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi that Muslims were not so unvalued to accept a 5-acre land as donation [in exchange of the place of the mosque].</p>
      <p>“We can also get donations and build a mosque on our own,” the foreign minister quoted Owaisi as saying.</p>
      <p>He further expressed concerns over India’s suspension of internet connections in Aligarh and arrest of more than 1,000 people.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court of India on Saturday, while announcing its verdict on a disputed land where Hindu hard-liners demolished a 16th century mosque in 1992, ruled in favour of the Hindus and said that a temple will be constructed on the Ayodhya land.</p>
