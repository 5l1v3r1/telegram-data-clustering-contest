      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/woody-allen">Woody Allen </a>and Amazon Studios settled a USD 68 million breach of contract lawsuit that the director had filed in February after the company terminated a four-picture movie deal with him.</p>
      <p>The studio ended their deal with Allen when allegations that he raped his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, arose again amid the rise of the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>The director has long denied the charges and has faced no criminal actions stemming from investigations of Dylan's claim.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Allen and Amazon filed paperwork in a federal court in New York to dismiss the legal action.</p>
      <p>According to The Wrap, the case was "voluntarily dismissed with prejudice", which means both parties agreed to dismiss it and it can't be brought back to court.</p>
      <p>In his lawsuit, Allen had claimed Amazon knew of the allegations and owed him $68 million in guaranteed payments. The studio cancelled the release of his 2018 film, "A Rainy Day in New York", and dropped plans for three more.</p>
