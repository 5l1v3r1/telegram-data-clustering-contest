      <p>The Gunners had another disappointing away day after suffering a 2-0 loss to Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has been linked as a possible replacement, but reports in Spain claim Arsenal chief Raul Sanllehi has made contact Former FC Barcelona tactician Luis Enrique.</p>
      <p>Following the poor the run off form recently, El Confidencial reported that Sanllehi has drawn up a list of possible replacements but has been in contact with Enrique.</p>
      <p>Enrique has been out of work since resigning as head coach Spain in June this year for personal reasons.</p>
      <p>However, Emery refused to believe that his position is under threat as the club extended their winless run to five matches across all competitions.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a coach, it's about continuing stronger and improving with our players," he said.</p>
      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay calm and to stay patient to improve and recover some confidence with some circumstances.</p>
      <p>"We are receiving criticism but I know that's my job. I've had lots of moments like that but I've recovered by working to get confidence, being together with the club and players.</p>
      <p>"I accept all (of the criticism). I accept the applause and I accept it when they criticise us. I know when we win, they are going to be happy and when we lose, they are going to be sad. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm and also keep improving things. Today we got one step ahead by being together and being strong defensively. But we lost because we were playing a very strong team in a good moment."</p>
