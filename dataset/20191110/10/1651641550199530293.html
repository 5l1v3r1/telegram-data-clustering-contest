      <h1>Microsoft testing a new photo gallery UI for Your Phone desktop app (video)</h1>

      <p>We reported earlier than Microsoft is working on an improved Your Phone photo preview feature, making it possible to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/your-phone-now-allows-you-to-preview-images-within-the-app/">preview photos in full size</a> in the Your Phone app, a feature which has inexplicably been missing since the release of the app.</p>
      <p>Now<a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia"> Aggiornamenti Lumia</a> has discovered that Microsoft is working on multiple user interfaces for the feature, including a dedicated gallery feature accessible by a new Photos (new) menu entry.</p>

      <p>The feature leads to an attractive photo gallery where users will have the option to Open, Copy, Save As and Share the picture.  See the feature in action in ALumia’s video below.</p>

      <p>The Your Phone photo preview feature is said to be in testing with some Windows 10 Insiders but will hopefully come to regular users in short order.</p>
