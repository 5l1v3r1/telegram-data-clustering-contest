      <h1>'I couldn't have asked for a more fulfilling career with the Springboks'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:35:04+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Rugby World Cup-winning Springbok backrow forward, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath/players/francois-louw/">Francois Louw</a>, has called time on his international career.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old made the announcement after capping a ten-year Test journey with a winner’s medal in Saturday’s 32-12 victory over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> 2019 in Japan.</p>
      <p>Louw, affectionately known as ‘Flo’, made 76 Test appearances in a decade at the top, adding 2019 gold to the bronze he won in 2015. In all, he appeared in three <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> tournaments.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t have asked for a more fulfilling career with the Springboks,” said Louw, “and I bow out with a full heart”.</p>
      <p>Flo won his first cap as a flanker under Peter de Villiers against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> in 2010 and went on to be selected by each of the subsequent three coaches, whilst being based overseas with English club Bath, for whom he is in his ninth season.</p>
      <p>He scored an impressive 10 Test tries – the last of them against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup/teams/namibia">Namibia</a> in this year’s Rugby World Cup – and was a key member of the 2019 ‘Bomb Squad’ coming on at crucial times either at the back of the scrum or at flank.</p>
      <p>“Flo was a real warrior of the back row,” said Rassie Erasmus, SA Rugby’s director of rugby.</p>
      <p>“He was always ready to go where the fire was hottest and was the kind of tough-minded character that you’d always want beside you. He didn’t take a step backwards ever.</p>
      <p>“He has been a tremendous servant of South African rugby and we’re losing a lot with his retirement, not just in how he played, but in the calmness, insight and character that he brought to the group.”</p>
      <p>Louw was born in Cape Town to a rugby family – his grandfather, Jan Pickard, was a Springbok and a former president of Western Province. He attended Bishops school and graduated through the ranks of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/western-province">Western Province</a> to make his senior professional debut in 2006.</p>
      <p>He made 53 Vodacom <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> appearances for the DHL Stormers – including an appearance in the 2010 Final – before pursuing his career in England.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had an amazing journey in international rugby,” said Louw.</p>
      <p>“I’ve made friends for life in the game and created incredible memories with great people.</p>
      <p>“To end it as part of the Springbok Trophy Tour and see the joy and excitement we have brought to people’s lives is an incredible way to bow out.”</p>
