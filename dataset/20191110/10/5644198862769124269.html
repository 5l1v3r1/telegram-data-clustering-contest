      <p>WELLINGTON: England centre Joe Marchant will join Super Rugby side Auckland Blues for a season as part of a sabbatical written into his three-year contract extension with Harlequins.</p>
      <p>The highly-rated 23-year-old, who played in three of England’s warmup tests for the Rugby World Cup, will link up with the Blues between January and the end of June next year.</p>

      <p>The arrangement bolsters the Blues' back-line options and covers the absence of Caleb Clarke, who was released to join New Zealand's rugby sevens programme in the leadup to the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>"Firstly I could not be more grateful to Harlequins for allowing me this opportunity to expand and grow my game," Marchant said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The club has supported me every step of the way in my career to date and proven that Harlequins is still willing to support my growth as an individual.</p>
      <p>"I am really excited to be given the chance to experience playing in Super Rugby. I am sure that I will learn a lot and I can’t wait to bring my learnings back to the club."</p>
      <p>The twice-champion Blues finished bottom in the New Zealand conference and 13th in the 15-team Super Rugby competition in 2019 but head into next season with great expectations after signing All Blacks' superstar flyhalf Beauden Barrett on a long-term deal.</p>
