      <h2>Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have been engaged in a week-long war of words ahead of their biggest game of the Premier League campaign so far on Sunday afternoon</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday in a game that could be pivotal in deciding the destination of this season's Premier League title.</p>
      <p>With such a great deal at stake both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola will be doing their utmost to gain any advantage they can.</p>
      <p>Guardiola, whose side are champions but trail by six points at this early stage of the season, decided early on in the week that a dose of mind games may give his side the upper hand.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Liverpool's Sadio Mane, the Spaniard suggested that the Senegalese forward goes to ground easily in an attempt to influence referees.</p>

      <p>"It's happened a lot for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in the last years [scoring late on]. It's because he's a special talent," Guardiola said of Mane to the BBC.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes he's diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute. He's a talent."</p>
      <p>Not one to shy away from a confrontation, Jurgen Klopp hit back in the press, saying: “I promise not to mention tactical fouls!</p>
      <p>“I am not sure if Pep spoke in that moment about Sadio or the team – both is not too nice to be honest.</p>

        <figcaption>Klopp responded to the comments in a press conference</figcaption>

      <p>“Somebody showed it to me because I had to see it as everybody told me about it... I couldn’t really believe it to be honest. Then I saw it."</p>
      <p>Klopp was once again quizzed on Guardiola's comments prior to Tuesday's Champions League game v Genk, and the German boss seemed unusually prickly.</p>
      <p>"I'm not really in the Man City mood at the moment to be honest," he said.</p>
      <p>"I don't think about that. Do I like that he talks about one of my players Sadio Mane?</p>

      <p>"What I can say, and people from other clubs, it's always like this, that's how it is. But, Sadio's not a diver."</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Guardiola clarified his comments, saying: "It was far from my intention to say Sadio is like that. I admire him a lot. I was the wrong guy to think it wasn't a penalty.</p>
      <p>"Like Jurgen says, he knows Sadio better than me. With Jurgen he tries to be positive, when he says it’s not like this. But my comments, what I said, was longer than the highlight, it was a praise for Liverpool, to say it was not just one action."</p>
      <p>The Spaniard made an effort to diffuse the situation, but the seed may have already been planted in the official's minds ahead of Sunday's titanic clash.</p>
