        <b>After a stuttering start to their Premier League season, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is concerned that the club will not give him time to rebuild his team. The Argentine and company have endured a tough start and sit in 12th place with eleven points separating them and top four.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With just three wins and five draws in the Premier League so far Tottenham look in trouble and sit in 12 place in the league table. That has caused a few problems for the North London side and a draw against Sheffield United did not help their cause. However, with VAR playing a major part in that game, things could have certainly gone against the North Londoners. But Mauricio Pochettino was able, for the first time this season, start new signings Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele together.</p>
      <p>That did not change too much for the North Londoners and they eventually had to settle for a draw against the Blades. But with the away side the better team for most of the game it has caused a ripple of concern but Pochettino went on to concede that he needs time to help the club improve in this transitional period. The Argentine even admitted that he’s concerned the club’s board may not give him the time with the club winless in their last five games and players still adapting to their new surroundings.</p>
      <p>"We need to find a balance. We are building a team when we play in the Champions League and the Premier League, the toughest league in the world. It is dangerous as situations like this can happen. You expect better results than you get. We are in the process to build and we will see if we have the time to build what we want,” said Pochettino reports Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>While many expected former Championship side, Sheffield United to be walkovers, the Blades have proved to be more than match for the Premier League at times. Not only that against Tottenham but the away side were also the better of the two and created more than their fair share of chances with only a questionable VAR call stopping them from a potential giant-killing win. But despite that, Pochettino went on to admit that while Sheffield United were the better side, Tottenham’s performance changed in the second half.</p>
      <p>"It was an even game, when you assess the game it was a fair result, they deserved the point. We started the game not well, it was a little bit strange the feeling of Tanguy Ndombele, he never felt comfortable in the game and maybe that affected the team. We arrived to the first half and we changed for Harry Winks and then we played better.</p>
      <p>“We are disappointed because we knew we were going to find a team who would be aggressive and very energetic, well organised. This is the worst opponent you can have when you come to play from Wednesday in the Champions League, a very long way. We feel so disappointed, I don't know the word to use. Upset or frustrated, but it is not a happy feeling,” concluded the Argentine.</p>
