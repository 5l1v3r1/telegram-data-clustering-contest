      <h1>Celtic star Christopher Jullien explains Livingston jitters and the lifelong mantra that ensures he 'never loses'</h1>
      <h2>The centre-back has bounced back to help the Hoops reach the Europa League last 32.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:13:04+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>From Tony Macaroni jitters to Stadio Olimpico euphoria, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christopher-jullien">Christopher Jullien</a> knows how to bounce back.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> star's Tweet claiming he was "nervous" during the Hoops defeat against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> last month was given a social media hammering.</p>
      <p>But instead of a hasty deletion and retraction, Jullien has used his bruising encounter with Lyndon Dykes for the better.</p>
      <p>The Â£7million from Toulouse has a lifelong mantra he insists ensures he "never loses".</p>
      <p>And his recovery culminated in another towering display as Neil Lennon's side stunned Lazio to reach the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> last 32 with room to spare.</p>
      <p>"I always say that in my life I never lose, you know? So when I lose a game I learn," Jullien told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/index.html">The Daily Mail</a> .</p>

      <p>"I said to the team and the coach after the Livingston game that I was sorry because I let my emotions get to me that day.</p>
      <p>"I lost my head in the game. It's something that's happened but I don't think it's going to happen again.</p>
      <p>"Every bad thing I do in my life, every bad moment I see it as an opportunity to get better.</p>
      <p>"I have thought this way since I was young. So I can definitely say that the Livingston game made me stronger.</p>
      <p>"It helps me every day. And it it helped me (against Lazio)."</p>

      <p>Jullien feels those powers of recovery extend right throughout the Celtic team as he insists the best may be yet to come on the European stage.</p>
      <p>He added: "It's good to be part of this. We know the result is historical and we will enjoy it.</p>
      <p>"We don't know how far we can go.</p>
      <p>"We still have two games to play and we want to win them both and finish first.</p>
      <p>"That would perhaps get us a better draw in the next round.</p>
      <p>"Every bad step this team has made, every bad result, we have just stepped back up again.</p>
      <p>"We come back stronger, whether it be the Champions League defeat or the game against Livingston.</p>
      <p>"We get back up, work, keep the head up."</p>
