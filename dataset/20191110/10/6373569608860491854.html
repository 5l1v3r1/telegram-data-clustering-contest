      <p>A 25-year-old man from Plymouth has died after a late-night crash.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/firefighters-carry-out-emergency-rescue-3521175">emergency rescue</a> was carried out by firefighters at the scene after a red Ford C-Max, which was being driven by the male, crashed into a wall.</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police was called to the single-vehicle collision at 1.38am today (Sunday, November 10) at the junction of Ferndale Road and North Prospect Road.</p>

      <p>A Devon and Somerset Fire Service spokesperson said: "Crews from Camels Head and Crownhill in Plymouth were mobilised following a request from the police to assist after a car had collided with a wall trapping the driver.</p>
      <p>"Due to the medical condition of the casualty the crew had to carry out an immediate extrication shortly after arriving, alongside ambulance paramedics, whereby they were conveyed to hospital via land ambulance.</p>
      <p>"Once extricated crews made the vehicle and scene safe, before leaving duty of care with the police."</p>
      <p>Devon and Cornwall Police has now confirmed that the man died as a result of the collision.</p>
