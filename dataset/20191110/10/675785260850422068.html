      <p>A balaclava clad man is terrorising families by staring at them through their windows.</p>
      <p>Police have launched a manhunt in Stoke-on-Trent following reports from petrified victims of a man behaving suspiciously outside their homes.</p>
      <p>They initially received one report but since then other residents told <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/my-granddaughter-scared-witless-hid-3520704">StokeonTrent Live</a> they too were victms.</p>
      <p>A family member of a witness told StokeonTrentLive: "I believe he is targeting specific houses and he is studying the occupants of these homes.</p>
      <p>"My granddaughter walked into the kitchen to see a man wearing a balaclava watching her through the kitchen window.</p>

      <p>"Then on another night they went out on the spur of the moment and immediately after they left someone dressed in black wearing a balaclava was going around the house looking through windows.</p>
      <p>"He was only scared away by a neighbour across the road who he then targeted two days later.</p>
      <p>"My granddaughter was scared witless and hid behind the couch for ages before getting the courage to go go upstairs to tell her mum what happened."</p>
      <p>It is believed at least three houses were targeted before 7.30am on November 6.</p>
      <p>Another victim said: "When I saw him, he was wearing a dark duffle coat. It was really unnerving. It's like he gets a kick of scaring people."</p>
      <p>Police are now appealing for witnesses to get in touch.</p>
