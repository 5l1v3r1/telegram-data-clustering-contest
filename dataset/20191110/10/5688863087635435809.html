        <b>A Lionel Messi inspired performance helped Barcelona overcome Celta Vigo and Ernesto Valverde admitted that it’s impossible not to depend on the Argentine. The 32-year-old scored a record 34th La Liga hattrick, matching superstar Cristiano Ronaldo’s tally, to make it six goals in his last six games.</b>

      <p>The Argentine was at the peak of his powers against Celta Vigo and walked away with yet another match-ball to his name with Barcelona winning 4-1. But, in the process Messi equalised <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/cristiano_ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s tally for the most <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/tournament/la_liga">La Liga</a> hattricks, with 34, after he scored two free-kicks and a penalty for his 9th goal of the season in just 11 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>It was an inspired performance by the Argentine and one that Barcelona needed with the La Liga giants walking into the game on the back of a two game winless run. That performance combined with Messi’s goalscoring run had Ernesto Valverde gushing about his superstar. The Barcelona manager went on to admit that it’s simply impossible not to depend on the Argentine.</p>
      <p>"It's impossible not to depend on Messi. That's how it works. He lights up everything. Today we were fluent and he scored three times. It is an advantage that we have, that our opponents fear and that is fine. When we win, we all win. Those who play are many, besides Leo. Everyone does their job,” said Valverde reported Goal.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants walked into the game against Celta Vigo on the back of a two-game winless run that included a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Levante. It caused a few problems for Ernesto Valverde with rumours of him getting sacked floating about but the Spaniard went on to admit that it’s bound to happen at some stage or another. He also added that the club had to react and they did with him proud of the performance.</p>
      <p>"When you do not win, there is uncertainty surrounding your environment. It's good that it happens because you have to react. Because when you are used to a regular feeling, it forces you to improve,” concluded Valverde.</p>
