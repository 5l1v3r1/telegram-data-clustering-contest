      <p>If you were to ask me why I live in the country, I'd probably tell you it's because I love the sense of community.</p>
      <p>Or because I love that I wake up looking at trees and the rolling countryside.</p>
      <p>Or maybe, because I foolishly fell in love with a farmer and had no choice (but I wouldn't have it any other way).</p>
      <p>But that is not how I would talk to a prospective employer.</p>
      <p>No, if I am talking about my career I am quick to highlight the 10 years of experience I have working as a journalist in Melbourne and Sydney.</p>
      <p>That I landed in the country entirely by accident and that my career was heading in a different direction.</p>
      <p>I would try to communicate that I really had "made it" because I had worked in the city.</p>
      <p>Many people living in the country feel they have to justify their careers, whether it's in the media industry, health, education or business.</p>
      <p>Some people think if you're not working in the metropolitan centres, then you must not be good enough at what you do. You never cracked the "big time" or you were too afraid to try.</p>
      <p>It's an attitude that can hold many regional professionals back.</p>

      <h3>Where we get our 'inferiority complex'</h3>
      <p>Dr Kristy Hess lives in the country, and as an associate professor in communications at Deakin University, has picked up on this inferiority complex.</p>
      <p>She specialises in regional journalism and has noticed the problem in the media profession.</p>
      <p>"Local journalism is often considered to be inferior to the work produced by those in the metropolis — local journalists often believe that themselves," she says.</p>
      <p>"By default, regional areas are perceived as 'lesser'."</p>
      <p>It's a two-way street:, she says. People in the city need to realise they are not necessarily better at their job because they do it in the city but likewise those with regional careers should be proud of our achievements in the community.</p>
      <p>"It is acceptable to us all that regional people move to the city for 'opportunity'," Dr Hess says.</p>
      <p>"Imagine if we turned this idea on its head and more and more city people thought of regional areas as the land of opportunity.</p>
      <p>"Not simply because they cannot find employment in the city or because they can't afford to contend with rising city house prices."</p>

      <p>In my case, I moved to the country because I married a farmer. There are many other women who have moved to a farm and have had to move their profession with them.</p>
      <p>We face the challenge of distance (it takes me an hour and 20 minutes to get to work). We are the ones running the household — from physically doing the shopping and feeding the kids, to carrying the mental load of knowing you're out of toilet paper, planning the meal for the dinner party on Saturday and organising a costume for school dress up day. And then, we'll go move a mob of sheep.</p>
      <p>But adjusting to country life and rural living can make you a better employee. I have picked up many random skills, I am able to relate to people from all walks of life and given how busy I am, in general, more efficient.</p>
      <h3>'Geographical narcissism'</h3>
      <p>If you work for a big organisation where the headquarters is based in the city, the system could be set up in a way that inadvertently makes regional people "lesser".</p>
      <p>Dr Kristy Hess calls this "geographical narcissism".</p>
      <p>"It's perhaps most apparent when we have to engage with networks and individuals that are competing for resources and attention, all of which continue to be based in metropolitan areas," she says.</p>
      <p>So, sometimes we end up pitting city against country, just in the race for resources or funding.</p>
      <p>But it doesn't have to be this way. We have the digital technology these days to allow for remote work (so long as the internet connection is decent).</p>

      <p>This means some executive and management roles could be based in the country. If that happened, we might actually be able to achieve the dream of governments all over the western world: decentralisation.</p>
      <p>In Australia, at least, governments have been trying to decentralise the cities for decades, with limited success.</p>
      <p>In NSW in the 1970s, there was a government push to decentralise Sydney. I know, because my parents took up the opportunity of subsidised housing to move to Bathurst.</p>
      <p>They enjoyed country life and really made a go of it — but there was no career progression for my dad, so eight years later, and just before I was born, they moved back to Sydney.</p>
      <p>Now we have the technology to support decentralisation. But large-scale government schemes of moving public service jobs or offering housing subsidies aren't the only option.</p>
      <p>Companies could start thinking about having staff in locations outside the major cities, simply by supporting remote work.</p>
      <p>By growing our regions we take the pressures of overcrowding off the cities and bring people and stronger economies to the country.</p>
