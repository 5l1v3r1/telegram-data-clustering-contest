      <h3>EVERY woman wanted to be a June Bride, then came a change just like the climate.Now, marami choose to marry in December.</h3>
      <p>Regardless of the month many celebs are saying goodbye to pagdadalaga. Angel Locsin and Neil Arce, Maja Salvador and Rambo Nunez, Richard Gutierrez and Sarah Lahbati, Sarah Geronimo and Matteo Guidicelli announced their engagements.</p>
      <p>Ang napag-iwanan ay si Jessy Mendiola na ang tanging hinihintay ay mag-propose ang matagal na niyang boyfriend na si Luis Manzano. Could it be na hindi naniniwala sa kasal si Luis?</p>
      <p>Sapat na ba na parang member of Luis' family na si Jessy? Sa birthday party ng Star for all Seasons (who else, but Luis' mom, Vilma Santos?), super ang bonding nila sa kanyang future mother-in-law.Â  (What's in the future, we don't know.)</p>
      <p>Kaya lang parang hanggang bonding-bonding na lang ang nangyayari. At 66, gusto na ni Ate VI na magkaapo. To propose or not to propose, that is Luis Manzano's dilemma. What do you think?</p>
