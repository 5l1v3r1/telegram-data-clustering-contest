      <h1>Man Utd legend Ryan Giggs compares Daniel James to young Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
      <h2>Daniel James has become an instant hit at Man Utd - and club legend Ryan Giggs has drawn parallels with a young Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:58:24+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:58</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs says Daniel James reminds him of a young <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> for the way he takes physical punishment.</p>
      <p>The pacey James has a tendency to be fouled by defenders due to his trickery and dribbling.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, who turns 22 today, has still impressed early on in his Old Trafford career and shown his willingness to get on with it amid some tough tackling.</p>
      <p>And international boss Giggs says he sees similarities with the attitude shown by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo when he first arrived at the club as a fresh-faced teenager.</p>
      <p>Giggs said: “Dan takes a lot of knocks but gets up, gets on with it and demands the ball back.</p>

      <p>“Ronaldo, especially earlier on in his career, took a lot of knocks and would still demand the ball. It shows huge bravery.</p>
      <p>“Dan’s a fantastic character and great professional.</p>
      <p>“It was a physical game. You’ve got to stand up for yourself. You’ve got to trust in the referee as well that he protects the players.</p>

      <p>“Over the years forwards have been more and more protected. But we have a few players who receive nasty treatment because of the quality they possess.”</p>
      <p>James will celebrate his birthday by taking on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> today (Sunday) before linking up with Giggs' Wales squad ahead of their Euro 2020 qualifiers against Azerbaijan and Hungary.</p>

      <p>He will head to international duty in fine form with Giggs finding it easy to see why he has become a favourite with fans.</p>
      <p>“United fans like players who like to attack, who gets the fans off their feet — and he’s somebody who does that.</p>
      <p>“With the form he’s in, he has been outstanding and a constant threat. He’s added goals and assists, which is a wingers’ game. He will get better and better — and I’m pleased for him.”</p>
