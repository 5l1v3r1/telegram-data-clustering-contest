      <p>In the main event of UFC Moscow, Zabit Magomedsharipov won a unanimous decision against Calvin Kattar, despite “The Boston Finisher” ending the fight on top.</p>

        <b>What was the high point of the fight?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zabit used some good movement backing up Kattar early with some double jabs whilst constantly switching stances. Both men showed off some flashy striking, as Kattar landed a flying knee whilst Zabit scored a good step in elbow.</p>
      <p>In the second round, Zabit landed a great outside sweep and almost took the back of Kattar but “The Boston Finisher” did a job of fighting him off. Kattar turned up the heat in the third and backed up Zabit with an uppercut followed by a straight. As Kattar threw a flying knee, Zabit timed a takedown but Kattar remained active on the canvas as the fight came to close.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where do both men go from here?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Still undefeated in the UFC, Zabit’s win over Kattar was undoubtedly his biggest yet as he progress to 6-0 for the promotion. In his post-fight interview, Zabit said he wants to fight the winner of Max Holloway vs. Alex Volkanovski next, that fight takes place at UFC 245 next month.</p>
      <p>The loss is just Kattar’s second in the UFC, however he certainly put up a good fight against Zabit especially in the last round, proving he is a top contender at 145-pounds. Maybe a rematch against Renato Moicano, who defeated Kattar last year at UFC 223, is a good one to make next.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch it now, later or never?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a fight full of action, watch it now.</p>
