      <h1>Mick McCarthy Hits Out At Derby Following Richard Keogh Sacking</h1>

        <b>Irish manager Mick McCarthy has explained that he was “astounded” by Derby County’s decision to terminate the contract of defender Richard Keogh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Keogh was sacked by the club last week with immediate effect on the grounds of ‘gross misconduct’ after he was involved in a car crash which saw Derby teammates Tom Lawrence and Mason Bennett charged with drink driving.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old severely injured his knee in the incident which will see him miss over a year of action as well as Euro 2020 next summer should Ireland reach the finals of the competition.</p>

      <p>Keogh will work closely with the English PFA who outlined earlier this week that they would be “<a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/pfa-to-defend-richard-keogh-derby-dismissal/">robustly defending</a>” the player who has 14 days from the day of his dismissal to appeal Derby’s decision.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Keogh’s dismissal, <a href="https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/if-richard-has-got-in-an-uber-and-the-uber-driver-was-drunk-i-dont-think-they-would-have-sacked-him-mick-mccarthy-38677536.html">McCarthy said in quotes reported by Independent.ie at the PFAI awards on Saturday night, </a>that he feels the situation may have been different if ‘Richard had got in an Uber and the Uber driver was drunk.’</p>
      <p>“I’m astounded at what’s gone on there, I really am. I’ve only worked with him since December and he’s been brilliant, such a great guy,” McCarthy said.</p>
      <p>“I know they (English PFA) have taken it on and so they should be, that’s where they (players) really need help in cases like that.</p>

      <blockquote>“If Richard has got in an Uber and the Uber driver was drunk I don’t think they would have sacked him.”</blockquote>
      <p>Last night’s awards also saw Keogh’s international teammate Jack Byrne pick up the 2019 PFAI Player of the Year accolade as he beat out Dundalk duo Sean Gannon and Michael Duffy.</p>
      <p>Bohemians and Ireland U21 midfielder Daniel Mandroiu was named Young Player of the Year with Enda Stevens picking up the Irish Overseas Player of the Year.</p>
