      <h2>Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the Premier League as they aim for their first title since 1990. Roberto Firmino has netted three times this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T10:32:49+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been given the backing of Brazilian legend Cafu to win their first Premier League title this season.</p>
      <p>The Reds haven't won a domestic league crown since 1990 but have finished runners-up twice - including last year when they were a single point behind champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>This time around they have gone off quickly and currently boast a five point advantage at the summit of the Premier League - although face nemesis City on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And Cafu reckons Jurgen Klopp's men have the strength to see it through to silverware come May.</p>
      <p>“First of all, I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ," Cafu told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10313950/liverpool-facing-battle-keep-alexander-arnold-says-cafu/">Sun.</a></p>

      <p>“Second, with the basics of what Liverpool have now, they have all the conditions and ability due to the strength of the team to win the league title."</p>
      <p>Cafu has pin-pointed Roberto Firmino's improvements as one of the keys behind Liverpool's title charges.</p>
      <p>Brazil international Firmino has become a vital cog in the Reds' front three alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.</p>

      <p>Firmino has netted 69 goals in 209 appearances for the Merseyside club since joining from Hoffenheim four years ago.</p>
      <p>“Firmino can help a lot as he has been on the rise and really grown as a player in Liverpool," Cafu added.</p>
      <p>“He is in a period that he is on fire and constantly growing with the team. Firmino is a great player. He can play either side and has powerful contact with the ball in any position.</p>
      <p>“Today we can say that Firmino is one of the better players in the world. The difference in his game on the field is noticeable to all. Firmino is also admired for his assistance on the field.</p>
      <p>“What Jurgen Klopp has done is bring the team together with a very strong presence and powerful position on the field.”</p>
