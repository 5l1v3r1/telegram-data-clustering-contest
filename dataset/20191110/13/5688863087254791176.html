        <b>England captain Eoin Morgan singled out Chris Jordan for praise after the fast-bowler held his nerve to deliver a Super Over-win against New Zealand at Eden Park after an even contest between the two teams. Jordan’s heroics helped the tourists to a 3-2 victory over New Zealand in the T20I series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Once again, a match between England and New Zealand went all the way down to the wire and, once again, it was England who prevailed. After rain gave way for the series-decider to eventually start, New Zealand blasted away to post 146 for five in the 11 overs. England was nearly down and out with three balls to go in their chase when Jordan hit 12 off the remaining deliveries to tie the scores, before defending their Super Over score of 17 comfortably. </p>
      <p>"I don't think both sides mind a bit of extra time or a Super Over. It makes for great entertainment. It's obviously brilliant to play in big-pressure situations, but we're glad we came out the other side of it. The Black Caps played well again, bowled really well, and there was nothing between the sides for the 11-over game. And then, the Super Over - I thought the standout was <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/chris_jordan">Chris Jordan</a>, a guy who's extremely calm under pressure and delivers," Morgan said, reported Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>Jordan admitted that his experience playing T10 cricket in the recent past came in handy in delivering a succession of yorkers which the Kiwis just couldn't get away.</p>
      <p>"A few of us have played T10 cricket so the mood was very calm the entire way through. I just tried to keep a clear mind. I'd bowled a super over before in Sharjah against Pakistan [in 2016, conceding just three runs], so it was more or less going through processes and letting what will be will be," Jordan said.</p>
      <p>For England, pulling one over the hosts without much of their first-choice team on hand is an impressive achievement ahead of the two-match Test series, beginning in Mount Manganui on November 21.</p>
      <p>"To win it in such fashion with a young, inexperienced side in the long term will pay huge dividends for us," Morgan told BBC's Test Match Special.</p>
      <p>"It says a lot about the team. It gives us huge strength in depth moving forward and it creates a really good headache for us when it comes to selection. When you select a squad like we did, you always run the risk of getting drilled, particularly away from home. We are further ahead than we thought," Morgan added.</p>
