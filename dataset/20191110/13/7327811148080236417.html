      <p>COLUMBIA, Tenn. -- Another incident of violence erupted at a Popeyes with an employee allegedly body-slamming a woman onto the concrete outside a Tennessee restaurant.</p>
      <p>Video of the alleged incident has gone viral and is now the subject of a police investigation.</p>
      <p>Witnesses say the attack began after a woman disputed a charge on her bill at the restaurant in Columbia, Tennessee.</p>
      <p>A heated argument ensued between the customer and several employees, prompting workers to tell the customer to leave the restaurant. Employees claim the woman then used a racial slur.</p>
      <p>Footage shows the woman walking out of the restaurant, followed closely behind by several employees, including a man who appears to lift the woman off the ground and quickly slams her on the pavement.</p>
      <p>The woman's attorney said the employee's actions weren't justified.</p>
      <p>"If she said something that she regrets, it doesn't give a grown man the right to chase her into the parking lot as she is trying to leave the store, and body slam a 55-year-old grandmother down on the concrete," he said.</p>
      <p>The customer's attorney also said the woman suffered nine fractures, including six broken ribs and a broken knee.</p>
      <p>Police arrested 29-year-old Deriance Hughes, who faces aggravated assault charges.</p>
      <p>The attack comes after a series of violent incidents at Popeyes restaurants around the country, including in Maryland where a man fatally stabbed another customer outside of a location in a <a href="https://abc7.com/man-stabbed-to-death-over-popeyes-chicken-sandwich-police/5672332/">fight over the recently re-released chicken sandwich</a>.</p>
