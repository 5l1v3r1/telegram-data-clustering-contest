      <p>DUBAI: Dubai construction and hospitality giant Emaar Properties on Sunday reported a rise in interim profit results, posting higher sales despite an economic downturn that has depressed the property industry.<br/>The company, which owns the world’s tallest tower, Burj Khalifa, said it posted $362 million in net profit in the third quarter, up 20 percent from $302.4 million in the same period last year.<br/>Dubai is defined by its beachfront skyscrapers and man-made islands, but it is stuck in a five-year property downturn with analysts saying there will be no relief in the near term.<br/>The government in 2018 introduced a raft of rescue measures including easy visa terms for expatriate buyers and permanent residency permits for big investors. And in September, a top-level committee was established to rebalance the market.<br/>Emaar, the largest property firm in the Middle East, reported that over the first nine months of the year net profits rose just 2.3 percent to $1.2 billion, from $1.18 billion in the corresponding period of 2018.<br/>Sales in the first three quarters of 2019 hit $3.44 billion, a surge of 25 percent on the same period last year.<br/>The growth was attributed to the “resilient performance of the property, malls and hospitality business,” the company said in a statement posted on the Dubai Financial Market website.<br/>Since 2002, Emaar has delivered some 59,000 residential units in Dubai and other global markets.<br/>Besides real estate, Emaar has a number of malls, including Dubai Mall, the world’s most visited shopping center, and several hotels.</p>
