      <h1>Amazon spent a fortune to block a socialist candidate's re-election to Seattle city council; she won anyway</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T13:58:45+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Former tech worker Kshama Sawant (<a href="https://boingboing.net/?s=%22Kshama%20Sawant%22">previously</a>) won an unprecedented victory in 2013 by running for Seattle city council as on the Socialist Alternative ticket, raising unprecedented sums in small-money donations, and then winning the election after a last-minute surge in the polls.</p>
      <p>Seattle is a city dominated by a handful of giant corporations (Starbucks, Microsoft, Boeing, and, of course, Amazon) and has historically had a municipal government that put those companies' interests first, so Sawant's victory (and her subsequent re-election) was a huge change in Seattle politics -- and Amazon was determined to change them back.</p>
      <p>Amazon funnelled $1.5m through a Chamber of Commerce PAC that worked with the "Civic Alliance For A Sound Economy PAC," to back Sawant's opponent and other "business-friendly" candidates -- an eye-popping sum that had climbed considerably since 2015, when Amazon only spent $130k on the city's elections.</p>
      <p>Once again, Sawant came from behind to win her seat, a phenomenon she attributes to 1,000 doorbell-ringing volunteers. Sawant's losing opponent, Egan Orion, said that the Amazon money was "unnecessary" and "a distraction."</p>
      <blockquote>Four other candidates endorsed by the Civic Alliance For A Sound Economy also seemed set to lose. Phil Tavel, Heidi Wills, Mark Solomon and Jim Pugel trailed their opponents by at least 6%, with Solomon down by about 20%. Two candidates endorsed by the Pac, Alex Pedersen and Debora Juarez, had substantial leads. <br/><br/>A win for Sawant would give her a third term. She has been a fierce critic of the influence of big business on Seattle, and helped lead the push last year for the head tax, a per-employee tax on large corporations that was repealed a month after passing unanimously. <br/><br/>On Saturday, Sawant said she planned to continue her battle for a tax on big business. Orion does not support the head tax.</blockquote>
