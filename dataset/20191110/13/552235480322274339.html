      <p>His mum Nadia Hulse was cooking and video chatting with her mum when the horrifying drama unfolded, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-horror-veg-steamer-tipped-20851906">Mirror Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She recalled Dougie, who had been playing with pots and pans on the floor, reach towards the steamer with a spoon.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old said: "I was right next to Dougie when it happened. I shouted, 'Dougie, no!' which startled him.</p>
      <p>"As he jumped back the handle of the spoon got caught on the wire and the vegetable steamer tipped over.</p>

      <p>"I stripped Dougie and raced him upstairs into a cold bath but he was screaming hysterically and trying to out of the bath and on to me."</p>
      <p>Nadia's mum called an ambulance after watching the incident unfold on FaceTime in March this year.</p>
      <p>Dougie was rushed to Birmingham Children's Hospital with burns covering half of his body.</p>

      <p>"He was touch-and-go in the hospital at one point and I couldn't stop crying. I was an absolute mess," she said.</p>
      <p>Receptionist Nadia, who lives in Cannock, Staffordshire, was told her son had to undergo skin grafting where doctors took skin from Dougie's thigh to cover his left wrist and chest.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't the end of Dougie's harrowing ordeal.</p>

      <p>On 14 March, doctors diagnosed toxic shock syndrome - a potentially fatal condition caused by an infection.</p>
      <p>Dougie's blood pressure soared and he needed an oxygen mask to breathe. Doctors were then forced to administer a blood plasma transfusion.</p>
      <p>But the brave boy fought back and within hours of the transfusion he was showing signs of recovery.</p>
      <p>He was finally discharged on April 8.</p>

      <p>Seven months later Dougie, now two, still wears a compression vest at night to try to reduce scarring.</p>
      <p>Nadia said: "Dougie is such a happy, lively little boy and has not changed his outgoing personality one bit.</p>
      <p>"But I still feel guilt. I know it was a freak accident and the only thing I could have done differently was not let him play with the saucepans.</p>
      <p>"I worry about him growing up with his scars but will constantly reassure him every day of how brave he was and how beautiful he is with his scars."</p>
