      <p>BERLIN -- Police and organizers say more than 100,000 people took part in an open-air party celebrating the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
      <p>Despite the cold and damp, crowds flocked to Berlin's Brandenburg Gate late Saturday for music and fireworks.</p>
      <p>The boulevard leading up to the Brandenburg Gate was covered with a giant rainbow-colored net made of 100,000 streamers, many with messages of love and peace, created by American artist Patrick Shearn.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the city, images and video of the events around the Nov. 9, 1989 fall of the wall were projected onto buildings.</p>
      <p>In the once-divided town of Moedlareuth, auto enthusiasts re-enacted the moment when East Germans first cross the border in their modest 'Trabi' cars to the cheers of welcoming West Germans.</p>
