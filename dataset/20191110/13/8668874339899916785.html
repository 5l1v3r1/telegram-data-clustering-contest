      <p>Follow all the action on the <i>RugbyPass</i> live blog from the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> match between Exeter <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol">Bristol</a> Bears at Sandy Park.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the Sunday 3.0pm kick-off, Rob Baxter has been buoyed by the return of four more of his Chiefs following the culmination of the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Welshman <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/tomas-francis/">Tomas Francis</a> is back nursing a shoulder injury sustained in the semi-final against South Africa, while English trio <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/luke-cowan-dickie/">Luke Cowan-Dickie</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/jack-nowell/">Jack Nowell</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/henry-slade/">Henry Slade</a> are just nursing the wounds of narrowly missing out on lifting the William Webb Ellis Cup.</p>
      <p>All three, however, will <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/former-sevens-boss-urges-fans-to-trust-clubs-like-exeter-with-post-rwc-player-welfare">get the chance to get back into the rugby groove immediately</a> as Baxter has thrust them all into his match-day squad. Slade will start in the centre alongside <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/sam-hill/">Sam Hill</a>, while Cornish pair Cowan-Dickie and Nowell are named among the replacements.</p>

      <p>Other changes to the Chiefs line-up from last weekend’s 24-20 win on the road at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/worcester">Worcester</a> Warriors see <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/bulls/players/jannes-kirsten/">Jannes Kirsten</a> come into the second row in place of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/dave-dennis/">Dave Dennis</a>, who has a foot injury. </p>
      <p>Sam Simmonds is back at No8, so the back row is re-jigged with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/dave-ewers/">Dave Ewers</a> the man to miss out on this occasion. Behind the scrum, Aussie <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/nic-white/">Nic White</a> comes in for his first start of the season, while summer signing <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/stuart-hogg/">Stuart Hogg</a> is poised to make his Sandy Park bow for the Chiefs, having featured twice already on the road against <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> and Worcester.</p>
      <p>Alongside Cowan-Dickie and Nowell, there is also a welcome return to first-team duties for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/exeter-chiefs/players/don-armand/">Don Armand</a>, who has yet to feature this term following summer surgery.</p>

      <p>“Gone are the days now when you under-estimate the threat of a promoted side,” warned Baxter. “We, better than a lot of clubs, appreciate where we have come from and we have always given Bristol an awful lot of credit for what they have done.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably what has allowed us to get the results we have needed – and we certainly haven’t gone into any of those games lightly. They have been battles every single time and we’re expecting a similar thing this weekend.”</p>
      <p>Bristol, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/harry-randall/">Harry Randall</a> lined up for his first start of the Premiership campaign as Bristol. The scrum-half is one of three changes to Pat Lam’s side following last weekend’s win over Sale.  Harry Thacker is the only change to the pack, while <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bristol/players/will-hurrell/">Will Hurrell</a> comes into the midfield with Piers O’Conor switching to the wing.</p>

      <p>Director of rugby Lam said: “The need to be right physically for these sort of games is critical. Last year, we played them three times and we were all within one score – and it’s the little things done well that make the difference.</p>
      <p>“This is close to an international. They are really big games. You can do things perfectly nine times out of ten, but it’s that one mistake that can cost you the match and that is a good challenge for the growth of this team.”</p>
      <p>England under-20s hooker Will Capon and winger Toby Fricker are listed among the replacements and could make their Premiership debuts for Bristol if they feature.</p>
