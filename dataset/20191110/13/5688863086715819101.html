        <b>There’s no question as to why a bowler would celebrate intensely after getting the extremely dangerous Rohit Sharma out. The stand-in Indian captain was sent back to the pavilion by Bangladesh quick Shafiul Islam, who in turn gave the audience a reaction to be remembered for a long time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bangladesh set out to tour India at the start of the month without their captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shakib_al_hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a> in the side. But the way they started their tour could be summed up by their win in the first T20I in Delhi. In that game, too, Rohit was dismissed early and Bangladesh went to win the game by seven wickets. In the 2nd T20I, much to the visitors’ discontent, Rohit hammered a 43-ball 85 to steer India to an eight-wicket victory. Needless to say, Rohit’s wicket is monumental in any limited-overs game.</p>
      <p>Bowling the second over of India’s innings, in the 3rd T20I at Rajkot, Shafiul Islam got rid of Rohit in just his third delivery. Rohit’s was termed ‘lazy’ by the commentators as the batsman tried to flick the length ball on the off stump he and ended up angling the ball with an inside edge onto the stumps. Hence, getting the leg stump uprooted completely. Shafiul, rejoicing the wicket gave a ‘priceless’ and intense reaction to it. Staring deep into the eyes of the batsman, the bowler roared in celebration.</p>
      <p>The next three deliveries were faced by the new batsman <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kl_rahul">KL Rahul</a>, who failed to open his account and Shafiul ended up bowling the first maiden over of the series!</p>
