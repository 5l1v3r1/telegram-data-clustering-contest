      <h1>Fake Madeleine McCann troll posts vicious message after parents snapped at Scots restaurant</h1>
      <h2>The mocked up Facebook profile is used as a front for a catalogue of vile racist and homophobic content and was used to leave the cruel message.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T13:13:57+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>A vile troll posing as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/madeleine-mccann-disappearance-may-never-17259543">Madeleine McCann</a> left a cruel comment on a picture of the missing girl's parents at a restaurant in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Kate and Gerry, who was born in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> , were snapped eating out in pictures uploaded to Facebook on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Among the 3,700 comments was an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/kate-gerry-mccann-mercilessly-trolled-14186902">abusive profile</a> set up under the name of their daughte,r who was just three years old when she vanished from a hotel room in the Algarve region of Portugal in 2007.</p>
      <p>Her parents, from Rothley in Leicestershire, were dining with friends in a restaurant at the time.</p>
      <p>The callous comment read: "Mum and dad are closer than I thought".</p>
      <p>It is unclear if the account was set up in Scotland.</p>
      <p>A deep dive into the profile revealed a catalogue of horrific racist and homophobic posts, including multiple depraved jokes about the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York.</p>
      <p>Other sick comments joke about being in a relationship with paedophile Jimmy Saville, David Bowie's death and suicide.</p>
      <p>While some social media laughed at the repulsive posts, others called it out, branding the online monster "absolutely disgusting" and "bloody sick".</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "The poor girl could be dead and you’re sat here making up stupid accounts you horrible person."</p>
      <p>While another posted: "I'm shocked at the amount of sick minded people. A 3-year-old has been missing for 12 years, I dread to think what she's been through if she's still alive."</p>
      <p>The revolting profile was discovered on a viral post showing Kate, and Gerry, both 51, enjoying a meal while in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Pictures show the pair carrying plates of food back to their table believed to be at the Beijing Banquet in Renfrew.</p>
      <p>The post has racked up 1,300 likes and has been shared over 3,200 times since being uploaded on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Sadly, this is not the first time a twisted online account has been set up in Madeleine's name.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year the Record exposed a fake Tinder dating account claiming to be 'Maddie', aged 18.</p>
      <p>The distasteful profile, with the bio "just want some loving, I have daddy issues, here for a good yin", came up in searches on the app for people seeking dates in  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> .</p>
      <p>It comes after Netflix released an eight-part documentary series on the infamous case in March this year, featuring theories behind the toddler's disappearance and interviews with multiple key players from the investigation.</p>

      <p>Madeleine disappeared from a holiday apartment where she was sleeping with her two younger siblings in Praia da Luz in May 2007.</p>
      <p>Kate and Gerry were dining with friends at a nearby tapas restaurant when she vanished from her bed. They did not approve of the documentary and chose not take part.</p>
      <p>Social media had been rife with trolling of the parents and nasty comments referencing Madeleine's disappearance when it was aired.</p>
      <p>Last month Kate and Gerry thanked the public for 'being by our side' after being granted a £300,000 fund to continue their search.</p>
      <p>The couple vowed to continue the worldwide hunt 'for as long as it takes'.</p>
