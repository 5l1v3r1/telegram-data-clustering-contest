      <h1>Jet diverts to Shannon after suffering hydraulic failure over Atlantic</h1>

      <p>A transatlantic jet was forced to divert to Shannon Airport this morning after suffering a hydraulic system leak and failure off the Scottish coast.</p>
      <p>Atlas Air flight ‘Giant’ 8327 was en route from Frankfurt Hahn airport to Portsmouth, New Hampshire in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Shortly before 10.00am, when the Boeing 767-300(ER) jet was about 800km northwest of Donegal, the crew reported they were experiencing mechanical issues.</p>
      <p>Later, the flight crew further advised controllers that they had “lost the majority of the fluid” from one of the jet’s hydraulic systems. The pilot also confirmed that as a result, this could potentially affect the plane’s braking capability on landing.</p>
      <p>Shannon Airport’s fire and rescue service was placed on standby as a precaution and crews were waiting for the aircraft when it landed safely at 11am.</p>
      <p>Emergency vehicles moved into position behind the jet after it landed however crews reported there was no evidence of a fluid leak.</p>
      <p>An inspection of the runway was undertaken to ensure there had been no contamination of the surface by hydraulic fluid.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the jet was able to taxi to the terminal accompanied by airport fire crews. Engineers were also standing by at the terminal to investigate the hydraulic issue.</p>
      <p>Atlas Air is a New York based cargo and passenger charter airline that also provides services to the U.S. military flying troops around the world.</p>
