      <p>Cape Town - <b>Tottenham Hotspur</b> have reportedly made <b>Lyon</b> winger <b>Memphis Depay</b> their top transfer target in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Depay joined Manchester United from PSV in 2015, struggling to impress before leaving for Lyon in January 2017.</p>
      <p>United retain a buy-back clause but have yet to make their interest in re-signing the Dutchman known, with Tottenham seeking to capitalise on the situation.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mirror say they are 'ready to make a move' to bring him back to the Premier League for Â£50m, the player having 'matured and gone from strength to strength' in France.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are among 'a number of leading clubs' keeping tabs on Depay's progress at Lyon, having scouted him extensively in the Champions League in particular.</p>
      <p>That has given Spurs the opportunity to watch Moussa Dembele, a player who attracted their interest at Celtic, but Depay has become their 'main target'.</p>
