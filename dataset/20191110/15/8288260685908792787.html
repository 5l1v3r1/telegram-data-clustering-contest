      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers v Aston Villa live coverage | The claret and blue faithful have been having their say on social media after a half to forget at Molineux</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:05:02+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans were fearing the worst after a dismal first half against Wolverhampton Wanderers this afternoon.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> trailed 1-0 at half-time, Ruben Neves' stunning strike four minutes before the interval the difference after an opening 45 to forget for Dean Smith's side.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Jed Steer, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/wolves-vs-aston-villa-live-17231152">starting his first Premier League game of the season</a> , had to come off injured after eight minutes and Matt Targett also left the match in injury time for the same reason.</p>
      <p>Villa's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-team-news-wolves-17232215">injury worries have mounted</a> with Jack Grealish, first choice 'keeper Tom Heaton and Bjorn Engels all missing the trip to Molineux.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>So it's no surprise to see Villa fans are not holding out much hope for their side making a comeback at their West Midlands rivals.</p>
      <p>Here's the pick of the reaction to that opening half on social media...</p>
      <p>@ <b>jake_candy</b> : Struggling for a stand out player when Grealish is not offering something different. Wingers need to do more work.</p>
      <p>@ <b>FoxyN77</b> : Targett was having a shocker before the injury. Guilbert our only decent player in that half</p>
      <p>@ <b>TumeloMacha</b> : Ds can be naive at times , we need to reshape, if Wolves had more about them, the game would be over. Regardless of injuries. We should expect better than this</p>

      <p>@ <b>geoffers180</b> : Fearing the worst here! Playing terrible</p>
      <p>@ <b>JedinaksBeard</b> : This is as glum as I’ve been at halftime. We look lost. Wesley isolated again, wingers poor. We need Luiz &amp; McGinn to offer some threats.  Only one sub left as well</p>
      <p>@ <b>JayOfSanj</b> : So many injuries coming into the game, and it isn't ending, let's hope we make a 2nd half comeback</p>
      <p>@ <b>markAV_8</b> : The worst half of football so far this season</p>
