      <p>Game Of Thrones star Conleth Hill has denied being responsible for the show’s coffee cup controversy.</p>
      <p>Viewers poked fun at the fantasy epic when a rogue container was spotted on a table during an episode in the final season earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Emilia Clarke, 33, who played Daenerys Targaryen, later said co-star Hill, who portrayed master of spies Lord Varys, admitted being responsible.</p>

      <p>But the actor, 54, told Channel 4’s Sunday Brunch: “I would need to have had Mr Man arms to leave a coffee cup there.</p>
      <p>“I took a bullet for Emilia Clarke and she touted on me.”</p>
      <p>He told the show: “You know, there’s no proof that I did it. So accuse away!”</p>
      <p>And the actor quipped: “I’m just not making any comments until I have a lawyer … It definitely wasn’t product placement!”</p>
      <p>Clarke, who was seen as a culprit, previously told Jimmy Fallon’s US talk show: “We had a party before the Emmys recently and Conleth, who plays Varys, who’s sitting next to me in that scene, he pulls me aside and he’s like, ‘Emilia, I have got to tell you something, love. The coffee cup was mine’.”</p>
      <p>The hugely popular fantasy epic finished its eight-season run in May but many fans were left disappointed, signing an online petition calling for a remake of the last episodes with “competent writers”.</p>
