      <h2>Ronald Portz, 30, was discovered dead at an address in north Hull in the early hours of Saturday morning - with neighbours saying a screaming young child was knocking on windows to alert them</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:37:16+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>This is the first picture of a young man found dead after reports of a screaming young child knocking windows to alert neighbours.</p>
      <p>Officers believe Ronald Portz, 30, was murdered at his home in north Hull.</p>
      <p>They've been granted a 36-hour extension to question a woman currently in custody on suspicion of murder.</p>
      <p>Mr Portz’s family have been informed and are receiving support from specially trained officers.</p>
      <p>Neighbours said yesterday they heard "kiddies screaming" and saw police cordon an area as they investigated the death.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/humberside-police">Humberside Police</a> have described it as an "isolated incident" and have stressed there is no wider risk to the public.</p>
      <p>Senior investigating officer, Detective Chief Inspector Christine Calvert, said: “Enquiries are still continuing and I would like to thank those who have come forward and who have provided information. Your assistance could prove vital to the investigation.</p>

      <p>“I would encourage anyone with any information to please contact our non-emergency line on 101 quoting log number 21 of 9 November 2019, or you can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 completely anonymously.</p>
      <p>“The investigation must progress unhindered, and I would also please also ask that people are mindful of posting any speculation on the case on social media, as it could potentially harm the enquiry.”</p>
      <p>Speaking yesterday, Daniella Siantota, who lives nearby, described the distressing scene.</p>
      <p>“I woke up and could hear a boy screaming. He was going around to the neighbours and knocking on windows," she said.</p>

      <p>"Then I saw blue lights and I went to the window and could see the ambulance and police were there and had opened the door.</p>
      <p>"I saw a paramedic get the other one to go in and look. I know the ambulance got here in four minutes.</p>
      <p>"I saw the police taking a woman - arresting her from the house. That’s it. I went back to bed and woke up and saw all of the police are still here and saw online about the murder."</p>
      <p>The investigation continues.</p>
