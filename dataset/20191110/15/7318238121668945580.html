      <p>Iraqi security forces continued to clash with anti-government protesters in Baghdad on Sunday, just a day after a violent police operation left six demonstrators dead and more than 100 injured.</p>
      <p>Protesters ran away as live ammunition, tear gas canisters and stun grenades were fired towards them.</p>
      <p>Security forces put up concrete barriers in the centre of the capital, trying to hamper and block protesters' movements.</p>
      <p>Since the unrest began last month, more than 260 protesters have been killed by security forces.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International called it a "bloodbath" and said Iraqi authorities should immediately rein in security forces.</p>
      <p>The growing security crackdown reflects the government's intransigence and narrowing of options for protesters taking to the streets of Baghdad and the Shi'ite-dominated southern cities for weeks.</p>
      <p>Authorities blocked the Internet and banned social media several times amid protests.</p>
      <p>The unchallenged protests, driven by deteriorating economic conditions, target the entire Iraqi political class and call for reform of the sectarian system created after the US-led invasion in 2003.</p>
      <p>Protesters are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi's government, which has held the post for more than a year. But he refused to step down.</p>
