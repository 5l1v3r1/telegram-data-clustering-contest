      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/greta-thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a> politely dealt with a heckler after being interrupted during speech in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/false">US</a>.</p>
      <p>The activist was giving a speech at a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/climate-change">climate change</a> rally in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NorthCarolina">North Carolina</a> when someone started shouting over the crowd’s cheers.</p>
      <p>The woman in the crowd could be heard saying, in what seemed to be the teenager's native language of Swedish: "Greta, I came here today to get your attention.</p>
      <p>"I must speak to you. It's very, very important"</p>
      <p>Footage of the moment shows the teenager pausing her address and allowing the heckler to finish speaking.</p>
      <p>“I think if you want to speak with me personally, maybe you can do it later,” Ms Thunberg then tells the woman in the crowd.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old's response prompted cheers from members of the crowd, before the activist eventually restarted her speech over the calls of support. </p>
      <p>“It is young people who are the future, but there is not enough time for us to grow up and become the ones in charge,” Ms Thunberg said.</p>
      <p> “We need to tackle the climate and ecological emergency right now.”</p>
      <p>In August, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/greta-thunberg-sailing-boat-climate-change-un-summits-new-york-santiago-a9058541.html">Ms Thunberg set sail on a two-week journey </a>across the Atlantic in a high-tech yacht to avoid flying to the US.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/greta-thunberg-united-nations-climate-change-speech-today-world-leaders-a9117031.html">She was travelling to speak at the United Nations climate summit in New York</a>, where she told world leaders including <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”</p>
      <p>The climate activist, who shot to fame after leading school strikes for climate action last year, has been travelling through the US and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Canada">Canada</a> giving speeches and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/greta-thunberg-climate-march-montreal-canada-justin-trudeau-a9123991.html">taking part in marches</a>.</p>
      <p>In San Francisco, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/greta-thunberg-mural-san-francisco-cobre-climate-change-a9196406.html">a huge eight-storey mural of the teenager recently appeared</a>.</p>
