      <p>There’s been no official announcement by the club yet, but Kaizer Chiefs’ newest signing was spotted celebrating their Soweto Derby win.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Amakhosi head coach, Ernst Middendorp, did reveal in a press conference earlier in the week that Brylon Petersen had been snapped up again after the club’s decision to release him back at the end of June, however the club has not yet made an announcement about his arrival.</p>
      <p>Petersen spent a number of years at Naturena after being snapped up as a youngster from the Wits University side, but the club opted not to renew his contract when it expired at the end of last season and he went on to finish his studies.</p>
      <p>Now though, following injury concerns surrounding Itumeleng Khune and the fact that Daniel Akpeyi’s contract will expire in June, Middendorp and his goalkeeping coach, Lee Baxter, decided to bring the 23-year-old back as cover for Akpeyi and Bruce Bvuma.</p>
      <p>The shot-stopper could be seen celebrating with his teammates on the field at FNB Stadium on Saturday afternoon after the final whistle had been blown on an epic battle with Orlando Pirates, with Chiefs now 15 points clear of their Soweto neighbours.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how long Petersen will have to wait for his debut in Amakhosi colours, but he could find himself in the matchday squad for the Telkom Knockout semifinal with Maritzburg United due to Akpeyi’s suspension.</p>
