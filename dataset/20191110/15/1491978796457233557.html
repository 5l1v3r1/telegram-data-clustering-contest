        <i>Passenger injured as pilot slowed plane at low altitude to ‘dump 350 gallons of pink water’ in stunt gone badly wrong</i>
      </p>
      <p>In another instance of a “gender reveal” stunt gone badly wrong, a small plane crashed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> after “dump[ing] about 350 gallons of pink water” to indicate that a friend of the pilot was going to have a daughter.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20190908X51027&amp;ntsbno=GAA19CA535&amp;akey=1">a National Transportation Safety Board report</a> into the crash, which happened near the town of Turkey on 7 September, “the pilot reported, that while maneuvering at a low altitude in an aerial applicator airplane, he dumped about 350 gallons of pink water for a gender reveal.</p>
      <p>“The airplane ‘got too slow’, aerodynamically stalled, impacted terrain and came to rest inverted.”</p>
      <p>The pilot reported no mechanical failures or malfunctions before the plane crashed.</p>
      <p>The NTSB report added: “The Federal Aviation Administration inspector … [said] there were two persons on board the single-seat airplane.”</p>
      <p>The pilot was not injured. The passenger suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender">Gender</a> reveal parties let expecting parents reveal whether they are going to have a boy or a girl. Stunts gone wrong have become a staple of online reporting.</p>
      <p>In Iowa in October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/28/woman-killed-explosion-iowa-gender-reveal-party">a 56-year-old grandmother was killed</a> when a device meant to shoot out coloured powder exploded instead.</p>
      <p>In Arizona in 2017, a man fired a rifle at a target that exploded, releasing blue powder. It also started a wildfire that burned 73 sq miles of mostly Forest Service land. The man was ordered to pay nearly $8m in restitution.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Jenna Karvunidis, a mother of three who in 2008 was one of the first people to hold a gender reveal, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/26/gender-reveal-party-pioneer-regrets-trend">told the Guardian</a> she “had released something bad into the world”.</p>
      <p>Aside from accidents, Karvunidis said she regretted the focus of such events on traditional notions of gender.</p>
      <p>“I started to realize that nonbinary people and trans people were feeling affected by this,” she said, “and I started to feel bad.”</p>
