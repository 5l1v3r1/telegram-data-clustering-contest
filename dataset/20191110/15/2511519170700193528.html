      <h2>The two great rivals meet at Anfield on Sunday afternoon</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> take on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterCity">Manchester City</a> in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's side can take a commanding lead in the Premier League title race with victory at Anfield on Sunday with Jordan Henderson and Virgil van Dijk, who both missed training earlier in the week, both expected to be fit.</p>
      <p>There's worse news for Pep Guardiola, however, with goalkeeper Ederson already ruled out with an injury picked up on Wednesday against Atalanta in the Champions League. </p>
      <p>He joins Aymeric Laporte as key absentees while David Silva could also be missing. Back-up keeper Claudio Bravo is set to start despite being sent off midweek.</p>

      <h4>Odds</h4>
      <p>Liverpool: 8/5</p>
      <p>Draw: 12/5</p>
      <p>Manchester City: 8/5</p>
      <h4>Prediction</h4>
      <p>Whenever these two get together there's nearly always fireworks. Throw in a back-up goalkeeper and the looming spectre of VAR and you can almost guarantee it this time around.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have been the better team this season - their league position and points advantage neatly illustrate that. Add in City's injury problems and that Anfield home crowd and this one feels like it can only go one way.</p>
      <p>City remain a fearsome proposition and are of course champions for a reason, but the cards feel like they have fallen neatly into place for Jurgen Klopp here and I think his side will take full advantage.</p>
