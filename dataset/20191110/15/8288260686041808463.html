      <h1>Wolves fans will love what Jose Mourinho had to say during Aston Villa derby</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United boss has been speaking about Wolves vs Aston Villa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:15:05+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Aidan McCartney, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/aidan-mccartney/</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho believes that Wolves were showing their true class against Aston Villa.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves </a>led 1-0 at half-time thanks to Ruben Neves' 41st minute strike during a half they dominated at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Villa were overrun at times by the rampant home side who were in control in the Midlands derby.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mourinho, who has been out of work since being sacked by Man United in December, revealed that he was concerned for Villa.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say I fear for Aston Villa, I’d say <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves </a>are the better team with the better players, with a tactical approach that some teams try to have it but not many are ready for it,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“Wolves are ready for it because they have played like this for the last three years.</p>
      <p>"They have big routines in these models of play, they are very physical and intense, they are in control and for a team like Villa, it’s always going to be hard for Villa.”</p>
      <p>Fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness criticised Villa's first half performance, adding: “Do you need 11 people back? Wolves haven’t committed everyone. It’s just bad organisation, there isn’t any way to dress it up. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Wolves were first to the ball, very aggressive. Villa have got some good players but you need the ball. Wolves were way too fast, way too aggressive and Villa need to shape themselves up. </p>
      <p>“You talk about tactics but if you haven’t got the ball, you can’t play football. I’d be telling the Villa players to get to the ball first and to see where that takes them.”</p>
