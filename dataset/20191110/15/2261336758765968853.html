      <p>Greg Hardy stepped in on short notice to face Alexander Volkov as the co-headliner of UFC Moscow on Saturday. Things didn’t go as planned for “The Prince of War,” who was dealt his second UFC loss via unanimous decision.</p>

      <p>During a post-fight interview with ESPN, Hardy admitted to some hesitance on his part, resulting to Volkov getting the better of him on the feet.</p>
      <p>“I kind of lost the use of my right hand after the first, so my mind was just, ‘Get comfortable,’” Hardy said of his performance (via <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/9/20957200/greg-hardy-in-tears-on-the-inside-after-ufc-moscow-loss-to-alexander-volkov">MMA Fighting</a>). “I kind of settled in front of him. I wanted to close distance a little bit more.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I got back into the game plan later in the fight, but you can’t fight somebody like Alexander Volkov and start in the middle of the second round.”</p>
      <p>Hardy was candid about how the loss devastated him, considering the expectations he set for himself. Nonetheless, he promises to bounce back stronger, treating it as a learning experience.</p>
      <p>”The bar where I want to get to is astronomically high,” he said . “It’s so far away from me that I’m in tears on the inside.</p>
      <p>”I have a lot to go, and I’m going to go get it. I’m going to sweat and bleed until it’s done. I will be the ‘King of War.’ But right now, I’m humbly bowing down as the ‘Prince of War’ in defeat to one of the best in the game right now.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to check out the film, see what I did wrong, (and) analyze it professionally,” he added. “But right now, the only thing that matters is the ‘W,’ and I didn’t leave with the ‘W,’ so that means there’s work to be done, and I didn’t do exactly what I said I was going to do. And that makes me feel very bad.”</p>
      <p>Hardy’s first UFC loss happened in January against Allen Crowder, where he was disqualified due to an illegal knee strike. After his fifth fight in a span of ten months, he now holds a professional record of 5-2 (with 1 NC and five wins by knockout).</p>
