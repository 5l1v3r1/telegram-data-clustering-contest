        <b>A day when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan didnâ€™t work out for India, KL Rahul took charge and scored a splendid fifty but without hitting any six. After his dismissal, it was young Shreyas Iyer who accelerated the innings and his long travelling sixes were just the icing on the cake.</b>

      <p>Had Mahmudullah foreseen what was going to occur in the next few minutes, he wouldnâ€™t have given the ball to the young Afif Hossain. Coming in to bowl his first over of the game, with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a> batting on 31 off 22 balls, the offspinner faced the wrath of the batsmanâ€™s power game. Using his muscles, Iyer powered his already swift innings and clobbered a huge six over long-on and into the stands. The ball travelled 97 metres and landed a few rows in front of Nagpur's outstanding press box. Following that, he punished the bowler once again on the next delivery, this time by stepping out and hitting the ball straighter just wide of the sightscreen. While it was shorter than the previous one, the ball still travelled a massive 91 metres! Captain Mahmudullah was then seen making his way toward the non-strikerâ€™s end. Afif took another run-up but stopped midway, showing the pressure was getting onto him. But the worst thing that couldâ€™ve happened to the bowler, happened yet again. Another six! And this time it was 98 metres, the longest of the three. Meanwhile, Iyer had already scored his highest T20I score and was at 49 when Afif finally broke the streak but choosing to bowl round the wicket. After scoring one dot, Iyer got to his maiden T20I fifty.</p>
