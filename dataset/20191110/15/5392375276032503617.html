      <p>Instagram to hide likes counter as soon as next week<br/>2 (40%) 1 vote</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tags/instagram">Instagram</a> is currently the world’s one of the most used social media apps, especially by generation Z. The photo and video sharing app owned by Facebook is now set to roll out a controversial update starting with the US. The popular app will soon hide the like counts on their platform.</p>
      <p>In case you are not aware of, Instagram has been already testing with a few numbers of users by removing the like counts. But now, Adam Mosseri, the company’s CEO <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/instagram-hiding-likes-adam-mosseri-tracee-ellis-ross-wired25/">announced</a> they would be extending this feature to a handful of users in the US. Previously, the company noted this move will reduce psychological effects on users thriving for impressions and reach on the platform.</p>

      <p>Instagram has been hiding the post like counts to a small set of users in countries like Canada, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand. The company wants people to worry less on the number of likes on their posts. They don’t want people to come under pressure by competing with themselves,  friends, and celebrities in terms of post likes. They want their users to share expression and not go blind over like counts.</p>
      <p>This bold move by Instagram is to improve the well-being of their users similar to what other tech giants on offering on their products(Google Digital Wellbeing &amp; Apple Screen Time).</p>
