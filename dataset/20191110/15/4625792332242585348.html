      <h1>Cindy McCain defends the Biden family against Trump’s accusations: ‘I was very disappointed’</h1>

      <p>Cindy McCain, the wife of the late Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, defended former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden against corruption allegations from President Trump.</p>
      <p>In a Saturday interview on CNN, McCain said she was “very disappointed” in Trump’s treatment of the Biden family amid accusations that Hunter Biden profited off the vice presidency.</p>
      <p>“Well, he’s my friend. I mean, I had the same reaction that any friend would have,” she said. “I was very disappointed in all of this.”</p>
      <p>McCain claimed Trump’s attacks on the Biden family are politically motivated.</p>
      <p>“There’s no reason to disparage anyone, you know, just because you disagree with them, and that’s kind of where we’re at right now,” she said.</p>
      <p>McCain vouched for Biden’s character, saying, “I think he’s a lovely man. I mean, I really do. I differ with him on his politics all too often, but that’s okay. Our friendship goes way beyond that.”</p>

      <p>She noted that she believes her husband would be disgusted with the partisanship that has unfolded in the wake of impeachment and claimed Republicans would have rallied behind him if he were still in the Senate.</p>
      <p>“I think he’d be disgusted with some of the stuff that’s going on. I really do. I think what he’d be saying is that he’d be railing against what’s going on,” she said. “I think John provided a lot of cover for other members, and when he would do it, then they could get behind him kind of thing, and I’m not seeing a real rudder in the Senate right now.”</p>
      <p>She alleged that Republicans are afraid to oppose Trump because it could harm their reelection odds.</p>
      <p>House Democrats launched impeachment proceedings against Trump last month for urging the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens for alleged corruption after the younger Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hunter-biden-it-was-poor-judgment-to-join-ukrainian-board">landed a high-paying position</a> on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was in office.</p>
