      <h1>Liverpool fans disappointed with Jurgen Klopp's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain decision</h1>
      <h2>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been in stunning form, and even won Liverpool's player of the month, but has only made the bench this Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T15:45:33+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool fans are disappointed to see that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has not been named in the starting XI to take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>The English midfielder has enjoyed a sensational month, even winning Liverpool's Standard Chartered Player of the Month award, but has been named on the bench by Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain was particularly impressive in the Reds' 4-1 win over Genk in the Champions League before netting a stunning goal in the Carabao Cup victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal.</a></p>
      <p>Reds supporters had hoped that Klopp would name him in the starting XI for the biggest game of their season to date against champions City in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>And many are making themselves hard on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , with one asking: "Where is Oxlade-Chamberlain?" and another adding: "Really wished Ox was starting, but we knew he'd stick with Henderson."</p>
      <p>Oxlade-Chamberlain spoke out recently about winning Liverpool's player of the month award.</p>
      <p>"Looking back, it was a really, really good month for me and a step in the right direction to where I want to get back to,"  <a href="https://video.liverpoolfc.com/player/0_i4hialzt"><b>he told Liverpoolfc.com</b> </a>upon receiving the Standard Chartered prize.</p>

      <p>"That's the thing with football, in the space of a week or two, a lot can change for an individual or a team – and I've sort of had that with Genk, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and then Genk again, with a really good win away at Aston Villa for us between as well.</p>
      <p>"It's been a bit of a crazy 10 days/two weeks, but it was really positive for myself with where I want to get back to.</p>

      <p>"In terms of goals, I don't think I've ever been as consistent before in the space of a couple of weeks, so that's been really nice, but I still think there's a long way to go for me to get my all-round game back to where it needs to be.</p>
      <p>"It was a good month moving in the right direction, for sure."</p>
