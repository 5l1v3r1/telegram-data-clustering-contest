      <p>Ohrid (Republic of North Macedonia) (AFP) - Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia discussed setting up a common market at a summit Sunday, weeks after the European Union snubbed bids by Skopje and Tirana to open membership talks.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the three countries met at Lake Ohrid, in North Macedonia, after the EU last month refused to start membership talks with Albania and North Macedonia.</p>
      <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, his North Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who launched the common market initiative in October, attended Sunday's meeting.</p>
      <p>"We should not be afraid of our own shadow and to do something for ourselves," Vucic told reporters.</p>
      <p>"We did not invent anything better for the past 30 years in the Balkans."</p>
      <p>"We all want to be part of EU," but "it depends on them," he added. Serbia opened membership talks with the bloc in 2014.</p>
      <p>This new initiative is aimed at establishing the free movement of goods and people by 2021 in the divided region.</p>
      <p>Bosnia, Montenegro and Kosovo have also been invited to take part in the project.</p>
      <p>But while Bosnia and Montenegro sent representatives to Sunday's meeting, Kosovo was absent.</p>
      <p>"The vision of Kosovo is its accession to EU and NATO" which cannot be replaced by "any other regional initiative", Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said in a message posted on social media.</p>
      <p>"This initiative makes no sense as long as Serbia and Bosnia do not recognise Kosovo independence."</p>
      <p>Serbia's former ethnic Albanian-majority province proclaimed independence in 2008, but Belgrade has still not recognised it. Nor does Bosnia, due to the opposition of Bosnian Serbs.</p>
      <p>The issue remains extremely sensitive in the Balkans region, which was torn apart in a series of wars in the 1990s that accompanied the collapse of Yugoslavia.</p>
      <p>Rama voiced regret over Pristina's stance over the initiative.</p>
      <p>"It is also in the interest of Kosovo, its citizens and market that the border between Kosovo and Serbia be abolished" despite the unresolved dispute between the two countries, he said.</p>
      <p>The three leaders present agreed on introducing a common work permit and allowing travel between the three countries with an ID card only.</p>
      <p>They also discussed setting up a "mini Schengen" visa-free zone to facilitate free movement of foreign visitors within the three countries.</p>
      <p>And they agreed to ease customs procedures and border controls to accelerate the passage of trucks.</p>
      <p>Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia have a combined population of nearly 20 million people.</p>
      <p>France led last month's opposition to the EU membership talks for Albania and North Macedonia, although Denmark and the Netherlands also expressed reservations.</p>
      <p>Albania will host the next meeting of the Balkans initiative on December 21.</p>
