      <p>“Lord Mawhinney was awarded life membership in 2012 for the significant contribution he made to the league during his seven years at the helm, during which he made a number of important introductions as part of a substantive programme of governance reforms.</p>
      <p>“He was also the driving force behind the league’s first solidarity arrangement with the Premier League, the formation of the Football League Trust and a significant rebranding to support subsequent commercial development.</p>
      <p>“Club owners, their respective teams and staff at the EFL remember Lord Mawhinney’s time at the league fondly and our collective thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad and difficult time.”</p>
