These are made with "moderate" arch support (per Amazon reviews), which provides stability. And according to customers who've tried them, these sneakers also offer supportive ankles and roomy toe boxes.</p>
      <p>What's even better is that these come with removable inserts made with foam that can be <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-4-best-insoles-for-heel-pain-18179180">replaced with orthotic linings</a> for a more customized and comfortable fit. Plus, the traction from the rubber outsoles make them for great for running on various outdoor surfaces. Available in a variety of colors, these sneakers are suitable for both sporting and everyday wear.</p>
      <p><b>Reviewers say</b>: "I am flat-footed with plantar fasciitis &amp; heel spur problems for years. This product is most helpful for arch support &amp; heel of the shoe also provides back support as well."</p>
