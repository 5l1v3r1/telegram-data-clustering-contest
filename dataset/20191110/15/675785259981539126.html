      <p>A bride-to-be has told how she's gutted after being mocked by her pals for wanting to wear a ‘lovely’ H&amp;M wedding dress on her big day.</p>
      <p>The woman revealed to Mumsnet website users that she decided to buy the dress from H&amp;M, which sells wedding frocks for between £56 and £200, to keep costs of her wedding down.</p>
      <p>But users of the site were outraged to hear the woman's mates were bemused by her purchase of the off-shoulder, lace design, and asked 'if she was definitely going to go with it?'.</p>
      <p>In her post titled 'To be surprised at reactions to wedding dress', the woman, who did not identify herself,  wrote: "Getting married next year and I had been somewhat dreading going into a shop to try on dresses.</p>
      <p>"All the ones round here are little boutiques where everything costs an arm and a leg and you have an assistant with you the whole time."</p>

      <p>"The woman revealed she had come across a dream white frock, that was within her budget, by accident.</p>
      <p>"Everyone agreed that the H&amp;M dress was the one - it fitted really well and looked well made.</p>
      <p>"Saw a photo of a lovely, fairly traditional dress from H&amp;M of all places (they're great but never knew they did properly formal dresses).</p>
      <p>"Had a look at the site and it turned out the dress was on sale because it was pretty much sold out except in my short a*** size."</p>
      <p>The woman explained how she decided the dress was perfect for her after ordering it online and trying it on in front of her mum-in-law.</p>

      <p>The woman shared pictures of a model wearing the same dress in the post.</p>

      <p>But said her dream dress was mocked by "good friends" after they heard where it was from.</p>
      <p>"I was so pleased and felt like it was sorted after that," she said</p>
      <p>"But as others started to ask if I'd got a dress and where it was from, the reaction has been one of bemusement, really.</p>
      <p>"I thought people would just say something vaguely positive and leave it there, but a number of good friends have asked if I'm definitely going to go with it, I'm not going to go to a 'proper shop' etc."</p>
      <p>The mum also asked Mumsnet users for advice on what she should do, writing: "Shall I take it that it's hideous then and my judgement is way off?!</p>
      <p>"Or shall I maybe just stop telling people where it's from as that and the price seem to be promoting the reactions?"</p>
      <p>But users reassured her and hit out at the comments of her mates.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Oh that dress is lovely. Ignore everyone's comments, you'll look fab."</p>
      <p>Another said: "People are daft. It’s lovely. Congratulations and I hope you have a lovely time in it!"</p>
      <p>A third added: "It’s absolutely gorgeous! And you will look utterly beautiful in it. Please don’t fret about where it came from! Wedding dress comments are usually borne of jealousy.</p>
      <p>"Be proud in the fact that you will look stunning for a more modest amount that will leave you with more spending money for your honeymoon or much needed home essentials."</p>
