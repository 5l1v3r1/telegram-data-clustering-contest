      <p>Although YNW Melly is behind bars facing a double murder charge and potentially the death penalty, he sounds like he's having a great time on Tay Money's new song, "Left Cheek, Right Cheek". If he's gonna star on a booty-shaking anthem laced with steely synths, how could he not? He belts out his half of the chorus in his usual whine, serving as a nice foil to Tay Money's nonchalant delivery.</p>
      <p>Tay Money hails from rural Athens, Texas, so you catch hints of a Southern accent while she raps. However, the music video for "Left Cheek, Right Cheek" appears to have been shot on in Miami. A puppet version of YNW Melly accompanies Tay and her bikini-clad friends on jet skis and to the club. The video ends with a clip from the studio session when the two rappers recorded this song, so turns out it wasn't a result of a mailed-in verse from jail. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ynw-melly-is-all-smiles-in-new-video-from-jail-watch-news.95040.html">Hopefully YNW Melly gets to see the music video, like he did for "223s"</a>, because he'll probably get a kick out puppet-him partying it up.</p>
