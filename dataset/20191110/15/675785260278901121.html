      <h1>Andy Gray identifies where Liverpool's title clash with Man City will be won or lost</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool play host to Manchester City, and victory could see them go nine points clear of the champions at the top of the table</h2>

      <p>Andy Gray reckons Manchester City's shaky defence could cost them in their crunch clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool.</a></p>
      <p>The Reds play host to City at Anfield, and victory could see them go nine points clear of the champions - putting them further in the driving seat to win a first Premier League title.</p>
      <p>The two sides are equally matched for the most part, but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> will be without a number of key players in defence - including goalkeeper Ederson.</p>
      <p>And Gray reckons <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will come out on top if their front three are in the mood.</p>
      <p>"If you look at the two teams - is it too simplistic for me to ask which one is stronger than the other?" asked Gray on <a href="https://twitter.com/beINSPORTS_EN/status/1193524318103162880">beIN SPORTS.</a></p>

      <p>"If you take the two front threes, there is nothing between them really.</p>
      <p>"Midfield creativity, City have more of it, if it's David Silva or [Kevin] de Bryune, they are more creative than any of Liverpool's three players but Liverpool play a typical type - they have an energy in defence.'</p>

      <p>"So where Liverpool have a big bonus is defensively, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the back four and goalkeeper today of Liverpool is better than Man City's back four and keeper. That might be it.</p>
      <p>"If City can't cope with [Mohamed] Salah, [Roberto] Firmino and [Sadio] Mane then they could lose the game."</p>
