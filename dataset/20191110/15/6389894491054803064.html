      <p>Chinese firm Jingye is set to agree a deal to buy British Steel tomorrow, in a move that is hoped to save more than 4,000 jobs at the company’s flagship plant in Scunthorpe.</p>
      <p>Advisers have been working on a draft agreement in recent days. Jingye is thought to be gearing up to pay a figure in the region of £70m, according to reports.</p>

      <p>Jingye will also be able to use a £300m taxpayer-funded support package, according to the Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>British Steel employs around 5,000 people in the UK, and supports about 20,000 further jobs in the supply chain. It is one of Network Rail’s main suppliers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cityam.com/chinese-steel-maker-jingye-in-new-bid-for-british-steel/">Jingye reentered the fray as a bidder</a> for the company when negotiations with Ataer Holding, an investment arm of the Turkish military’s pension fund, did not come to fruition during a period of exclusivity with the Official Receiver, which is managing the negotiations.</p>
      <p>The Chinese firm striking a deal would end months of uncertainty for British Steel workers, who have been in limbo since the firm went into administration in May.</p>
      <p>Any agreement tomorrow would be followed by weeks of further negotiations, with no guarantee a final deal would be reached.</p>
      <p>Labour’s shadow steel minister Gill Furniss said: “At this moment in time the workforce needs some reassurance.”</p>

      <p>Jingye Group is chaired by businessman Li Ganpo, one of the richest men in China.</p>
      <p>Ganpo and a group executives arrived in the North of England two weeks ago for a tour of the company’s flagship Scunthorpe plant and its factory on Teesside.</p>
      <p>Jingye was not available for comment.</p>
