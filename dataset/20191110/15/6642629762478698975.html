      <p>A prominent St Petersburg-based Napoleon scholar confessed to killing his young lover and former student and dismembering her body in a grisly crime that sent shock waves across <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a>.</p>
      <p>Oleg Sokolov, a 63-year-old history lecturer who received France's Legion d'Honneur in 2003, was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/murder.html">murder</a> after he was hauled out of the icy Moika River with a backpack containing a woman's arms.</p>
      <p>"He has admitted his guilt," Sokolov's lawyer Alexander Pochuev said, adding he regretted what he had done and was now cooperating with police.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was reportedly drunk and fell in as he tried to dispose of body parts.</p>
      <p>After getting rid of the body, he reportedly planned to commit suicide at the Peter and Paul Fortress, one of the former imperial capital's most famous landmarks, dressed as Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Sokolov teaches history at St Petersburg State University, President Vladimir Putin's alma mater, and was close to the Russian authorities.</p>
      <p>He told investigators he shot and killed his lover during an argument and then sawed off her head, arms and legs, local media reported.</p>
      <p>Pochuev suggested Sokolov may have been under stress or emotionally disturbed.</p>
      <p>"He is an elderly person," he said, adding he was being treated for hypothermia in a hospital.</p>
      <p>Police discovered the decapitated body of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24, with whom Sokolov had co-authored a number of works, and a blood-stained saw at his home.</p>

        <b>'Simply monstrous'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The historian, who also taught at Sorbonne University, is the author of books on French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>
      <p>He acted as a historical consultant on several films and took part in historical re-enactments of Napoleonic wars.</p>
      <p>Both he and his lover studied French history and liked to wear period costumes, with Sokolov dressing up as Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Students described Sokolov as a talented lecturer who could impersonate the French emperor and his generals and a "freak" who called his lover "Josephine" and liked to be addressed as "Sire".</p>
      <p>"What happened is simply monstrous," a St Petersburg State University lecturer said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said Sokolov was dedicated to his work but was also emotionally unstable and abused alcohol.</p>
      <p>His former student, Fyodor Danilov, said Sokolov was regarded as one of the university's best lecturers but an eccentric man who at times yelled in French.</p>
      <p>His relationship with Yeshchenko was an open secret, he said. "But everyone was fine with that, it was her own business," said Danilov.</p>
      <p>Many expressed dismay saying Sokolov had long been known for his hostile behaviour but officials had ignored complaints.</p>
      <p>Vasily Kunin, who studied with the victim, blamed the university management.</p>
      <p>"They did not pay attention to certain things. There was a certain policy of hushing things up," Kunin said.</p>
      <p>Media reports said Sokolov also beat up and threatened to kill another woman in 2008 but was never charged.</p>
