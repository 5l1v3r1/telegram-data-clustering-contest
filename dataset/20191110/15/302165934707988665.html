      <p>RIYADH, Nov 10 — Energy giant Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest company, has lifted the lid on its secretive operations in a prospectus ahead of a highly anticipated listing on the Riyadh stock exchange.</p>
      <p>As a legal requirement for its initial public offering, expected to be the world’s biggest, Aramco has published major risks and strengths that could impact the company’s operations.</p>
      <p>Here are the factors that the energy Goliath said investors must take into account: </p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s missing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most notable is what was not said in the prospectus. </p>
      <p>It did not disclose the size of the share sale or the pricing range, nor did it mention the company’s valuation and how much Aramco expects to raise from the IPO.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The risks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Climate change — Aramco conceded that during a time of transition to renewable energy sources, concerns over global warming could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and potentially affect its bottom line.</p>
      <p>“Climate change concerns... may reduce global demand for oil and propel a shift to lower carbon intensity fossil fuels such as gas or alternative energy sources,” it said.</p>
      <p>Geopolitical risk — With Saudi Arabia facing off with regional rival Iran, and leading a military coalition bogged down in a disastrous war in neighbouring Yemen, Aramco noted that political and social unrest in the region may affect its operations.</p>
      <p>In September, attacks on its Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oilfield temporarily halved the kingdom’s crude output and caused turmoil on global energy markets.</p>
      <p>Government control — The prospectus said Saudis Arabia’s government determines the kingdom’s maximum level of crude oil production and that public finances are highly connected to the hydrocarbon industry.</p>
      <p>This means Aramco does not have a final say on its level of crude production — a dynamic that analysts say could create tensions between the interests of the company and of the authorities. </p>
      <p>Results and cashflow — The company noted that its results and cashflow are significantly impacted by international crude oil supply and demand.</p>
      <p>Aramco’s income also depends on the price of oil which has fluctuated sharply since mid-2014 from a monthly average of US$112 (RM462) a barrel in June 2014 to a monthly average of US$31.9 a barrel in January 2016.</p>
      <p>In recent months, prices have hovered around the US$60 a barrel mark. </p>
      <p>
        <b>The strengths</b>
      </p>
      <p>Production — In 2018, Aramco produced 13.6 million barrels per day of oil equivalent including 10.3 million bpd of crude. </p>
      <p>Its total liquids production of 11.6 million bpd was over 20 per cent higher than the combined output of the five major international oil companies, among them BP and Shell.</p>
      <p>Reserves — Aramco reserves stood at 256.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of last year — sufficient for 52 years, much longer than the five major international oil companies who claim between nine and 17 years.</p>
      <p>Spare capacity — Saudi Arabia says it has a spare capacity of up to 12 million bpd, about two million bpd above daily production.</p>
      <p>Low production cost — Aramco production costs are among the lowest in the world due to the unique nature of the kingdom’s geological formations. Production costs in 2018 were US$2.80 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Company finances — The company is the world’s most profitable, posting US$111.1 billion in net profits last year and US$68.2 billion in the first nine months of 2019. — AFP</p>
