      <p>According to court documents, police were called about a possible drunken driver heading toward Zelienople from Beaver County. The driver, a man, was believed to be suicidal and armed with a handgun. He was involved in a prior shooting in Rochester in Beaver County.</p>
      <p>The car was being tracked using the onboard GPS and dispatchers relayed to police that it had stopped at a Speedway gas station in Jackson Township. </p>
      <p>When police got there, the man ran from the convenience store and into the woods nearby. A K-9 was brought in to track him on the ground while a state police helicopter was called in to use thermal and night vision technology from the air.</p>
      <p>The man was found after a short time and arrested. He is charged with felonious aggravated assault among other charges.</p>
      <p>Police have not yet released his identity.</p>
