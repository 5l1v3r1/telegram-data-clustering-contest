      <p>The Conservatives have sparked a furious political row with Labour over claims that a Jeremy Corbyn government would splurge over £1 trillion on its policy pledges.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Tory attack was “fake news” while government ministers came unstuck amid questions about their own spending commitments.</p>

      <p>With economic policy set to take centre-stage during the campaign, Conservative strategists believe Labour is vulnerable to the charge that its policies would “bankrupt the country.”</p>
      <p>Chancellor Sajid Javid has also vowed to ramp up public spending but refused yesterday to put a precise figure on the costs.</p>
      <p>Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng was asked yesterday by Sky News how much the Tories would spend if they won the 12 December election.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m not going to bandy around figures” and said the manifesto would be costed when it was finalised.</p>
      <p>Javid also refused to give away further details of the Conservatives’ spending plans, telling  the BBC: “I’m not going to get into individual policies today.”</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have pledged to end austerity after the election with spending promises of an extra £20bn a year on capital projects, and an extra £7bn and £34bn for the education and health budgets respectively over the next three years.</p>
      <p>Labour, meanwhile, has pledged<b> </b>to double net capital spending to £100bn a year.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives claim that a Labour government would spend an additional £1.2 trillion over a five-year term, citing the cost of Labour’s 2017 manifesto as well as policies passed by the party in subsequent party conferences.</p>
      <p>Javid said Labour’s plans would “lead to an economic crisis within months”.</p>
      <p>McDonnell said the analysis was “an incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths cooked up because they know Labour’s plans for real change are popular.”</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats’ treasury spokesperson Ed Davey said both parties’ costings need to be scrutinised by the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
      <p>He accused Labour and the Tories of engaging in a “battle to splash the cash”.</p>

      <p>Reports emerged yesterday that voters may be treated to a televised head-to-head debate between Javid and McDonnell.</p>
      <p>The two sides are apparently wrangling over the details.</p>
