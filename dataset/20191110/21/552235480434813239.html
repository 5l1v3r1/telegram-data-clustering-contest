      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Irvine Vics</a> manager Brian McLuckie called for fans to be patient with his young side after their winless run continued with a 3-1 defeat to Arthurlie in the West of Scotland Cup yesterday.</p>
      <p>The Westenders last recorded a victory in August – a 3-2 win over Gartcairn – and their first-round exit means they are out of all the cups this season.</p>
      <p>Avoiding relegation in the West Region Championship is now all Vics have left to play for and McLuckie insists his team will be fine once they string a run of positive results together.</p>
      <p>He said: “If you look at our team, it’s all young boys. We must have had about six teenagers on the pitch and we can struggle a bit away from home, especially when heads go down.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of teams in our league that have got experienced Junior players and that’s the big difference.</p>
      <p>“Our objective is stay in the league. We’ve got the lowest budget in the division but two or three wins and we will be back up the table.”  </p>
      <p>Arthurlie opened the scoring early at Dunterlie when Daniel McKay’s mishit shot found its way through to Daniel Kindlan in the box.</p>
      <p>His first effort was well saved by Jamie Walker but the young keeper could do nothing to stop Kindlan tucking in the rebound.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Barrhead men then doubled their lead when Kindlan’s corner found the head of McKay who netted.</p>
      <p>The Westenders pulled one back against the run of play on the counterattack with Jonny Baxter smashing the ball into the bottom corner of the net.</p>
      <p>Lie’s two-goal lead was quickly restored, however, when McKay teed up Lee Roulston who slotted home.</p>
      <p>McLuckie added: “I’m not under any pressure in my position whatsoever, zero.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We are up here again soon and we know what we need to do. Our only objective now is to get <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-junior-football-association">league points.</a></p>
      <p>“There are areas that we know that we need to work on when we play them and there are areas where we know we can exploit them and hopefully get three points off them.”</p>
      <p>Arthurlie manager Duncan Sinclair said: “I thought we played Vics off the park in the first half but fair credit to them, the second half was more of a battle.</p>
      <p>“Overall, we played some really good stuff and could have scored more goals.”</p>
