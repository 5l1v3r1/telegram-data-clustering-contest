      <p>US President Donald Trump appears to have landed in hot water while attending the recent Alabama-LSU football game as some observant viewers took note of his rendition of the national anthem at the event.</p>
      <p>A video which surfaced online shows that Trump seems to have stopped singing at the penultimate line, even as the people around him continued to sing, with the Independent even suggesting that the president appeared to “forget the words”.</p>
