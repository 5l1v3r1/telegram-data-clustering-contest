      <p>Nick Johnson said he was left unemployed for two months despite his qualifications, which led him to pound the pavement in his search for work, WFLA <a href="https://www.wkrg.com/news/florida-man-finds-new-job-after-handing-out-his-resume-on-streets/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Bachelor’s in construction, management from Purdue University, and I have a Masters in global entrepreneur management from the University of San Francisco,” says Johnson.</p>
      <p>It was a hot day outside in Tampa when he decided to panhandle his resume out to folks at a busy intersection between West Cypress Street and North Westshore Boulevard.</p>
      <p>“Very hot. I was dressed business professional. I had a sign that said, ‘Masters in Management. Looking for a career. Please take a resume,’” Johnson said.</p>
      <p>“They were honking, hey come over! Let me take a resume,” he recalls. “People were literally stopping, making U-turns to come back around just to meet with me.”</p>
      <p>His resume stunt went viral on social media, leading to 17 interviews within the span of a week. As for Johnson, he is set to take his new job at an engineering firm in Houston, Texas, leaving Tampa behind.</p>
      <p>Johnson is not the first man to get a job offer after pulling a similar stunt. In July, a Phoenix man went viral for <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2019/07/31/man-hands-out-resumes-side-road-gets-hundreds-job-offers/">standing</a> outside in 110-degree heat handing out his resume looking for a job, and in that same month, a homeless man in Silicon Valley, California, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/07/29/homeless-man-resumes-200-job-offers/">handed</a> out his resume instead of asking for money.</p>
      <p>Both people got hundreds of job offers.</p>
