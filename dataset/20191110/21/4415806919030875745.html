      <p>A Sinn Féin TD is expressing concern over the future of 120 jobs in Arklow, County Wicklow.</p>
      <p>John Brady is calling on Enterprise Ireland and the government to do everything in their power to save the jobs at Rondo Foods.</p>
      <p>He says staff have been told the future of the company in Ireland is uncertain and it could potentially close at the end of January.</p>
      <p>Deputy Brady says it's a worrying development:</p>
      <p>"I am seriously concerned about the future of the 120 jobs at Rondo Foods in Arklow amid reports of potential job losses looming," he said.</p>
      <p>"Management met with staff on Friday and said the future for Rondo Foods in Ireland was uncertain and that they could potentially close at the end of January," he explained.</p>
      <p>The Wicklow TD said that the potential closure would be "devastating" for the area.</p>
      <p>"I have been in contact with Enterprise Ireland and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation Heather Humphreys to see that they do everything in their power to protect these jobs.”</p>
