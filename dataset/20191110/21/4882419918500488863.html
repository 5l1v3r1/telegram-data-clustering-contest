      <p>"What happened today is we showed why we are the champions," Guardiola said. "In this stadium with the way we played was incredible and I'm proud of my team more than ever.</p>
      <p>"We put in an incredible performance in this stadium against the best team in Europe and with the way we played, I'm so proud. We played so good.</p>
      <p>"We are playing in the way which shows why we are back-to-back champions.</p>
      <p>"There are still seven months and if Liverpool win [the Premier League], I will be the first to congratulate them because we cannot deny how good they are, but they way they play, they create the chances with this personality to play all the time."</p>
