      <h1>UND's Junior Class Steps Up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:26:29+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/goon48/" target="_blank">Eric J. Burton</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday night, UND recorded its first conference sweep of the 2019-20 season. How did we get there? On Friday night, the Hawks rolled the RedHawks 7-1. Saturday night, it was a bit closer, with UND winning 5-4. No matter who you’re playing, sweeps don’t come easy in the NCHC. Last season, UND has two conference sweeps.</p>
      <p>Last season, UND never <a href="https://www.collegehockeynews.com/schedules/team/North-Dakota/40/20182019">won more than five games</a> in a row. This season, UND is <a href="http://collegehockeynews.com/schedules/team/North-Dakota/40/20192020">currently on a five-game winning streak</a>. During those five games, UND has outscored the opposition 21-8. This weekend, that winning streak will be under attack when the Hawks take on their hated rival the no. 1-ranked Denver Pioneers.</p>

      <p>It will be interesting to see how well that tweet ages. I am guessing we will see that tweet again if UND takes more than a point next weekend.</p>

      <p>First, the Fighting Hawks top forward line is getting it done. Something that they lacked last season. This past weekend, the forward line of comprised of junior forwards <a href="https://www.collegehockeynews.com/players/career/Grant-Mismash/32620">Grant Mismash</a>, <a href="https://www.collegehockeynews.com/players/career/Collin-Adams/32621">Collin Adams</a> and<a href="https://www.collegehockeynews.com/players/career/Jordan-Kawaguchi/32611"> Jordan Kawaguchi</a> were unbelievable, they scored (3g-7a–10pts). Moreover, they were a cumulative plus-nine on Saturday night. That’s pretty impressive. If Kawaguchi isn’t the NCHC offensive player of the week, I will be highly surprised.</p>
      <p>For the weekend, junior forward, Collin Adams scored (3g-0a–3pts) against the RedHawks. This season, Adams has elevated his game, currently, he’s on a six-game point streak. After struggling his first two seasons, Adams is developing into a good first-line, top-six player.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s being older, the confidence level,” Adams said. “Knowing that I can play in this league and make an impact… Bubbs having the confidence in me and putting me out there on the ice has helped me grow as a player.”</p>

      <p>Adam’s linemate, junior forward, Jordan Kawaguchi recorded (1g-5a–6pts) in the series against the RedHawks, and is also on fire. He’s currently on a five-game point streak (3g-7a–10pts) and has vaulted to the top of the UND scoring race.</p>
      <p>Another junior that has stepped up is defenseman <a href="http://collegehockeynews.com/players/career/Matt-Kiersted/33254">Matt Kierstad.</a> He’s on a three-game points streak and has scored (1g-4a–5pts).</p>
      <h3>Breaking Down the Numbers</h3>
      <p>Looking at the numbers, the junior class is leading the team in scoring (12g-24a–35 pts). Breaking it down further, the junior class has scored 31.0% of UND’s goals.</p>
      <p>The senior class is second in scoring with (13g-15a–28pts) and they’ve also scored 33.3% of UND’s goals.</p>
      <p>The sophomore class is third with (10g-17a–27pts). The sophomores have scored 26.0% of UND’s goals.</p>
      <p>Finally, the freshmen class has scored (4g-11a–15pts). Forward Harrison Blaisdell leads all UND freshmen with (2g-5a–7pts) he’s also a plus-six. Against the RedHawks, Blaisdell had (0g-3a–3pts). In his young career, he already has two multi-point games.</p>
      <h3>UND’s Low Penalty Minute Total</h3>
      <p>Early in the season, UND isn’t taking a lot of penalties. Currently, UND is ranked 54th in the nation in Penalty Minutes averaging 8.1 minutes per game. That’s not a misprint. For comparison sake, last season, <a href="http://collegehockeystats.net/1819/national/d1m">Colorado College was 50th averaging 9.3 minutes per game</a>. This season, Omaha is leading the nation averaging 19.2 penalty minutes per game.</p>
      <p>For the most part, they’ve played disciplined hockey and stayed out of the penalty box. On Saturday, they had a parade to the penalty box. Big picture, head coach Brad Berry isn’t all that concerned about it.</p>
      <p>“If we did it each, and every night then I’d be concerned,” Berry said. “Unless we take a bunch more going forward, and we see a pattern. Tonight, we addressed how we do it. Not only as a team but individually as far as the guys are taking the penalties. Then you go from there. But like I said until that happens consecutively, that number, then we’ll make that change.”</p>
      <h3>Deep Dive into the Numbers</h3>
      <p>UND’s offense is ranked fourth in the nation, averaging 4.33 GPG.<br/>Only one team has scored more goals than UND, Providence 41 goals.<br/>UND’s defense is tied for second in the nation, allowing 1.67 GAPG<br/>UND is third in the nation in scoring margin, 2.67.<br/>UND’s power play is ranked 38th in the nation, (5/34, 14.7%)<br/>UND’s penalty kill is ranked sixth in the nation (27/29, 93.1%).</p>
