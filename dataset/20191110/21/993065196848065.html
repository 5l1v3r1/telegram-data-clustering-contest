      <p>“I’ve always admired Britain,” she said at Southbank Centre’s Royal Festival Hall.</p>
      <p>“I am, as a great admirer, concerned because I can’t make sense of what is happening.</p>
      <p>“In my own country as well. I don’t understand it.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to figure out exactly where you’re headed.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Clinton said she was aware of the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>“We really do count on you coming out of this in a smart and effective, successful way, however it turns out,” she said.</p>
      <p>She added it was important for democracies to stick together given the pressure from “dictatorships and authoritarian regimes”.</p>
      <p>Mrs Clinton said that she has seen the UK “sort of shrink” and “turn inward”.</p>
      <p>“To be trying to separate yourself from Europe at a time when democracies need to stick together, because we are truly under pressure from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We have a president who admires dictators and takes their help and does all kind of crazy stuff.</p>
      <p>“We need you to be the sane member of this partnership going forward.”</p>
