      <h1>Ethereum Price Analysis: In The Footsteps of Bitcoin, ETH Is Back Above $190</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:18:05+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Yaz Sheikh</a></address>
      <p>Ethereum saw a small increase of 2.85% over the past 24 hours and it currently trades at $191. This was largely been helped by the 2.74% spike seen in Bitcoin today. Ethereum is now trading at resistance provided by the 100-days EMA with a break above sending us well above $200. </p>
      <p>ETH remains the second-largest cryptocurrency as it holds a market cap of $20.62 billion. </p>
      <h3>Looking at the ETH/USD 1-day chart:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Since <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-price-analysis-could-eth-finally-breach-the-200-benchmark/">our previous ETH/USD analysis</a>, ETH fell below the 100-days EMA but remained supported at the $185 region. In today’s session, ETH got back up to the resistance at $191.</li>
        <li>From above: The nearest level of resistance lies at the 100-days EMA. Above this, resistance is at $193.66 and $200. The resistance at $200 is further strengthened by the 200-days EMA. Above $200, resistance lies at $202.74, $211.75, $218.25, $220, $225, and $227.57.</li>
        <li>From below: The nearest level of support lies at $185. Beneath this, support is found at $180, $176.48, $171.87, $170, $165.42, and $160.</li>
        <li>The trading volume has remained average during November but may increase if we break above the 100-days EMA.</li>
        <li>The RSI has rebounded at the 50 level to show that the bulls still remain in control over the market momentum. </li>
      </ul>
