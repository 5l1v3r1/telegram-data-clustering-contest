      <p>A tourist is in a critical condition after a giraffe fell on top of a safari vehicle at the Kruger National Park, according to SA National Parks. </p>
      <p>The giraffe was killed in the incident which happened on Sunday, spokesperson Ike Phaahla said.  </p>
      <p>"A taxi carrying visitors to Letaba was involved in an accident south of Mopani. From the initial observation, it looks like the taxi hit the giraffe and the giraffe fell on top of the safari vehicle which was following the taxi," Phaahla told News24.   </p>
