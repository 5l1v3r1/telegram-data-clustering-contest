      <h2>Premier League prediction latest | Jurgen Klopp's side widened the gap to second-placed Leicester City to eight points with the Reds hoping to end a 30-year wait for a title</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:04:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>The latest international break is upon us, with 12 Premier League matches gone and the table starting to take shape.</p>
      <p>The final weekend of action before the break saw a number of eye-catching results, with Liverpool extending their lead at the top by defeating Manchester City, Leicester City beating fellow top-four rivals Arsenal and Newcastle United picking up another valuable three points.</p>
      <p>Now, the significance of those results has been determined by a supercomputer created by <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/premier-league/">FiveThirtyEight</a> , which has predicted the outcome of all the vital battles in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Overall, it’s great news for Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp’s side are given a 67% likelihood of finally bringing an end to a 30-year wait for a league title, with City now just 29% likely to lift the title for the third season in a row.</p>

      <p>Beneath them, Frank Lampard’s stellar work at Chelsea is predicted to be fruitful come May as the Blues are given an 81% likelihood of securing Champions League football, with Leicester 63% likely of booking their spot in Europe’s elite competition.</p>
      <p>That means it’s not good news for Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal, all of whom are given less than a 20% likelihood to secure their spot in midweek European action next term.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile at the bottom of the table, the prediction clearly believes Norwich City are doomed as they are handed a 74% likelihood to suffer an immediate return to the Championship, with Southampton 43% likely to join them.</p>
      <p>The final spot is claimed by Watford, handed a 39% likelihood of relegation, with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> at 30%, West Ham at 28% and Newcastle at 20% all surviving to enjoy another campaign in the top-flight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> are backed for a mid-table campaign, with their chances of being relegated and qualifying for the Champions League at five per cent and three per cent respectively.</p>
