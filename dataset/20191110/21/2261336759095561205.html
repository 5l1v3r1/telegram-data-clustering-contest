      <p>Nate Diaz believes UFC 244 opponent Jorge Masvidal was on the verge of giving up in their ‘BMF’ title bout earlier this month at Madison Square Garden.</p>

      <p>Masvidal, who battered Diaz from pillar-to-post for the entire contest, has offered the former UFC lightweight title challenger a rematch following the controversial doctor stoppage at the end of round three, but Diaz doesn’t seem interested.</p>
      <p>Diaz probably doesn’t want an immediate rematch because, in his mind, he already made ‘Gamebred’ quit — at least mentally — at UFC 244.</p>

      <p>“This is the time in the fight where him and I realized he didn’t wanna be in this fight anymore,” the Stockton slugger posted on Twitter yesterday night.</p>
      <p>Following the loss, Diaz hinted at another extended hiatus from MMA but the 34-year-old backtracked on those comments when speaking to ESPN’s Ariel Helwani on Saturday, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/10/20957386/nate-diaz-says-he-isnt-retired-ill-fight-tonight">claiming he’d ‘fight tonight’ if given the opportunity</a>.</p>
      <p>“Who said I was retired? I’ll fight tonight,” he said. “I’ll fight forever. I’m never going to retire, that’s for sure.”</p>
