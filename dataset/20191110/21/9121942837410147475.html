      <p>BANGKOK (AP) — Shares declined Monday in Asia as investors watched for the latest developments in the China-U.S. trade war saga.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong led the retreat, with the Hang Seng falling 2.1% to 27,062.49 by mid-morning after a police officer wounded a protester in a shooting. Demonstrators blocked subway lines and roads in the southern Chinese financial hub during the Monday morning commute.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty has risen in the city after more than five months of protests that began with a fight over an extradition bill that has expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>The Shanghai Composite index declined 1.2% to 2,928.04, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.2% to 23,342.05. South Korea’s Kospi dropped 0.7% to 2,122.32.</p>
      <p>Australia’s S&amp;P ASX/200 was the sole major index to advance, gaining 0.5% to 6,759.90. Shares fell in Taiwan and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Hopes for a breakthrough in the trade standoff between Beijing and Washington were shaken when President Donald Trump on Friday dismissed a Chinese official’s assertion that the U.S. side had agreed to roll back some tariffs on Chinese goods that it has imposed in the conflict over trade and technology policies.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman said Thursday that the two sides had agreed to a phased cancellation of their tariff hikes as part of an agreement now under negotiation.</p>
      <p>“They’d like to have a rollback,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I haven’t agreed to anything.”</p>
      <p>That raised doubts over progress officials had suggested was being made in finalizing a “Phase 1” deal that was announced on Oct. 12.</p>
      <p>A private sector source with knowledge of the talks said Thursday that the U.S. had agreed to suspend the duties Trump threatened to impose on Dec. 15th on about $160 billion of Chinese imports as part of the agreement. But there is dissension within the White House about whether and by how much to roll back 15% duties imposed on Sept. 1 on another $112 billion of goods.</p>
      <p>“It will be the U.S.-China trade talks that will continue to dictate the daily swings in sentiment this week,” Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.</p>
      <p>“What matters is getting some sort of interim trade deal across the line for both sides. President Trump’s comments sounded more like a negotiating tactic than an actual threat, and Wall Street seemed to agree.”</p>

      <p>Shares in New York ended last week with healthy gains, though stocks wobbled between small gains and losses on Friday, amid the conflicting signals about the trade talks.</p>
      <p>In the end, the S&amp;P 500 rallied in the last hour of trading, closing at a record 3,093.08, up 0.3%. That was the fifth straight week of gains for the index, which matches its longest winning streak in the last two years.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up less than 0.1%, to 27,681.24, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.5% to 8,475.31.</p>
      <p>Walt Disney jumped 3.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected, thanks in part to its “Toy Story 4″and “The Lion King” movies. The company also said it received a positive response from a test of its planned streaming service, Disney Plus.</p>
      <p>On the losing end was Gap, which sank 7.6% for the largest loss in the S&amp;P 500 after the retailer slashed its profit forecast for the year. It also announced the resignation of its CEO, Art Peck.</p>
      <p>Benchmark crude oil lost 47 cents to $56.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 9 cents on Friday to settle at $57.24 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Brent crude oil, the international standard, lost 52 cents to $61.99 per barrel. It rose 22 cents on Friday to $62.51 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The dollar fell to 109.03 Japanese yen from 109.18 yen on Friday. The euro rose to $1.1024 from $1.1021.</p>
