      <h1>Jose Mourinho explains why he was "upset" after Liverpool's win over Man City</h1>
      <h2>Former Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho hit out at the VAR decision from the fifth minute of Liverpool's Premier League win over Manchester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:38:41+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:38</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho said the inconsistency of VAR left him feeling upset following Liverpool's Premier League win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>VAR was called into action in just the sixth minute of Sunday's title crunch match at Anfield after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> opened the scoring through Fabinho.</p>
      <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold had handled the ball in his own area in the build-up to the goal, but a VAR check ruled his arm wasn't in an unnatural position and no penalty was awarded.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss Pep Guardiola was incensed by the decision, and sarcastically thanked referee Mike Riley after the final whistle.</p>
      <p>Mourinho discussed VAR in the Sky Sports studio following the game and sympathised with the Spaniard, admitting the technology's inconsistency upsets him.</p>

      <p>"I think we've spoken enough about it and I think the main question is just consistency," said the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss.</p>
      <p>"That's what really upsets me in the game, in this moment, that one weekend it's not a penalty and next week it's going to be a penalty. For me that's the crucial point of it.</p>
      <p>"The game was so good and there is so much to speak about the game that I think enough is enough.</p>

      <p>On Liverpool's impressive counter-attack move, which directly lead to the goal, the Portuguese added: "Yeah of course [City could have prevented the goal], there's no doubt about it.</p>
      <p>"And I think everybody knows how strong Liverpool is in these situations.</p>
      <p>"Everybody knows how they play and the way they manage to only leave [Mohamed] Salah and [Sadio] Mane in privileged positions for these transitions.</p>

      <p>"Everybody knows the positions they like to attack and you see the way they score both goals, the second and the third.</p>
      <p>"City is too good to be now crying for a week about an incident, they should focus also on the game, what they could do better."</p>
