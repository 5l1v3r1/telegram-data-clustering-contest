      <h2>Keith Vaz, of the Labour Party, has quit ahead of the General Election 2019 after he was found to have "expressed willingness" to purchase cocaine for others</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:17:07+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:17</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>Shamed MP Keith Vaz is to stand down before the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> MP, who was facing suspension from the Commons for six months after he was found to have "expressed willingness" to purchase cocaine for others, will not stand at the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>Sunday Mirror exposed the Leicester East MP in September 2016. It found Vaz called himself Jim and posed as an industrial washing machine salesman.</p>
      <p>In response to the 62-year-old's announcement, Labour leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said: "Keith Vaz was among the pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987. I was proud to support his selection and incredibly proud when he won, taking the seat from the Tories.</p>
      <p>"Keith has made a substantial and significant contribution to public life, both as a constituency MP for the people of Leicester and for the Asian community across the country. He has helped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics.</p>

      <p>"His work in Parliament has been exemplary, as Britain's first Asian origin Minister, Chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, a campaigner on diabetes issues, and most recently trying to help the peace process in Yemen.</p>
      <p>"Our work to combat racism and bring our diverse communities together is far from over."</p>
      <p>Vaz apologised and quit as chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee after the secret came to light.</p>

      <p>Prior to this, a video showing Vaz speaking using loudspeakers from a campaign car upset the Tories in Leicester.</p>
      <p>Using a loudspeaker on the street is an offence that carries a penalty of up to £5,000.</p>
      <p>Leicester City Council investigated Vaz and confirmed it was illegal but that no action would be taken.</p>
