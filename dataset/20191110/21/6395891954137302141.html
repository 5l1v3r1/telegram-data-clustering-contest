      <p>Jefferson was the father of Atatiana Jefferson, who was <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/texas-police-officer-fatally-shoots-woman-inside-her-own-home-investigators-say/996787006">playing video games</a> with her <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/who-was-atatiana-jefferson-woman-killed-in-her-home-by-fort-worth-police-officer-/997388484?utm_source=homestream&amp;utm_medium=site_navigation&amp;utm_campaign=homestream_click">8-year-old nephew</a> in the early hours of Oct. 12. Atatiana Jefferson apparently heard a noise in the backyard of her home, grabbed a handgun and walked toward a window,<a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Atatiana-Jeffersons-Father-Dies-Weeks-After-Daughters-Death-564714351.html"> KXAS</a> reported.</p>
      <p>That's when a Fort Worth police officer, identified as Aaron Dean, 34, failed to announce himself as a police officer before he fired a shot that struck and killed the 28-year-old woman, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>Dean resigned before he could be fired by Fort Worth police officials, <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/special-reports/atatiana-jefferson/father-of-atatiana-jefferson-dies-family-spokesperson-confirms/287-2695dad6-01bc-49eb-8073-1365c52a504e">WFAA</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Carter said Marquis Jefferson had not been ill before he was felled by the heart attack, <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Atatiana-Jeffersons-Father-Dies-Weeks-After-Daughters-Death-564714351.html">KXAS</a> reported.</p>
      <p>"It's just sad because of grief. I don't know what else to say. Less than a month ago, he was working at El Centro, mentoring kids twice a week. He just couldn't get back from what happened with his daughter," Carter told the television station.</p>
      <p>Marquis Jefferson had filed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q947ijEX5-k&amp;feature=emb_logo">temporary restraining order</a> last month against some of his daughter's relatives to stop Atatiana Jefferson's funeral and gain control of the arrangements, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/10/father-atatiana-jefferson-who-was-shot-dead-by-police-texas-four-weeks-ago-has-died/">The Washington Post</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The funeral was held Oct. 24 after a settlement was reached, <a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Atatiana-Jeffersons-Father-Dies-Weeks-After-Daughters-Death-564714351.html">KXAS</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Marquis Jefferson told <a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/10/13/atatiana-jeffersons-father-on-the-shooting-death-of-his-only-daughter/">KTVT</a> last month he bonded with his daughter through their mutual passion for reading.</p>
      <p>“When she was growing up, I read to her a lot. I bought her a lot of books,” Marquis Jefferson told the television station. “Oh, she loved to read all the time. Her mother would tell me, ‘She’s in there reading, reading, reading.’”</p>
      <p>Atatiana Jefferson's death occurred less than two weeks after former Dallas police Officer Amber Guyger was convicted of murdering Botham Jean, a black man shot in 2018 as he ate ice cream in his home.</p>
      <p>After Guyger was sentenced, Jean's brother and the judge hugged her. </p>
      <p>Marquis Jefferson said last month he was not planning a similar embrace when the case went to trial.</p>
      <p>“Unlike Botham Jean, I don’t want no hug. That’s my one and only daughter,” Marquis Jefferson told <a href="https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/10/13/atatiana-jeffersons-father-on-the-shooting-death-of-his-only-daughter/">KTVT.</a> “I’ll never forget that.”</p>
