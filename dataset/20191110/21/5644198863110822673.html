      <p>SHANGHAI: Kento Momota won his 10th title of a remarkable year as Japan's world number one defeated Chou Tien-chen to retain his Fuzhou China Open badminton crown on Sunday (Nov 10).</p>
      <p>Home hope Chen Yufei similarly successfully defended the women's title with a gritty victory over Japan's Nozomi Okuhara.</p>

      <p>Reigning two-time world champion Momota battled past Taiwan's world number two Chou 21-15, 17-21, 21-18 in a repeat of last year's final.</p>
      <p>Chou saved one match point, but handed Momota the title by hitting into the net. The Japanese player fell onto his back and screamed in celebration, his fists clenched.</p>
      <p>Momota lost the final of the Indonesian Masters in January to Denmark's Anders Antonsen and said that defeat sparked his incredible run of titles.</p>
      <p>"I was in form in Indonesia and I was very disappointed when I lost," said the 25-year-old, whose haul in 2019 includes another world crown and the prestigious All England Open.</p>
      <p>"I used that as motivation to work harder. I didn't want to lose another final so I've put in a lot of effort."</p>
      <p>The women's final was a similarly gruelling affair and likewise went to three games.</p>
      <p>China's Chen lost the first game 21-9 to Okuhara but recovered to lift the Fuzhou title for the second year in a row by winning the next two 21-12, 21-18.</p>
      <p>It was more disappointment for Okuhara, who has now lost all six finals she has contested this year.</p>
      <p>"I tried my best, but it wasn't enough," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's very painful to accept. I'm very disappointed that I lost another final."</p>
      <p>In contrast, this was Chen's fifth tournament triumph this year.</p>
      <p>"I feel honoured and proud of myself," she said.</p>
