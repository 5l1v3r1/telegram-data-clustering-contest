      <h1>Driver staggered at £400k bill for hiring car while accident claim was being resolved</h1>
      <h2>Susan Harries, who crashed her £10k Audi near Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, hired a Mercedes C220 through an independent company but it cost her £300 per day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:26:27+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A driver was given a £400,000 bill for the hired <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/motoring/">Mercedes</a> she used while her accident claim was being resolved.</p>
      <p>Susan Harries had the high-powered Mercedes C220 for three years through an independent firm.</p>
      <p>It promised it would cover the cost of the rental, only if Ms Harrie was not to blame for the smash.</p>
      <p>But it was deemed her "negligent driving" was the cause and Ms Harries has had to cough up £400,000 - as the car cost £300 per day.</p>
      <p>The woman drove her £10,000 Audi into a parked Honda near Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, back in 2016.</p>
      <p>Typically, these independent companies approach drivers after an accident with offers while the driver's insurer works out who is to blame.</p>

      <p>They usually claim the cost of the hire from the at-fault driver's insurer, but only if the person who takes out the policy is not at fault.</p>
      <p>If they are at fault, they need to pay the bill themselves.</p>
      <p>But Richard Hiscocks from insurer Aviva said Ms Harries's case "highlights how far credit hire organisations are willing to go to pursue profit."</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Compare it - Make a list of the comparison websites (the main ones are Moneysupermarket, <a href="https://www.confused.com/car-insurance">Confused.com</a>, <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p%2879767%29a%282447058%29g%2818427918%29url%28http%3A%2F%2Fwww.comparethemarket.com%2Fcar-insurance%2F%29">Comparethemarket</a>, <a href="http://clk.omgt1.com/?PID=3503&amp;AID=709908">GoCompare</a> ) and work your way through them to find the cheapest offerings.</li>
        <li>Ring them - It is important to note that you won't find insurers like <a href="https://www.directline.com/int">Direct Line</a>, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aviva.co.uk%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;id=76202X1526515&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcar-insurance-mistake-thats-costing-10132664">Aviva</a> or <a href="https://www.zurich.co.uk/en/personal">Zurich</a> on price comparison sites and they are three of the largest insurers. Get a quote online or ring them (you have a better chance at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/how-haggle-high-street-win-9016290">haggling</a> on the latter).</li>
        <li>Add someone to your policy - Adding an additional driver to your policy – especially if they are an older, more experienced motorist – can bring the cost of cover right down. Just remember - don’t make them the main driver if that isn't true.</li>
        <li>Swap your job title - If your job fits in more than one category check the quotes for all of them before applying. For more on how your job affects your car insurance, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gocompare.com%2Fcar-insurance%2Fhow-your-job-affects-your-car-insurance%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;id=76202X1526515&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcar-insurance-mistake-thats-costing-10132664">check out GoCompare’s guide</a>. If you’re a full time parent or retired make absolutely sure you check that box and not ‘unemployed’ as it could save you almost £300.</li>
        <li>Pay upfront - It'll cost you less if you can pay in one go - so where possible do it.</li>
        <li>Get money back on your policy - Topcashback is offering <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.topcashback.co.uk%2Ftm-aviva&amp;xs=1&amp;id=76202X1526515&amp;sref=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fcar-insurance-mistake-thats-costing-10132664">up to £40 cashback</a> when you switch through them, while <a href="http://bit.ly/1Kknjwl">Quidco pays as much as £50</a>. Compare prices and then visit one of these sites to buy. It'll be tonnes cheaper. Confused? See our guide on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/what-cashback-websites-can-really-8684198">how cashback websites work.</a></li>
        <li>Never accept the renewal price offered by your existing insurer. It will almost certainly be way higher than what you could pay by shopping around – you could typically save £275.</li>
        <li>Start shopping around <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/simple-car-insurance-mistake-thats-10132664">60 days before renewal</a>. Some insurers allow you to lock-in a quote up to 30 or even 60 days before you have to buy. Locking-in now means you won’t suffer from any increases in the pipeline.</li>
        <li>Get a fresh quote just before you renew. We’re always pushing insurers to lower their prices, so it’s worth checking before you commit to make sure you’re on the best deal.</li>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10313662/driver-pay-400000-hire-car/">The Sun</a> it was "right and responsible" for insurers to take claimants to court when "costs have escalated out of all control".</p>
      <p>In September, Ms Harries appeared in court claiming a man reversed his Honda into the path of her car.</p>
      <p>But Nottingham County Court ruled against her.  </p>
