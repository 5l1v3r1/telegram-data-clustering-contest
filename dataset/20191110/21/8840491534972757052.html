      <p>THE funeral arrangements have been announced for a 54-year-old west of Ireland entrepreneur and champion of industrial development who died suddenly yesterday after participating in an adventure race in Westport</p>
      <p>James Paul (J.P.) Duffy, Bunnacranagh, Curry, Co. Sligo, and a native of Tavneena, Charlestown, was attended to by medics after becoming ill, but passed away despite efforts to save him.</p>
      <p>Along with his wife Yvonne, Mr. Duffy founded the successful company, Westel Utilities Limited, which is based in Curry, Co. Sligo, 19 years ago.</p>
      <p>The firm, which has a significant workforce, specialises in the installation of telecoms networks.</p>
      <p>Councillor Gerry Murray, a Charlestown based member of Mayo County Council, said Mr. Duffy's passing represented a huge loss to the western region.</p>
      <p>Councillor Murray noted Mr. Duffy’s great passion for telecommunications and said he was always at the cutting edge when it came to new technology.</p>
      <p>“P.J. was passionate about rural Ireland,” Councillor Murray continued.</p>
      <p>“One of his greatest desires was to ensure rural Ireland would have the same access to broadband technology as its urban counterparts.”</p>
      <p>He was a leading figure in Curry GAA Club and served with Neasden Gaels GAA Club during the years he spent living and working in London.</p>
      <p>In a tribute to him on their Facebook page, Neasden Gael said: “It is with great sadness we have learned of the death of former player JP Duffy who served the club in the mid to late 1990s. Our sincere condolences to the Duffy family on their loss."</p>
      <p>Deepest sympathy is tendered to his wife Yvonne and family Aoife, Patrick and Eanna.</p>
      <p>The deceased was brother of Christy, Caroline, Eddie and Pearl and the late Michael and he will also be sadly missed his sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, mother-in-law, father-in-law, his many nieces and nephews, cousins, neighbours, friends and work colleagues.</p>
      <p>His remains will be reposing at his family home tomorrow (Monday) from 2 until 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>Mass of the Resurrection will be celebrated in the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Curry, on Tuesday at 12 midday with burial afterwards in Bunnacrannagh Cemetery.</p>
      <p>May his gentle soul rest in peace.</p>
