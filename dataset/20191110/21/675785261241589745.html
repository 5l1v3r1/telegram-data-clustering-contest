      <h2>Hull mum-of-one Lauren Martin revealed her discovery on Facebook group The Motherload, leaving fellow parents amazed by the clever trick that makes baby wipes simple</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:46:42+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:46</time> by <a rel="author">Joanna Lovell</a></address>
      <p>A mum who discovered a "game-changer" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> wipe <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/life-hacks">hack</a> has been praised for sharing it with other <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parents</a> .</p>
      <p>Lauren Martin was in the middle of changing her son Noah's nappy when she had her revelation, after more than a year of using the daily wipes since he was born.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old realised how to pull out just one baby wipe from the packet at a time, instead of several coming at once, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/baby-wipe-hack-mum-discovers-3503752">Hull Live</a> reported.</p>
      <p>And fellow parents were left with their "minds blown" by her discovery.</p>
      <p>Lauren had accidentally ripped the inner thin plastic on the packet, and for the first time was able to pull out just one wipe while trying to change a wriggling Noah's nappy, rather than a bunch squeezing through the hole together.</p>

      <p>Sharing her tip on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group The Motherload, Lauren wrote: "My son is 19 months and I'm ONLY just 'discovering' that if you fully rip open wipes they'll come out one by one and not a whole bunch that string out while I'm trying to change a dirty nappy and undo a wipe with my double chins.</p>
      <p>"This may or may not be known and I'm a tit... but I felt I had to share."</p>
      <p>The post had over 1,000 reactions and almost 400 comments, with parents describing it as a "game-changer" and saying they had been left "mind-blown".</p>

      <p>One mum said: "I have been a parent for over ten years and I have never heard of this!! Mind blown!!"</p>
      <p>Another said: "OMG thank you for this! I'm often changing my son's bottom and holding his legs, fighting his escape, while having what seems like a ninja attack with the baby wipes as they come out in a long line of wipes! I'm flapping about like a nutter."</p>
      <p>Another mum said: "No way! I thought all the packs were bloody faulty, lmao, but we love Aldi wipes so wasn't changing them. Thanks for that!"</p>

      <p>One mum said: "Three kids later, did not know thanks."</p>
      <p>Another replied: "Jesus Christ, what a game changer."</p>
      <p>And another said: "They need to add these kind of instructions on packs!!!"</p>
      <p>Lauren said she shared the post because she wasn't sure if others knew or not.</p>
      <p>She said: "I ripped it by mistake at one side and pulled one out and it ripped off the side, and I thought 'well this is a bit like if you're using cling film'.</p>
      <p>"It kind of rips it for you so I ripped both sides and that was that, it was a pure accidental hack.</p>
      <p>"I never thought the post would get this reaction. I thought either it wouldn't get a reaction or that people would have known and I was just late to the news. I usually am.</p>
      <p>"My son is called Noah and is a whirlwind so this has helped massively already because he's a wriggler, and he's getting stronger so I need to be quick."</p>
