      <p>MEXICO CITY, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The Mexican government invited the FBI on Sunday to participate in its investigation into an attack in northern Mexico that killed nine dual citizens of the United States and Mexico.</p>
      <p>Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it extended the invitation through a diplomatic note to the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.</p>
      <p>"The Mexican government reiterates its commitment to investigate the facts, in order to ... offer justice to the affected families," the ministry said.</p>
      <p>The U.S. agents must work in coordination with their Mexican counterparts and will not be armed, it added.</p>
      <p>The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>On Monday, gunmen killed three women and six children from a breakaway Mormon community in northern Mexico, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to offer Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador help in wiping out drug gangs he blamed for the ambush.
