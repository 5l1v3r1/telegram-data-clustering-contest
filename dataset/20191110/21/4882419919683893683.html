      <h1>Barça defender Junior Firpo: When I came I knew how it would be</h1>
      <h2>The defender says he's not worried about his situation in the squad</h2>

      <p>Junior Firpo started for Barcelona again against Celta after a while out of Ernesto Valverde's plans. The ex Real Betis defender played the 90 minutes, largely thanks to Jordi Alba's injury.</p>
      <p>"I'm not worried about my situation, I've not been here long and I think everyone needs time to adapt," said Firpo. "All players are selfish and of course I'd like to play more. It was hard not to play against Levante but in the end I have to respect the decision of the coach.</p>
      <p>"We'd all like regular games but when I came I knew what I was in for. I don't like not being in the squad but I understand that the full-back who doesn't play sits in the stands. I'll keep working and I'm ready."</p>
      <p>He also said the team is doing fine. "When you come from a good run then have two slip ups, it affects you mentally. There's a team and players to have a great season. All the teams have runs of form, we're leaders in La Liga and in the Champions League, we're happy with the win."</p>
