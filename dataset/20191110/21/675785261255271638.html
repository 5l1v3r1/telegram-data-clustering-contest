      <h1>Jurgen Klopp snaps back at cameraman after Liverpool beat Man City</h1>
      <h2>Jurgen Klopp's Premier League leaders beat Pep Guardiola's Manchester City 3-1 in the clash of the two title favourites at Anfield on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T21:53:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp refused to play up to the Sky Sports cameras following Liverpool's stunning win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , telling them: "Not while you're here... I'm not a clown".</p>
      <p>The German boss was understandably buoyant after his Reds side moved eight points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Pep Guardiola's side at Anfield.</p>
      <p>But his mood took a turn when a Sky Sports cameraman urged Klopp to perform his trademark fist pump, something which seemingly angered the boss.</p>
      <p>Klopp immediately shook his head before appearing to mouth: "Not while you're here... I'm not a clown".</p>

      <p>The Reds boss then returned to the Anfield tunnel where he congratulated full-backs Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold for their part in the victory.</p>
      <p>Following the match, Klopp admitted he could hardly believe his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> side had opened up a nine-point lead over champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Klopp's Premier League leaders beat City 3-1 in the clash of the two title favourites at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>But the German claimed it was far too early in the season for such an advantage to be significant and the pressures of the title race were yet to come.</p>

      <p>Klopp said: "Today we were completely focused on this game and not the situation in the table and how many points we are ahead of City. That's crazy.</p>
      <p>"Nine points ahead of City - you cannot imagine that something like this would happen.</p>
      <p>"But it's not important because who wants to be first in November? You want to be first in May. It's only November.</p>
      <p>"The pressure is not there yet. It will come, but at the moment it's just opportunity and go for it and do the work, throw in all you have and let's see what happens.</p>

      <p>"We don't feel any pressure, to be 100% honest. Nine points is a positive but there's a long way to go.</p>
      <p>"People will 100% say, and have said already, that from now on Liverpool can only lose it.</p>
      <p>"That's a very negative approach but we don't care, I can promise you that we don't care."</p>
