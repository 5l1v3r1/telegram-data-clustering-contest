      <p>Arsenal have made contact with former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique as they sound out a possible replacement for Unai Emery, according to the Daily Mirror.</p>
      <p>The Gunners' poor recent form -- without a win in six games -- has seen Emery come under increased pressure and some fans have begun to turn against him.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's sporting director Raul Sanllehi, who joined the London club from Barcelona, has taken personal responsibility for getting in touch with Luis Enrique, the reports say.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Lucho has been approached by Arsenal, who previously talked to him about the possibility of replacing Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>However, it's unclear how open Luis Enrique is to returning to management at the moment given the way he left his last job. He had to stand down as Spain coach following the death of his daughter.</p>
      <p>He had previously coached FC Barcelona (2014 - 2017), Celta Vigo (2013 - 2014), Roma (2011 - 2012) and Barça B (2008 - 2011).</p>
