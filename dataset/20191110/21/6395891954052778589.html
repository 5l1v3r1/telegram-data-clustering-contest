      <p><b>AVONDALE, Ariz.Â (AP)</b> - Chase Elliott's championship chances ended Sunday with a crash in the final stage at ISM Raceway.</p>
      <p>Elliott had to win to earn a berth in next week's title-deciding finale after a disastrous third round of the playoffs. NASCAR's most popular driver had a mechanical problem at Martinsville, crashed last week at Texas and crashed Sunday when he appeared to have a tire issue that caused him to spin.</p>
      <p>"Just a continuation of our first two weeks," Elliott said. "I feel like we were in a good position to run solid. Not sure why we had a tire go down, I think that's what happened. These last three weeks have been rough."</p>
      <p>Elliott had been hoping to claim one of the remaining two berths in the Nov. 17 finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Kevin Harvick and Martin Truex Jr. have already clinched their spots.</p>
      <p>Elliott, Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, Kyle Larson and Ryan Blaney were the four drivers trying to move back into title contention outside of Phoenix.</p>
