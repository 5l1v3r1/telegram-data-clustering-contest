      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 10 — Tiny Singapore had embraced electric scooters in a big way, but deaths and fires linked to the two-wheelers have prompted authorities to introduce tough rules that could put a brake on their runaway success.</p>
      <p>The contraptions have popped up in cities worldwide but pedestrians in many places have come to see the silent machines as menaces, and authorities have been scrambling to regulate them.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands flooded Singapore, becoming particularly popular among commuters and workers delivering food, but apartment fires blamed on charging devices and the death of an elderly cyclist after a September collision stoked public anger.</p>
      <p>Last week, officials announced a ban on the trendy two-wheelers on all footpaths.</p>
      <p>To start with, most riders caught breaking the rule will be given a warning but from January, offenders face being jailed for up to three months and fined.</p>
      <p>The move surprised observers after a panel advising the government had recommended weaker measures, such as a mandatory theory test — and angered some who have come to rely on the scooters.</p>
      <p>“It is definitely over-regulation,” Venkata Goruganthu, who rode his e-scooter to his office in the business district every day, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“There are car accidents and people are dying, are we going to ban cars on the streets now?”</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old technician will now have to commute by public transport, which will take him 45 minutes — twice as long as a scooter ride.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Reckless’ riders</b>
      </p>
      <p>But many others approved of the effort to rein in the scooters, which now number about 100,000 in the space-starved country of 5.7 million.</p>
      <p>“People are not responsible, they are reckless,” Vasukie Mayandi, a 51-year-old bank worker, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“They feel they want to move somewhere fast, but they’re not considering others who are using the same pathway.”</p>
      <p>E-scooters were already banned from Singapore’s roads but they are now prohibited on all pavements and other footpaths, and can only be used on cycle paths and a network of routes connecting parks.</p>
      <p>It drastically reduces the area where people can ride the contraptions — Singapore has about 440 kilometres (275 miles) of cycle paths compared with 5,500 kilometres of footpaths. Officials, however, say cycle paths will be extended to cover 750 kilometres by 2025.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, regional ride-sharing giant Grab said it was suspending its scooter-sharing set-up in Singapore while the government said it would reject applications by other firms hoping to start such services.</p>
      <p>
        <b>International clampdown</b>
      </p>
      <p>Singapore is just the latest country trying to get control of the scooters.</p>
      <p>Last week, the French government issued new rules, including a ban on using them on pavements — unless a city permits them in certain areas — and a 25 kilometre per hour speed limit.</p>
      <p>Germany does not allow them on pavements while London has taken the most extreme approach of major European cities, prohibiting the two-wheelers entirely unless a rider has a driving licence, insurance, road tax, a helmet and a number plate.</p>
      <p>The hardest hit in Singapore by the new rules is the army of people using e-scooters to deliver food across the city for companies such as Deliveroo, Grab and Foodpanda, although authorities have taken steps to help.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the transport ministry said the government and companies were offering grants for e-scooter delivery riders to switch to other devices including regular and power-assisted bicycles.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Goh has already changed to a bike for his food delivery job — but said his income would be affected as cycling is more exhausting, meaning he can complete fewer orders.</p>
      <p>“It’s very tiring for me to use a bicycle,” said the 26-year-old single father, adding that he would also end up fatigued and potentially less capable of caring for his young son after work.</p>
      <p>Goh said he felt food delivery workers were being punished for the bad behaviour of some recreational riders, but conceded: “I can understand why people hate us.” — AFP</p>
