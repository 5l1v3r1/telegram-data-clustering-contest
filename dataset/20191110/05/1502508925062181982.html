      <h1>FPIs remain bullish, invest over Rs 12,000 cr in first week of November</h1>
      <h2>Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India said, mainly the domestic factor led to the foreign inflows</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:50:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Overseas investors remained net buyers in the domestic capital <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>with an investment of over Rs 12,000 crore in the first week of November as market sentiments improved following economic reforms by the government.</p>
      <p>The latest depositories data showed that <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-portfolio-investors">foreign portfolio investors </a>(FPI) infused a net Rs 6,433.8 crore in equities and Rs 5,673.87 crore in debt segment between November 1-9.</p>
      <p>This took the total net investment in the domestic <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>(both equity and debt) to Rs 12,107.67 crore.</p>
      <p>The latest inflows come after two consecutive months of foreign investments. In October, FPIs invested a net Rs 16,464.6 crore while in September they had put in Rs 6,557.8 crore.</p>
      <p>However, Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities termed the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-fpi">FPI </a>purchases "half-hearted" saying that they invested "an average of Rs 550 crore per day this week which is nothing compared to their aggressive past purchases which tally around Rs 1,500-2,000 crore per day.</p>
      <p>"It seems that FPIs are feeling left out and have joined the herd; clearly visible through their halfhearted purchases in Indian <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets.</a> FPIs are currently nibbling a few shares just to maintain their asset allocation weights in the portfolio towards Indian equities," Mehta said.</p>
      <p>Himanshu Srivastava, senior analyst manager research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India said, mainly the domestic factor led to the foreign inflows.</p>
      <p>"Measures announced by the government to boost domestic economy and foreign investment like abolishing super-rich surcharge, cutting corporate tax and recapitalisation of banks has started to pay dividends. Besides, stock markets touching new all-time highs and better than expected earnings growth would have also encouraged investors," he added.</p>
      <p>Additionally, US Fed's rate cut on October 30 for third time this year coupled with a reprieve in the US-China trade war, has helped increase risk-appetite among global investors, who are now looking at emerging markets such as India for their investments, Srivastava said.</p>
      <p>Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww said,We are beginning to see steady inflows from FPIs since a few weeks. However, the recent downgrade of India by Moody's could affect inflows temporarily but not for the long term.</p>
