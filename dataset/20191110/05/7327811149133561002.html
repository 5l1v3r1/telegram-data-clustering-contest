      <p>CYPRESS HILLS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- A Brooklyn mother of four has died ten days after she was hit by a car while running errands. That driver did not stop.</p>
      <p>"It is truly sad to see she passed away the way she did - she deserves so much better," said her son, Navindra Boodhu.</p>
      <p>After days of agony in the hospital, Vabita Arjune lost her fight. Her son found the courage to talk.</p>
      <p>"She would stop to do whatever she was going to do to help anybody out," said Boodhu.</p>
      <p>She was a mother of four - her youngest is 13 years old. They were her world, and on Monday, October 28th, off work from her home health aide job, she was running errands a few blocks from her house and was crossing the intersection at Liberty Avenue and Crescent Street.</p>
      <p>The car threw the 50-year-old right into the intersection. The driver did not stay on scene. This past Thursday, a week and a half after the accident, Arjune succumbed to her injuries.</p>
      <p>"She didn't deserve to die like that," said one neighbor.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe the vehicle they are looking for is a gray 2014-2015 Hyundai Sonata with driver's side mirror damage.</p>
      <p>The family is making a plea for the driver to turn themselves in.</p>
      <p>As Arjune's children search for justice, they are leaning on each other, trying to make sense of the future without their mother guiding them through.</p>
