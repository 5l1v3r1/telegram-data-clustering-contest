      <h3>Ethereum Price Weekly Analysis</h3>
      <p>This past week, Ethereum started a slow and steady decline from well above $190 against the US Dollar. More importantly, ETH traded below the key $188 support to move into a short term bearish zone.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break below the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/ethereum-eth-declining-likely-to-continue-lower/">key $186 support area</a>. Finally, the price spiked below the $182 support and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). However, the bears failed to gain strength below $180.</p>
      <p>As a result, Ethereum recovered above $182 and 100 simple moving average (4-hours). Besides, it traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $194 swing high to $180 low.</p>
      <p>The price even climbed above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $184 on the 4-hours chart of ETH/USD. At the moment, the price is consolidating above the $182 level and the 100 SMA.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance is near the $188 area (the previous support). Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $194 swing high to $180 low is also near the $188 level.</p>
      <p>Therefore, an upside break above the $188 resistance could push the price further higher. The next key resistance is near the $194 area. Any further upsides may perhaps set the pace for a break above the $200 barrier.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many key supports near the $180 and $178 levels. Furthermore, there is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $180 on the same chart. Only a daily close below the $178 support could start another downward move towards the $160 level.</p>

      <p>The above <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a> indicates that Ethereum price is clearly holding a couple of important uptrend supports near the $178 level. Thus, there are chances of a fresh increase above the $185 and $188 levels unless there is a clear break below $178.</p>
