      <h1>Restaurant launches 'doggie dinners' menu - so now your pooch won't feel left out</h1>
      <h2>Loaded Wollaston, on the Bridgenorth Road, are now serving meals suitable for dogs to eat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Regen, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/charlotte-regen/</a></address>
      <p>A couple who set up their dream restaurant have come up with a pioneering way to welcome more customers.</p>
      <p>Loaded Wollaston owners, Jessica Billingham and Matthew Holmes, wanted to relive and share their exotic culinary experiences from travelling - so they set up shop in Wollaston.</p>
      <p>After a whirlwind first six months in business, the soon-to-be-married couple decided it was time to extend their clientele - by creating a menu for dogs.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theblackcountrylive/">Black Country Live</a>, Matthew said: "We take pride in making every dish as good as it was when we first tried them. <br/><br/>"We try to cater to all dietary requirements including gluten free, dairy free and vegan. We've recently taken this to a whole new level by catering for four-legged customers too. Our 'doggie dinners' are hot and full of goodness, guaranteed to be safe for their tummies.</p>
      <p>"They come in large and small portion sizes to accommodate every breed and are going down a treat."</p>
      <h3>Why you should never feed bones to your dog</h3>
      <p>RSPCA Cymru said it advises against feeding bones to dogs because of the risks of obstruction, damage to the teeth and fatal injuries.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman added: "Most dogs do find chewing items rewarding and relaxing so we would encourage owners to consider other safer dog friendly chew toys and treats.</p>
      <p>"There are many different types of treats available and the suitability may depend on various factors such as the size of the dog and how vigorously they chew. If an owner is unsure whether a product will be safe for their pet they should seek advice from a vet.</p>
      <p>"If a pet is unwell after eating a treat, particularly if they are vomiting or gagging then immediate veterinary treatment should be sought.</p>
      <p>"Particularly with the run up to Halloween , Bonfire Night and Christmas we would remind pet owners to be mindful of items around the home that could be harmful to their pets.</p>
      <p>"As well as chocolate, foods to keep away from your pet include leeks, garlic, macadamia nuts, cooked bones, alcohol and any leftover food which has gone mouldy."</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>The pair, who are both self-confessed animal lovers, understand eating out can be difficult for dog owners, which is why they decided to become dog friendly.</p>
      <p>Matthew added: "We've both grown up with dogs in the household and they've always had a special place in our heart. We love to take our Lurcher out and about with us and always try to find somewhere that can accommodate him.</p>
      <p>"We thought we could be that place for people in Wollaston. It has been successful, people are coming in to us on their evening walks.</p>
      <p>"We're not just a restaurant, our doors will always be open for anybody who wants to pop in for a coffee, chat, catch up or just to escape for a while. Every member of staff will be more than happy to sit and have a chat with you, if that's what you would like."</p>
