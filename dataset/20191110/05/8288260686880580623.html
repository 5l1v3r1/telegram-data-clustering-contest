      <p>The video above shows moments from history captured on camera from Remembrance Day memorials in and around Birmingham since the end of World War II.</p>
      <p>At <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/">BirminghamLive</a>, we have trawled the picture archives to pull some of our most powerful and telling pictures captured from the Hall of Memory in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/">Birmingham</a>'s Centenary Square in 1945, to soldiers paying their respects at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire in 2018.</p>
      <p>This year, the annual Remembrance Day Service in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/">Birmingham</a> will take place on Colmore Row, opposite St Philip’s Cathedral, on Sunday, November 10, attended by military veterans and Armed Forces representatives.</p>
