      <h1>If <i>Superstore</i> Was a Presidential Candidate It’d Probably Be Elizabeth Warren</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:09:01+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>At their 2019 Vulture Festival panel, the <i>Superstore </i>cast discussed current events and the way the show addresses political issues like immigration and labor organizing rights. When asked if the actors were aware of how much the show would tackle these topics before signing on, cast member Lauren Ash told the audience, “The stuff that’s going on in the country, obviously being able to find ways to talk about that in a way that is still funny, that’s a dream. That’s the goal.”</p>
      <p>Series producer and star America Ferrera added on to that sentiment. “I think the important thing to remember is that this show wouldn’t exist and be successful if it wasn’t for the time we were making it in. We’re not starting these conversations. It’s like Lauren just said, laughter is recognition. We’re putting up a mirror to the conversations and the things people are just feeling in this time,” Ferrera explained, saying that <i>Superstore</i>’s kinder representation of how people reconcile differences can feel like an escape in such a polarized time. “The show is striking a chord that already exists in this time, and we’re at a point where all we can do is laugh.”</p>
      <p>Toward the end of the panel, Vulture staffer and moderator Kathryn VanArendonk asked cast members Ferrera, Ash, Nico Santos, Kaliko Kauahi, and Ben Feldman which Democratic presidential candidate they support. Each of them declined to answer, but Feldman did offer that if the show could be personified in one candidate, there is one woman that comes to mind. “If you’re talking about a candidate that maybe identifies with the underlying themes of the show, it feels like a very Elizabeth Warren-y kind of show.” Then Ferrera added, “I could argue that. I won’t. But I could argue that.” Feldman elaborated a bit further by saying, “This isn’t speaking for me personally. If our show was running for president it would have just released a tremendously complicated healthcare — no. Not gonna do any of that.” So, speculate on that as you will! </p>
