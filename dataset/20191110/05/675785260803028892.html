      <h1>UK weather forecast: Cold and sunny for Remembrance Day but flood warnings still in place</h1>
      <h2>The Sunday services will take place under bright and chilly conditions but the north could be hit with flooding and sub-zero temperatures</h2>

      <p>Remembrance day is set to be a sunny one for much of the UK but 'danger to life' flood warnings remain in place for some areas.</p>
      <p>Forecasters say the conditions will be chilly for most of the country, with temperatures between 4C to 10C.</p>
      <p>There will be showers across southern and western England, as well as light snow over high grounds in Wales, but it will eventually die out overnight.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> has also issued a yellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning for ice across the east of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>Icy stretches are expected to form overnight on untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths.</p>
      <p>Sub-zero weather conditions could hit the Scottish Highlands as the mercury is expected to plunge to -8C.</p>

      <p>The respite comes after the UK was hit by widespread flooding, with towns across the Midlands and northern England deluged by a month's worth of 'almost biblical' rain in just one day, killing one person.</p>
      <p>Former High Sheriff of Derbyshire Annie Hall died after being engulfed by floodwater in Darley Dale, near Matlock, with her body pulled from the River Derwent in the early hours of Friday.</p>
      <p>Seven severe flood warnings indicating a 'danger to life' remain in place at various points along the River Don in Yorkshire, according to the Environment Agency.</p>
      <p>Meteorologist Luke Miall said: "Under clear and starry skies we will see that frost forming, some dense patches of fog, especially for Northern Ireland, perhaps some northern counties of England as well.</p>
      <p>"If you're heading to any services it will be a pretty fine day. Into the afternoon it's a brightening up picture for much of the country.</p>

        <figcaption>Most parts of the UK will see sunshine today</figcaption>

      <p>"We see long spells of sunshine, just a few showers affecting those north sea coasts."</p>
      <p>Commuters in South Yorkshire were warned some rail and road routes would likely stay closed until at Monday morning at least as some rail tracks will remain submerged underwater.</p>
      <p>But through Sunday evening a weather front bringing snow and rain will sweep in from the west.</p>
      <p>It will push through Northern Ireland, march into Wales, Scotland and eventually cover much of England, coming with gusty winds.</p>
      <p>Mr Miall said: "You will notice some fairly persistent snow across the higher ground in Scotland ... elsewhere it's falling as rain but it will be a fairly gloomy old night to come, with quite brisk winds as well."</p>
      <p>Train operator Northern said: "The rail industry is doing all it can to deal with the issues caused by flood water, but in many cases the full picture will not be apparent until all water has been drained from the tracks."</p>
      <p>"Until further notice we are still advising customers not to travel in some areas as rail travel is not possible and roads are also badly affected."</p>
      <p>Affected routes include Doncaster to Scunthorpe, Sheffield to Goole, Sheffield to Doncaster, and Sheffield to Leeds.</p>
      <h3>Five-day weather forecast:</h3>
      <h4>Today:</h4>
      <p>Cloud and occasional rain or drizzle in the south clearing, then most places dry with sunny spells, except for a few showers affecting eastern coasts of England and Scotland. Rather cold.</p>
      <h4>Tonight:</h4>
      <p>Cold in the east at first, but a band of rain, with hill snow for northern areas, moving eastwards through the night. Blustery showers following into the west by morning.</p>
      <h4>Monday:</h4>
      <p>Rain clearing eastwards, then sunny intervals and occasional blustery showers, some heavy. Showers merging into longer spells of rain over north-west Scotland.</p>
      <h4>Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday:</h4>
      <p>Remaining unsettled, breezy and rather cold, with showers and also some longer spells of rain at times, falling as snow over northern hills.</p>
