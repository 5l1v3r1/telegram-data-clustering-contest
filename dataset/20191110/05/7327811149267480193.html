      <p>MELVILLE, Long Island -- New York state police say a Long Island woman used social media and the U.S. mail to harass a child with a genetic disorder that causes the skin to harden and crack.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Krista Sewell on Thursday on charges including aggravated harassment as a hate crime, a felony.</p>
      <p>Anna Riley lives in Ulster County in the Hudson Valley and suffers from harlequin ichthyosis.</p>
      <p>The skin of children born with the disorder forms large plates separated by cracks.</p>
      <p>The skin abnormalities affect breathing and movement.</p>
      <p>Police say Sewell posted messages threatening the child on Facebook, Instagram and GoFundMe over the last year.</p>
      <p>They say the 26-year-old Melville resident also mailed threatening letters to the child's home.</p>
      <p>It's not clear if Sewell has an attorney who can speak for her.</p>
      <p>Anna's mother, Jennie Riley released a statement on Saturday, saying,</p>
      <p>
        <i>"In 2017 my daughter Anna was born with a skin condition called Harlequin Ichthyosis. This condition is very severe and I have made a choice to educate people publicly on Facebook and Instagram. Although I knew there was a possibility for negativity I never expected to receive the messages that were sent to me. over the past year I have fought a battle I never thought I would fight and I felt fear no mother should feel. I want to thank the New York State police and the ulster county sheriff's Department for their diligence, dedication and most of all their compassion. I hope we can all learn from this and understand the importance of teaching our kids kindness and acceptance of visible differences."</i>
