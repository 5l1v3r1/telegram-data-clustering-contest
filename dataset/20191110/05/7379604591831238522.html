Most of the 26-year-old's looping efforts have sailed wide but he's the more likely to do damage. KSI just looked over to his corner for a dangerous amount of time but Paul did not leap in. Paul down but ruled a slip, he looked dazed. Both up now and hugging again.</li>

Paul felt that one. KSI in charge of this round so Paul's fan raise the noise levels. KSI hurling shots but the second ends with more smooching on the ropes.</li>
        <li>Wally Downes Jr<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/7056457/ksi-logan-paul-live-results-latest-round-updates/#liveblog-entry-206234">5 minutes agoNovember 10, 2019</a>R2 The entire Staples Center is on its feet, security have given up even trying to make everyone sit. The place is rocking. Ridiculous two haymakers from KSI miss by miles as Paul moves smoothly. KSI clips the American, nothing heavy. Left hook from KSI is decent but two follow up shots are not.</li>

KSI lands clean with a right hook but Paul eats it fine. Paul trying to jab and move while KSI windmills. Everytime they get in range it ends in a cuddle. Even opener. No skills on show.</li>

Paul lands and KSI clinches. The whole place is on its feet, no one will sit down. The fight is a mess. Scrappy and dimwitted.</li>
