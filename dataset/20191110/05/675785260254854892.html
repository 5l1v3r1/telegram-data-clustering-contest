      <h1>KSI beats Logan Paul by split decision as YouTube stars settle rivalry in rematch</h1>
      <h2>KSI and Logan Paul faced off at Staples Center in Los Angeles as they finally settled their rivalry 12 months after their controversial draw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T05:40:44+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 05:40</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>KSI settled his rivalry with Logan Paul with a narrow points win in their rematch.</p>
      <p>In a controversial fight riddled with poor technique and fouling, the Brit did enough to overcome his YouTube rival.</p>
      <p>One judge awarded the fight to Paul but the other two saw the fight - correctly - to the travelling Londoner.</p>
      <p>KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - and Paul were meeting for a second time after their draw in Manchester last year.</p>
      <p>The influencers turned professional for the sequel having been licensed by the California State Athletic Commission.</p>
      <p>Both had promised to ensure the other's ring career was a short one.</p>

      <p>The Staples Center was close to full by the time the pair made their walks to the ring although the crowd had been more interested in the 'celebrities' filing in than the action in the ring.</p>
      <p>Both Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Haney had laboured to successful defences of their world titles, much to the frustration of the fans they had hoped to win over.</p>
      <p>But the young audience was firmly transfixed on the square circle when KSI and Paul traded their first blows.</p>
      <p>KSI looked to land his jab in the early seconds of round one but it was Paul who connected with the first solid shot.</p>
      <p>The American tried to turn the fight into a messy scrap by holding on and punching in the clinch but it was KSI who edged the session with the bigger shots.</p>

      <p>Paul was displaying the marginally better technique but KSI's was at least landing one in 10 of his wild shots as he edged the second session.</p>
      <p>KSI thought he had dropped Paul in the third stanza when he landed a right hand but referee Jack Reiss ruled it a slip - and did so again in the dying seconds when the American was on the canvas again.</p>
      <p>Controversy erupted in the fourth round when Paul landed an uppercut before dragging KSI to the canvas and hiting him on the back of the head.</p>
      <p>The Londoner was livid and was given a chance to recover while Reiss deducted two points from Paul to leave him needing a knockout.</p>
      <p>He did not come out of his corner looking like a man in need of one however but jabbed his way to the fifth session.</p>
      <p>But it was KSI who finished the fight on top, landing the better punches over the final three minutes as the fight went to the judges.</p>
