      <h2>Ngannou is being trained by Tyson and he posted an impressive punching score ahead of a potential UFC match-up with Tyson Fury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T01:45:43+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 01:45</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Mike Tyson has shared a video showing Francis Ngannou posting an impressive punchbag challenge score ahead of a potential UFC match-up with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> .</p>
      <p>Ngannou earlier this week claimed boxing legend Tyson would be training him <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/mike-tyson-train-francis-ngannou-20829319">after Fury called him out for a heavyweight MMA clash</a> .</p>
      <p>Lineal heavyweight boxing champion Fury has teased a transition into mixed martial arts recently, having already crossed over into another fighting sport with a couple of WWE bouts.</p>
      <p>Now Tyson, after posting a video in which he demonstrated body punches on Ngannou, has shared more footage of their time together.</p>
      <p>In the video posted on Tyson's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> account, Cameroonian ace Ngannou hits a punching machine before admiring his impressive score amid cheers from others in the gym.</p>

      <p>Former undisputed world heavyweight champion Tyson wrote on Twitter: "The young brother @francis_ngannou has some serious power. Who thinks they can hit harder than the uncrowned champ? #tysonchallenge."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Ngannou tweeted: "Spoke with Mike Tyson and he agreed to train me for when I fight Tyson Fury in the ring.</p>
      <p>"Don't be scared Fury, you called me out and now you'll have to live with it."</p>
      <p>Fury accepted the challenge, tweeting: "I'll deal with you and all the other MMA heavyweights when I’m done with my boxing fights, it won’t be long to wait! Then I’ll show u how we roll."</p>

      <p>He had previously said: "Who's the heavyweight champion of the world in the UFC? The American-Croatian, Stipe Miocic, I'll fight him in a heartbeat, no problem.</p>
      <p>"Or, Francis Ngannou, any of the heavyweights they've got.</p>
      <p>"I'm not afraid of any of them, I'm the Gypsy King; I'm a boxer but I'm one bad ass motherf*****."</p>
