      <p>MUNICH, Nov 10 — Managerless Bayern Munich thrashed Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in 'Der Klassiker' yesterday as Robert Lewandowski continued his phenomenal scoring run with two goals at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski's first-half header and 76th-minute tap-in mean he has scored in all of Bayern's Bundesliga and Champions League games this season for a tally of 23 goals.</p>
      <p>“We were very focused, we knew we had to give 100 percent and improve,” said Lewandowski after the reigning Bundesliga champions bounced back emphatically from last weekend's 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry claimed Bayern's second, while visiting captain Mats Hummels scored a late own goal for his former club as Dortmund suffered another heavy defeat in Munich after a 5-0 rout in April.</p>
      <p>“After 10 minutes, we made it clear that we wanted to win,” said Bayern forward Thomas Mueller. “The alibis had all been used up."</p>
      <p>Bayern moved up to third, level on points with second-placed RB Leipzig and one behind leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach, who host Werder Bremen today.</p>
      <p>Interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his second win in charge since Niko Kovac was sacked last Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It's not been easy for the team, we didn't have that many training sessions,” said Flick.</p>
      <p>“They knew they had a duty to improve and they did.”</p>
      <p>Afterwards, club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said Flick will stay in charge for Bayern's next game on November 23 at Fortuna Duesseldorf.</p>
      <p>However, Bayern are having difficulties finding a new coach, with Arsene Wenger on Saturday contradicting their claims they turned him down as Kovac's successor and slammed the club for a lack of discretion.</p>
      <p>Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already made it clear they will not join Bayern this season.</p>
      <p>Despite their off-field troubles, Bayern dominated as Lewandowski opened the scoring with a superb header from a Benjamin Pavard cross on 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho was taken off on 36 minutes after failing to make an impact on proceedings.</p>
      <p>Gnabry had a goal ruled out for offside as Bayern went in 1-0 up at the break, but the Germany winger struck two minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>When Lewandowski stumbled with the goal at his mercy, Gnabry fired home.</p>
      <p>With an hour gone and his side 2-0 down, Dortmund coach Lucien Favre brought on forwards Marco Reus and Paco Alcacer, who have only just recovered from foot and calf injuries respectively.</p>
      <p>Alcacer had his head in his hands after failing to connect with an Achraf Hakimi cross with 20 minutes left as Dortmund's best chance went begging.</p>
      <p>Bayern's third came as Lewandowski finished another counter-attack by the hosts, just before Hummels' own goal.</p>
      <p>“That was a huge disappointment, a lot of our players didn't play well. Bayern were better,” admitted Dortmund coach Lucien Favre.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leipzig go second</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier, Timo Werner netted twice as Leipzig went second with a 4-2 win at Hertha Berlin in the capital, where the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989.</p>
      <p>To mark the 30th anniversary, a replica of the Wall, which divided Germany's capital from 1961, separated Hertha and Leipzig before being knocked down prior to kickoff.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Maximilian Mittelstaedt gave Hertha a first-half lead which lasted six minutes before Werner converted a penalty.</p>
      <p>Marcel Sabitzer added Leipzig's second on the stroke of halftime before three goals came in the final five minutes.</p>
      <p>Kevin Kampl netted Leipzig's third with a superb left-footed strike before Werner grabbed his second for his 11th league goal in as many games, before Hertha striker Davie Selke scored against his former club.</p>
      <p>Striker Rouwen Hennings completed his hat-trick five minutes from time as Fortuna Duesseldorf held Schalke to a 3-3 draw.</p>
      <p>The Royal Blues squandered the lead three times as goals by Daniel Caligiuri, Ozan Kabak and Suat Serdar in Gelsenkirchen were cancelled out by Hennings.</p>
      <p>Union Berlin are up to 11th after their third straight win as Sebastian Anderson scored twice in a 3-2 victory at Mainz.</p>
      <p>Augsburg climbed out of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at bottom club Paderborn thanks to a goal by defender Philipp Max.</p>
