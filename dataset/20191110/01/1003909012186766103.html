      <h1>City seeking opinions on a dual park and cemetery in northeast Calgary</h1>

      <p>The city of Calgary is seeking public input on the development of a cemetery in the north that could include sports courts, wading pools and ziplines.</p>
      <p>An undeveloped plot of land in the north, south of Highway 566 and east of 6th Street N.E., has been selected as the prime location for a cemetery but, in researching modern trends, the city became interested in the development of a dual-purpose facility, which would blend elements of a regional park with a cemetery.</p>
      <p>The city launched an online survey to ask about design, usage, and opinion on the regional park and cemetery to determine how comfortable Calgarians are with the idea.</p>

      <p>The results of the <a href="https://engage.calgary.ca/north-calgary-regional-park-and-cemetery">online survey</a> will show what amenities could appropriately share the same space as the city’s dead. The list of suggestions is long, with various sports courts, wading pools, picnic areas, walking pathways, playgrounds or ziplines being some of the contenders. There is also the possibility of building an independent concession or café in the cemetery.</p>
      <p>Calgary started looking into developing more cemeteries recently because it was creeping up to capacity, according to Coun. Shane Keating.</p>
      <p>The city continued the development of Prairie Sky Cemetery in the southeast this summer, breaking ground on the first new cemetery in nearly 80 years. The last burial space built was Queen’s Park Cemetery in the northwest in 1940.</p>
      <p>With roads and landscaping near completion, the cemetery is set to open in 2020, situated to the east of Ralph Klein Park. Despite their proximity, the two are separate entities and there aren’t plans to blend them.</p>
      <p>“Once Prairie Sky was set aside as only a cemetery, it stays that way. There are some unique features to the cemetery, like a section set aside for green burials. But it was intended to be a cemetery only,” said Keating.</p>
      <p>The online survey requests input on designing the transition between the regional park and cemetery, and overall thoughts on thoughts on including amenities or planned events in the cemetery, which is currently unfunded. Participants in the survey are also asked to define what they find appropriate and inappropriate in a cemetery, which is a sensitive space.</p>
      <p>Dual-purpose cemeteries are becoming more popular internationally because of a shortage of parkland space in urban communities. Australia’s Bunurong Memorial Park could serve as a model for the kind of park and cemetery Calgary could develop, with its modern al fresco café, children’s playground, art pieces, and walking paths.</p>
      <p>In Brooklyn, Green-Wood Cemetery is known as a hot date-night spot because of the introduction of year-long themed trolley rides, whiskey tastings, catacomb tours and old movie nights, according to city bureaucrats.</p>
      <p>Atlanta’s Oakland Cemetery has guided walking tours because some of the city’s notable leaders rest there. The cemetery is also home to an annual “Tunes From the Tombs” music festival, a “Run Like Hell” five-kilometre run and Halloween tours.</p>
      <p>Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Conn., and Forest Hills Cemetery both encourage dog walking along the pathways created in the space. Cedar Hill also allows cycling and hosts social events like jazz concerts, lantern tours, bird walks and movie screenings.</p>
      <p>The online survey for Calgary’s park and cemetery will be open until Friday, and an open house is scheduled on Wednesday at 5:30 p.m. in Balzac.</p>
