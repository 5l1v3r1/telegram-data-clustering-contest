      <p>MILAN, Nov 10 — Nicolo Barella scored his first league goal for Inter Milan to secure a 2-1 win over Verona which put Antonio Conte's side top of Serie A yesterday.</p>
      <p>The former Cagliari midfielder's stunning curling strike seven minutes from time allowed Inter to overtake defending champions Juventus.</p>
      <p>Inter sit two points ahead of Juve, who host 13th-placed AC Milan in Turin today.</p>
      <p>Conte had been furious after his side threw away a two-goal lead to fall to a 3-2 Champions League defeat at Borussia Dortmund in midweek.</p>
      <p>“I saw an important response after Dortmund,” said Conte. “The lads are doing something important — 31 points in 12 games is a nice haul.</p>
      <p>“Now there is a (international) break and we're going to rest after a victory that gives us enthusiasm and the knowledge that we're on the right path.”</p>
      <p>Inter had got off to the worst possible start when Valerio Verre put Verona ahead from the spot on 19 minutes after Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic tripped Mattia Zaccagni.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Marco Silvestri and the Verona defence held off Inter at the San Siro before Matias Vecino broke through, heading home a Valentino Lazaro cross on 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>Barella completed the comeback late on, whipping off his jersey as he celebrated wildly with his teammates.</p>
      <p>It was his second goal since joining Inter last summer having scored the equaliser in a 1-1 Champions League draw with Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to win at all costs, despite the fatigue from the recent matches,” said Barella.</p>
      <p>“Now it's time for the national team and I'm already focused on that,” he added of Italy's upcoming Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Later, Carlo Ancelotti's Napoli, in seventh after three league games without a win, host 17th-placed Genoa.</p>

        <b>Torino back winning</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Turin, Andrea Belotti converted a pair of penalties with Alex Berenguer bagging a brace of his own to get Torino back to winning ways with a 4-0 romp over 10-man Brescia.</p>
      <p>Torino snapped their six-match winless run and inflicted a first defeat on new Brescia coach Fabio Grosso, whose side are second from bottom in the Serie A table.</p>
      <p>Belotti got Torino off the mark on 17 minutes with a penalty awarded after a Simone Verdi free-kick bounced off Brescia defender Andrea Cistana's arm.</p>
      <p>The second came on 26 minutes when Czech defender Ales Mateju was also deemed to have used his arm to block a Belotti shot after a VAR review.</p>
      <p>Belotti again slotted in to bring his tally to seven Serie A goals this season.</p>
      <p>Brescia were reduced to 10 men before the break when Mateju was sent off for a second yellow card after fouling Belotti.</p>
      <p>A man down, Grosso substituted Brescia striker Mario Balotelli with defender Bruno Martella after the break.</p>
      <p>Jesse Joronen denied Belotti a hattrick before Berenguer fired past the Finnish keeper with 15 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>And five minutes later, Berenguer latched onto Diego Laxalt's long ball forward to slot in his second goal this season.</p>
      <p>Brescia, with a game in hand, fell to their fourth consecutive defeat with their winless run now stretching back seven games.</p>
      <p>Torino's first win since September 26 puts them 11th.</p>
