      <p>Yesterday, also when the actress stepped out of her pilates classes along with her trainer, her little fans started calling her 'Sara didi'. Sara too in the sweetest manner waved back to her fans. Later, she stopped for a few seconds, posed for the shutterbugs and walked towards her car. Sara was seen sporting cool athleisure teamed up with a pair of white sports shoes. She had tied her hair in a single braid and also adorned a hairband.</p>
