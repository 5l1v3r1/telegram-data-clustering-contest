      <p>Catalan’s dramatic KO came one week after a stunning head-kick knockout was given by Kevin Lee to the previously-undefeated Gregor Gillespie, resulting in the latter's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201911091077261071-russias-mma-fighter-nurmagomedov-reveals-his-2020-ufc-comeback-conditions/">defeat at the UFC 244 in New York</a>. Commentators and fans alike have described Catalan’s incredible KO as surpassing Lee’s pile-driving knockout.</p>
