        <b>The Young Bucks vs. Proud &amp; Powerful</b>
      </p>
      <p>The match began with high intensity, as both teams came out swinging from the opening bell. AEW official Rick Knox became a story early in the match, as he did not allow a tag on the foot between Santana and Ortiz</p>
      <p>As the action got underway, it became clear that Proud &amp; Powerful were on the offensive early. The duo went for The Bucks and eventually, they confronted the legendary Rock ‘N’ Roll Express, who were at ringside in the audience.</p>

      <p>The match soon took a turn as Matt and Nick began to gain the advantage. The brothers hit a few of their signature moves, including an attempt at the Meltzer Driver, but Nick’s right knee gave out due to attacks earlier in the bout.</p>
      <p>Nick spit his gum at Santana but Santana actually put it in his own mouth. This set Nick off and suddenly things began to start cooking. A near-fall took place, but The Bucks broke it up.</p>
      <p>Ortiz came off the top rope with the Street Sweeper, getting the pin on Nick Jackson.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Winners: Proud &amp; Powerful</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the match, P&amp;P’s fellow Inner Circle teammate Sammy Guevara came out to celebrate. Santana and Ortiz continued to beat down The Bucks and this brought The Rock ‘N’ Roll Express in to make the save. Ricky Morton hit the Canadian Destroyer on Santana and the crowd went wild. The Express and The Bucks celebrated in the ring afterward.</p>
