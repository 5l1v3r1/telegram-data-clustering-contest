      <p>Perth - <b>Australian </b>captain <b>Alica Molik</b> put a brave face on their <b>Fed Cup </b>defeat to <b>France</b> on Sunday, insisting they will use it as fuel to finally snap a streak of nine final losses.</p>
      <p>Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia led France to their third title by beating Ashleigh Barty and Samantha Stosur in the deciding singles rubber 6-4, 6-3 for a 3-2 victory in Perth.</p>
      <p>It meant Australia's 45-year wait to be crowned champions for an eighth time continues, with the country earning a reputation as one that can't finish the job after crashing at the last hurdle for a ninth straight time.</p>
      <p>They last won in 1974 and have since lost the final over six consecutive years from 1975-80, then again in 1984 and 1993 before another failure Sunday.</p>
      <p>Molik said the run of defeats wasn't for want of trying.</p>
      <p>"We gave everything today, we fell just a fraction short. That happens," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't regret a single day of practice or preparation that we've had. I don't have any regrets, but it hurts a lot.</p>
      <p>"It difficult for all of us to come to grips with losing because it means so much playing in front of our home crowd," she added.</p>
      <p>World number one Barty was distraught at the end, crying as the defeat sunk in.</p>
      <p>After a stunning breakthrough season, she was unexpectedly beaten in her singles rubber Sunday by Mladenovic in three epic sets and then in the doubles.</p>
      <p>Despite the painful loss, she said it had been a privilege to be in the team, which also included Ajla Tomljanovic, Astra Sharma and Priscilla Hon.</p>
      <p>"It's been an amazing year for us and to be able to get to the Fed Cup is very precious and we will cherish it," she said.</p>
      <p>Molik said defeat would only motivate them to go one better next year, when the tournament format will be overhauled with 12 nations competing in a six-day event in Budapest.</p>
      <p>"I think there's no question you get better through experience. We've lost in the final but it's pretty amazing the players got to feel what's it like to be in a final," she said.</p>
      <p>"The last couple of years we have always expected to be a team that was in the final and next year because of this we'll expect to be in another Fed Cup final.</p>
      <p>"We'll be stronger, more resilient and more prepared. What we'll do is use this moment for fuel to drive us into the future."</p>
