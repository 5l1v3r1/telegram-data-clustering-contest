      <p>In 2021 financial regulations are being made part of F1 for the first time, limiting teams to spending no more than $175m a season.<br/> <br/>But there are still parts that aren’t included in that budget, driver salaries being one of them as well as marketing, heritage costs and power unit development.<br/> <br/><i>“I think drivers should have been included in the budget cap, whatever that budget cap is,” </i>said Brown (quoted by <a href="https://www.motorsportweek.com/news/id/25151"><i>MotorsportWeek</i></a>).<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I think what that would do is it would force teams to make decisions on where they want to spend money.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It wouldn’t necessarily, if you felt driver made the biggest difference, keep paying your drivers what you’re paying them today, but I think it would have put pressure on the teams to figure out where do you get your biggest value.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“It wouldn’t have automatically reduced their salaries, but it would have forced teams to make more decisions on where to spend their money.”</i><br/> <br/>Brown had preferred the initial figure for the budget cap which was a lower sum of money able to spend and fewer exclusions, but reckons a good compromise has been made with the increased number.<br/> <br/><i>“[The ideal figure] was $150m plus fewer exclusions. Now it’s $175m plus more exclusions,” </i>he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>“I think what was presented in Bahrain [in 2018] was a better financial model that would have produced the same race results, maybe even arguably better race results because it would concertina the field that much more.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“For your shareholders, you like to provide them a return, and because we will run at the budget cap, had the budget been less, that would have provided a better return.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>“But there’s compromise, the guys spending a lot more obviously wanted it to be higher.”</i></p>
