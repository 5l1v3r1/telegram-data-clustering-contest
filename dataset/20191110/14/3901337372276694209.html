      <p>The Citizens put an end to a nine-game winless run with a 5-3 triumph over Rise and Shine in front of their new head coach Â Jan Olde Riekerink, who watched from the stands on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Kermit Erasmus will be looking to continue his form in front of goal after the striker bagged a brace on Wednesday to take his tally to seven goals in 10 matches.</p>
      <p>City come up against a Leopards outfit who have not featured since 25 October when they drew 2-2 with SuperSport United on home soil.</p>
      <p>Leopards have only registered two wins this season, while Luc Eymael is yet taste victory since taking charge in the dug-out as the Belgian was in the stands for the win over Bloemfonein Celtic.</p>
      <p>It was Leopards who claimed the spoils in the fixture last season, with Khomotso Masia netting the game's only goal.</p>
