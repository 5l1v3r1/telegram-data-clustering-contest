      <p>Nate Diaz recently took to Instagram <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/7/20953772/nate-diaz-retire-ufc-244-jorge-masvidal-dana-white-mma-news">seemingly announcing a hiatus or retirement from mixed martial arts</a>. He changed his tune on getting another crack at the BMF title winner, saying “F—k a rematch this s—t was over before it started. I’m goin on out on tour. Peace out fight game.”</p>
      <p>When asked about what many interpreted as a retirement post, Diaz insists that isn’t the case.</p>
      <p>“Who said I was retired?” Diaz told <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28044596/nate-diaz-said-was-retired-fight-tonight">ESPN</a>. “I’ll fight tonight.”</p>
      <aside><b><b>IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO </b><a href="http://bit.ly/2mBnel4"><b>Watch ‘UFC 244 - ‘MASVIDAL VS DIAZ’</b></a></b> <b>Stream all the fights broadcast LIVE — don’t miss a single second of face-punching action!</b> Plus, you get access to the best of the UFC Archives &amp; more! <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=BloodyElbow"><b>GET THE FIGHTS!</b></a></aside>
      <p>Diaz didn’t reveal his actual future plans, but prior to his UFC 244 bout, he did discuss <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/1/20943919/ufc-244-mma-news-interview-nate-diaz-jorge-masvidal-fight-new-york-madison-square-garden">his love-hate relationship with the fight game</a>. He says that he doesn’t really “need” to fight anymore, but isn’t comfortable just sitting around either.</p>
      <p>“I’ll never have to fight again (after UFC 244),” Diaz said. “I didn’t have to fight a long time ago. But what am I going to do? I’ve got all kinds of other stuff going on, but … I don’t like not fighting.</p>
      <p>“I think (fighting) is the best thing for me,” he continued. “It’s weird because it’s self-destructive fighting, and it’s self-destructive not fighting. Kill or be killed. Like I said before, it’d kill him with it, it’d kill him without it. I don’t want to do this (expletive) at all, but sitting back watching somebody else do it is not comfortable for me.”</p>
      <p>Diaz, 34, has been fighting professionally for 15 years now.</p>
