        <b>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has paid tribute to Irish Reds fan Sean Cox in the matchday programme ahead of their crucial clash with Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday afternoon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cox will return to Anfield for the first time since April 2018 when he suffered devastating head injuries after an attack in a random assault by a masked AS Roma supporter outside Liverpool’s stadium.</p>
      <p>The Meath native is a lifelong Liverpool fan and he had spent the last 18 months receiving treatment in Ireland before recently moving to a specialist neurological facility in the north of England.</p>

      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/jurgen-klopp-admits-attack-on-sean-cox-was-lowest-point-liverpool-tenure/">Earlier in the week, Klopp had outlined</a> the time of Cox’s injury was the most difficult spell of his career at Anfield to date and in his notes in the Liverpool matchday programme, the German took the time to pay tribute to the 54-year-old.</p>
      <p>“There are a couple of people in the ground today I want to make a special mention of – Seán Cox and his incredible family.</p>
      <p>“Seán’s story has touched all of us, and although initially the emotions were one of sadness that his life has been so affected purely by coming to support the football team he loves, we now have new feelings when we hear his name mentioned.</p>

      <blockquote>“Seán’s name and that of his wife Martina and his wider family makes me think of courage, spirit and renewal.</blockquote>
      <p>“Seán is an inspirational figure in this club’s story now. To know he plans to come back to Anfield – to support this club once more – brings perspective to so many things, both in football and life.I hope all of us here today, whatever colours we wear, do him proud in how approach this occasion.</p>
