      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Massachusetts Senate is set to debate legislation that Democratic leaders say will address the soaring cost of prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>This legislation would create a process to help identify drug price thresholds that supporters of the bill say pose a public health risk.</p>
      <p>The bill would also immediately address the price of insulin by eliminating deductibles and coinsurance for insulin and capping co-pays at $25 per month. It would also require pharmacists to notify patients if the retail cost of a medication is less than a co-pay or deductible.</p>
      <p>The Senate is scheduled to debate the bill this week.</p>
      <p>The release of the Senate plan comes just weeks after Republican Gov. Charlie Baker unveiled a health care bill also designed to stem the growth of costly prescription drugs.</p>
