      <h2>Manufacturer Promobot claims it can make androids that look like anyone - and one order has already come in from a customer who wants robot versions of their parents</h2>

      <p>Mounted on a tabletop in Russia, an eerily human-looking robot smiles, squints and even frowns when he gets angry.</p>
      <p>The bionic man, named Android Robo-C, is the first produced by a manufacturer which boasts it can make robot clones to look like anyone in the world.</p>
      <p>He may have to practice his frown though, after the venture was branded "creepy" and questions were raised about the legality.</p>
      <p>This week the robot was unveiled by Russian startup company Promobot - which claims one customer has already ordered replicas of their parents to greet guests at their home.</p>
      <p>Critics say the project opens the door for clones to be created of anyone without their knowledge.</p>
      <p>Promobot chiefs say they can make realistic likenesses of well known figures that can be used to hawk goods.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It said the service robots could replace staff in public-facing roles in places such as post offices, banks and council buildings.</p>
      <p>Aleksei Iuzhakov, chairman of the company's board of directors, said in a statement: "Everyone will now be able to order a robot with any appearance — for professional or personal use.</p>
      <p>"Thus, we open a huge market in service, education and entertainment. Imagine a replica of Michael Jordan selling basketball uniforms and William Shakespeare reading his own texts in a museum?"</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>And a person's mannerisms and turn of phrase will also be replicated by the bots.</p>
      <p>Mr Iuzhakov continued: "We can build a linguistic model based on popular phrases of a particular person – the robot will communicate and answer questions by analyzing frequent expressions of the 'original' and using a certain context of knowledge of this person."</p>
      <p>Company founder Oleg Kivokurtsev <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/human-like-androids-have-entered-the-workplace-and-may-take-your-job.html">told CNBC</a> that one family have ordered replicas of their mum and dad to greet guests at their home.</p>
      <p>He added: "Now we have more than 10 orders from companies and private clients from around the world.”</p>

      <p>But unsurprisingly it has made plenty of people uneasy, with many branding the idea "creepy".</p>
      <p>And it could also present legal problems if the person the android is based on finds out.</p>
      <p>In a blog post on <a href="https://hotair.com/archives/jazz-shaw/2019/11/05/russian-ai-robot-may-creepiest-yet/">Hot Air</a> , Jazz Shaw wrote: "It seems to me that if I ordered a robot that looks and sounds exactly like Chuck Schumer, for example, and started posting embarrassing videos of its performances online, he might be able to sue me.</p>
      <p>"Of course, we’re talking about a Russian company here, so I’m not sure how much they care about such laws.</p>
      <p>"But the customer still might wind up getting in trouble."</p>
      <p>The manufacturers say they envisage the androids being used as companion robots, or performing customer service roles.</p>
      <p>But it will need to be recharged every eight hours.</p>
