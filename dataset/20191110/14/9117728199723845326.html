      <p>Brawn, who was temporarily retired when the 2017 regulations had been agreed, believes it was a good idea at first to increase the downforce on cars but in turn has made it worse for the sport due to racing being harder.<br/> <br/><i>"The huge increase in downforce was 'let's make the cars go faster, let's make F1 better;' But what we have actually done is made it worse because the cars can't race each other,"</i> said Brawn (quoted by<a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/vettel-brawn-criticism-2017-downforce-cars/4594374/"><i> Motorsport.com</i></a>).<br/><i> </i><br/><i>"It's an example of an unthought-through programme. So, the cars are very quick now, but they're not raceable."</i><br/> <br/>But <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver Vettel doesn’t agree, stating that the move to bigger cars has made it more exciting for drivers.<br/> <br/><i>"I think the cars are a lot more spectacular since 2017. Now we know what the cars can do, it was quite slow before that,”</i> Vettel said.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>"Obviously we had very little drag, and it was great in a straight line, but that's not the exciting bit for us.</i><br/><i> </i><br/><i>"And it felt a bit slower than some years earlier. So I don't think that was the wrong direction."</i><br/> <br/>The German added that the wrong move in the regulations was increasing the weight of cars.<br/> <br/><i>"The wrong direction from my point of view was that the cars are so heavy, which is obviously related to in a way some of the safety measures, but I think everybody accepts that, and the power unit,” </i>he added.<br/><i> </i><br/><i>"I think that really is the biggest difference if you really make a big compare between now and where F1 has been 10 or 20 years ago, or even further."</i></p>
