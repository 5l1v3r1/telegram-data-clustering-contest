      <h1>Kim Boutin gets 11th straight first-place finish, third straight ISU gold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:59:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Kelsey Patterson, The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>MONTREAL -- Canadian Kim Boutin is still perfect this short-track season.</p>
      <p>Boutin continued her blistering start to the new ISU World Cup campaign by winning gold in the women's 1,000-metre Saturday in Montreal.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old from Sherbrooke, Que., also topped the podium twice last week in the season-opening event in Salt Lake City, Utah -- in the 1,500 and 500 races.</p>
      <p>Boutin has crossed the finish line first in all 11 of her individual races, from qualifying heats to the finals.</p>
      <p>"That's three-for-three for me, and one gold medal in each distance makes me feel good," said Boutin, who also set a new 500-metre world record last week. "I feel really good. It's a nice start to the season internationally. I'm happy with how I'm racing.</p>
      <p>"But I don't want to rest on those laurels."</p>
      <p>Boutin finished first in 1:30.827 after taking a lead with three laps to go and easily broke away from the other skaters.</p>
      <p>Korea's Seo Whi Min took silver in 1:31.268 while Fan Kexin of China earned bronze in 1:31.343.</p>
      <p>"I was in third place and the Koreans were skating so fast," said Boutin, describing her gold-medal race. "I saw their strategy of trying to block me. I tried making a move to the outside, then moved inside. I'm happy with that maneuver because it's one of the weak points I need to work on."</p>
      <p>Steven Dubois of Lachenaie, Que., also medalled on Saturday, finishing second in the men's 1,000 in 1:26.739.</p>
      <p>Dubois claimed silver behind Korea's Hwang Dae Heon, who won gold in 1:26.553. China's Han Tianyu was awarded the bronze in 1:27.078.</p>
      <p>Dubois started the race last, biding his time at the back of the pack. The 22-year-old made a move to the outside and jumped into third with two laps to go, then passed Tianyu on the inside with another burst of speed to claim silver.</p>
      <p>"I knew I had that in me," said Dubois, who fell twice last week in Utah. "To do that in the 1,000-metre, my weakest distance, I nearly cried earlier. I'm so happy. I came into this race with confidence, and now that I made it happen, I'm eyeing gold medals for the next races.</p>
      <p>"I felt really in shape this weekend and this is the proof."</p>
      <p>It was a disappointing day for five-time Olympic medallist Charles Hamelin, last year's overall world champion.</p>
      <p>Hamelin fell in the 1,500 semifinal and failed to advance to the final. The 35-year-old veteran was in third place with three laps to go when he stepped on a lane marker with his left skate and flew into the safety padding.</p>
      <p>Hamelin also failed to win an individual medal last weekend in Salt Lake City.</p>
      <p>"I stepped on a block and that's inexcusable," said Hamelin, who made his World Cup debut in 2003. "I was feeling good. My legs were in it. I was exactly in the position I wanted to be, near the front of the pack. I was waiting for those last few laps to make a real push.</p>
      <p>"I managed my race well, until my fall."</p>
      <p>Penalties and falls hurt Canada's up-and-comers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Rikki Doak of Fredericton, N.B., fell in the women's 1,000 semifinal while Montreal's Alyson Charles was penalized for an arm block at the finish.</p>
      <p>Courtney Sarault of Moncton, N.B., finished second in her 1,500 semifinal but was disqualified for an arm block.</p>
      <p>Claudia Gagnon of Saguenay, Que., finished sixth in the 1,500 women's final while Montreal's Maxime Laoun came in last in the 1,000 men's final.</p>
      <p>The finals for the 500 and relay races will take place Sunday. The Canadian women qualified for their relay final while the men failed to advance past the quarter-final.</p>
      <p>Notes: Boutin and Dubois are the national champions after they each won six gold medals at the Canadian short-track championship two months ago. ΓÇª The next stop on the World Cup short-track circuit is Nagoya, Japan on Nov. 29.</p>
