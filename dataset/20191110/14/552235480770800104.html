      <h1>Neil Lennon offers Scott Sinclair Celtic hope as he delivers definitive January transfer stance</h1>
      <h2>The 30-year-old hasn't played since September but failed to make the bench for the game against Motherwell.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T14:59:04+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Adamant Neil Lennon insists he doesn't want to lose out of favour winger <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-sinclair">Scott Sinclair</a> during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> star hasn't played since September but did earn himself a place among the squad for Thursday's thrilling 2-1 win over Lazio on Thursday.</p>
      <p>But the wide man, who is out of contract in the summer, failed to make the bench for Sunday's clash with Motherwell at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>And the Hoops boss admits opportunities will come Sinclair's way with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> side facing a jam-packed schedule before the winter break.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Lennon</a> told Sportsound: "I hope not. He will still play a part.</p>
      <p>"We've got nine games in December and I imagine Scott will figure the squad or even the team in some of those games."</p>
      <p>"With Tom Rogic coming back into contention, Scotty has been squeezed out at the minute.</p>
      <p>"I've got real competition in those places and Scott's finding himself out of the picture at the minute."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lennon admits striker Leigh Griffiths is still working his way back into contention but could return after the international break.</p>
      <p>He added: "He needs to get up to condition physically - hopefully he can do that over the next few weeks."</p>
