      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lil-pump">Lil Pump</a> has shared footage of the moment he was bitten by a snake during the filming of an upcoming music video.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old ‘Gucci Gang’ rapper shared the video on his Instagram account, revealing a bloodied hand after being bitten by the reptile as it was handed to him.</p>
      <p>“I JUST GOT BIT BY A SNAKE. WTF,” Pump captioned the clip. “I CANT FUCK W NO SNAKES. I HOPE I DONT DIE.” Watch the video below.</p>

      <p>A few seconds later, the serpent also attempts to bite another a member of the rapper’s entourage.</p>
      <p>The dramatic clip prompted reactions from many of Lil Pump’s nearly 18 million Instagram followers, including a comment from <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>: “Bro can’t f*** with snakes.”</p>
      <p>Pump released his second album, ‘Harverd Dropout’, earlier this year. Watch the video for ‘Gucci Gang’ below.</p>

      <p>In June he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lil-pump-calls-xxxtentacion-the-tupac-of-our-generation-2511835">claimed that XXXTentacion, the controversial rapper who was murdered in Miami last year, was his generation’s equivalent of Tupac Shakur</a>.</p>
      <p>Pump took to his Instagram Stories to eulogise his friend and former collaborator (they had worked together on the song ‘Arms Around You’). “Deadass though, X is the Tupac of our generation, no cap,” he declared to the camera.</p>
      <p>Pump wasn’t the only person mourning the Florida rapper on the anniversary of his death. <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-pays-tribute-xxxtentacion-first-anniversary-death-2510633">posted a message on Instagram</a>: “Miss you. Hope you’re okay up there. Long live you.” She had caught flak in the past for paying tribute to XXXTentacion, who had a history of domestic abuse charges, and in March <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-xxxtentacion-mourning-death-2468335">defended herself in an interview with <i>the New York Times</i></a>: “I want to be able to mourn, I don’t want to be shamed for it. I don’t think I deserve getting hate for loving someone that passed.”</p>
