      <p>An unemployed single mum is in total shock after an amazing gift was handed to her when she went to her local Jobcentre.</p>
      <p>Jodie Graygoose was handed £32,000 by a total stranger as she waited for a routine appointment.</p>
      <p>And it was all because the 30-year-old mum, who lives with her eight-year-old son Riley, sat in the right seat at the right time (10.10am to be exact) on that particular day.</p>
      <p>The time slot had been decided in advance and it was all down to who sat in the chair at that moment.</p>

      <p>Jodie says she was suddenly approached by a man who turned out to be Peter Kelly, CEO of Imployable, and left stunned by what he did.</p>
      <p>Jodie told our sister title <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/unemployed-single-plymouth-mum-given-3513994?">Plymouth Live</a> : "It was half term, we got to the Jobcentre in the pouring rain, and this guy came over and asked if we could have a chat.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t mind, I was there early anyway. I thought it would waste some time while waiting.</p>
      <p>"We went in and I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ I’m thinking, this isn’t happening. Surely he’s going to say he’s just joking. Apparently it wasn’t a joke.</p>
      <p>"He said ‘I want to gift you 1 per cent' and I was in shock. I wouldn’t claim to know anything about shares and don’t know what one per cent means. I’m terrible with numbers, so when he was writing it down I was like, ‘Come on, dumb it down for me.’"</p>

      <p>She added: "When I went to the offices to meet the team, we sat down and he talked me through it. When he told me I was like, ‘Oh my God, you must be crazy to give somebody you don’t know that kind of money.’</p>
      <p>"He said it was his way of giving back. People ask me how I feel and I still don’t think it’s really happening. I had to go to my Jobcentre appointment after, then rang my sister. She was like, ‘Are you sure?' And I didn’t know. We were very sceptical about it.</p>
      <p>"Obviously now I know it's real. I speak to Pete quite often and ask how it’s going. I don’t know who these people are half the time but it’s nice to know what’s going on."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"In the long run it’s going to be a complete change to my life.  I’m not ready to give it away yet, though. I think it could make a lot more and he’s capable of doing very big things. I can put money into it and get more shares, but I’m just letting it sit."</p>
      <p>"I just happen to be the person who sat in that seat. Wow. The Jobcentre was quite busy, it could’ve been anyone that sat there. I’m in shock really, it’s surreal."</p>
      <p>'It’s £32k. The possibilities are endless, it’s crazy. Maybe I’d buy this house? I know people my age who are married and own a house, I’m like ‘Hang on?! How have you managed that?’</p>
      <p>Her day-to-day life hasn't changed yet, though.</p>
      <p>"I drop to Riley to school, do a bit of housework and some shopping. Obviously I’m unemployed at the minute, which majorly sucks. I am hoping to get hired. I volunteer at a children’s centre."</p>
      <p>Peter Kelly said: "It is very rare that you get the opportunity to change someone's life directly, this campaign was about giving a gift to someone who is deserving of a break whilst inspiring entrepreneurs to increase their social value and close the gap between businesses and society.</p>
      <p>"I hope that people in the same position as Jodie can be inspired, be open to opportunity and achieve more than their circumstances dictate."</p>
      <p>Six other companies have already signed up to follow Peter Kelly's example and are set to gift equity totalling over £300,000.</p>
