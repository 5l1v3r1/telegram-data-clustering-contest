      <p>Here's a blast from the past, quite literally. Retro fans Hamster have dug out another old school SNK arcade game for re-release, as this week sees 1985 shmup <i>TNK III</i> made available for download on PS4 and Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/>Originally released in arcades during SNK's fledgling period, <i>TNK III</i> is a free-movement top-down shmup that sees players pilot a fearsome tank through a warzone, taking out infantry, gun encampments and other heavy metal monstrosities en route to each stage's conclusion. The vehicle is armed with standard machine gun fire as well a a limited number of rockets. <br/><br/><i>TNK III</i> was essentially a variant on Capcom's popular <i>Commando</i>, released the same year, and a precursor to SNK's own <i>Ikari Warriors</i>, which would follow in 1986. <i>TNK III</i> would receive numerous home computer ports under the less confusing moniker of <i>T.A.N.K</i>. and would even see a loose sequel on the NES in the form of <i>Iron Tank.</i> You can check out a video below courtesy of YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV35dlGveBg">RetroMGV</a> <br/><br/><i>TNK III</i> is available for download now on PS4 in Japan and Nintendo Switch worldwide.</p>
