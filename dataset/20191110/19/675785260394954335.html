      <h1>Man City's defensive disarray will cost them the title - not VAR and referees</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City's miserable run at Anfield - one win in 29 visits - continued in a match which left Pep Guardiola raging at some controversial VAR calls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:14:33+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:14</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>As he slumped into his bucket seat, Pep Guardiola spat something out.</p>
      <p>It was hard to tell what it was so let’s just call it his disgust.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah’s head had just added insult to the injury inflicted by Fabinho’s sweet right boot and the game was up for City.</p>
      <p>The vagaries of VAR and Liverpool’s ruthlessness on the counter-attack had combined to put Guardiola’s hopes for this particular contest to the sword.</p>
      <p>And in truth, the title game was probably up a while ago. Up when Pep failed to sign a high-quality central defender in the summer after Vincent Kompany left, up when Aymeric Laporte collided with Brighton’s Adam Webster at the end of August.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Forget any perceived injustices here. In the grand scheme of things, they are largely irrelevant.</p>
      <p>The simple fact is that whatever defence Guardiola fields is not a defence truly befitting of such stellar champions.</p>
      <p>No matter how eye-pleasing they are in possession - and they were again here - their defending is best watched from behind a sofa.</p>
      <p>The snapshots of their disarray were scattered across Anfield.</p>
      <p>Angelino clearly believing his inclusion was some sort of daydream, Kyle Walker and John Stones arguing as though they were a couple of hungover pub players.</p>

      <p>Fernandinho wasting his energy hectoring Michael Oliver, Claudio Bravo only ever looking remotely comfortable when the ball was at his feet.</p>
      <p>Good for an outfield player, trouble for a man with big gloves.</p>
      <p>But while City might have been better off with Walker in goal, a fit Ederson would not have saved this game for City.</p>
      <p>This is a very good team with one serious issue. They look like conceding against any decent attacking outfit they come up against.</p>
      <p>Raul Jimenez, Adama Traore and Patrick Cutrone gave them the runaround last month - no wonder this crack Liverpool unit got such joy.</p>
      <p>No wonder Sadio Mane appeared to be the only body and mind in the City box able to chart the flight of Jordan Henderson’s cross in adding the third.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There were other contributing factors in this defeat.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling’s persistence was exceptional and came with the normal amount of invention but his final choice of option was unusually flawed.</p>
      <p>Throw in the fact that Oliver gave him very little sympathy and it was a predictably frustrating afternoon for him even though he was a constant menace.</p>
      <p>Ditto Sergio Aguero, a quarter-stride from his standard sharpness. It was that quarter-stride that saw him pass up several invitations from Kevin De Bruyne.</p>
      <p>And in general, their finishing was a long way from the clinical level until Bernardo Silva’s sidefooted effort set up an interesting finale.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Of 18 attempts at goal, City managed to get just three on target.</p>
      <p>Compare that with Liverpool getting five of their 12 attempts on target.</p>
      <p>That would have been as much a source of Guardiola’s exasperation as the failure of Oliver and VAR to do City and favours.</p>
      <p>It has to be said that while this was a deserved win for Liverpool, they would be very happy to welcome Oliver back in the future, I’m sure.</p>
      <p>And inevitably, that Guardiola exasperation boiled over and took him out of that bucket seat to confront fourth official Mike Dean.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He held up his fingers to count the number of injustices he considered had been inflicted on him and his team.</p>
      <p>Then, to accompany his handshake of Oliver, he thanked the referee "soooo much".</p>
      <p>Who said sarcasm was an English peculiarity?</p>
      <p>But if he wanted to sarcastically thank anyone, it should have been his defence.</p>
      <p>It cost him this football match, it will cost him the title.</p>
