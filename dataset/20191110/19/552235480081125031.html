      <p>Scott McTominay is a major doubt for Scotland's Euro 2020 double header against Cyprus and Kazakhstan after being stretchered off in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>'s win over Brighton.</p>
      <p>The midfielder suffered an ankle injury towards the end of his side's 3-1 win against the Seagulls and was taken down the tunnel on a stretcher after several minutes of attention in the technical area.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">McTominay</a> was able to walk out of Old Trafford, albeit with a bit of a limp, and the severity of the issue will be assessed on Monday.</p>
      <p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer provided an update on McTominay at full-time.</p>

      <p>He said: "He went over on his ankle. It's a painful one.</p>
      <p>"I've had one and I was out for eight weeks. But then again sometimes you're back in two weeks, so I don't know.</p>
      <p>"He's in for a scan tomorrow... but it looked painful and he's not one for rolling around."</p>
      <p>McTominay was included in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a>'s squad for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> 's two remaining qualifiers next weekend and it's likely he'll be ruled out of the dead rubber fixtures.</p>
