      <p>Malizio, 28, was one of ten veterans invited to see the Penguins practice and take a tour of their locker room on Friday, ESPN <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/28038233/penguins-sidney-crosby-gifts-new-car-local-army-veteran">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Malizio, a single mother, Crosby heard that she did not own a car and had to ride the bus to get around.</p>
      <p>Crosby made it his mission to help Malizio. After the locker room tour, Crosby <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU5ACIij_dU">pulled</a> Malizio aside, leading her to a garage door within the training facility.</p>
      <p>“He was telling me how he heard about my story and he wanted to do something to help my situation,” Malizio said. “I was confused. I wasn’t sure what he could be talking about. He puts the garage up and it’s this car.</p>
      <p>“I felt weak in my knees. I felt speechless. I don’t really think there is a word to describe how you feel in that moment,” she continued.</p>
