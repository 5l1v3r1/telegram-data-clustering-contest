      <p>Shiv Sena on Monday officially severed its ties with the BJP at the Centre after Arvind Sawant quit as a union minister from the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This has given rise to speculations that a new political alignment in Maharashtra was imminent with Uddhav Thackeray becoming the new chief minister in the state.</p>

      <p>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Sunday asked the Shiv Sena, the second single largest party in the just-concluded assembly elections to indicate the willingness and ability of his party to form the government in Maharashtra. Uddhav Thackeray is likely to be the new chief minister with the outside support from the NCP and the Congress.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Maharashtra’s acting chief minister Devendra Fadnavis stepped down from his post citing his party’s inability to form the government.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who’s been very vocal with his criticism for the BJP since the assembly results were out, has put out a cryptic tweet.</p>
