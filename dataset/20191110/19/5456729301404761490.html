      <p>Liverpool have now increased to eight points their lead at the summit of the Premier League table following their 3-1 win over Manchester City in the Super Sunday clash at Anfield.</p>
      <p>With their feat on Sunday, Jurgen Klopp’s men have now won 11 and drawn one of their 12 league matches this season, leaving them eight clear of second-placed Leicester City and third-placed Chelsea, and nine points clear of the reigning champions City, who stay down in fourth after suffering their third defeat of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane proved enough for the home side to triumph despite City pulling one back late on through Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>In the day’s other game Manchester United also recorded an identical 3-1 win over Brighton while Wolverhampton piped Aston Villa 2-1.</p>
