        <b>Franco-Togolese photographer Djeneba Aduayom, based in Los Angeles since 2009, showcases her work for the second year at the AKAA art fair in Paris.</b>

      <p>Djeneba Aduayom moved to photography a few years ago after a long career as a dancer.</p>
      <p>"Most people that I photograph have been called 'ugly' [...] just because people don't understand culture or skin color," says <a href="http://www.djeneba-aduayom.com/contact">Djeneba Aduayom </a>to RFI.</p>

      <p>"This is Adele, I met her in Montreal, she's the daughter of a woman who used to be a soldier and a rebel in Sudan. Adele's mother migrated to Canada when she was young and Adele lost her identity," explains Aduayom.</p>
      <p>"My photos always use different elements to create visual poetry".</p>
