      <h1>Full transcript as livid Pep Guardiola speaks out after Man City defeat by Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was much calmer in his post-match interview than he was on the pitch during the defeat by Liverpool</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:19:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola was livid following Manchester City's defeat by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was incensed that a number of key decisions went against the Citizens at Anfield, as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ran out 3-1 winners.</p>
      <p>Guardiola was frustrated to see that a penalty wasn't awarded for a handball in the area just six minutes into the contest - around 20 seconds before Liverpool opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss felt a second handball decision went against his side in the second half, prompting him to confront referee Mike Riley after the game and sarcastically say: "Thank you so much".</p>
      <p>Guardiola was much calmer in his post-match interview than he was on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Here is everything the Manchester City boss had to say on Sky Sports and the BBC:</p>

      <h3>On his team's performance</h3>
      <p>"What happened today we showed why we are champions, I am so proud of my team, more than ever. We can be proud of how we played against the strongest team in Europe.</p>
      <h3>On the penalty decision</h3>
      <p>Ask the referees, don't ask me. Ask Mike Riley and the guys in VAR. Don't ask me, we tried to do our job. I would like to talk about our performance, it was so good. I know the way teams play when they come here and have so much respect for Anfield, and with the problems we had in the squad, the way we played was awesome. It was one of the best performances we have played.</p>
      <p>We played like back-to-back champions. That is the point. And if in seven months Liverpool win I will be the first to congratulate them.</p>
      <p>We cannot deny how good Liverpool are but the way we played, the way we created chances, the personality, it was good. At the end, in the boxes it was quite similar to the Champions League, three shots on target, and the first two were goals, so it's not easy. But after that we continued and we did it.</p>
      <h3>On why Man City lost</h3>
      <p>We lost because they scored three goals and we scored one. There are many things about one team and how they play and how we have to grow when we play away on the big stages like today.</p>
      <p>It was quite similar to the [Champions League] quarter-final, the way we played there apart from in the last 15 minutes of the first half we played so good in the first 30 but we were 3-0 down, and in the second half we were good, and it was an an incredible situations in that game too that sometimes influence the result but the performance was so good.</p>
      <p>We tried, we are always positive and never give up, that's why we won back-to-back in this league, and we want to fight until the end. But we dropped points for our fault, it is what it is but it's important to grow as a club and a team.</p>
      <p>I think it was an honour for both teams to show Premier League this kind of game. To see two English teams who want to attack, it is good advertising, and that's why on behalf of myself and hopefully Jurgen will think the same, it was good for the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>On picking Angelinho over Mendy</h3>
      <p>Mendy was two years injured and played one game, he needs a little bit more time to recover and Angelinho is a young player with a lot of quality, and he played a really good game.</p>
      <h3>On reacting to the defeat</h3>
      <p>We have showed many times, we have three teams, they are in front, they have more chances to be champions than us, but we are going to try. In football you can't always win. I am so proud to see my team play in this stadium against this team in that way.</p>
      <h3>On catching Liverpool</h3>
      <p>I don't know. I am not a magician, I do not know the future. Now we have <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at home, so we are going to try and beat them, and if we don't the next one.</p>
      <h3>On if he confronted Mike Riley sarcastically</h3>
      <p>No way, I congratulated them. You can't say anything here.</p>
      <h3>On being proud of his team</h3>
      <p>Congratulations to Liverpool, they scored three, we got one but I'm so proud of my team, few teams can come here and play the way that we did. We started incredibly well, we showed incredible bravery, they are the champions of Europe of and it is the most difficult stadium in the world. They had two shots and it was two goals.</p>
      <p>It's not easy after being two goals down to react the way we reacted. It was one of the best performances I have ever seen from my team. That's what we needed and hopefully we can continue to make the steps we need.</p>
