      <p>Since he entered the UFC in 2017, Zabit Magomedsharipov proved himself to be a legitimate contender at 145 pounds. After six fights and four post-fight bonuses, he now feels he is ready for a crack at the title.</p>

      <p>Speaking through a translator in a post-fight interview with ESPN, Zabit expressed excitement and interest towards the upcoming featherweight title fight between Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 245 this December.</p>
      <p>“I think it is going to be a very exciting fight; I can’t wait to see it,” Magomedsharipov said (via <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/9/20957189/zabit-magomedsharipov-i-think-i-fully-deserve-the-title-fight-against-holloway-vs-volkanovski-winner">MMA Fighting</a>). “I will also be happy to face the winner of this upcoming fight.</p>
      <p>“I think I fully deserve the title fight and after enough preparation, I should be more than ready to have a go at the title.”</p>
      <p>Zabit fought through a scrappy three-round battle against Calvin Kattar at UFC Moscow on Saturday, earning him a unanimous decision victory. But apparently, he labored through the final round, battling the effects of an infection he caught while training in Asia.</p>
      <p>“I knew he was a tough guy,” he said of Kattar. “We didn’t expect him to block so much, so I had to kick him in the legs. This is what was different from our expectations.</p>
      <p>“I got a little tired in the third round because I had an infection when I was in Thailand,” he revealed. “I have to take antibiotics, so I think that influenced my performance.”</p>
      <p>Zabit is now on a 14-fight win streak he began in 2013. He currently holds a record of 18-1 (with 13 wins by stoppage). He also won $50,000 for Fight of the Night honors.</p>
