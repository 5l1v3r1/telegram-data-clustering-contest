      <h1>Former referee claims Premier League explanation of Trent Alexander-Arnold handball was wrong</h1>
      <h2>Manchester City were furious with the officials for not awarding them a penalty before Liverpool's opening goal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:13:42+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Former referee Mark Clattenburg has blasted the Premier League over their explanation for not awarding a penalty to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City were furious when Trent Alexander-Arnold appeared to handle the ball in the area.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> went down the other end and opened the scoring through a stunning drive from Fabinho.</p>
      <p>The Premier League insisted the penalty was not given because Alexander-Arnold's arm was not in an unnatural position.</p>
      <p>It was also stated that the Liverpool defender did not have time to get out of the way.</p>

      <p>But former official Mark Clattenburg insists that is not why the penalty shouldn't have been given.</p>
      <p>"It is the arm of Manchester City forward Bernardo Silva that deflects the ball onto Alexander-Arnold and that is why, for me, play should not be brought back," <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7670373/Manchester-City-NOT-penalty-Premier-Leagues-explanation-wrong.html">he told the Mail.</a></p>

      <p>"If Silva's arm does not divert the ball, then yes, I believe a penalty should have been awarded as Alexander-Arnold's arm is in an unnatural position and he is using it to make himself bigger.</p>
      <p>"That is why I do not understand the Premier League explanation that it was not a deliberate handball."</p>

      <p>Despite angrily confronting referee Michael Oliver at full-time, Pep Guardiola refused to discuss the handball before the opening goal.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves asked him for his thoughts on the penalty, and the City boss insisted: "Ask the referees, don't ask me.</p>
      <p>Pushed for an answer, he said: "Ask Mike Riley and the guys in VAR. I would like to talk about our performance, it was so good."</p>
