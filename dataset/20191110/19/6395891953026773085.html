      <p>The shooting occurred at 12:30 a.m. in an encampment along the San Francisco Bay Trail in Richmond where the men were staying, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Update-Suspect-In-Shooting-With-Arrows-Faces-14823340.php">SFGate</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Police said they are looking for a black man in his early to mid-20s, about 5 feet, 6 inches tall with an athletic build, the website reported.  East Bay Regional Park District police Lt. Gretchen Rose said the man was clean cut with short, curly black hair and brown eyes. He was riding a purple Cannondale bicycle, Rose told <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Update-Suspect-In-Shooting-With-Arrows-Faces-14823340.php">SFGate.</a></p>
      <p>Both victims were staying at the encampment in a marshy area near the trail when arrows began flying, the <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/richmond-bow-arrow-shooting-bay-trail/">Mercury News</a> reported. One man was hit in his abdomen, while the other man was hit in his abdomen and leg, the newspaper reported. A woman in the same area avoided injury. The attacker is known to the victims, Rose told <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/Update-Suspect-In-Shooting-With-Arrows-Faces-14823340.php">SFGate</a></p>
      <p>Both men were listed in stable condition Saturday night after surgery, Rose told <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/09/2-men-wounded-by-arrows-fired-at-homeless-camp-along-bay-trail-in-richmond/">KPIX</a>.</p>
      <p>The assailant is facing two counts of attempted homicide, the <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/richmond-bow-arrow-shooting-bay-trail/">Mercury News</a> reported.</p>
