      <p>Kelly Brook has told of her shock after photographers on a red carpet told her to “breathe in”.</p>
      <p>The presenter and model, 39, was posing at a film premiere after some time out of the spotlight, when the incident took place.</p>
      <p>She said hearing the photographers tell her to “breathe in” was a “wake up call”.</p>
      <p>Brook told The Sun’s Fabulous magazine: “Well, I’m glad they told me.</p>
      <p>“They actually thought they were doing me a favour, but yeah, it was a bit of a shock.</p>

      <p>“But they knew me as skinny, and all of a sudden I’d turned up with bigger boobs, a bigger bum, bigger arms – just a lot bigger, so I think it was a shock for them as well.”</p>
      <p>The star said the incident made her feel she “should do something about it” and that she has since lost weight.</p>
      <p>But she said she would never want to go back to being as slim as she once was.</p>
      <p>“I’m still not the thinnest I’ve ever been in my life,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But nor would I ever want to go back there, because some of my thinnest times were also my saddest.”</p>
      <p>“My body likes being curvy,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It would be really difficult for me to be a skinny girl cos it’s not my shape or who I am and I’m not going to aspire to be something that’s unattainable.”</p>
