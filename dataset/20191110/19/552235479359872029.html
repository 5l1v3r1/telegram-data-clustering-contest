      <p><b>@JMcConachie:</b> Wow. That is awful. Those hospital ECG lines and that red stripe .. why .. why .. why ? Truly hideous !! 1 person in a million might think that looks nice. .. maybe</p>
      <p><b>@greagsy:</b> Worst home kit yet from <a href="https://twitter.com/adidasfootball">@adidasfootball</a> hopefully away kit may be better but going with history of away kits I doubt that. What is it with the Red and white sleeve?</p>
      <p>Not everyone was so negative though, there were at least a few out there who backed Adidas' new design and will be wearing them on their next visit to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hampden-park">Hampden</a> .</p>
