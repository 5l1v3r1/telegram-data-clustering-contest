      <h1>Calgary's snowfall warning over but snow still expected in southern Alberta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:32:54+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:32</time> by <a rel="author">Newsroom Staff</a></address>
      <p>It’s technically still fall, but you wouldn’t know that by looking outside.</p>
      <p>With 10 to 20 centimetres of snow expected, the city of Calgary — and indeed, much of southern Alberta — was under a <a href="https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/report_e.html?ab12#1029524821525364535201911090501ww1575cwwg">snowfall warning</a> that ended around noon.</p>
      <p>Environment Canada advises those driving to be prepared to adjust to changing road conditions, including potential reduced visibility due to heavy snowfall.</p>
      <p>And in Calgary, from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday, 93 incidents involving vehicles were reported: nine with non-serious injuries, and 84 without injury.</p>
      <p>The good news? Heavy snow is expected to end in the afternoon — so if you’re going to see the Calgary Stampeders take on the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/sports/football/cfl/calgary-stampeders/west-semifinal-gameday-bombers-at-stampeders-5-storylines/wcm/35a0cc6c-f128-4fa3-a78c-709793b42175">West Semifinal</a>, you (and the players) may only have to deal with the cold. Today’s high is a balmy -12 C, while tonight it’s only (only!) expected to drop as low as -15 C.</p>
      <p>And even more good news: temperatures are expected to warm right back up Monday, with an anticipated high of 2 C, and more positive temperatures forecasted throughout the week.</p>
      <p>Monday is also Remembrance Day. There will be <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/lest-we-forget-calgary-remembrance-day-ceremonies-listings">a number of services</a> — both indoor and outdoor — held throughout the city.</p>
