      <p>A top aide to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton mocked the University of Alabama after fans cheered for President Trump at a football game and the team went on to lose.</p>
      <p>The president and first lady Melania Trump attended the college's Saturday game against Louisiana State University, and his arrival was met with mostly positive feedback from the audience. Before the kickoff, the president and first lady stood and waved to the crowd after being introduced, eliciting big applause and chants of "USA" and "Trump 2020."</p>

      <p>However, the school went on to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/politics/trump-alabama-lsu-football-game/index.html">lose</a> the game 46-41, ending a 31-game stint of home wins. President and CEO of the Center for American Progress Neera Tanden poked fun at Alabama fans on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>"The Nationals fans boo Trump and win the World Series. Alabama fans cheer Trump and lose the first home game in 31 games," she tweeted. "It’s a sign."</p>
      <p>Tanden <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/about/staff/tanden-neera/bio/">was</a> the policy director for Clinton's 2008 presidential bid. Before that, she was a legislative director in then-Sen. Clinton’s office and deputy campaign manager and issues director for her 2000 Senate campaign.</p>

      <p>The Alabama-LSU game is just one of a few sporting events the president has attended lately. He made an appearance last month at a World Series game between the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros in Washington, D.C. While there, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fans-chant-lock-him-up-when-trump-announced-at-world-series">was met with "lock him up" chants</a> and boos from Nationals fans. The Nationals went on to clinch their first World Series title soon after.</p>
      <p>Days later, he attended a UFC match and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ufc-president-trump-wanted-to-attend-ufc-fight-the-day-after-2016-election">was welcomed</a> with mixed reactions.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Saturday's game, the University of Alabama’s Student Government Association <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alabama-student-government-threatens-to-pull-reserved-seats-of-students-who-protest-trump">warned students</a> their reserved seating could be revoked if they protested the president. Nearby the school, anti-Trump protesters flew a "Baby Trump" balloon that depicts the president crying and holding a cell phone, and a Trump supporter <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/fixing-to-get-rowdy-trump-supporter-charged-with-stabbing-baby-trump-balloon">was arrested</a> after using a knife to deflate it.</p>
