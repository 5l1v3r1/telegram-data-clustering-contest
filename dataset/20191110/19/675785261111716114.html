      <h1>Jurgen Klopp responds to claims Liverpool could throw away Premier League title</h1>
      <h2>Fabinho fired Liverpool into an early lead with a superb 25-yard shot following a controversial VAR decision before Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane put the game out of sight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:43:24+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author">David Maddock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-maddock/</a></address>
      <p>A beaming Jurgen Klopp insisted his side is feeling zero pressure after opening up a “crazy” nine point lead over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss urged the Reds to embrace their position as runaway Premier League leaders, after a sensational three goal salvo against the Champions. </p>
      <p>Fabinho, Mo Salah and Sadio Mane exposed real weakness in a visiting defence that no amount of complaints about VAR from Pep Guardiola could disguise. And Klopp said: </p>
      <p>“We don't feel any pressure, to be honest - if you are with us, then nine points is a positive. </p>
      <p>“Other people will 100% say, and have said already, that from now on Liverpool can only lose it.</p>
      <p>“That's a very negative approach, but I can promise you that we don't care.”</p>

      <p>City have now slipped to fourth after their third defeat of the season already, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> leading the chase eight points behind the Reds in second place. </p>
      <p>Yet if Klopp says his side will feed on the confidence their incredible position will bring, he also insisted no trophies are handed out in November. </p>
      <p>“Today we were completely focused on this game and not the table and how many points we are ahead of City,” he said. </p>
      <p>“That's crazy. Nine points ahead of City, you cannot imagine that something like this would happen. But it's not important because who wants to be first in November? You want to be first in May.</p>
      <p>“It's only November. The pressure or whatever is not there yet. It will come, but at the moment it's just opportunity and go for it and do the work, throw all in what you have and let's see what happens.”</p>

      <p>Klopp said his side’s performance was inspired by Sean Cox, the fan from Ireland who was viciously assaulted outside Anfield and left in a coma by a Roma thug. He returned to watch a game for the first time since his ordeal, and Klopp said: </p>
      <p>“I saw Sean after the game - Great! It was very, very nice. It was very nice.</p>
      <p>“He was very happy to see me and I thought I am much more happy to see him, but I think we had a draw!</p>

      <p>“It was special, it was nice. His wife and son were there as well, it was a wonderful day for them as well. It's what we wanted.</p>
      <p>“I can say already that if he moves to Liverpool then he gets a season ticket, 100%! </p>
      <p>“It was for all the boys really important news when we heard he was able to come to the stadium and watch a football game.”</p>
