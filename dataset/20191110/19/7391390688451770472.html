      <p>In honor of her longtime hair stylist and friend Chris McMillan's birthday, <a href="https://people.com/style/jennifer-aniston-throwback-friends-photo-chris-mcmillan/">Jennifer Aniston shared a <i>Friends </i>throwback picture</a> on Instagram, and the post will make fans nostalgic for the show. On Saturday, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4qAdoUhaui/">Aniston posted an old picture with McMillan</a> from the <i>Friends </i>set, which shows the hairstylist styling Rachel's '80s flashback look. The star also included a recent selfie with McMillan, in which both can be seen grinning.</p>
      <p>Aniston captioned the photo with a birthday message for her friend, captioning the pictures, "Happy Birthday, Chrissy. We've come a long way, baby." McMillan responded to the post in the comments, tagging the star with a simple heart emoji. On her Instagram Story, Aniston shared yet another sweet message for the hairstylist, writing, "One more pic, just because I love you! @mrchrismcmillan Happy Birthday!!"</p>
      <p>McMillan collaborated with Aniston on many of her iconic hairstyles over the last couple decades, ranging from <a href="https://people.com/style/jennifer-aniston-admits-she-couldnt-style-friends-hairdo/">Rachel's signature look on <i>Friends</i></a><i>, </i>to many of <a href="https://people.com/style/jennifer-aniston-wears-natural-hair-texture-red-carpet/">the actor's recent red carpet appearances</a>. McMillan recently styled the star's hair for <i>Good Morning America,</i> and in October, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4KXVv_h4Md/">Aniston posted a photo of her glam squad </a>ahead of the appearance on Instagram. In the photo, McMillan appears alongside makeup artist Angela Levin and clothes stylist Nina Clare. Aniston wrote, "Good Morning @goodmorningamerica #teamwork."</p>

      <p>The <i>Morning Show </i>star's throwback picture on Saturday is not the only recent time the star has celebrated <i>Friends</i>. On Oct. 15, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o8vWDhlOh/">Aniston posted a picture with the </a><i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o8vWDhlOh/">Friends </a></i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o8vWDhlOh/">cast</a>, including Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, and Matthew Perry. The photo was not the only <i>Friends </i>reunion to occur as of late — <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3RInE5jxc8/">Cox shared a selfie with Aniston and LeBlanc</a> in October, writing, "A rare night and I love it." On Friday,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4lRJHXjgnT/"> Cox posted another selfie with Perry,</a> writing, "Guess who I had lunch with today....I KNOW!!"</p>
      <p>The <i>Friends </i>costars are spending plenty of time together as of late, sparking rumors of a potential revival. On Oct. 28, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/jennifer-aniston-teased-the-friends-cast-is-working-on-something-together-19273559">Aniston teased a potential <i>Friends </i>reunion</a> during an appearance on <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</i>, saying the former cast mates were "working on something", but insisted the project would not be a reboot. "Listen, we would love for there to be something, but we don't know what that something is," she told the talk show host. "We're just trying. We're working on something."</p>
      <p>In early October, <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/08/jennifer-aniston-friends-reboot/">Aniston came out against a reboot of <i>Friends</i></a><i>, </i>explaining how new episodes might ruin the iconic series for fans on <i>The Howard Stern </i>show, according to <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>. "There’s an idea that if there’s a reboot of the show it won’t even be close to as good as what it was, so why do it? It would ruin it," she said.</p>
