      <h2>Rolf Buchholz from Dortmund, Germany entered the Guinness Book of Records for the enormous number of piercings he has scattered across his body - and now he has horns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T19:13:34+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A world record breaker who has 278 penis piercings in his penis has taken body-modification to a new extreme by having horns implanted into his forehead.</p>
      <p>Back in 2010 Rolf Buchholz was verified by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's most pierced man.</p>
      <p>If the 453 bits of metal attached to his body and dyed black eyes weren't enough to make him standout, synthetic horns that stick out of his forehead will do the trick.</p>
      <p>The German was spotted showing off the striking look at the 10th International Brussels Tattoo Convention, which took place this weekend.</p>

      <p>As well as the heavily tattooed Dortmund man, visitors to the convention enjoyed oggling body-modifications enthusiasts from across the world, skateboarding displays and a motorcycle wall of death.</p>
      <p>The splash Rolf made this weekend was not the first time he has made headlines.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014 he came to the public attention when he was turned away from Dubai International Airport because officials suspected him of witchcraft, <a href="https://www.7sur7.be/insolite/l-homme-le-plus-perce-au-monde-de-passage-par-la-brussels-tattoo-convention~a84af5c2/?fbclid=IwAR3iv82Wn6r9Va8KYRgYfaPSieW7PaDoQnJehiuFgi9stORNmmDZtorrvxA">7sur7 reported</a> .</p>
      <p>Magic has nothing to do with Rolf's look however.</p>

      <p>Human horns are actually made of either Teflon, coral or silicone which are then inserted beneath the skin of the forehead.</p>
      <p>As they stretch out the skin, larger and larger horns can be put in.</p>
      <p>The first recorded set of human horns belonged to American sideshow performer The Enigma, who had a couple of silicone nodules installed beneath his jigsaw tattooed face.</p>

      <p>While it may cause heads to turn, Rolf's extreme look does not cause him problems in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Back in 2017 the 60-year-old reassured the public that his 278 penis piercings had not negatively impacted his sex life.</p>
      <p>”It's not a problem at all," the telecommunications worker told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/prince-albert-piercing-sex-man-16958769">The Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>"I have had the piercings already so long, if there was a problem, I would have got rid of them already long ago."</p>
