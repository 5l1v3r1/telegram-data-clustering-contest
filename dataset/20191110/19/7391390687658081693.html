      <p>The Elusive Chanteuse is a fan of Lizzo, too. <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8543188/lizzo-mariah-carey-twitter-stamp-of-approval">Lizzo’s reaction to Mariah Carey’s stamp of approval</a> for her music is 100% that ecstatic. In a Twitter exchange on Saturday, Nov. 9, Carey let it be known that, contrary to her <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/mariah-carey-i-dont-know-her-meme">viral “I don’t know her” meme</a>, she does, in fact, know her — the her being singer and flutist Lizzo, that is. On Saturday, the “Truth Hurts” singer tweeted a page from <i>Vogue </i>that featured Carey on its spread with the tagline, “What would Mariah Carey do?” In a series of Q&amp;As, Carey is asked, “What up-and-coming singer should I listen to?” and she responded, “Lizzo.” The answer prompted an ecstatic response from Lizzo herself.</p>
      <p>“I got the @MariahCarey stamp of approval b*tch oooooohhhh my goooooooooooooodness,” <a href="https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1193263848473681922?">Lizzo tweeted on Saturday</a> alongside a photo of the spread. Not long after, <a href="https://twitter.com/MariahCarey/status/1193309621110398977?">Carey offered a reply of her own</a> and wrote, “You don't need my stamp, you're 100% that b*tch!!!!” In a <a href="https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1193315418095718407?">follow-up response, Lizzo tweeted</a> alongside a crying face emoji, “ilysm.”</p>
      <p>Lizzo and Carey have a lot in common in terms of record-breaking hits. Lizzo broke a Billboard Hot 100 record in September when her single <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/lizzo-celebrated-her-truth-hurts-billboard-record-with-a-throwback-pic-18797188">“Truth Hurts” became the longest-running No. 1 rap</a> single by a solo female artist. Carey, on the other hand, reigned supreme with “One Sweet Day” with Boyz II Men, her tenth chart-topping song that <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/greatest-of-all-time/6760674/mariah-carey-boyz-ii-men-one-sweet-day-most-weeks-no-1-billboard-hot-100">remained on Billboard charts for nearly 20 years</a> until it was <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8524477/mariah-carey-congratulates-lil-nas-x-old-town-road-chart-record">dethroned by Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Old Town Road” </a>in July.</p>

      <p>The commonalities don’t end there. On Twitter on Nov. 3, <a href="https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1191050893153705991?">Lizzo announced that she had a Christmas song</a> titled “Never Felt Like Christmas.” In her mentions, fans were quick to parallel the track to Carey, the self-proclaimed reigning queen of Christmas and holiday music. On the heels of Halloween on Nov. 1, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4UEpHdAFDX/">Carey took to social media to officially declare it Christmas</a> season. In the clip where she quickly transitions from a Halloween costume to holiday pajamas, she declared, “It’s time!” Carey also released a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/holiday/8530793/mariah-carey-25-years-merry-christmas-deluxe-album">deluxe anniversary edition of her 1994 Christmas album</a> <i>Merry Christmas </i>on Nov. 1 to celebrate the album’s 25th anniversary.</p>
