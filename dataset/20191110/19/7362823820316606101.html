      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/italy">Five Italian soldiers</a> were wounded in a roadside blast Sunday while returning from a mission to help Iraqi troops combat <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis">ISIS</a>, military officials said.</p>
      <p>Three of the wounded were in "grave condition" after the explosion, the Italian Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>Rear Adm. Fabio Agostini said the five – three in the navy and two in the army – are part of a special forces team that was traveling back after a mission aimed at finding ISIS refugees.</p>

      <p>Agostini told Italian <a href="http://www.rai.it/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-32815f97-4458-459d-b062-67a97788389f-tg1.html">Rai state TV</a> that Iraqi armed forces members were also injured in the blast but didn't say how many.</p>
      <p>An Iraqi security official said the bomb exploded next to their vehicle as they were traveling just outside Kirkuk – about 165 miles north of Baghdad, wounding six Italian soldiers.</p>
      <p>The discrepancy in the number of wounded wasn't immediately explained.</p>
      <p>U.S. military helicopters evacuated the soldiers to a hospital in Baghdad.</p>
      <p>One Italian soldier lost a leg to amputation due to injuries from the bomb and another suffered serious internal injuries, Italian Gen. Nicola Lanza de Cristoforis told Rai.</p>
