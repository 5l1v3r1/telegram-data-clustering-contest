      <h1>Florida county declares it's a ‘Second Amendment sanctuary’ to protect gun rights</h1>

      <p>Lake County, Florida, commissioners <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/lake/os-ne-lake-county-second-amendment-sanctuary-20191108-j3t2f7hohnfnhefl67nklxsknq-story.html">voted</a> to make their region a “sanctuary county” for the Second Amendment.</p>
      <p>In a unanimous resolution, the commission voted to declare the county a “Second Amendment sanctuary,” meaning that local law enforcement would not participate in any federally mandated gun restrictions. The resolution came in response to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/beto-orourke-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race">former presidential candidate</a> Beto O’Rourke’s plan to confiscate all AR-15s and other “weapons of war.”</p>
      <p>“This draws a line in the sand,” Commissioner Josh Blake told the <i>Orlando Sentinel</i>. “It doesn’t mince words. And I hope it sends a message to what can be described as the authoritarian control freaks.”</p>
      <p>He claimed that Democrats such as O’Rourke “see it as their job to forcibly disarm their fellow citizens, and with all due respect that simply won’t be happening in Lake County.”</p>
      <p>Commissioner Sean Park said the resolution isn’t a “knee jerk" reaction, but a vital piece of legislation that ensures county sheriffs honor the Constitution, adding, "It’s a problem across the country, and it’s very concerning about what could happen in the future.”</p>
      <p>An anti-gun violence group, the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, claimed the decision doesn’t have legal clout and wouldn’t hold up before the courts.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s really just posturing by the gun lobby and their supporters,” Andy Pelosi, a co-chairman of the organization, said. “It really doesn’t have any teeth.”</p>
      <p>Pelosi claimed the courts would not allow a local legislature to nullify federal laws, explaining, “It could be setting up a fight for nullification down the road. That’s possible.”</p>
      <p>Several counties and states throughout the country have adopted sanctuary policies related to immigration. Many sanctuary cities have forbidden local authorities to work with ICE when detaining illegal immigrants for other crimes.</p>
      <p>Florida has a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/florida-passes-ban-on-sanctuary-cities">ban on immigration-related</a> sanctuary cities that became law in May.</p>
