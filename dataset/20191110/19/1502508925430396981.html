      <p>Former <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chief-election-commissioner">chief election commissioner </a>(CEC) and former Cabinet secretary Tirunellai Narayana Iyer Seshan, who ushered in reforms in the country’s electoral process during his tenure as CEC in the 1990s, died of a cardiac arrest on Sunday in Chennai. He was 86.</p>
      <p>He was not keeping good health for the past couple of years and he passed away at about 9.30 pm.</p>
      <p>Born on December 15, 1932, in Thirunellai, Palakkad district, Kerala, Seshan was the youngest of six siblings in a middle-class family. His father was a lawyer in the district court.</p>
      <p>Seshan went to school in Kerala, then studied science at Madras Christian College in Chennai, where he won a gold medal for outstanding performance — but at the cost of his social life. With few job opportunities in the early 1950s for young scientists, Seshan became a lecturer in the same college at 19.</p>
      <p>He left in 1953 because the monthly salary was a paltry Rs 180. He decided to make a career in the civil services, and topped the police examination in 1953. In 1955, he topped the IAS entrance exam and began his long journey as a bureaucrat. T N Seshan was the 10th <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chief-election-commissioner">Chief Election Commissioner </a>and had served from December 12, 1990, till December 11, 1996.<br/><br/><b>ALSO READ</b>: <a href="https://mybs.in/2O5tXKW">T N Seshan, the man who helped clean up India's elections</a></p>
      <p>He had also won the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his services to the government in 1996.</p>
      <p>"His efforts towards electoral reforms have made our democracy stronger and more participative. Pained by his demise. Om Shanti," Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on Twitter.</p>
