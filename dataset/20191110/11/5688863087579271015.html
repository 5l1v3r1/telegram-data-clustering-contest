        <b>BCCI's Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) is awaiting the Karnataka police reports before taking further course of action against the accused in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match-fixing scandal.

      <p>Earlier this month, two players from the Bellary Tuskers team — namely skipper CM Gautam and Abrar Kazhi — were arrested by Karnataka police for allegedly being involved in match-fixing. According to the Central Crime Branch (CCB), the two are accused of spot-fixing in the final their team played against the Hubli Tigers on August 31. The duo was allegedly paid Rs 20 lakhs to bat slowly and also fix another match — against the Bengaluru team. </p>
      <p>“We have been conducting internal inquiries and now we are waiting for the police reports also. Inquiries are in a fairly advanced stage. Police reports hopefully would give us additional evidence,” Ajit Singh told ANI.</p>
      <p>A major breakthrough in the case was made when the CCB arrested international bookie Sayyam, in the case of match-fixing by celebrity drummer Bhavesh Bafna. </p>
      <p>Earlier, Nishanth Singh Shekhawat, Belagavi <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a>hers team’s owner Ali, Bengaluru Blasters bowling coach Vinu Prasad and batsman Vishwanathan was also arrested by the Karnataka police in connection with the spot-fixing case.</p>
