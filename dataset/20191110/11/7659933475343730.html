      <p>Israelis were prevented from entering Jordanian border enclaves on Sunday after a deal allowing farmers to work land there expired, 25 years after a peace treaty.<br/><br/>Since the two countries signed the deal in 1994, Jordan has allowed Israeli farmers access to the territories of Ghumar in the north and Baqura in the south under a renewable 25-year arrangement.<br/><br/>In October last year however, Jordan's King Abdullah said his country had notified Israel that it wants them back.<br/><br/>An AFP journalist in northern Israel on Sunday said the yellow gate to a bridge over the river dividing the two countries, long the portal for Israeli farmers to access Baqura, was locked.<br/><br/>Baqura, known in Hebrew as Naharayim, lines on a spit of land where the Jordan and Yarmuk rivers meet.<br/><br/>Ghumar, deep in the Negev desert south of the Dead Sea, is known in Hebrew as Tzofar.<br/><br/>The lands have been privately owned by Israeli entities for decades, but the 1994 deal saw the kingdom retain sovereignty there.<br/><br/>Israel's relations with Amman been increasingly strained.<br/><br/>Opinion polls have repeatedly found that the peace treaty with Israel is overwhelmingly opposed by Jordanians, more than half of whom are of Palestinian origin.<br/><br/>In 2017, an Israeli embassy security guard in Amman killed two Jordanians.<br/><br/>Three years earlier, an Israeli soldier at a border crossing killed a Jordanian judge he deemed a threat.<br/><br/>Just last month, Amman recalled its ambassador from Israel over the prolonged detention without trial in Israel of two Jordanians. The ambassador returned after the two were released.</p>
