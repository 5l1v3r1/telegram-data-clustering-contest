      <h1>Beluga whale seen playing catch in viral video ‘may have escaped Russian military spy programme'</h1>
      <h2>Researchers suggest unusually friendly whale was trained by Russian Navy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:40:11+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Conrad Duncan</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/beluga-whales">beluga whale</a> that was filmed “playing catch” with a group of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SouthAfrica">South African</a> rugby fans may have escaped from a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Russia">Russian</a> military spy programme, according to researchers.</p>
      <p>Experts suggest the whale could be Hvaldimir, a malnourished male beluga who is thought to be a lost “spy” animal trained by the Russian Navy.</p>
      <p>Hvaldimir was first reported in April 2019, when he was discovered near northern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Norway">Norway</a> with a harness attached to his body and a label that said “Equipment of Saint Petersburg”.</p>
      <p>The whale has been known to go up to boats to ask for food and play fetch and appears to be tame, suggesting he is used to interacting with humans.</p>
      <p>Footage of a whale chasing and returning the rugby ball to a group of men has been viewed more than 19 million times on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SocialMedia">social media</a>.</p>
      <p>“This is likely Hvaldimir, a once captive whale who may have escaped a Russian military programme,” Ferris Jabr, a science writer for the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>Scientific American</i>, said of the video.</p>
      <p>“Alone, malnourished, and injured, [Hvaldimir] roams the seas, seeking food &amp; attention from people.”</p>
      <p>Quad Finn, a researcher of aquatic mammals, and Darren Naish, a zoologist, both supported the theory.</p>
      <p>A man in the video can be seen wearing a jacket with the logo of a vessel called “Danah Explorer”, which is currently in Norwegian waters.</p>
      <p>However, the original source of the video is not known.</p>

      <p>The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research and the Hvaldimir Foundation, who help care for the whale, have not yet responded to a request to verify the theory.</p>
      <p>Mr Finn has said he believed the animal in the video was Hvaldimir and that the filmed behaviour was “not natural”.</p>
      <p>“Hvaldimir was taken from the ocean &amp; trained by humans to do tricks like fetching objects in exchange for food,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That he's malnourished &amp; still dependent on humans for food are likely reasons for what appears to be ‘playful’ behaviour.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, another viral video showed Hvaldimir helping to retrieve an iPhone that was dropped into the water near him.</p>
      <p>The whale may have become dependent on humans due to hand-feeding and does not appear to be able to successfully hunt and feed for itself, according to the Hvaldimir Foundation.</p>
      <p>When he was spotted in early September off the Norwegian coast, the whale also showed signs of injuries from boat propellers.</p>
      <p>Both the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/united-states">United States</a> and Russia are known to have military training programmes for aquatic mammals, such as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Dolphins">dolphins</a> and whales, who are sometimes trained to detect sea mines and recover inert torpedoes.</p>
      <p>A Russian military spokesperson denied in April that Hvaldimir was connected to a training programme but acknowledged that dolphins are sometimes used for military roles.</p>
      <p>Morten Vikeby, a former Norwegian consul in Murmansk, has offered an alternative theory that Hvaldimir is a therapy animal from a programme for disabled children near the Russian-Norwegian border.</p>
