      <p>An ex-serviceman is offering all uniformed veterans a free carvery in Plymouth today.</p>
      <p>Reza Davarian, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/much-loved-plymouth-restaurant-returned-2775300">who owns Heaven restaurant on Exeter Street</a>, served in the Royal Navy and wants to give something back to other servicemen.</p>
      <p>The popular restaurant known for its roast dinners opened in the former First and Last pub almost ten years ago.</p>
      <p>The venue underwent a major transformation in April 2018 into healthy eating restaurant 'Fuel', <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/much-loved-plymouth-restaurant-returned-2775300">but in April 2019</a> the Davarian family decided to take the eatery back to its roots.</p>
      <p>Joshua Davarian, 18, who works at the restaurant with his dad, Reza, said that their carvery has been popular among customers.</p>

      <p>He said that his family had decided to offer something back to the cause which is "very close to our hearts" and donations for the Poppy Appeal will also be collected at the premises.</p>
      <p>The free lunch is available for all uniformed veterans between 12pm and 3pm after the Remembrance Day service on Plymouth Hoe.</p>
      <p>After 3pm all uniformed veterans will be eligible for a free dessert.</p>
      <p>Joshua said: "In honour of Remembrance Day we are offering all uniformed veterans free carvery tomorrow (between 12 and 3pm) after the service on the hoe.</p>
      <p>"We are also collecting donations and selling poppies."</p>
