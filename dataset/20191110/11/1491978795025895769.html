      <h1>Gillian Wearing on George Eliot: 'She spoke of life from every side'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:30:36+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/juderogers" target="_blank">Jude Rogers</a></address>

        <i>The acclaimed artist discusses her new BBC film celebrating the life of the great Victorian novelist</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since her <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wearing-signs-that-say-what-you-want-them-to-say-and-not-signs-that-say-what-someone-else-66092">1992 series</a> <i>Signs That Say What You Want Them </i><i>to Say </i><i>and Not Signs That Say What Someone Else Wants You </i><i>to Say</i>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gillian-wearing">Gillian Wearing</a> has used real life in her art to tell us deeper things about ourselves. Her latest work will air on television and initially appears different: a BBC <i>Arena</i> film she has made about the novelist George Eliot. The threads between Eliot and Wearing reveal themselves as you watch <i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000b8nj">Everything Is Connected</a></i>, however: like Wearing, Eliot was a woman who left the Midlands to pursue a life of creativity, who took a microscope to life, observing it sensitively and sharply from all perspectives.</p>
      <p>The documentary also reminds us of how contemporary Eliot’s writing still is today. As an undergraduate in the late 90s, I was intimidated by the heftiness of <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot">Middlemarch</a></i> and <i>The Mill </i><i>on </i><i>the Floss</i>, and then floored by them. Eliot had such an acute understanding of the machinations of class and the workings of women’s internal lives. She had also prevailed, despite the restrictions placed on her by society: she wasn’t entitled, she wasn’t a man, but she still became Queen Victoria’s favourite writer. So many of her lines still feel intensely direct and relevant to me. Here’s one: “What do we live for, if it is not to make life less difficult for each other?”</p>
      <p>Broadcast to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Eliot’s birth (and the BBC’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/494P41NCbVYHlY319VwGbxp/explore-the-list-of-100-novels-that-shaped-our-world">100 Novels That Shaped Our World</a> season), <i>Everything Is Connected </i>combines footage from Eliot’s long-transformed homes in Nuneaton and Coventry, and her later life in London, with a diverse cast reading and exploring her work (this includes the actors Jason Isaacs and Sheila Atim, the Wolverhampton-born writer <a href="https://www.sathnam.com/">Sathnam Sanghera</a>, and ordinary locals of all ages). Taking its cues from the Turner prizewinner’s earlier film work (like 1997’s <i>2 </i><i>into 1</i>, in which twin boys and their mother lip-sync each other’s words) it reinvents the talking heads format in a radical way. We are taught how much we have in common with the Victorian novelist’s world, and the lessons Eliot still reveals to us through her work.</p>

      <h3>Q&amp;A with Gillian Wearing</h3>
      <p><b>Jude Rogers: How did this project come about? Was it personal enthusiasm?</b><br/><b>Gillian Wearing</b>: No, I didn’t know Eliot’s work very well at all before doing this. Janet Lee [BBC executive producer] and Martina Hall [director] approached me in February 2018, seeing if I’d like to do a biographical film on an author, and I jumped at the chance. The idea was really outside the zone of my thinking processes. I was asked to do Eliot specifically because I’m from the Midlands, I think, but I found a connection with her quite quickly in her books, particularly in <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/10/100-best-novels-middlemarch-george-eliot">Middlemarch</a></i>. I loved her interest in giving a voice to so many different people. I think about that a lot in my work, especially in letting people speak without judgment.</p>
      <p><b>What struck you most about Eliot while making the film?</b><br/>The extraordinary trajectory of her life. She began life as this judgmental, pious young girl who found fictional books frivolous, then met people in Coventry who had very radical ideas, which led her to leave religion behind completely. That’s quite a change already.</p>
      <aside>I wanted to find people who felt protective of her because they're from where she’s from</aside>
      <p><b>Then there was her relationship with George Henry Lewes, a married man who was her partner for 24 years. That still feels quite radical today</b><b>…</b><br/>It did – and she faced so much criticism for it. She was very sensitive about it. She had suffered from depression, headaches and kidney stones, which were very hard to treat then, so was often in great physical pain. But she also wrote stories full of empathy and reality and anger and all the emotions you can think of. She could properly speak of life from every side.</p>
      <p><b>Did it help that she came from the Midlands</b><b> – from outside a big city?</b><br/>Yes, I’m sure it did. It’s also a place that was changing very much at the time, and you feel those changes in small towns.</p>
      <p><b>Early on, the film takes us to places from Eliot’s early life, such as </b><b>Griff House</b><b>, which is now Nuneaton’s </b><b>Premier Inn</b><b>. The views of rolling fields Eliot once saw are now car parks. Were those journeys important to you?</b><br/>Yes, they changed the focus of the film. I’d read Rebecca Mead’s book <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/16/road-to-middlemarch-review-rebecca-mead">The Road To Middlemarch</a></i> [Mead is a consultant for the film, and features in it]. She writes about how the book changed her perspectives on life as she got older, and how she visited places from Eliot’s life. I was interested to revisit them too, to find traces of George Eliot through the present day. I also wanted to find other connections from the present that could bring you back into Eliot’s life, whether that be meeting people who had similar experiences to her, or people who were fans of her work, or people who feel very protective of her because they are from where she’s from.</p>
      <p><b>Which encounter meant the most to you?</b><br/>Meeting Ahmed, the teacher from Syria who works in the Bangladesh Centre [which is housed in the building in Coventry where Eliot lived in the 1840s]. We’d gone to film someone else there, but then Ahmed told us he’d read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeeliot">George Eliot</a> in Syria, so we filmed him too. He recalled Eliot writing about how everyone should have an education so that they could make their own decisions – that had really stayed with him. It was such a lovely moment, as it was to know that he’s working in her old home, inspired by what she taught him.</p>

      <p><b>How did it feel making the film as a Midlander?</b><br/>I did feel the connections. My family are all still in Birmingham – I’m the only person who came to London. Coventry I used to know too, but it’s a place I hadn’t really been to since my teens. Then it was a very concrete place, but unfortunately they’re demolishing a lot of those beautiful brutalist buildings. I wanted to evoke something about that memory for me, though, that might not be read by anyone else, to help me connect with it. And Adrian Utley [from the band Portishead] working on the music to make it sound like it came from the 60s and 70s helped with that.</p>
      <p><b>As someone who has worked with film in galleries and cinemas, did you find anything daunting about working for TV?</b><br/>Not exactly. I knew I was asked to do the film because I was an artist, because I’d give a different perspective. Also, <i>Arena</i> has a great history of experimental documentaries. The first I saw as a teenager had a big effect on me: it was on the song My Way [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074lx2">this renowned film</a> was made by the director Nigel Finch in 1979]. It just featured lots of people singing the song, which was very simple, but I remember thinking, wow, this is quite radical. What I did find daunting, though, was trying to tell the story of an author’s whole life through all of her writing. It’s different to just making a film about a book.</p>

      <p><b>The films seem to be showing, through Eliot’s writing, all the things that people have in common despite coming from different historical periods or cultural backgrounds. Was that a deliberate response to our times? Or to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/28/jo-cox-parties-must-agree-behaviour-standards-kim-leadbeater-catherine-anderson">Jo Cox comment</a> that we have “more </b><b>in common”</b><b>, in the face of Brexit and political unease?</b><br/>That wasn’t exactly what I was thinking of, but that’s a good analogy. I was trying to find connections between historical moments, too: how Eliot was a child of the Industrial Revolution, for example, while I was a child of the 70s industrial recession, and how her words still say so much to me. She understood how people were, and still are.</p>
      <p><b>What passage of Eliot’s writing has stayed with you most?</b><br/>There’s so many from the film. Like “When we are young we think our troubles a mighty business”, from her letter to Cara Bray [a friend]. And “she turned up her sleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life”: I really love that. That [passion] is what she gave.</p>
