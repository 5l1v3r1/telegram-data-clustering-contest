      <p>The reverse osmosis water filtration facilities have been set up in the less developed areas of the port city of Karachi and Hyderabad in collaboration with Al-Khidmat Foundation, the country’s one of the largest non-governmental organizations (NGO), said a statement by the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA).</p>
      <p>Kamil Kolabas, advisor to Turkish minister of culture and tourism, and TIKA’s Karachi Coordinator Ibrahim Katirci on Saturday inaugurated a water filtration facility in western Orangi town of Karachi.</p>

      <p>Kolabas, in his remarks at the inaugural ceremony, said that TIKA aimed to help provide clean and safe drinking water to the citizens of Oragni town through this project.</p>
      <p>Also, he said, similar projects were being launched in other parts of the country to help citizens have access to the potable water.</p>
      <p>Katirci said the agency wanted to help Pakistanis in their fight against waterborne diseases through the installation of reverse osmosis water filtration plants across the country.</p>
      <p>Salem Azhar, the chief executive officer of Al-Khidmat Foundation Karachi, for his part, thanked the Turkish government and TIKA for establishing the water filtration facility that would benefit thousands of area residents.</p>
      <p>Apart from Orangi town, TIKA has also established another three facilities in Karachi’s FB Area, and Millatabad, and Pretabad areas of Hyderabad district.</p>
