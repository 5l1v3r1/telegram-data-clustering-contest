      <p>A woman has reportedly poured water over <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/milo-yiannopoulos">Milo Yiannopoulos</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gavin-mcinnes">Gavin McInnes</a> while the far-right commentators were sat at a restaurant in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/WashingtonDc">Washington DC</a>. </p>
      <p>The two men, appearing to laugh off the incident in a video, claimed the woman had been sitting near them for around half an hour and threw water over them as she was leaving.</p>
      <p>“A grumpy feminist just poured drinks on us,” said Mr McInnes.</p>
      <p>“She said you should be ashamed of yourself and then she screamed kill yourself,” said the founder of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/proud-boys">Proud Boys</a>, a right-wing group the FBI called an “extremist organisation with times to white nationalism”.</p>
      <p>Mr Yiannopoulos said it was “only with water which is so lame”.</p>
      <p>He smoothed his hair over in the video, saying he rather liked how it looks when slightly wet.</p>
      <p>"I think I look kinda fresh and youthful," he said.</p>
      <p>The former Breitbart writer also said Mr McInnes, who co-founded Vice Media, got her back with Guinness in a separate video.</p>
      <p>Mr Yiannopoulos posted the video on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/telegram">Telegram</a>.</p>
