      <h1>Arsenal chiefs 'blame VAR' as part of Gunners' dismal start to campaign</h1>
      <h2>The Emirates hierarchy have reportedly placed some blame at the door of the controversial technology as pressure mounts on under-fire boss Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:23:26+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:23</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal chiefs have reportedly apportioned some blame to VAR for the Gunners' dismal start to the season.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery's men are winless in the Premier League since October 6 and were well beaten by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday as the Foxes ran out 2-0 winners at the King Power Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> will be at least eight points off the top-four pace after Sunday's fixtures and pressure is mounting on boss Emery with fans turning on the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>It is understood the Emirates hierarchy are ready to keep faith in Emery and thought the display at Leicester showed 'improvements' despite a third top-flight defeat of the season.</p>

      <p>And, according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1365197/2019/11/10/exclusive-arsenal-will-not-sack-emery-and-are-100-behind-the-manager-they-believe-club-are-on-the-right-path/">The Athletic,</a> chiefs accept that many of Arsenal's problems have been self-inflicted - but also place some blame at the door of VAR.</p>
      <p>Sokratis had a late goal controversially ruled out against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> a couple of weeks ago which would have given the Gunners a 3-2 win over their London rivals.</p>
      <p>The technology again hit the headlines on Saturday after officials took almost four minutes to rule out David McGoldrick's strike for Sheffield United in an eventual 1-1 draw at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>Despite yet another defeat, Emery issued a defiant response when quizzed over his future after the game.</p>
      <p>"We need time and patience. We have changed a lot of players and we have a lot of young players," he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"We are going to achieve. We have had a lot of circumstances that haven't helped but with consistency, we can do it."</p>
      <p>Asked if he will get the time from the board, Emery added: "The most important thing is to be calm but step up in our intensity and our work."</p>
