      <p>In a video released on his  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  account before the ceremony, Mr Corbyn paid tribute to the work of the Armed Forces both current and throughout history.</p>
      <p>He said: "We remember the many brave people from Britain and all across the world who put their lives on the line making huge sacrifices in two world wars which cost the lives of millions, and in all other conflicts since.</p>
      <p>"And we stand together to say: Never again."</p>
      <p>During the ceremony thousands of veterans and servicemen and women marched past the Cenotaph to pay their respects to those killed in past and present conflicts.</p>
      <p>Buglers of the Royal Marines sounded the Last Post before the wreaths were laid by members of the royal family, politicians, foreign representatives and senior armed forces personnel.</p>
      <p>Five former prime ministers, Sir John Major, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> , Gordon Brown, David Cameron and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> were at the event.</p>
