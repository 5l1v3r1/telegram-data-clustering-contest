      <p>The Citizens currently trail Jurgen Klopp's men by six points heading into Sunday's top-of-the-table affair in Merseyside.</p>
      <p>The two sides played to a goalless draw at Anfield in the Premier League last season, and the Belgian is looking forward to playing at the home of the European champions.</p>
      <p>"If you are somebody who wants to compete for titles and win, these are the games you want to play," the Belgium international toldÂ Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I like Anfield, I like it a lot. I love people being on you, being noisy, that is what it's all about. I love the passion of football.</p>
      <p>"Lately, a lot of new things have been introduced in football, but I still love things how they were in the old days - people shout and get their team forward. That is something that I learned in Germany, because fans are so behind their team.</p>
      <p>"The home players probably get a little bit more [from the Anfield atmosphere] but even if it's against you, you are at the top of the world, playing the best level. That is what you want.</p>
      <p>"You fight your whole lifetime to be here. That's the appreciation you get for working as a young child and getting here.</p>
      <p>"You know if you play away from home, people are going to be against you and when you play at home, people are for you. That's just the way the world rolls."</p>
