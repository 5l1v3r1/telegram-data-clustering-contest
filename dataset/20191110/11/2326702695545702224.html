      <p>Do you remember the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/corsair-void-pro-rgb-wireless-gaming-headset-review/">Corsair Void Pro RGB Wireless we reviewed</a> two years ago? Chances are that a fair few of you are using that headset right now! It’s one of the most popular in the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/corsair">Corsair</a> range, blending fantastic performance, comfort, sound quality and features in general. I loved that headset, and now it’s back again to kick ass and take names. However, you may have to look fairly hard to see what’s new, because at first glance you would be right to think you’re seeing double.</p>

      <h3>Corsair Void RGB Elite Wireless</h3>
      <p>Corsair has kept with the winning formula they had with the original Void Pro <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/gaming">gaming</a> headsets. If it isn’t broken, then don’t bloody fix it, and I think they’re wise to do so. I already know this is a comfortable headset, and so do many Corsair fans who may be looking for a replacement or upgrade. Don’t be fooled though, Corsair has gutted out the headset and given the drivers and the microphone an upgrade to keep it as competitive as ever. You now get an expanded frequency range from the improved 50mm drivers; 20hz to 30,000 Hz. The microphone now has a 100Hz to 10kHz range and an Omnidirectional pickup pattern.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No need to miss a beat – from the lightest footsteps to the thinnest explosion – thanks to the high-end custom 50mm neodymium drivers with a wide range of frequencies ranging from 20Hz to 30,000 Hz.</li>
        <li>With breathable microfibre mesh cushions and memory foam, the headset is designed to ensure long-lasting comfort during long gaming sessions.</li>
        <li>The omni-directional microphone captures your voice with exceptional clarity, while a Flip-Up mute function and a built-in LED mute light let you know when you’re listening or not listening</li>
        <li>Thanks to its robust design and aluminium frame, the helmet is built to withstand years of gaming.</li>
        <li>Experience immersive 7.1 surround sound across your PC, delivering multi-channel audio that puts you right in the heart of the action.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>“Immerse yourself in the action with the CORSAIR VOID RGB ELITE Wireless, boasting custom-tuned 50mm neodymium audio drivers, comfortable microfiber mesh fabric with memory foam earpads, and a 2.4GHz wireless connection.” – <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Headsets/Wireless-Headsets/VOID-RGB-ELITE-Wireless-Premium-Gaming-Headset-with-7-1-Surround-Sound/p/CA-9011201-EU">Corsair</a></blockquote>

      </figure>
      <h3>What’s in the Box</h3>
      <p>The headset comes bundled with a few nice accessories, giving you everything you need to keep powered up and connected.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_112915-880x617.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The wireless dongle is USB and works on both PlayStation 4 and PC. It’s simple enough, just plug it in, turn the headset on and everything pairs up pretty much immediately.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_112933-880x591.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A handy little windbreak for the microphone, which should help reduce some breathing noises if you need it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_112943-880x544.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Finally, there’s a nice heavy-duty USB charging cable. The headset is good for 16 hours of usage too, so you shouldn’t need to charge it every day. You could easily sub this out for your own cable if you lose or damage it though, as it’s simply USB to Micro-USB, not some custom piece of junk.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_112951-880x522.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>A Closer Look &amp; Performance</h3>
      <p>The Corsair Void RGB Elite is a superb looking headset, even if it does feel a little bit like your favourite band doing a comeback tour. It’s extremely similar to the non-Elite model because they haven’t really changed the external look at all. Of course, as I said earlier, if it isn’t broken don’t fix it. It may be a two-year-old design, but it’s still every bit as fantastic today as it was back then.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113008-880x546.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The headband is very durable, as are the ear cup mounts. It features a cast metal design that gives it a really firm and stable mount. This means they can use a single pivot mount on one side of the ear cup rather than two. That means the headset feels less bulky, and it also doesn’t stick out the side of your head too much either.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113016-880x559.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus, having the pivot mount means that while you can adjust the ear cups a little bit vertically, they can also be folded in horizontally. When wearing the headset around your neck between games, having them fold flat like this makes them a lot more comfortable to wear. Plus, any movement also helps ensure a clean and flat fit around your ears. We all have different shaped heads, so this is a welcome addition to the ergonomics.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113025-880x547.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The actual headband is mostly plastic, but that means it has a good amount of flex and movement too. Plus, that helps cut the weight down quite a bit. Make no mistake though, it’s plenty durable, and I suspect there’s a metal band running throughout the whole thing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113038-880x455.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I like that the length adjustment is integrated here too, rather than an exposed slider further down. It’s just a cleaner look overall. Plus, the range of adjustment is huge, so while it fits my kids, it even fits my massive head with room to spare; very few headsets extend far enough for me.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113051-880x552.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The headset is wireless, so you’re going to need some controls at your fingertips. There’s a two-way toggle here allowing you to make quick volume changes. However, you can also push it in to mute/unmute.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113105-880x519.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the side, you’ll find the master power control. The headset will turn its self off eventually when not in use, but to save power, it’s always best to shut it down yourself when you’re done. Below that, a handy microphone mute button so your mates can’t hear what you really think about their gaming.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113117-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The ear cups are very nicely padded with a lightweight and breathable memory foam. They’re fabric coated rather than leather too, which makes them much more comfortable for long gaming sessions. Of course, it doesn’t quite lock in the sound as much, but it’s really a matter of personal preference on the feel and sound you get from cloth/leather pads.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113134-880x540.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You get the same memory foam and cloth setup on the headband too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113142-880x455.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The microphone is “Discord Certified” but whatever that means, as any bloody microphone is. That’s like saying the headphones are ear certified. Regardless, it’s a decent size boom and the frequency range is pretty decent too. It cuts off below 100hz, so it’s not going to pick up too much bass tones and has quite an open and natural sound to it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113207-880x392.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I do prefer a detachable microphone myself, as I so rarely use one while gaming. However, if you’re a big online gamer, having it ready to deploy at any moment is no bad thing either.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113230-880x640.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The real star of the show here, however, has to be the new drivers. I must admit, for many users and in many usage scenarios, they may not even notice the difference. The are better on paper, no doubt about it. However, you need to remember to configure Windows Audio to output the full range and quality the drivers can accept, and you need an audio source that delivers the range. They’re not quite Hi-Res, but they’re getting up there.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113259-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Numbers and specs aside for a moment, I loved the sound of the Corsair Void headset when I first reviewed them. This does sound a bit better, and I can’t say fairer than that. Despite the breathable ear padding, there’s still a good low-end “womp” to the bass when you need it. Plus, the drivers have a lot of texture and warmth you can dial in on the mid-ranges. It brings out a lot of detail in your games and sounds absolutely stunning when cranking your favourite music. The treble has the biggest boost though, it’s crystal clear and sharp, and lends well to voice chat and competitive gaming, without compromising the rest of the audio range.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191109_113302-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Of course, this being Corsair, you can use their iCUE software. From here, you can tinker with those little RGB lights on the side. RGB on a headset? Yeah, I know, but this is small and tasteful as far as RGB goes, so I’ll allow it. Furthermore, you can tinker with the EQ and other profiles. I quite like the stock profile for a change, but a little push to the mid-ranges really worked well for giving more grunt to the sound; that’s all subjective though.</p>

      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/corsair-void-rgb-wireless-elite-white-880x563.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Corsair VOID RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset is available now for just <a href="https://amzn.to/2rnpC15">£109.99</a> in Carbon (black), that’s the one we reviewed. Or, for the same price, you can get the lovely <a href="https://amzn.to/34SJ1FT">white version</a>, pictured above. That’s not a bad price given the improvements to the microphone and drivers, and it’s only <a href="https://amzn.to/2Q3UfTK">£20 more than the older model</a>, which is around two years old now. For a premium wireless gaming headset, it’s not a “bargain” but it’s certainly a competitive option.</p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Corsair can do no wrong when it comes to their peripherals, or at least, it certainly seems that way. They haven’t done a whole lot to the Elite, and certainly not enough for existing Corsair Void owners to upgrade their existing models. However, for newcomers, this is the one to get and I suspect it’ll slowly replace the older model entirely in the not-too-distant future.</p>
      <h3>Better is Better</h3>
      <p>While the headset has the same design it had two years ago, it still looks modern and properly cool. The Carbon version we had is ultra-sleek and stealthy looking, while the white model looks crisp and cool. All Corsair has done is strip out the electronics and fit some improved drivers and a new microphone. The end result is a headset that’s just a bit better than it was before, and the old model still sounds pretty great too, so it wasn’t an easy improvement to make.</p>
      <h3>Added Value</h3>
      <p>The wireless technology is superb, it’s easily one of the things Corsair is best at. I had zero issues with connectivity, latency or anything like that really. The sound was as powerful and clear as I could have asked for. Plus, with it being wireless, you’re free from the shackles of nasty cables. At least until the battery runs low, which should be 12-16 hours depending on how hard you push the volume up. Add to that some fantastic iCUE software for tinkering with the EQ and RGB, and you’ve got a pretty sweet deal here.</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>Corsair are in a strong position with their latest gaming headset. It’s a nice improvement on the older model and the price is pretty competitive. It’s a bit cheaper than rival offerings such as the SteelSeries Arctis 7, Logitech G Pro X, and Turtle Beach 700, which would be the closest match for features and specifications. Highly recommended, again!</p>
