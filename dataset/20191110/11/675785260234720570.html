      <h1>Why the Queen is wearing multiple poppies for Remembrance Service</h1>
      <h2>Meghan Markle, Kate Middleton, Princes William and Harry and other members of the Royal Family have joined the Queen for the Remembrance Sunday service today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:40:06+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Royal Family have joined together today to honour the brave men and women who have given their lives to defend our country.</p>
      <p>The Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> are just some of the group who are attending the Remembrance Sunday service at The Cenotaph this morning.</p>
      <p>They will join war veterans, politicians and other high profile figures to pay their respects to the Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>The royal women are all dressed in black and are proudly displaying their poppies - but many fans have been left wondering why the Queen is wearing more than one.</p>
      <p>The Queen was seen wearing five poppies above a diamond brooch as she was joined by Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.</p>

      <p>There are many theories as to why she wears so many, the most commonly accepted being that each is to represent a different branch of the services</p>
      <p>She has one for the Navy, Army, Air Force, Civil Defence and the final poppy is to represent women.</p>
      <p>Kate normally wears three traditional poppies as well as a poppy brooch but this year she has decided to wear just a brooch. Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, was also seen wearing a brooch.</p>
      <p>The Royal Family play a key role in the Remembrance events, and have attended a number of services and engagements this week.</p>
      <p>Royal British Legion head of remembrance Catherine Davies told the <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/podsavethequeen/54c047b5-41c3-4fe0-a772-9f5aba97f1a8">Mirror's royal podcast Pod Save the Queen</a> just how vital their role is.</p>

      <p>She said: "They are incredibly important. As a charity we are honoured to have the Queen as our patron.</p>
      <p>"One of our charitable remits is that we are the national UK champion of remembrance. We work to ensure that the service and sacrifice of our Armed Forces is remembered and acknowledged over the Remembrance Weekend.</p>
      <p>"This is led by the Queen and the Royal Family who are obviously head of the Armed Forces, and who themselves have all been and worked either actively in the Armed Force or hold titles in the Armed Forces.</p>

      <p>"They have a great understanding, love and appreciation of our the service and sacrifice Armed Forces that is reciprocated.</p>
      <p>"They send an incredibly important message of why and how to remember and this is something as a state and we need to do together, which is I think is quite uniquely very British.</p>
      <p>"I think that's something that is really important to do, just taking the time  to acknowledge the things other people are doing on our behalf."</p>
