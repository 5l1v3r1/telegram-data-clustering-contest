      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:32:27+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brenda-edwards">Brenda Edwards</a> has insisted she was booked for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> All Stars but claims she was not told that the show had been axed.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/latest/daily-star-sunday">Daily Star Sunday</a> , the Loose Women panellist, 45, revealed she only learned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> had pulled the plug on the show by reading it in the papers.</p>
      <p>The former contestant told the publication: "We were waiting to hear what was going on.</p>
      <p>"And then I saw it in the paper that the series had been cancelled."</p>
      <p>After discovering the show had been scrapped, Brenda told the paper she was "surprised" and thought it was a "shame".</p>
      <p>She also revealed she didn't know what the reasons behind the show's cancellation were.</p>

      <p>A show spokesperson has hit back at Brenda's claims and explained she was "not due to take part" in the All Stars series.</p>
      <p>Brenda originally found fame on the ITV show in 2013 when she came in fourth place after being mentored by Sharon Osbourne.</p>
      <p>After impressing with her soulful voice, Brenda sailed through the competition and made it all the way to the live shows.</p>
      <p>During one episode, Simon compared Brenda to Shirley Valentine as he praised her new look.</p>

      <p>At the beginning of the month it was announced that music mogul Simon, 60, decided to cancel his upcoming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> spin-off.</p>
      <p>A host of winners and contestants from across the years were set to battle it out in the new version of the ITV show.</p>
      <p>The Mirror exclusively revealed Simon scrapped the idea at the last minute after struggling to get any big name former stars to take part.</p>
      <p>Leona Lewis was among those believed to have backed out.</p>
      <p>Now Simon's launching X Factor: The Band instead, and plans to find a new pop supergroup.</p>
      <p>He said the winners of his new show will do more than get a record contract, they'll also launch a new wave of music, "UK-Pop".</p>
      <p>2011 winners <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/little-mix">Little Mix</a> are also set to launch a rival BBC talent show, The Search, to put together a band to support them on their next tour.</p>
