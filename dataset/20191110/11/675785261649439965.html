      <h1>Former Tottenham star slams Arsenal's "complete lack of direction" under Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal suffered a 2-0 defeat to Leicester on Saturday, with Jamie Vardy and James Maddison both netting for the Foxes, which condemned the Gunners to their worst start for 37 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:21:09+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Jermaine Jenas has accused Arsenal of having a "complete lack of direction" during their defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>The Gunners were condemned to their fifth match without a win as Jamie Vardy and James Maddison both netted to send the Foxes second in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , who haven't won in the league for over a month, have had their worst start to a season for 37 years and pressure on manager Unai Emery has grown.</p>
      <p>Emery attempted to stop the slump at the King Power Stadium by moving to a three at the back formation, which was also utilised in the Europa League draw with Vitoria.</p>

      <p>But that tactic didn't work and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> midfielder has savaged Emery and the Gunners.</p>
      <p>“It’s not looking good. It’s the first time they’ve gone to a back three today and you could tell. They had no plan and there was a complete lack of direction,” Jenas said on  <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t9y1">Match of the Day</a> .</p>
      <p>“When they did have the ball going forward, they had no confidence and they didn’t want to play it forward. They played it negative and backwards and they went sideways.</p>

      <p>“It was like they were waiting to have the ball taken from them and Leicester didn’t disappoint.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal were not good enough to play in that system and were always going to make mistakes.</p>
      <p>“Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was playing right wing-back at one point and [Hector] Bellerin should have been telling him to get out of the way.</p>
      <p>“On the opposite side of the field there was [Alexandre] Lacazette playing left wing-back. How are you supposed to have a chance of playing counter attacking football?”</p>
      <p>“The complete inability to recognise that they needed to change the system or the tempo is worrying.</p>
      <p>“That is worrying for Unai Emery.”</p>
