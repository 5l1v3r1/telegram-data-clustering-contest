      <p>CONAKRY, Nov 10 — Guinea’s electoral commission has announced a long-delayed parliamentary election will be held in February next year, with tensions high after deadly clashes during opposition protests.</p>
      <p>The poor West African nation has been shaken by violence during weeks of demonstrations over opposition suspicions that President Alpha Conde is seeking to prolong his rule. </p>
      <p>The head of the country’s electoral commission, Amadou Salif Kebe, said in a statement yesterday that a parliamentary election would go ahead on February 16, 2020.</p>
      <p>But uncertainty remained over whether the poll would go ahead on that date after previous delays and lingering concerns over the electoral roll.</p>
      <p>In September the commission head had proposed the parliamentary vote be held on December 28, a date the opposition condemned as unrealistic and in the interest of Conde seeking a constitutionally-banned third term in office next year. </p>
      <p>The International Organisation of Francophonie, which is helping implement recommendations for auditing the electoral roll, said the December 28 date needed “to be reconsidered”.</p>
      <p>The current parliament started its five-year term in January 2014 and an election had been due in late 2018 or earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But the vote was delayed after heated debates between the government and opposition. In January Conde extended the current parliament’s term indefinitely. </p>
      <p>The electorial commission said yesterday it had unanimously approved the February date.</p>
      <p>Commission head Salif Kebe said a review of the electoral roll had begun and the results were “very comforting”.</p>
      <p>Conde, 81, became Guinea’s first democratically-elected president in 2010, but critics say his rule has been marred by a growing crackdown on dissent.</p>
      <p>The president, whose second term ends next year, launched constitutional consultations in September, saying the former French colony’s basic law “concentrates corporate interests” and needed reform.</p>
      <p>The opposition, fearing the president will try to push through an amendment allowing him to seek a third term, took to the streets.</p>
      <p>At least 16 civilians and a police officer have been killed in bloody clashes since the protests began in mid-October, according to the opposition, with dozens injured and arrested.</p>
      <p>Conde has neither confirmed nor denied his intention to seek a third term. — AFP</p>
