      <h1>Reports | Tottenham considering £50 million move for Memphis Depay</h1>

        <b>Tottenham are eyeing a move for Olympique Lyon star Memphis Depay with the North London side impressed by the 25-year-old’s performances. The former Manchester United star moved to the Ligue 1 after a disaster class of a spell at Old Trafford but has since resurrected his career in France.</b>

      <p>Despite losing Fernando Llorente and selling Vincent Janssen over the summer, Tottenham opted not to bring in new strikers to help out <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/harry_kane">Harry Kane</a>. But injury troubles and Kane’s struggles to put his best foot forward has seen the club consider a move for a new forward. However, while Spurs have been linked with a move for Erling Braut Haaland, the ESPN has reported that their top target is Olympique Lyon striker Memphis Depay.</p>
      <p>The report went on to add that the 25-year-old has been heavily scouted by Spurs and believe that the Dutchman is their man. The former <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> striker has enjoyed a new lease on life since his move to France with him struggling to make an impact at Old Trafford. But his performances has seen <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/ronald_koeman">Ronald Koeman</a> make him a big part of the Dutch squad alongside Virgil Van Dijk and Matthijs De Ligt.</p>
      <p>That has seen Depay linked with a move to Europe’s biggest sides including Liverpool and Manchester United. But having heavily scouted the 25-year-old, and his teammate Moussa Dembele, Tottenham currently lead the race and reports indicate that they could consider a January move. But with Olympique Lyon doing relatively well in the Champions League the club might not consider a move until the 2020 summer window.</p>
