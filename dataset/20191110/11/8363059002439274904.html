      <h1>Here's How the Lush Title Sequence For Steven Universe: The Movie Came Together</h1>

      <p>Have you heard the tale of Steven....’s opening credits sequence? The beautiful intro to the <i>Steven Universe</i> movie is a perfect scene-setter for the self-consciously theatrical film. A curtain opening, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-new-steven-universe-storybook-has-to-be-held-to-be-1838877682">a storybook</a>, a song straight out of <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/io9-discusses-the-musical-delights-of-steven-universe-1837942363">a classic musical</a>. It’s great stuff.</p>
      <p>And it took a good deal of effort to put together. In <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/one-of-steven-universe-the-movies-most-emotional-momen-1839535704">a behind-the-scenes video</a> from Cartoon Network, we can see just how it came together. Created by Chromosphere, the video – a very literal behind-the-curtain presentation – playfully demonstrates the layers of creation that went into the opening’s most iconic images, from the designs behind the opening curtain to the layers that went into creating Steven’s book.</p>

      <p>The video is a cheeky, playful exploration of the animation tricks that went into the opening, featuring some <i>Looney Tunes</i>-style sound effects and a bit of visual humor. It showcases just how deep every shot of the movie is, and how much effort goes into the most basic animation. We’re lucky to have a story quite this elegant.</p>
