      <h2>In No Time To Die James Bond reportedly drives an electric Aston Martin and fights a baddie who sets out to poison the oceans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T11:15:51+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>The new James Bond movie is set to be the most progressive yet as bosses have banned saucy innuendo, given 007 an electric car and eliminated plastic water bottles from the set.</p>
      <p>No Time To Die is believed to be Daniel Craig's final outing as the superspy and is due out next year.</p>
      <p>In the film, Bond ties the knot with Dr Madeleine Swann – the psychologist played by actress Lea Seydoux in 2015's Spectre - and retires to Jamaica.</p>
      <p>A new report has revealed movie bosses have gone to great lengths to change the culture around 007 - especially on the set.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7668333/Bond-gets-electric-car-wife-refuses-second-Time-Die-film.html">The Mail On Sunday</a> reports the phrase "Bond girl" has been banned along with all saucy innuendo, which is believed to have been eliminated from the film's script.</p>
      <p>A source said: "The phrase 'Bond girl' was outlawed from the set. The women in this film are all strong, brave and fiercely independent."</p>

      <p>One scene said to feature in the movie is said to show Madeleine telling her new husband she won't taking his name.</p>
      <p>The morning after their wedding, Bond says "Good morning, Mrs Bond" and she replies: "Don't you mean Ms Swann?"</p>
      <p>Environmental awareness is also said to be a huge feature of the film.</p>
      <p>Bond is believed to be brought out of retirement to battle a villainous plot to infect the world's oceans with a killer algae.</p>
      <p>The message was also spread behind the scenes as bosses reportedly banned single use plastic water bottles and handed out reusable versions to the crew instead.</p>

      <p>Around 11 tons of waste packaging was recycled during the shoot, and 1.6 tons of unused food was donated to a homeless charity.</p>
      <p>Keeping up the good work, film chiefs ditched Bond's gas-guzzling supercar and gave him an eco-friendly electric Aston Martin instead.</p>
      <p>The secret agent will be seen driving the £250,000 Rapide E model, one of only 155 vehicles which have been built.</p>
      <p>The film is due for release in April.</p>
