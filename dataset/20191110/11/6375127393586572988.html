      <h3>Immigration officers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) foiled on Thursday another human trafficking attempt after stopping four women who were illegally recruited to work abroad from leaving the country.</h3>
      <p>Bureau of Immigration port operations division chief Grifton Medina said the victims were supposed to board a flight to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia when they were intercepted at the departure area at the Terminal 3 of the NAIA.</p>
      <p>“Once they reach Malaysia, they planned to proceed to Dubai where they were recruited to work as household workers and drivers,” Medina said.</p>
      <p>The women, who were in their mid-30s to early 40s, presented company employment IDs under a major construction firm that turned out to be fraudulent. They claimed it was their company that sponsored their trip to Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“We contacted the personnel department of the company where they were purportedly employed and we were told that these women are not their employees,” said Ma. Bernadette Catipay, head of BI-NAIA 3 travel control and enforcement unit (TCEU).</p>
      <p>Catipay also found that the victims’ working visas for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and their plane tickets to Dubai will be given to them upon their arrival in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>The victim said a woman said to be part of the syndicate that recruited them handed to them their fraudulent documents at a convenience store at the Terminal 3 before they entered the immigration area.</p>
