      <h3>SIXTEEN more members of the New People’s Army were recently accounted for by the government through efforts made by the Philippine National Police Intelligence Group (PNP-IG) as the government continued its massive effort to convince more leftist rebels to surrender and avail themselves of the administration’s Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) program, the Journal Group learned yesterday.</h3>
      <p>PNP-IG director Brigadier General Edgar S. Monsalve said they are stepping-up their campaign against wanted NPA rebels and at the same time are embarking on a massive drive to convince rebels to finally surrender and leave their mountain hideouts in order to live a normal life.</p>
      <p>Monsalve said all PNP-IG Regional Intelligence Units have launched their full support to the government’s E-CLIP to ensure that NPA members who plan to surrender to the government will have a holistic package of benefits that they can avail of, such as livelihood assistance, medical assistance, education, housing, and legal assistance.</p>
      <p>Both the PNP and the Armed Forces believe that more NPA members are realizing they are fighting for a lost cause and would want to return to the mainstream of the society to live a free and peaceful life with their families away from violence and hardship in the mountains.</p>
      <p>According to the official, they have been facilitating the surrender of NPA members in full support to President Duterte’s Executive Order 70 which created a National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC) of which the PNP is one of its members.</p>
      <p>Last November 4, Monsalve said members of the Regional Intelligence Unit 3 oversaw the voluntary surrender of two NPA members identified as  Federico Laza alias ‘Ka Fidel’ and Joel Basilio alias ‘Ka Boboy’ in San Fernando City, Pampanga.</p>
      <p>Laza, a former commanding officer of the NPA’s White Area Command operating in Tarlac and Pampanga turned over an improvised caliber .22 sub-machinegun and an empty AK-47 magazine. On the other hand, Basilio is a former liaison officer of the same rebel unit in 2002.</p>
      <p>Last October 29, RIU5 operatives facilitated the surrender in Barangay Bapor in Masbate City of Melani Mali alias ‘Ka Lawrence,’ Erickson Capinig alias ‘Ka Junnel/Rex’ and Joseph Danao alias ‘Ka Jomar,’ all members of an NPA unit in Masbate province. They turned over two cal. .38 revolvers, a KG9 submachine gun and dozens of bullets to authorities.</p>
      <p>Last October 28, RIU9 agents facilitated the surrender of Cindo Estacoja alias ‘Ka Langgam,’ a member of the NPA Monterosa Command in Bgy. Alicia, Molave, Zamboanga del Sur.</p>
      <p>Last October 24, RIU14 officers negotiated the surrender of 10 NPA guerrillas in Sallapadan, Abra. Monsalve identified the surrenderers as Moises Tangbaoan alias ‘Ka Missing,’ Jimmy Blanza, Janzen Blanza, Crisostomo Blanza Sr, Lumen Ballera, Marvin Montemayor, Loida Tamonte Walton Tubania, Jhonny Blanza and Larnie Trongco.</p>
      <p>The surrenderees also turned over one M-1 Garand rifle, three rifle grenades, three M-203 live ammunition, one M-79 grenade, one MK2 grenade and several bullets to authorities.</p>
      <p>On orders of the PNP leadership headed by Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa, the PNP-IG and all other PNP regional offices and national support units have stepped-up their campaign against NPA insurgents, going all-out to capture their wanted leaders and other partisans while embarking on a massive drive to convince majority of them to finally surrender and leave their mountain hideouts in order to live a normal life.</p>
