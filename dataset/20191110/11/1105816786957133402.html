      <p><b>DUBAI: </b>Iran has discovered a new oilfield in the southwest of the country that has the potential to boost its reserves by about a third, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Workers and the exploration arm of the National Iranian Oil Company …have found an oilfield with 53 billion barrels of reserves,” Rouhani said in a televised speech in the central city of Yazd.</p>
      <p>The field stretches over 2,400 sq km (927 sq miles) in the oil-rich Khuzestan province, Rouhani said.</p>

      <p>Iran ranks as the world’s fourth–largest reserve holder of oil, and the second-largest holder of gas reserves, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>
      <p>Iran had an estimated 157 billion barrels of proved crude oil reserves in January 2018, the EIA website said.</p>
      <p>Since withdrawing from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, the United States has reimposed sanctions to strangle its vital oil trade.</p>
