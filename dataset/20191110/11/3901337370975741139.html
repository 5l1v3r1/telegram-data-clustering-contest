      <p>Speaking ahead of the biggest fixture in Mzansi, Modise shared some of the things we might not have known about the Chairman, Dr Khoza.</p>
      <p>“I remember that Irvin would call key players in to his office and normally he doesn’t do it the whole season but when it is the derby he calls the key players in the office and reminds them what the derby means, not to the club but to the fans,” the former Bucs midfielder said.</p>
      <p>“There is one thing that people don’t know, Irvin is more concerned about the fans, and he wants the fans to be happy all the time so when you play for Pirates you play for the fans.”</p>
      <p>“He once said to me, people don’t understand that sometimes you find a guy that is stressed at work, or home, he can’t wait to come to the game and pay that 20 bucks even though he is broke, but he knows that for 90 minutes he can escape. He told that straight to me and then I understood what it meant to play for Orlando Pirates,” he added.</p>
