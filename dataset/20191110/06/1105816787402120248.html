      <h1>Pupils learn to assemble AK-47 rifles as Russia marks Kalashnikov's centenary</h1>

      <p><b>MOSCOW: </b>More than a hundred Russian schoolchildren were taught to assemble AK-47s in a Moscow park on Saturday as the country this weekend celebrates the centenary of the birth of Mikhail Kalashnikov, inventor of the legendary rifle.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the 100th anniversary of Kalashnikov’s birth is to be marked by a number of events, including museum display, biopic and patriotic lessons.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, dozens of boys and girls, some clad in camouflage fatigues, took part in a competition that saw them play paintball and assemble mock-up Kalashnikov rifles in a park in southern Moscow.</p>
      <p>“At least 100 people took apart the Kalashnikovs today,” Andrei Starykh, a director at the youth organisation that organised the competition, Gvardia, proudly told <i>AFP.</i></p>
      <p>He said Gvardia regularly organises similar events and Saturday’s get-together was not directly linked to Kalashnikov’s anniversary.</p>

      <p>He insisted however that children in Russia need to know “real life” and therefore have to know how to assemble the celebrated weapon.</p>
      <p>“How can one not know?” asked instructor Roman Kuzmin.</p>
      <p>“So much is happening around the country,” he said, adding that boys are often mesmerised by the gun.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing extra there, it is very beautiful.”</p>
      <p>Kalashnikov, who died in 2013 at the age of 94, is seen in Russia as a national hero and symbol of the country’s proud military past.</p>
      <p>His assault rifle has become a weapon of choice for both guerrillas and governments the world over.</p>
      <p>It is also a staple of military education in Russia.</p>
      <p>More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide and about 50 armies use the AK-47 including those in Iraq and Somalia.</p>
