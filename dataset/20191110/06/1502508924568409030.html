      <p>Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jairam-ramesh">Jairam Ramesh </a>on Sunday criticised the BJP government's plan to revise the base year to calculate the gross domestic product growth from the current 2011-12 to 2017-18, saying it was a "terrible" idea.</p>
      <p>Citing a media report in this regard, Ramesh asked if it was only to make Modi 2.0 government look good on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp-growth">GDP growth </a>rates.</p>
      <p>He suggested that 2018-19 should be made the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp-base-year">GDP base year </a>as 2017-18 was "an abnormal year with notebandi (demonetisation) and hasty GST".</p>
      <p>"Government wants 2017-18 as new <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp-base-year">GDP base year.</a> Terrible idea! It was an abnormal year with notebandi &amp; hasty GST. Is this only to make Modi Sarkar 2.0 look good on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gdp-growth">GDP growth </a>rates?" he tweeted.</p>
