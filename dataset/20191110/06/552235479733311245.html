      <h2>Former Northern Ireland boss Michael O’Neill insists it’s a remarkable landmark for a player he has the utmost respect for.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Steven Beacom</a></address>
      <p>Steven Davis has been hailed as the perfect role model as he prepares to beat an international record held by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-beckham">David Beckham</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star, who turns 35 on January 1, is set to win his 116th cap for Northern Ireland against Holland at Windsor Park next weekend in a Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>In doing so he will overtake England hero Beckham (115) in terms of international appearances and become the UK’s most-capped midfielder of all time.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland’s outgoing manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/michael-oneill">Michael O’Neill</a> insists it’s a remarkable landmark for a player he has the utmost respect for.</p>
      <p>Last month Davis passed club boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>’s total of caps (114 caps for England) in a 3-2 friendly win against the Czechs.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, who will stay in charge of the Irish until the end of the Euro qualifiers despite becoming Stoke boss on Friday, insists the classy star can comfortably play at the highest level for at least two more years.</p>

      <p>Only three British players remain ahead of Davis when it comes to caps.</p>
      <p>Davis could close in on Pat Jennings (Northern Ireland 119), Wayne Rooney (England 120) and Peter Shilton (England 125) if he continues to juggle playing for his club and country.</p>
      <p>O’Neill reckons Davis, who captained his nation in the Euro 2016 finals, is now a sharper performer than he was during his first trophy-laden spell at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Rangers fans are enjoying his contribution under Gerrard and Davis marked his 250th game for the club by scoring in Thursday’s thrilling 2-0 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> victory over Porto.</p>
      <p>O’Neill claims it is testament to Davis’ character that he has stuck by his country even when it went through some difficult times.</p>

      <p>He said: “The achievement in becoming the UK’s most-capped midfielder is phenomenal.</p>
      <p>“You have to consider that Steven will have gone over and above players of the quality and status of Beckham and Gerrard.</p>
      <p>“It is all the more special because when you play for a smaller nation it can be easy to become a little bit disillusioned with international football at times.</p>
      <p>“Steven played through a lot of periods when it wasn’t so easy and there was a lot of expectation on him as a younger player.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It must have been difficult at times in that situation.</p>
      <p>“So it is pleasing for me and him that we have also had successful periods. Steven has been key to that. He has been a hugely influential player and I’m pleased for him that he is achieving a notable landmark.</p>
      <p>“Steven is the perfect role model for any player.</p>
      <p>“You get your rewards if you continually turn up, show commitment and quality – and that’s what Steven has done over a fantastic, long career.”</p>

      <p>O’Neill, who last year turned down the opportunity to manage Scotland, faces a big challenge saving Stoke from the Championship drop.</p>
      <p>And he still hasn’t given up hope on steering his nation to another Euro finals, with two huge qualifiers left against the Dutch and Germany.</p>
      <p>He has been a regular visitor to Rangers games this season, watching Davis turn on the style.</p>
      <p>Once an attacking midfielder, Davis now sits in the middle of the park dictating play and using his experience to halt opposition attacks.</p>
      <p>With Rangers about to offer him a new deal, O’Neill is certain there is much more to come from the veteran.</p>
      <p>He reckons the super-fit star could cruise through top-level football for at least two more years.</p>
      <p>O’Neill said: “Steven is coming up for 35 now but I certainly think he can play for at least another two years.</p>
      <p>“Steven is as valuable as he has ever been. He is going to be an extremely difficult player to replace.</p>

      <p>“Certainly us changing his position has helped him and also with his position at Rangers as well.</p>
      <p>“He is such an intelligent player and goes about his job brilliantly.</p>
      <p>“I’ve watched him several times for Rangers this season and he has been superb positionally.</p>
      <p>“Also to have that composure and calmness in the biggest and most hostile arenas is where Steven really demonstrates his value.</p>
      <p>“I seriously haven’t seen any physical deterioration in Steven.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I would argue he is sharper and quicker than he was possibly when I became Northern Ireland manager eight years ago.</p>
      <p>“He had a groin injury when I came in and was going through that difficult period with Rangers, when they hit financial trouble, before his move down south to Southampton.</p>
      <p>“Now I look at him and see him running games for Rangers.</p>
      <p>“He’s playing against guys who are 10 or 12 years younger and he is not having any issues. Long may that continue. I’m sure he will go on to become the country’s most-capped player. He is not letting up in any way.”</p>
