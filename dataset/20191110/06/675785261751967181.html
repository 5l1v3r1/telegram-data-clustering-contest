      <h1>Logan Paul vows to "contest the commission" after being docked points in KSI defeat</h1>
      <h2>The American YouTube star was left raging after the decision cost him victory in the main event fight from Staples Center in Los Angeles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:28:24+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Logan Paul has been left furious by the referee's decision to controversially dock him points in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/breaking-ksi-beats-logan-paul-20852127">his defeat to KSI.</a></p>
      <p>The American YouTuber was two points in the fourth round after being found to have punched KSI after he had been knocked down.</p>
      <p>It turned out that the two points were crucial, as he lost 56-55 on the third and final judges' decisive scorecard.</p>
      <p>One judge scored the fight 56-55 in favour of Paul, the other scored it 57-54 in favour of KSI, before the final and decisive card ensured the split decision result.</p>
      <p>After paying tribute to KSI and congratulating him for his victory, Paul fumed at the official for the costly decision.</p>

      <p>"I thought it was a legitimate knockdown," Paul said. "I didn't get a warning.</p>
      <p>"I got two points taken away from me and that's the reason I lost tonight. I would love to contest the commission because I think I should have got a warning. I don't think it was fair at all."</p>
      <p>Paul was then asked whether he wants to fight KSI for a third time.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'd love to fight KSI again, these are the best moments of my life.</p>

      <p>"I just want to say fair play to KSI, you are one of the toughest people I know and I wish you the best. I can talk trash but it's all for show."</p>
      <p>However, KSI ruled out a third fight, claiming: "It's done."</p>
      <p>KSI added: “I'm on to the next thing. You should do MMA. You should fight CM Punk.</p>
      <p>“I moved around quite a bit. I got him a lot to the body, to slow him down.</p>
      <p>“I felt good and I was happy. It's different and I took some big shots.”</p>
