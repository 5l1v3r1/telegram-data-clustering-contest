      <p>Sydney - Australia's boxing community was in shock on Sunday after middleweight<b> Dwight Ritchie </b>collapsed and died aged just 27, reportedly while sparring.</p>
      <p>Sydney's Daily Telegraph said he took a body shot on Saturday, walked back to his corner and collapsed. He could not be revived.</p>
      <p>It said he was sparring in Melbourne with Michael Zerefa, who is preparing for a rematch with Jeff Horn, a former WBO welterweight champion.</p>
      <p>Ritchie's promoter Jake Ellis confirmed the news on Facebook.</p>
      <p>"It is with great sadness and shock to announce that the fighting cowboy Dwight Ritchie sadly passed away today doing what he loved," he said.</p>
      <p>"As Dwight's promoter and friend it's unbearable to accept the tragic news that's just surfaced."</p>
      <p>Richie, nicknamed "The Fighting Cowboy", held a 19-2 record.</p>
      <p>He last fought in August, losing to Tim Tszyu by a unanimous decision for the IBF Australasian super welterweight title.</p>
      <p><b><i>"I am truly saddened by the passing of Dwight Richie,"</i></b> Tszyu said on Instagram.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>"Only fighters understand the bond shared between them, especially those who shared a ring together. Rest In Peace to a true champion."</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Ritchie's death comes less than a month after American boxer Patrick Day died after suffering a serious brain injury during his knockout defeat to Charles Conwell in Chicago.</p>
      <p>He was the third boxer to die from injuries sustained in the ring this year.</p>
      <p>Argentina's Hugo Santillan died in July following a bout in San Nicolas, just north of Buenos Aires. His death came just two days after Russian fighter Maxim Dadashev died from brain injuries sustained in a fight in Maryland.</p>
