        <b>The BCCI Annual General Meeting will be held on December 1 at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. In the amendments to the constitution of the board, there are six major points as the board officials believe that some regulations do not fall in line with the suggestions given by the Lodha Panel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lodha Panel had given some suggestions that were approved by the Supreme Court and some regulations do not match with the suggestions given and will be discussed in the meeting by the office bearers and other board members. The first point is about the obligation to approach the Supreme Court (SC) for every amendment made which is not possible according to the officials.</p>
      <p>"The final constitution of the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> contains a requirement that any amendment to the constitution needs to be approved by the Supreme Court. This was not part of Justice Lodha Committee reforms. This did not form part of the principal judgement of the Supreme Court dated July 18, 2016. By this provision, the members' autonomy and the right to seek legitimate changes would every time have to be approved by the Supreme Court. This is not practical," read the report in TOI.</p>
      <p>Sourav Ganguly will be serving as the BCCI President only for a period of ten months as that will complete a tenure of six years of work for him in the board and he will subject to a compulsory cooling-off period for three years. This is the second point that needs reconsideration as Ganguly may not be able to create the necessary impact in such a short space of time.</p>
      <p>"The cooling-off period applied finally in the BCCI Rules takes into account whether a person has held a post for 6 years in both the member association and the BCCI. This restriction is proving to be a big blow to selecting talented and experienced hands," the report added.</p>
      <p>The third point is about the disqualification of members which the officials think leads to inexperienced people representing India at the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/icc">ICC</a>.</p>
      <p>"Disqualifications are too wide. If persons without sufficient experience are made to represent India's interests in the ICC, there will be no recognition for India's contribution to cricket at the international stage," the point read.</p>
      <p>"It will be increasingly difficult to find able hands to guide and nurture the interests of IPL which is the most valuable property of BCCI. The holding of a public office is too wide a definition that is different from being a government servant or a minister," it further read.</p>
      <p>There will also be a discussion about the role of the Secretary as the officials think that the Secretary's position will need a rethink and relook.</p>
      <p>"The powers of the Secretary have been curbed to the extent that the post is reduced to a mere minor functionary as against the powers vested in the paid executives. The elected representative should be allowed more responsibility. It is proposed that the post be returned all its powers, including over the CEO. A new sub rule (e) is proposed along with a modification to sub rule (f) the apex council must act through the secretary and not the CEO," the point read.</p>
      <p>The last point is about the powers that are taken away from the office bearers and have been handed over to the CEO as the officials believe that the powers need to be returned to them.</p>
      <p>"The day-to-day management of the BCCI shall be conducted by the professionals in both cricketing and non-cricketing matters under direct supervision, direction and control of the respective office bearers," the report concluded. </p>
