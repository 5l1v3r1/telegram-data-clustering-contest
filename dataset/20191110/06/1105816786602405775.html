      <h1>Iceland students see chilling reality of melting glacier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:48:36+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>VIK, ICELAND: </b>Icelandic seventh-grader Lilja Einarsdottir is on an unusual field trip with her class: they’re measuring the Solheimajokull glacier to see how much it has shrunk in the past year, witnessing climate change first-hand.</p>
      <p>“It is very beautiful but at the same time it is very sad to see how much it has melted,” says Lilja, bundled up against the autumn chill in a blue pompom hat.</p>
      <p>Each October since 2010, now-retired schoolteacher Jon Stefansson has brought students aged around 13 from a school in Hvolsvollur – a village about 60 kilometres (40 miles) away – to the glacier to record its evolution.</p>
      <p>The results are chilling: nestled between two moss-covered mountain slopes, Solheimajokull has shrunk by an average of 40 metres (130 feet) per year in the past decade, according to the students’ measurements.</p>
      <p><a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2096040/3-climate-strike-named-2019-word-year/"><b>‘Climate strike’ named 2019 word of year</b></a><br/>On this blustery October day, the youngsters – armed with a GPS, a measuring tape and two yellow flags – calculate the distances on foot from various spots, struggling against strong winds.</p>
      <p>Once done, some of the students hop in a dinghy and cross a lake of brown meltwater to reach an imposing wall of ice, the so-called terminus, or front of the glacier.</p>
      <p>Here, they determine the gap between the terminus and a handpainted sign at the end of a footpath, where previous students have recorded their measurements over the years.</p>
      <p>The numbers on the sign, pitched in black sand and steadied at the base by a pile of stones, indicate how many metres of ice have disappeared over the past years: “24”, “50”, “110”.</p>
      <p>“When [the first students] started here, you couldn’t see any water. So it [the glacier] was very big at first,” says Lilja.</p>

      <p>Glaciers cover about 11 percent of Iceland’s surface, including Vatnajokull, the largest ice cap in Europe.</p>
      <p>But they have lost about 250 cubic kilometres of ice in the past 25 years, or the equivalent of seven per cent of their total volume.</p>
      <p>“Now we have lakes that are forming in front of many of them,” says glaciologist Hrafnhildur Hannesdottir of the Icelandic Meteorological Office.</p>
      <p>Iceland in August unveiled a plaque commemorating the country’s Okjokull glacier, the first to be stripped of its glacier status in 2014.</p>
      <p>The plaque was meant as a wake-up call on the effects of global warming as scientists fear the island’s 400-plus glaciers could be gone by 2200.</p>
      <p>Solheimajokull, where the students go, is a popular tourist spot as it is one of the closest to Reykjavik, only 150 kilometres away. Icelandic Mountain Guides, one of three operators that runs year-round visits, had 27,000 clients in 2018.</p>

      <p>Solheimajokull, about 10 kilometres long and two kilometres wide, is an outlet glacier of Myrdalsjokull, the country’s fourth-biggest ice cap.</p>
      <p>Under the ice here lies Katla, one of Iceland’s most powerful volcanoes, which last erupted in 1901 and is long overdue to do so again, scientists say.<br/>The glacier receded by 11 metres in 2019, a significant amount but far from the record 110 metres registered last year.</p>
      <p>“It depends more or less on the weather [and] how the glacier is breaking,” explains teacher Stefansson.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you get a big cliff falling into the water and then you get a very, very big measurement.”</p>
      <p>Since the school started its measurements, the glacier has shrunk by 380 metres in almost a decade.</p>
      <p>“When we see this, it’s like proof [of global warming]. If we thought that we were maybe wrong, this is proof we weren’t,” says 12-year-old Birna Bjornsdottir.</p>

      <p>The measurements are neither scientifically exact nor official but they do indicate the changes underway and their acceleration in recent years.<br/>Official measurements from the Iceland Geological Society show Solheimajokull shrank by around 200 metres in 2018, putting it among the country’s top three glacier shrinkages.</p>
      <p>It has been receding every summer since 1996.</p>
      <p>The melting can be observed with the naked eye, with drops of water dripping from the ice, sometimes running into little streams.</p>
      <p>“I see a large change in the glacier’s volume: it’s a lot lower than it used to be,” says Daniel Saulite, a Scottish guide who has worked on the glacier for five years.</p>
      <p>“In the front, there is also a lot more crevassing, and also the access becomes increasingly difficult.”</p>
