      <h2>It was a bad weekend for Aubameyang as his first game skippering Arsenal ended in a 2-0 defeat to Leicester</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:55:21+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been pictured alongside his crashed Lamborghini on a bad weekend for the Gunners captain.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang's first game as skipper didn't go to plan as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> were beaten 2-0 at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City, leaving Unai Emery's side down in sixth place in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Hours before that, Aubameyang had been left looking on in despair as he stood next to the crumpled bonnet of his £270,000 silver Lamborghini following a prang on the M25.</p>
      <p>The sportscar had been involved in a crash with a Mercedes near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10313746/arsenal-aubameyang-crashing-270000-lamborghini/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573343041">The Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>It is believed nobody was hurt in the incident, which happened as Aubameyang was heading home from training on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>An onlooker told the Sun: “It was rush hour so cars were not going fast and travelling around them.”</p>
      <p>Aubameyang had an effort ruled out for offside during Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are eight points off the Premier League's top four following Leicester's win, which moved Brendan Rodgers' side up to second ahead of Manchester City's visit to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>

      <p>The defeat - which was watched by Arsenal's technical director Edu and Head of Football Raul Sanllehi - turned up the pressure on manager Emery, who was taking charge of his 50th Premier League game as Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have taken 87 points from those 50 games - one fewer than in their final half-century of matches under Emery's predecessor Arsene Wenger</p>
