      <h1>Christian Doidge reveals Hibs mixed feelings as he admits Paul Heckingbottom is right to be angry</h1>
      <h2>The striker got his first league goals but it came too late to save the manager who signed him his job.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Christian Doidge finally came good for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> – then admitted he felt terrible his hat-trick came a week too late for the gaffer who put his neck on the block to sign him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom’s</a> flagship £350,000 summer signing bagged his first league goals in a 4-1 rout of struggling St Johnstone.</p>
      <p>Scott Allan added the other before a late Stevie May consolation.</p>
      <p>And after taking interim boss Eddie May’s side within two points of the top six, the 27-year-old revealed his first treble as a pro was a bittersweet moment.</p>
      <p>He said: “It felt good to get on the scoresheet, it has been a long time coming.</p>
      <p>“Under the old manager I was getting into good positions but not putting the ball in the net so it’s a real confidence booster.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, I feel terrible about them coming now. Paul’s probably got choice words for me, looking at the scoreline, but that’s football.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to move on and see who the next manager will be.</p>

      <p>“Eddie has been really supportive all week and it’s been a fun week. We went out and gave it a really good go and the shape helped us.</p>
      <p>“The pressure got to us in the last couple of games but we were not far away from winning well.”</p>
      <p>May made five changes from the side who capitulated to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in the Betfred Cup semi-final last week.</p>
      <p>His big decision was playing two up top with Allan behind.</p>
      <p>But he revealed he picked the team from a completely blank canvas after revealing he hadn’t seen a single first-team game all season.</p>
      <p>May said: “I’ve not been to one game – I choose not to since I’m in charge of the academy.</p>
      <p>“That’s great for me because I can’t judge the players on what they’ve done in the past. All I can do is look at what they’ve done in training which is why I picked the team I did.</p>
      <p>“It couldn’t have gone any better and I’m pleased for the team.</p>
      <p>“The two up top certainly helped, they were both exceptional even though Christian got the goals.</p>
      <p>“It should be the standard this club sets out to achieve. If what we saw out there is not normal, and they’ve been exceptional here and not in other games, then we just have to ask how they maintain it.”</p>
      <p>The glass-half-full guide to Hibs will tell you they’re now six unbeaten but they were given more than a little help from Saints.</p>

      <p>Jason Kerr’s slip gave Florian Kamberi easy access to cut back Lewis Stevenson’s long ball, inside 90 seconds and although <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christian-doidge">Doidge’s</a> first attempt was timid, so was Zander Clark’s attempt to hold it and the former Forest Green frontman fired in the loose ball.</p>
      <p>There was definitely more art to his second 15 minutes later, a beautifully-timed clip from another Kamberi assist which flashed across Clark and inside the post.</p>
      <p>The only thing keeping hope alive for the home fans after an abject first half was the fact Hibs had coughed up virtually every lead they’d had all season, including a 2-0 at home to Ross County a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>Within three minutes though, another self-inflicted wound had ruled that scenario out.</p>
      <p>This time it was Matty Kennedy. The misplaced pass to Allan was bad enough but his half-hearted attempt to jog after the Hibs playmaker as he bore down on goal was lamentable.</p>
      <p>When Allan delivered the coup de grace with a sweet finish to his 30-yard run ,Kennedy stood with his head in his hands, still 30 yards back, presumably trying to hide his shame.</p>
      <p>Saints shipped a fourth before the hour, Doidge heading home a tempting Jason Naismith cross.</p>
      <p>Stevie May’s 90th minute counter, turning home Anthony Ralston’s ball, was scant consolation.</p>
