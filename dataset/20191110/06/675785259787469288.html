      <h1>England win five-match New Zealand T20 series after yet more super-over drama</h1>
      <h2>Eoin Morgan's England needed cricket's answer to the penalty shootout once again to get past New Zealand in a rain-affected fifth T20 in Auckland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:55:17+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p>England broke New Zealand hearts in yet another dramatic super over to claim a brilliant 3-2 T20 series win.</p>
      <p>After five matches, across 11 days, yet again these two teams could not be separated in 'normal' time and for the second occasion in 2019 a super over was called upon to settle things following a tie.</p>
      <p>Unlike the 50-over World Cup final that ended in a second tie, and needed a boundary countback to decide the trophy, this game was settled by the brilliance of Eoin Morgan who posted 17 from the over with Jonny Bairstow.</p>
      <p>And the skipper then took a stunning running and diving catch at cover to dismiss Tim Seifert and effectively close out the game and secure a nine-run win.</p>
      <p>There might have been less riding on this game than back in July but the players put everything into it and you have to spare a moment's thought for the Kiwis who might have hoped to move on from the final, but it has hung over this tour at every turn and this was the ultimate reminder.</p>

      <p>The super over was necessary because England managed to match New Zealand's 146-5 from 11 overs with 146-7 of their own thanks to Chris Jordan's final ball four off Jimmy Neesham.</p>
      <p>The wet weather had reduced the game to 11 overs per side and with a pair of tiny straight boundaries at this rugby ground no score would be too big to chase down.</p>
      <p>New Zealand had flown out of the traps with Martin Guptill scoring a 19 ball fifty and Colin Munro swatting 46.</p>
      <p>But Adil Rashid and Saqib Mahmood managed to drag things back every so slightly for England where every dot ball was as big a moment as a wicket.</p>

      <p>In reply England should probably have put the game to bed earlier with Bairstow leading the way with 47.</p>
      <p>An equation of 26 from the last two overs seemed perfectly getable for Tom Curran and Sam Billings but they both struggled to find the boundaries and left Jordan walking to the middle with 13 to win from the last three balls.</p>
      <p>He struck his first ball for six over cover, then took two from the next which meant five to win and four to tie and the outcome seemed oh so obvious as he clipped a full toss to the leg side rope.</p>
      <p>Morgan and Bairstow struck a straight six apiece to post a decent score, but where it was Jofra Archer at Lord's it was Jordan in Auckland and he got the job done.</p>
