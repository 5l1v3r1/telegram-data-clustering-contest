      <h1>Sunday Best: At LACMA’s ‘Art+Film Gala,’ a glamorous, dreamy green gown steals the show</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:21+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/moira-macdonald/" target="_blank">Moira Macdonald</a></address>
      <p>Every year, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) throws an “<a href="https://www.lacma.org/ArtPlusFilmGala">Art+Film Gala</a>,” and the outfits never disappoint. Among the attendees at last weekend’s event was KiKi Layne (“If Beale Street Could Talk,” “Native Son”), who wore a vivid green Gucci gown that manages to be both wonderfully over-the-top and coolly comfortable-looking (note how the sleeves seem to be effortlessly pushed up). And oh, the sparkle. In my dreams, I am wearing this sort of thing around the house, and I’m always sorry to wake up.</p>
