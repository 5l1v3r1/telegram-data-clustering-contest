      <h1>Turkey says at least 8 killed by car bomb in northeast Syria</h1>

      <p>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A car bomb in northern Syria killed at least eight civilians and wounded 20 others Sunday in a town near the border with Turkey, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The explosion struck a town south of the city of Tal Abyad, the ministry said. The city was captured last month by Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition forces from Kurdish-led fighters.</p>
      <p>The ministry blamed Syrian Kurdish fighters for the attack, accusing them of “massacring innocent civilians.”</p>
      <p>The attack came more than a week after a similar car bomb attack in central Tal Abyad killed 13 people.</p>
      <p>Turkey invaded northeast Syria last month to push out Syrian Kurdish fighters near the border. The military offensive has since displaced around 200,000 people.</p>
      <p>Ankara considers the Kurdish-led forces to be terrorists because of their links to Kurdish militants fighting inside Turkey.</p>

      <p>The Kurdish groups have called in Syrian government forces to halt Turkey’s advance.</p>
      <p>Despite a shaky truce brokered by Russia, Syrian government forces have since clashed with Turkish troops and Turkey-backed opposition fighters.</p>
      <p>Syrian government troops fought for a second day with Turkish-led forces in an area between the towns of Tal-Tamr and Ras al-Ayn, according to a war monitor, Syria’s state media and activists. At least four Syrian government soldiers were killed in the fighting Saturday.</p>
      <p>A Turkish drone struck a village north of Tal-Tamr Sunday, Syria state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory reported intense clashes not far from Russian patrols.</p>
      <p>Russia mediated a cease-fire whereby Syrian government forces deployed along parts of the border but also left Turkey in control of a stretch of land inside Syria.</p>
