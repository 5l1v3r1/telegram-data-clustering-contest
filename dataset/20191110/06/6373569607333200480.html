      <h1>Royal Navy's brave cat Simon whose pain helped the Allies win the war</h1>
      <h2>He is the only cat to have been awarded the Dickin Medal - the highest military award for animals</h2>

      <p>A poppy wreath is set to be laid in Plymouth on Armistice Day in memory of a brave feline who became the only cat to ever win the highest level of military award for animals.</p>
      <p>Simon was the ship's cat on the Royal Navy frigate HMS Amethyst.</p>
      <p>Discovered in March 1948, poking around the docks of Stonecutters Island in Hong Kong, and thought to be around a year old, the scrawny black and white tomcat was scrounging for food when a British sailor spotted him.</p>
      <p>Seventeen-year-old ordinary seaman George Hickinbottom decided a cat was just what the ship needed to get rid of its rats as well as provide some good luck - there is a seafarer superstition that a feline would provide good luck and would often sail with one.</p>
      <p>So George tucked Simon inside his jacket, smuggled him aboard The Amethyst, and hid the tomcat in his cabin.</p>
      <p>Simon managed to bag himself a PDSA Dickin Medal and a plaque for his heroic efforts keeping the ship’s morale high, after both cat and seamen were seriously injured during the civil war between communists and nationalists on the Yangtze River in China.</p>

      <p>Simon suffered with burns, a punctured lung and was severely weak and dehydrated as the ship finally managed a sneaky escape and returned to Plymouth to a heroes’ welcome, 101 days after being held hostage by the communists.</p>
      <p>He was placed in routine quarantine for six months, like other returning war animals, when the ship returned to England on November 9 1949.</p>
      <p>The feline was welcomed with bags of fan mail and was shot into stardom overnight, even appointing Lieutenant Stewart Hett, as cat officer to deal with Simon’s fan mail.</p>
      <p>Associated Press shortly broke the news of the PDSA’s decision. One newspaper headline of the AP story told the tale: “Amethyst’s Cat Gets Dickin Medal for Catching Rats.”</p>

      <p>The PDSA’s decision had been unanimous, with a plaque unveiled in Plymouth by Lt Geoffrey Weston, who had been severely wounded in the attack on Amethyst.</p>
      <p>Sadly, it was not meant to be. Two weeks before the presentation of the Dickin Medal was set to be presented by Maria Dickin herself, along with the Lord Mayor of London, Simon fell ill with a virus.</p>
      <p>He received treatment, including injections for a high fever and acute enteritis. But his war wounds had seriously weakened Simon’s heart.</p>
      <p>Simon passed away on November 28, having crammed a lot of living into his two short years.</p>
      <p>As one tribute put it, “the spirit of Simon slipped quietly away to sea.”</p>

      <p>Some said he died of a broken heart, that he missed his life aboard ship and the men he loved so much.</p>
      <p>This plaque was originally displayed at the PDSA Pet Hospital in Plymouth, now relocated to William Prance Road in Derriford, which is preparing for a wreath laying ceremony in memorial of Simon and other war animals that bravely sacrificed their lives whilst serving the country.</p>
