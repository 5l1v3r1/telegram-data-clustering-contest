      <p>WASHINGTON: The United States has said that the opening of the Kartarpur corridor sets a positive example of neighbours working together for mutual benefit.</p>
      <p>In a video message released on Saturday afternoon, State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus termed the opening of this new border-crossing an important “step towards promoting greater religious freedom”.</p>

      <p>Highlighting the importance of this “impressive” project, Ms Ortagus said in her brief statement: “The State Department welcomes the opening of a new border-crossing between India and Pakistan, the Kartarpur corridor. We see this as a positive example of neighbors working together for mutual benefit.</p>
      <p>“The newly opened corridor is a step towards promoting greater religious freedom. It allows Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit Gurdwara Kartarpur sahib, an important Sikh house of worship just inside the Pakistan border.</p>
      <p>This impressive project will transform a remote three-acre site across a sensitive international boundary.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to India and Pakistan on this initiative. And our best wishes to the pilgrims making the crossing for the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak’s birth.”</p>
