      <p>Logan Paul suffered defeat in his eagerly-awaited YouTube rematch against rival KSI - but felt a sense of injustice after being docked two points in the fourth round.</p>
      <p>The American floored his British opponent but was adjudged to have landed a punch while he was down - leading to the controversial deduction.</p>
      <p>If Paul had not been docked the two points, the judges scorecards show he would have won the bout by split decision rather than losing it in the same manner.</p>
      <p>The crucial scorecard was that of Lou Moret who, after the deduction, scored the six-round fight 56-55 to KSI.</p>

      <p>That card would have been reversed if Paul had not been docked two points, which would have seen the American have his hand lifted as the victor.</p>
      <p>Judge Patrick Russell scored the fight 57-54 to KSI - so the Brit would have still won the on that card without the deduction.</p>

      <p>Even having had two points docked, Paul came out on top on the scorecard of Zachary Young, winning the fight 56-55 in the eyes of the third judge.</p>
      <p>After the fight, Paul was livid at the deduction and called out KSI for a rematch - but his foe said the rivalry, in his opinion, was now finished.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a legitimate knockdown," Paul said. "I didn't get a warning.</p>
      <p>"I got two points taken away from me and that's the reason I lost tonight. I would love to contest the commission because I think I should have got a warning. I don't think it was fair at all."</p>
