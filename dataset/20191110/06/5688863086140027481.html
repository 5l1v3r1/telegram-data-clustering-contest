        <b>South African all-rounder JP Duminy has been ruled out of South Africa's premier T20 competition, Mzansi Super League, with a hamstring injury. He suffered a high-grade partial tear to his right hamstring in Paarl Rocks' training session in their lead-up to the first game against Cape Town Blitz.</b>
      </p>
      <p>JP Duminy will miss another season of the MSL having already missed the inaugural season with the hand injury and this time the problem is his right hamstring tear which he sustained during the build-up to the game between Paarl Rocks and Cape Town Blitz. The Paarl-based franchise will dearly miss the services and experience of the 35-year-old which would have been extremely crucial to them for their chances this season and skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/faf_du_plessis">Faf </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/du_plessis">du Plessis</a> understands the void created by this loss.</p>
      <p>"JP brings a lot of value in a lot of different areas. His experience will be missed, especially by the younger guys," du Plessis said.</p>
      <p>But du Plessis also believes that one's adversity is another's opportunity as he hopes that his batting unit will be motivated to do well in Duminy's absence.</p>
      <p>"I have full confidence in our team to bounce back from this. We have strengthened our batting this year and we'll use this setback as motivation," he asserted.</p>
      <p>Head coach Adrien Birrell will have to find a replacement for Duminy soon as his team has already suffered a loss of another star player in the form of Aiden Markram, who had sustained an injury on the tour of India. The franchise will announce their replacement on the next day of their opening game against the Blitz.</p>
      <p>"We will assess our options on Monday and then decide how best to replace JP," Birrell said.Â </p>
