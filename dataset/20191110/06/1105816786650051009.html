      <p><b>MULTAN: </b>Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was not stopping former premier Nawaz Sharif from going abroad for medical treatment, <a href="https://www.express.pk/story/1875191/1/"><i>Express News</i> </a>reported.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Multan, the foreign minister said Nawaz should go abroad for his medical treatment since his condition was critical.</p>
      <p>Praying for his speedy recovery, Qureshi hoped Nawaz would recover soon and return to Pakistan in a healthy condition.</p>
      <p>He stressed that the PTI government was not creating any hurdles for the former premier and, rather, was providing him the best health care. “He [Nawaz] can go wherever he wants for his medical treatment.”</p>
      <p>When asked about the Pakistan Peoples Party’s concerns over former president Asif Zardari’s health, Qureshi said the party and its chairman, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, should provide medical proof to the government.</p>

      <p>On the Indian Supreme Court’s decision on Babri Masjid, the foreign minister regretted that the verdict was given on the same day as the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor.</p>
      <p>“There are many contradictions in the verdict – it is not just by any standard,” he told reporters. “A war is being waged in India against minorities. Internet has been suspended in Aligarh while the curfew in occupied Jammu and Kashmir nears 100 days.”</p>
      <p>“This is not the India of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru – the ideology of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has taken over.”</p>
      <p>“Where India is violating human rights through its black laws, Pakistan is sending a message of peace by opening the Kartarpur Corridor.”</p>
