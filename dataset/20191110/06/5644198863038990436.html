      <p>MUNICH, Germany:Â Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge believes Robert Lewandowski can threaten the 48-year-old Bundesliga record of 40 goals in a season after the striker netted twice in Saturday's (Nov 9) thrashing of Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Managerless Bayern ran riot at the Allianz Arena as Lewandowski netted a first-half header and a 76th-minute tap-in to leave him on 16 goals from just 11 league games this term.</p>

      <p>Rummenigge thinks Lewandowski, 31, can break Gerd Mueller's record of 40 league goals for Bayern in the 1971/72 campaign.</p>
      <p>"I thought Gerd's record would last for eternity and never be broken, but I believe he (Lewandowski) is the first who can really put it in danger," Rummenigge, a former striker, told reporters in Munich.</p>
      <p>"It is astounding that 'Lewy' keeps scoring one or two goals in every game."</p>
      <p>The Poland striker has now scored in all of Bayern's Champions League and Bundesliga games this season, but needs surgery for a groin injury.</p>
      <p>"It is his decision when to have the operation," said Bayern interim coach Hansi Flick, who has two wins since stepping in after Niko Kovac was sacked last Sunday.</p>
      <p>"He isn't in any pain, but it is clear he needs surgery.</p>
      <p>"I believe he is having such a run that, in his shoes, I would also have a good think about when to have it done.</p>
      <p>"For me, he is the best striker in the world and it is crazy the way he performs for us. He is an absolute role model."</p>
      <p>- 'Team worked sensationally' -</p>
      <p>Since last Saturday's 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt which cost Kovac his job, Flick has led Bayern to a 2-0 victory over Olympiakos to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, plus Saturday's 4-0 rout.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski's double, plus a Serge Gnabry strike and an own goal by Dortmund captain Mats Hummels, completed the thumping.</p>
      <p>"I had a task with these two games and the whole team worked sensationally around them, even if it wasn't that easy, because you can't bring much content to training in such a short time," said Flick.</p>
      <p>Bayern appear to have trouble finding a replacement for Kovac after Arsene Wenger on Saturday contradicted their claims they turned him down as Kovac's successor.</p>
      <p>Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have stated they will not join Bayern this season.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Bayern's bosses are pleased with Flick, who will be in charge for their next game at Fortuna Duesseldorf on November 23 -- and possibly longer.</p>
      <p>"We will keep working calmly with him," said Rummenigge, while club president Uli Hoeness, who steps down next Friday, implied his deal could be extended.</p>
      <p>"I can't imagine Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was only talking about one more week."</p>
      <p>Bayern forward Thomas Mueller, who was often named among the replacements under Kovac, but has started the last two games, praised the performance.</p>
      <p>"It was a brilliant game today," said Mueller, who has made 500 appearances for Bayern.</p>
      <p>"The match in Frankfurt can't really be taken as a comparison because we got a red card (by Jerome Boateng) early on.</p>
      <p>"The players were challenged by the change of coach, because all the alibis were gone."</p>
      <p>Dortmund, who are fifth and a point behind Bayern, were poor, creating just two shots at goal compared to Bayern's 18.</p>
      <p>"As a team, we were clearly the weakest out there," said Dortmund captain Hummels.</p>
      <p>"We weren't brave enough with the ball and simply not good enough."</p>
