      <h1>Celtic boss Neil Lennon on the Virgil van Dijk roadmap Christopher Jullien can follow to emulate Liverpool star</h1>
      <h2>Lennon believes the Frenchman has qualities which can propel him into the same orbit as the Anfield defender.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Waddell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon sent Virgil Van Dijk on a journey into a different football stratosphere – now he wants <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/christopher-jullien">Christopher Jullien</a> to follow the trail.</p>
      <p>The French stopper was a colossus in Rome on Thursday night, his 6ft 5in frame standing guard to repel everything Lazio could throw at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>.</p>
      <p>And while the Parkhead boss knows his £7million summer recruit doesn’t have all the attributes yet that took Van Dijk into the rarefied air of beating Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to UEFA’s Player of the Year, he believes he has qualities which can propel him into the same orbit.</p>
      <p>As Lennon enjoyed another day dissecting their history-making performance, he said: “Van Dijk is Van Dijk. I want Jullien to use him as a benchmark, though, to try to get as far up the scale as he possibly can.</p>

      <p>“He has really good attributes to do that.</p>
      <p>“He was colossal for us against Lazio and read the game brilliantly.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how many interceptions he made, clearances or aerial challenges he won – and he is a threat now in the other box as well.</p>
      <p>“He has leadership qualities and is in a really good place.</p>
      <p>“What we are seeing now is everything we thought he would turn into. I liked everything I saw when we watched him. You ask, would he suit the way we play?</p>
      <p>“Well, he was a dominant header of the ball, which was something we lacked.</p>
      <p>“At Toulouse he looked proficient with both feet.</p>
      <p>“We knew he wasn’t dynamic in terms of sprinting but he could read the game well and there was a composure about him.</p>
      <p>“And we had missed that goal threat. For a while, to be fair, the set-play deliveries weren’t great so we tried to work on that and now have players who can attack the ball in good areas.</p>

      <p>“It’s a facet of the game that’s really important.</p>
      <p>“We could have scored one on Thursday night – <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> could have had scored one too – so Christopher was pivotal in terms of bringing that into the team.”</p>
      <p>Jullien’s emergence at one end has been supplemented by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-elyounoussi">Mo Elyounoussi</a>’s at the other.</p>
      <p>The Southampton loan man’s versatility and mobility were there for all to see as his rediscovered confidence shone through in the Stadio Olimpico. Anyone wondering why Saints had paid £16m to Basel for him last summer, after a season of struggles down south, is now getting their answer.</p>
      <p>Lennon said: “He has the pedigree and you can see his old instincts kicking in again. He’s now up to speed fitness wise but he’s a very fit boy anyway.</p>
      <p>“His quality is evident and we’ve watched him grow day by day.</p>
      <p>“His confidence is back and there’s no question he has made us better, whether it’s from a central position or coming in off the wing.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted with him and not just for what he brings to the team but because he’s a really good lad off the pitch as well, very humble.</p>

      <p>“We don’t want to over-egg his situation but we’ve spoken briefly about how it was for him before and how this is a great club.</p>
      <p>“He’s playing with good players in four competitions and there’s a chance for him to, not re-invent himself, but to get himself back up and running and doing what he’s good at.</p>
      <p>“It has worked both ways – we’ve been good for him and he has helped us.</p>
      <p>“His movement, vision and link-up play with Odsonne Edouard were all good.</p>
      <p>“His passing was off the pace for 15-20 minutes but then he rattles that one in for James Forrest to score.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t get too disappointed any more if things don’t seem to be coming off for him because he knows he might get another bite at it.</p>
      <p>“It also shows in his performances that he’s playing in a team that’s full of confidence.”</p>
      <p>Lennon’s hoping that seam of self-belief running through the team doesn’t diminish this afternoon against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> at home.</p>

      <p>He’s not taking anything for granted despite the apparent ease of their 5-2 win over the Steelmen at Fir Park in August.</p>
      <p>He said: “We didn’t start that game well. They were the better team for the first 15-20 minutes.</p>
      <p>“Well have had some great results this year even though Stevie Robinson’s team is always evolving because he sells his best players every year.</p>
      <p>“He has done a brilliant job. They gave Rangers plenty to think about at Ibrox a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We want to win but are coming up against a team who, apart from maybe the 3-0 loss to Aberdeen, have been playing well.”</p>
      <p>Lennon is faced with the dilemma of how to protect his players from burnout – does he keep playing his strongest XI with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> breathing down their neck, or does he rotate?</p>
      <p>He said: “Momentum is important and after this game we have another international break when some of the players will get a rest.</p>
      <p>“We have to be mindful of those who do go away with their countries. But we haven’t made too many changes Thursday to Sunday and in the main – apart from Livingston – it has worked OK.”</p>
