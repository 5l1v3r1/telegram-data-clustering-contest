      <p>Nate Hollander, a fan of pop star Madonna, is suing the artist and the event promoting company Live Nation for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201905181075112757-bobby-gillespie-madonna-eurovision/">repetitive delays at her concerts</a>. <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/08/madonna-sued-push-back-concert-start-times-live-nation/">According to TMZ</a>, who obtained a copy of the lawsuit, the ticket holder claims he has been denied a refund of $1024.95 for 3 tickets he purchased since August to Madonna’s 17 December concert after the time of the concert was delayed from 20:30 to 22:30.</p>
      <p>Hollander reportedly also claims that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201906271076067731-pop-icon-madonna-warns-no-one-safe-gun-control-now-new-disturbing-video/">the delay in concert timing is “ridiculous”</a>, arguing that his three tickets are now much less valuable because of the unexpected delay.</p>
      <blockquote>The fan is reportedly gathering up “a class of other angry fans”, who are willing to sue the singer for damages. The number of those “angry fans” has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201906191075955994-marcelo-burlon-misogyny-madonna-slur/">already reached 500 people</a> filing one class-action lawsuit, as Fox Business reported, citing the Wonderwall entertainment news website.</blockquote>
      <p>TMZ reported that they have <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201906271076067731-pop-icon-madonna-warns-no-one-safe-gun-control-now-new-disturbing-video/">contacted the pop artist’s representatives</a>, but there has been as yet no response.</p>
