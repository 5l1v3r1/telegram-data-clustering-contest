      <h1>Bill Murray Might Have Answered the Call for <i>Ghostbusters</i> Sequel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T06:49:28+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 06:49</time> by <a rel="author">Charu Sinha</a></address>
      <p>Jason Reitman’s <i>Ghostbusters </i>sequel, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/jason-reitman-is-making-an-original-ghostbusters-sequel.html"><i>Ghostbusters 2020</i></a>, might have just gained another original cast member. Dan Aykroyd confirmed that Bill Murray would be returning for the new film on <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/11/08/ghostbusters-2020-dan-aykroyd-confirms-return-original-cast-murray-weaver-potts-hudson-gb20/"><i>The Greg Hill Show</i></a> earlier this week, saying, “Jason Reitman wrote a beautiful, heartfelt script that takes the real DNA from the first two movies and transfers that directly to the third, the next generation.” Murray and Aykroyd’s co-star <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/09/17/ernie-hudson-return-winston-zeddemore-jason-reitmans-upcoming-ghostbusters-film/">Ernie Hudson</a> has already been confirmed to appear in the sequel. According to Aykroyd, the sequel will also pay tribute to Egon Spengler, played by the late <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/how-harold-ramis-and-bill-murray-ended-their-feud.html">Harold Ramis</a>. It’s important to note that Murray himself has not commented on the casting news nor confirmed it. The famously private actor has previously <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Bill-Murray-Finally-Explains-Why-He-Kept-Passing-Ghostbusters-3-67711.html">been cagey</a> about returning to the franchise, but did have a cameo in the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/review-ghostbusters-never-finds-its-own-way.html">2016 <i>Ghostbusters </i>reboot</a>. <i>Ghostbusters 2020 </i>has already added <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/paul-rudd-ghostbusters-2020.html">Paul Rudd</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/sigourney-weaver-is-in-for-ghostbusters-3.html">Sigourney Weaver</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/ghostbusters-remake-carrie-coon-and-finn-wolfhard-in-talks.html">Carrie Coon, and Finn Wolfhard</a>.</p>
