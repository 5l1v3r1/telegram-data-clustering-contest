        <b>LOS ANGELES, United States, Nov 10<i> – </i>Boston forward Gordon Hayward fractured his left hand Saturday in the Celtics’ 135-115 victory at San Antonio, dimming the joy of improving to 7-1 on the NBA season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jaylen Brown scored 30 points, Kemba Walker added 26, Jayson Tatum contributed 19 and Marcus Smart came off the bench for Hayward to add 16 to spark the Celtics’ triumph.</p>
      <p>Hayward managed nine points and two rebounds in 15 minutes before the injury.</p>
      <p>Hayward has been enjoying a stellar season with averages of 20.3 points, a team-high 7.9 rebounds and 4.6 assists a game. He’s also hitting 44% from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old departed after suffering the injury with 94 seconds remaining in the second quarter in a collision with San Antonio’s LaMarcus Aldridge, who was setting a pick on the play and was whistled for a foul.</p>
      <p>Hayward was taken to the locker room and an X-ray confirmed the break.</p>
      <p>Hayward spent his first seven NBA seasons with Utah before joining the Celtics, only to suffer severe leg and ankle injuries in the opening minutes of Boston’s 2017-18 season opener and miss the entire remainder of the campaign.</p>
      <p>While Hayward averaged 11.5 points a game this season, it wasn’t until the past few games when Hayward appeared to have shaken off the impact of the 2017 injuries.</p>
      <p>The Spurs, who fell to 5-4, were led by 22 points from DeMar DeRozan and 20 by Australian reserve guard Patty Mills.</p>
      <p>Brown scored seven points and Tatum added five in a 19-3 Boston run after the Spurs scored the game’s first seven points, the Celtics taking a 39-30 lead after the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Boston stretched the edge to 72-54 at half-time, Brown scoring 20 points in the first half. DeRozan led the Spurs with 14 first-half points.</p>
