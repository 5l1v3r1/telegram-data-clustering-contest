      <p>OHRID, North Macedonia (AP) — Leaders in the Western Balkans say they are committed to working closely together to remove barriers on the free movement of goods and people between their countries.</p>
      <p>The prime ministers of Albania and North Macedonia — Edi Rama and Zoran Zaev — along with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic gathered in the lakeside town of Ohrid to discuss concrete measures for establishing a free trade zone in order to boost economic growth and foreign investment. It is dubbed “little Schengen,” after the European Union’s free transit zone.</p>
      <p>Bosnia and Montenegro are willing to join the zone. Kosovo did not send a representative to the summit Sunday.</p>
      <p>Zaev said the initiative aims to create a completely different Balkans that will make it a better place to live.</p>
      <p>Relations among Western Balkan countries still remain tense after the wars amid the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.</p>
