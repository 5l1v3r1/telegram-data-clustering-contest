      <h1>Viral Tweets From Steve Wozniak and Ruby on Rails Creator Spur Investigation Into Apple Credit Card</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes the BBC: <i>A US financial regulator has opened an investigation into claims Apple's credit card offered different credit limits for men and women. It follows <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50365609">complaints -- including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak -- that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased</a> against women.<br/><br/>New York's Department of Financial Services has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card. Any discrimination, intentional or not, "violates New York law", the Department of Financial Services said. The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday that tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474">gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got</a>. In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score. Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193422616016519168">tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife</a> despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets. Banks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications. But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate. </i><br/>"Apple and Goldman Sachs have both accepted that they have no control over the product they sell," Hansson <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1193391198922321921">posted angrily on Twitter</a>. "THE ALGORITHM is in charge now! <br/><br/>"All humans can do is apologize on its behalf, and pray that it has mercy on the next potential victims."</p>
