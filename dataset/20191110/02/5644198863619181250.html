      <p>LONDON: Saracens ended the worst week in their history after a 35 point deduction and a fine of more than £5million (US$6.4 million) for breaching the salary cap with a gritty 21-12 win over Gloucester in their Premiership clash on Saturday (Nov 9).</p>
      <p>The English and European champions - whose punishment is in abeyance until the outcome of their appeal - have thrived on the negative energy directed at them said forwards coach Alex Sanderson.</p>

      <p>Exeter chairman Tony Rowe - whose side have lost the past two Premiership finals to Saracens - and Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care, have both said they should have been relegated.</p>
      <p>However, Sanderson - who was pursued down the touchline by Gloucester fans at the end of the match with the former England backrow forward pointing to the scoreboard to silence them - preferred to use a pop analogy to describe his and the club's attitude to such calls.</p>
      <p>"In the words of Taylor Swift the haters are going to hate, hate, hate and the players are going to play, play, play," the 40-year-old told BT Sport making a reference to the American star's hit Shake It Off.</p>
      <p>"We have to accept the hate and crack on and play.</p>
      <p>"I personally think it is misplaced and misguided but they are welcome to their opinions.</p>
      <p>"We have used the negative energy directed at us this week and turned it on our opponents.</p>
      <p>"I could not be more impressed by the players.</p>
      <p>"People may hate us but we do not care."</p>
      <p>The players had emerged for the match to a cacophony of boos from the Gloucester fans with some of the latter wearing fez style hats with -26 emblazoned on them - the points total Saracens would be on prior to the game had they not appealed.</p>
      <p>However, head coach Mark McCall had also taken measures to balance the booing by sending out the replacements to form a tunnel for the starting XV - which included a lot of inexperienced players - and applauding them onto the pitch.</p>
      <p>A side - lacking England World Cup stars such as Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell as well as the Vunipola brothers Mako and Billy - were superbly marshalled by the vastly-experienced scrum-half Richard Wigglesworth.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old former England half-back is at the centre of the scandal as he is one of the players with whom Saracens chairman Nigel Wray set up a joint-owned company.</p>
      <p>Wray claims it is a way of genuinely looking after his squad members' futures but the Premiership say it is a way of circumventing the £7 million salary cap.</p>
      <p>Wigglesworth guided them to a comfortable 15-6 half-time lead.</p>
      <p>Ben Earls' fourth try of the season in the second-half effectively put them out of reach and gave them only their fourth win at Gloucester in the Premiership and first since 2015.</p>
      <p>Victory saw them rise to second in the table just a point off leaders Northampton, who lost 22-13 away at Bath.</p>
      <p>Saracens have a breather from the domestic scene as they open their European defence in France against Racing 92 next weekend.</p>
