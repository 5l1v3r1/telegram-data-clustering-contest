      <p>RED DEER, Alta. - Alberta Premier Jason Kenney announced the creation of a panel that will examine ways to make his province more independent of Ottawa in a speech to the conservative Manning Centre on Saturday in which he rejected separatist arguments.</p>
      <p>Kenney's "Fair Deal Panel," which will include former Reform Party leader Preston Manning, will consult with Albertans on ideas such as establishing a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from the Canada Pension Plan in favour of a new provincial agency and establishing a formalized provincial constitution.</p>
      <p>The point of the panel, Kenney explained, is to secure a fair deal for Alberta and advance Alberta's economic interests, such as the construction of energy pipelines.</p>
      <p>Kenney noted that several of the ideas are borrowed from Quebec, such as collecting taxes and seeking provincial representation in treaty negotiations that affect Alberta's interests.</p>
      <p>He said that none of the ideas would be implemented without Albertans endorsing them in a referendum.</p>
      <p>Kenney told the audience that separating from Canada would landlock Alberta and not make it any easier to get a pipeline built to a coast, but that he sees the fear in Albertans eyes about their economic futures.</p>
