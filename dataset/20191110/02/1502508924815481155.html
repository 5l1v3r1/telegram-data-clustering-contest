      <p>A strong <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>made landfall early Sunday in Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of people have moved to shelters across the low-lying delta nation's vast coastal region.</p>
      <p>Up to 1.8 million were expected to be evacuated by Saturday evening ahead of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">Cyclone </a>Bulbul, said Enamur Rahman, Bangladesh's junior disaster management minister.</p>
      <p>More than 5,000 shelters had been prepared by Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/cyclone">cyclone </a>was packing winds of up to 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 130 kph (80 mph), but was forecast to weaken after crossing the coast.</p>
      <p>It slammed ashore near Sagar Island and its path included the southwestern Khulna region, which has the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, which straddles the Bangladesh-India border.</p>
      <p>The weather office said coastal districts were likely to be inundated by storm surges of 1-2 meters (5-7 feet) above normal tide because of the impact of the cyclone.</p>
      <p>Several ships from Bangladesh's navy and coast guard were kept ready in parts of the region for an emergency response, the TV station Independent reported.</p>

      <p>The storm is also impacted parts of India. One death each has been reported from Bengal and Odisha due to heavy rain triggered by the very severe cyclonic storm Bulbul.</p>

      <p>According to US-based AccuWeather Inc., Bulbul strengthened from a deep depression into a tropical cyclone on Thursday morning, and by Friday afternoon had strengthened into a severe cyclone.</p>
      <p>Bulbul was the equivalent of a Category 1 or 2 hurricane in the Atlantic, it said.</p>
      <p>Rahman said the government suspended weekend leave for government officials in 13 coastal districts on Saturday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, volunteers used loudspeakers to ask people to move to shelters in Chittagong and other regions, according to the Disaster Management Ministry.</p>
      <p>In the Cox's Bazar coastal district, tourists were alerted to stay in their hotels, while a few hundred visitors were stuck on Saint Martins Island.</p>
      <p>Authorities suspended all activities in the country's main seaports, including in Chittagong, which handles almost 80 per cent of Bangladesh's exports and imports.</p>
      <p>All vessels and fishing boats were told to stop operating.</p>
      <p>Local authorities ordered school buildings and mosques to be used as shelters in addition to dedicated cyclone shelters -- raised concrete buildings that have been built over the past decades.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, has a history of violent cyclones.</p>
      <p>But disaster preparedness programs in recent decades have upgraded the country's capacity to deal with natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties.</p>
