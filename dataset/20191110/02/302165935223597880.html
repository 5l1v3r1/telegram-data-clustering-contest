      <p>PARIS, Nov 10 — Mauro Icardi came off the bench to score a late winner as Paris Saint-Germain extended their Ligue 1 lead to nine points despite another unconvincing performance in a 2-1 victory at Brest yesterday.</p>
      <p>The reigning French champions, who were beaten by then-bottom club Dijon last week before scraping past Club Brugge in the Champions League, needed Icardi's ninth goal in eight games to secure the three points.</p>
      <p>“We can't score four goals each time,” said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel.</p>
      <p>“I'm very happy. It's five wins in six games. I didn't expect us to have our best match, but we had to be calm and fight.”</p>
      <p>Brest, promoted from the second tier last season, caused PSG problems throughout and had levelled with 18 minutes remaining through Samuel Grandsir.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Angers missed the chance to cut the gap to seven points as they were held to a goalless draw at Reims.</p>
      <p>Tuchel saw his long injury list extended before kick-off as goalkeeper Keylor Navas pulled out of the game after suffering a thigh problem in the warm-up.</p>
      <p>The Costa Rican joined Neymar, Kylian Mbappe, defenders Thomas Meunier and Thilo Kehrer and midfielder Ander Herrera on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Edinson Cavani made his first start since August, but struggled in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“For Edi (Cavani), it wasn't easy because he's lacking rhythm,” added Tuchel. “He has to manage his competition with Icardi. He is full of confidence.”</p>
      <p>The visitors claimed a 39th-minute lead as Angel Di Maria raced clear before clipping a chipped finish over Brest goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur to score his eighth goal of the campaign.</p>
      <p>His effort survived a VAR review for offside to send PSG into the interval ahead.</p>
      <p>Cavani wasted two clear-cut chances in the space of three minutes just after the hour mark, and Brest made him pay.</p>
      <p>Substitute Grandsir collected the ball inside the area and fired a low effort through goalkeeper Sergio Rico, making his Parisian debut after signing on-loan from Sevilla.</p>
      <p>But the Spaniard redeemed himself shortly afterwards, keeping out Haris Belkebla's long-range strike.</p>
      <p>On-loan Inter Milan striker Icardi had the final say, though, pouncing inside the six-yard box in the 85th minute to scramble the ball over the line after Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's cross was only partially cleared.</p>
      <p>Later yesterday, last season's runners-up Lille were held to a 0-0 draw by Metz at the Stade Pierre Mauroy to end a disappointing week on a low note.</p>
      <p>Lille, who were knocked out of the Champions League by a 4-1 loss at Valencia in midweek, sit third, already 11 points behind PSG.</p>
      <p>Monaco made it three wins in four league games to move into the top half of the table as Aleksandr Golovin's first-half strike was enough to edge out struggling Dijon 1-0.</p>
      <p>Today, unpopular Lyon coach Rudi Garcia takes his new side to their rivals and his former club Marseille.</p>
