      <h2>Stoke-on-Trent police were tipped off about a planned raid at the Festival Park store on Friday night amid concerns of recent grow in 'mass stealing'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T02:28:25+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 02:28</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Lo, Hayley Parker</a></address>
      <p>Police were deployed to a JD Sports store after posts suggesting a possible 'mass raid' had been circulated on social media.</p>
      <p>Riot vans and police cars were called to the Festival Park shop in Stoke-on-Trent for fear of a large-scale looting.</p>
      <p>The message shared on social media raised concerns that teenagers wearing balaclavas were going to storm JD Sports at 7pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>No one is believed to have been arrested, according to <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/watch-hooded-gang-teens-storm-3519985">StokeonTrent Live</a> .</p>
      <p>The high security alert came after several JD Sports stores have been targeted over the last few days.</p>

      <p>Sgt Chris Moss said an 18-year-old man was arrested at Hanley bus station, about a mile from Festival Park, on suspicion of possessing a knife.</p>
      <p>He said: "We had some information from an anonymous person that there was an organised event on Snapchat for a load of lads to come down to JD Sports at 7pm wearing balaclavas so they can all storm into the store and nick a load of stock and run out.</p>
      <p>"Officers have been providing a hi-visibility presence this evening to JD store Hanley and Festival Park.</p>
      <p>"This was due to info about what is known on social media as 'Mass Stealing'. We will continue to provide hi-vis patrols tomorrow for public reassurance and to prevent crime."</p>

      <p>Shoppers who were aware of the recent craze condemned the behaviour of those behind the raid.</p>
      <p>Craig Matthews, 25, of Bentilee, said: "It was a really stupid thing to do. We do not want that sort of thing in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
      <p>"I moved down from Manchester to get away from that sort of stuff. I am hoping to go about my shopping as normal."</p>
      <p>Lesley Eardley, 64, said: "It would be terrifying to be a shopper if people came in wearing balaclavas and started robbing the store."</p>
      <p>Another shopper said: "It seems like this is going to be the next big thing. They're just trying to copycat what's happening in bigger cities like London."</p>

      <p>Mobile footage circulating on social media shows a similar incident which happened on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a> night when a gang stormed into JD Sports at Tottenham Retail Park in north London.</p>
      <p>The group were seen grabbing handfuls of clothes and accessories before fleeing the shop.</p>
      <p>Shocked bystanders watch as over a dozen people wearing face masks run out of the store.</p>
