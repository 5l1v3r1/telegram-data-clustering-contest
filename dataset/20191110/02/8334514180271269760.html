      <p>Last weekend, anti-government protesters crowded into a shopping mall when a man slashed people with a knife and bit off part of the ear of a politician.</p>
      <p>Several other gatherings are planned for elsewhere in the city, to protest against police behavior and perceived meddling by Beijing in the politics of the Asian financial hub.</p>
      <p>China denies interfering in Hong Kong, but the protests have become the worst political crisis in the former British colony since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people gathered on Saturday night at a vigil for “martyrs”, after a student died in hospital this week following a high fall.</p>
      <p>Though the vigil ended peacefully, many attendees called for revenge after the student’s death from injuries sustained during a protest.</p>
      <p>Protesters have also called for a general strike on Monday and for people to block public transport, although when such calls have been made in the past they have come to nothing.</p>
      <p>As they departed Saturday’s vigil, a number of people shouted “strike on Monday” and “see you on Monday”.</p>
      <p>Scattered vigils on Friday night descended into chaos as some protesters vandalized metro stations and blocked streets.</p>
      <p>Riot police responded with tear gas, pepper spray, and at least one round of live ammunition fired as a warning shot to protesters who had barricaded a street.</p>
