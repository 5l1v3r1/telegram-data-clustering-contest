      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) â€” A towering "Baby Trump" protest balloon was knifed and deflated by someone unhappy with its appearance during President Donald Trump's Saturday trip to Alabama, organizers said.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during <a href="https://apnews.com/7751ba0c79f147a98f9a30524a5b4c5b">Trump's visit</a> to watch the University of Alabama football game. The balloon, which is over 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall, was set up in a nearby park.</p>
      <p>Jim Girvan, the organizer of a group that "adopts" out the Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut an 8-foot-long (2.4-meter-long) gash in the back.</p>
      <p>In a news release, Tuscaloosa police said Hoyt Deau Hutchinson, 32, was arrested and charged with first-degree criminal mischief.</p>
      <p>The orange, diaper-clad, cellphone-clutching caricature of the president is <a href="https://apnews.com/8f5de6a976af473788bf74389df782dc">often taken to Trump appearances</a> as a way to protest him.</p>
      <p>"Baby Trump" first rose over London when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas around the U.S.</p>
      <p>Robert Kennedy, a volunteer "baby sitter" who brought the balloon to Tuscaloosa, said the balloon immediately began to sag after it was cut.</p>
      <p>The day had been going mostly smoothly, Kennedy said. Some people yelled "Trump 2020" as they passed while others posed for selfies with the balloon. But then Kennedy said a man sidled up on the back of the balloon and attacked it with a knife. The suspect ran away but was caught by police officers, Kennedy said.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether Hutchinson has an attorney who could comment.</p>
      <p>Kennedy said he's accompanied "Baby Trump" to many appearances and never witnessed an attack on it, although someone did stab one of the balloons in London earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"It is rare to get that kind of anger," Kennedy said.</p>
