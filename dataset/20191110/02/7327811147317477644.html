      <p>ATLANTA -- A day after a missing Clark Atlanta University student was found dead in a Georgia park, police have arrested the victim's roommate and the roommate's boyfriend.</p>
      <p>Atlanta police on Saturday arrested 21-year-old Jordyn Jones and Jones' boyfriend, 21-year-old Barron Brantley, each on charges of malice murder in the Oct. 31 death of Alexis Crawford. Police say the medical examiner determined Crawford died by asphyxiation.</p>
      <p>Crawford was reported missing Nov. 1 and her body was found Friday.</p>
      <p>At a news conference, Police Chief Erika Shields said a motive had not been clearly established but she noted that Crawford filed a police report on Oct. 27 describing "unwanted kissing and touching" by Brantley.</p>
      <p>Jones and Brantley are being held at the Fulton County Jail. It was unknown if either has an attorney who could comment.</p>
