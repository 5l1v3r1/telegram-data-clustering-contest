      <p>PARIS, Nov 10 — British rocker Pete Doherty was fined €5,000 (RM22,771) and released from a Paris jail today, two days after being caught buying cocaine, legal sources told AFP.</p>
      <p>Police arrested the 40-year-old Libertines frontman carrying two packets of cocaine, one already partly consumed, early Friday.</p>
      <p>The singer opted for a simplified procedure for people caught using drugs, opting to pay daily 50-euro fines for 100 days, failing which he will be jailed, the Paris prosecutors’ office said.</p>
      <p>The sentence still has to be approved by a judge.</p>
      <p>Doherty’s lawyer Arash Derambarsh said his client, who is at the start of a major tour, had agreed to undergo full-time a medical treatment for his addiction to avoid a relapse.</p>
      <p>The bad boy of British rock, as famous for having dated supermodel Kate Moss as for his music, has repeatedly made headlines for drugs offences.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he was thrown out of a luxury rehab clinic in Thailand after claims he was a bad influence on other patients and did not try hard enough to kick his heroin habit. — AFP</p>
