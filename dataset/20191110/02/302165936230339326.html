      <p>PARIS, Nov 10 — A French former model and actress has accused Oscar-winning director Roman Polanski, 86, of raping her in a Swiss ski resort in 1975 when she was 18 years old.</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a series of allegations against the director, who fled to France from the United States in 1978 after admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Here is a summary of the accusations concerning Polanski, whose award-winning film <i>An Officer and a Spy</i> is released in France next week.</p>
      <p>
        <b> The US rape case</b>
      </p>
      <p>On March 11, 1977, the then 43-year-old Roman Polanski is arrested and accused of having drugged and raped a 13-year-old during a photo shoot the day before. He faces up to 50 years in prison.</p>
      <p>He is charged later that month on five counts, including rape by use of drugs and committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14.</p>
      <p>In August, to avoid a trial, Polanski pleads guilty to a single, lesser charge of unlawful sexual intercourse, an agreement reached with the judge and with the consent of the victim’s family.</p>
      <p>Sentenced to 90 days in prison, a psychiatric evaluation concludes he is not a danger and he is released after 42 days for good behaviour.</p>
      <p>But the day before a hearing to approve the deal, the judge changes his mind, saying he thinks the sentence was insufficient.</p>
      <p>On January 31, 1978, Polanski flees to Paris, making use of his French citizenship. The US issues an international arrest warrant.</p>
      <p>Polanski has since paid US$225,000 (RM929,925) to the victim, Samantha Gailey (now Geimer), to end a civil suit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>US extradition bids</b>
      </p>
      <p>US authorities have on several occasions tried to have Polanski extradited to face trial.</p>
      <p>On September 26, 2009, he is arrested in Zurich, Switzerland, on a US-issued international warrant. </p>
      <p>After two months in prison and eight months under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, in the Swiss Alps, Switzerland rejects the request in July 2010.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Polanski is arrested in Warsaw, although Poland refuses to extradite him.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Poland’s conservative government re-opens the case, but the Polish Supreme Court closes it in December. </p>
      <p>Despite requests from both Polanski and Geimer, in August 2017, a Los Angeles judge refuses to close the case.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fresh accusations</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the Cannes Film Festival in 2010, 42-year-old British actress Charlotte Lewis alleges Polanski sexually abused her when she was 16 during a casting session at his home in 1983.</p>
      <p>In August 2017, a second woman going by the name of “Robin” accuses Polanski of sexual aggression when she was 16, in 1973.</p>
      <p>In September 2017, Renate Langer, a 61-year-old former actress, accuses Polanski of having raped her in 1972 in Gstaad when she was 15.</p>
      <p>The following month, California artist Marianne Barnard accuses him of sexually assaulting her in 1975 after asking her to pose naked when she was just 10 years old.</p>
      <p>In November 2017, Swiss prosecutors rule out bringing charges over the latest allegations because the statute of limitations for the assault has expired</p>
      <p>Polanski’s lawyer says his client denies all the allegations against him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Oscars outlaw</b>
      </p>
      <p>Plans for Polanski to preside over the Cesars, the French equivalent of the Oscars, are abandoned in 2017, amid the fall-out from “Me Too” movement that started with accusations of sexual assault against US producer Harvey Weinstein.</p>
      <p>Although awarded the 2003 Best Director Oscar for <i>The Pianist</i>, Polanski is expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2018.</p>
      <p>The same year, his wife, actor Emmanuelle Seigner, refuses an invitation to join the Academy in protest at her husband’s treatment.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The latest accusation</b>
      </p>
      <p>On November 8, 2019, French newspaper Le Parisien carries allegations against Polanski from French former model and actress Valentine Monnier.</p>
      <p>She says he raped her at his chalet in the Swiss ski resort at Gstaad when she was a teenager in 1975, when she was 18 years old.</p>
      <p>While she did not file a complaint against him, she confided in two women at the time, both of whom confirmed her account to Le Parisien.</p>
      <p>Polanski’s lawyer has said he “firmly denies all accusations of rape”. — AFP</p>
