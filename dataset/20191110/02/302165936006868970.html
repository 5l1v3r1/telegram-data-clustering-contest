      <p>LONDON, Nov 10 — Klara Buhl's late goal gave Germany a 2-1 friendly win over World Cup semi-finalists England yesterday to send home a record crowd for a Lionesses home match disappointed.</p>
      <p>Buhl struck with less than a minute remaining on the clock in front of an attendance of 77,768.</p>
      <p>That smashed the previous best for an England fixture, but fell short of the best-ever crowd for a women's match in the United Kingdom — when 80,000 saw the USA beat Japan to win gold at the 2012 Olympics.</p>
      <p>Organisers had billed the game as a sellout with 86,000 tickets off-loaded, but a dreary and wet day in London may well have put off the less hardy and devoted supporters.</p>
      <p>Alexandra Popp had given Germany the lead inside three minutes, with Phil Neville's side failing to level when Nikita Parris missed a penalty.</p>
      <p>However, the hosts got back on level terms when Ellen White tucked away the ball before half-time.</p>
      <p>“It's a dream come true to play at Wembley for your country and score,” said Manchester City striker White.</p>
      <p>“It's unbelievable — the support, the noise, the atmosphere — we are really sorry we couldn't get the result.”</p>
      <p>Buhl's late strike means England have lost five of their last seven matches, dating back to their heartbreaking World Cup semi-final defeat by the USA.</p>
      <p>“It a was killer blow late on,” said Neville.</p>
      <p>“The results are not good enough — there's no hiding away but there's a long-term plan that we have. We have to take the criticisms that come our way and stick together.</p>
      <p>“I have been in football long enough and I know I need to take responsibilities, I need to make sure I improve as a manager and the players improve too.” — AFP</p>
