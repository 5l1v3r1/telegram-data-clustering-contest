        <i>Protest balloon was knifed during Donald Trump’s visit to college football game</i>
      </p>
      <p>A towering Baby Trump protest balloon was knifed and deflated by someone unhappy with its appearance during Donald Trump’s Saturday trip to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama">Alabama</a>, organisers said.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during the president’s visit to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/09/trump-cheers-louisiana-alabama-football-boos-baseball">watch a University of Alabama football game</a>. The balloon, which is more than 6.1 metres (20 feet) tall, was set up in a nearby park.</p>
      <p>Jim Girvan, the organiser of a group that “adopts” out Baby Trump balloons for protests, said a man charged the balloon with a knife and cut a 2.4-metre (8-foot) gash in the back. Girvan said the unidentified man was taken into custody. Tuscaloosa police did not immediately respond to a request for more details.</p>
      <p>The orange, diaper-clad, cellphone-clutching caricature of the president is often taken to Trump appearances as a way to protest against him.</p>
      <p>Baby Trump first rose over London, when local activists brainstormed a way to troll Trump. Now several groups raise money to bring balloon replicas around the US.</p>
      <p>Robert Kennedy, a volunteer “baby sitter” who brought the balloon to Tuscaloosa, said the balloon immediately began to sag after it was cut.</p>
      <p>The day had been going mostly smoothly, Kennedy said. Some people yelled “Trump 2020” as they passed while others posed for selfies with the balloon. But then Kennedy said a man sidled up on the back of the balloon and attacked it with a knife. He ran away but was caught by police officers, Kennedy said.</p>
      <p>Kennedy said he’s accompanied Baby Trump to many appearances and never witnessed an attack on the balloon, although someone did stab a Baby Trump balloon in London earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“It is rare to get that kind of anger,” Kennedy said.</p>
