      <p>A candidate in the upcoming November 12 city municipal council elections does not have a Voter Identification Card issued by the Election Commission. The rather strange situation came about as the Election Commission of India is undertaking a voters’ verification programme’ that will be completed in January 2020. The ID card applied for by P Prabhakara Nayaka, a candidate in the Robertsonpet municipal election can be issued only after that. His candidature was on the verge of being rejected because of that before the High Court stepped in. <br/><br/><br/>Nayaka approached the High Court after he was unable to file his nomination for the said election. In the petition before the court he sought a direction to the EC to issue him his voters-photo ID card. <br/><br/>Nayaka’s advocate argued that he was an eligible voter and his name was in the voters list. He also had an Aadhaar card. He managed to get an extract of the voters information downloaded from the website of Election Commission of India (ECI). “The online application status would indicate that the application has been submitted on 08.07.2019 has been verified and accepted on 18.09.2019,” the court was told. The advocate for the ECI pointed out that the Voters’ Verification Programme was underway after a notification was issued on October 12 this year. Only after the survey, would new Voter-Photo Identify cards be issued. It will happen only on January 20, 2020. Nayaka has to wait till then, it was told. <br/><br/><br/>The court noted that inclusion in to the voters list is permitted till the last date for making nominations in city municipal council elections. It is allowed under the Representation of People Act and the Karnataka Municipalities Act.</p>
