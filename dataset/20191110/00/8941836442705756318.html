      <p>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - The father of a black woman fatally shot by a white police officer inside her Fort Worth, Texas, home has died.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marquis-jefferson/">Marquis Jefferson</a>, Bruce Carter, tells the Dallas Morning News that the father of Atatiana Jefferson suffered a heart attack and died Saturday night at a Dallas hospital. Carter tells KDFW that Jefferson “just couldn’t get back from what happened with his daughter.”</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Jefferson was killed last month after police went to her home for a welfare check. The Fort Worth officer, Aaron Dean, was charged with murder after resigning from the force.</p>
