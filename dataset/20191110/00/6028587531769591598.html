      <p>He has scored an astounding 52 of them in his career and already four in 2019/2020 alone. Last night at the Camp Nou, as part of a dead ball hat trick that sent FC Barcelona back to the top of La Liga via a 4-1 victory over Celta Vigo, Lionel Messi wowed the soccer world yet again with two almost identical free-kicks into the inside left corner.</p>
      <p>Leading many to remark that from such range the five-time Ballon d’Or winner makes them look like close-range penalties, Messi is challenging the statuses of legends such as Juninho Pernambucano and Andrea Pirlo as the greatest free-kick taker of all time.</p>
      <p>And as revealed in a piece entitled ‘Another Dead Ball Lesson From Messi’ in SPORT this morning, it was not without his own tutors that the 32-year-old perfected the art.</p>
      <p>Thought of as a bad influence on the youngster at the time with their hedonistic ways, the shipping out of Ronaldinho and Deco was one of Pep Guardiola’s first port of calls when taking over the Camp Nou reins in 2009.</p>
      <p>Their love of Barcelona’s nightlife infamous, it was only when they had left that the ‘Tiki-taka’ golden era spearheaded by Messi could get underway.</p>
      <p>Under his predecessor Frank Rijkaard however, there was ample time for the Brazilian pair to leave a positive mark on their fellow South American on the training ground.</p>
      <p>Not trusted with such resposibilities while budding in the La Masia academy youth teams, Juanjo Clausi and Victor Vazquez were considered ‘better,’ than him from outside the 18 year box.</p>
      <p>Yet according to David Salinas, it was ‘next to them,’ Ronaldinho and Deco, that Messi ‘began to touch the ball with his bare foot’. ‘There he controlled his touch to give effect and power to the ball,’ continued Salinas.</p>
      <p>‘Leo Messi was born with an enormous talent to shine with his own light in football, it has been known since he was a child and played at Newell’s [Old Boys in Argentina],’ Salinas added. ‘But he also insisted on improving [while] surrounded by great masters, specialists and wizards of the ball, as were his Brazilian companions’</p>
      <p>Representing his homeland following their exits, Messi also took advice from the idol his countrymen consider the only figure perhaps surpassing him as the best to ever lace up a pair of boots.</p>
      <p>During his doomed tenure as Argentina national team coach at the turn of the decade, which ended in flames with a humbling loss to Germany at the 2010 World Cup, Diego Maradona acted as a teacher to a student according to then-physical trainer Fernando Signorini.</p>
      <p>‘Put the ball here and listen to me well: do not take your foot so fast to the ball, because then she does not know what you want,’ Maradona apparently said while revealing his inner-most secrets.</p>
      <p>And from then on, the student became a master.</p>
      <p>A leader for club and country, there have, as mentioned, been 52 converted free-kicks overall - 46 for Barça and six for Argentina.</p>
      <p>In addition, 72 penalties in Blaugrana colours have complimented 612 strikes overall in 698 appearances that contain within them an astounding 46 hat tricks. This weekend, with his latest three-goal haul, he tied the 34 in La Liga netted by the previous record holder Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>Whether in open play or from a dead ball situation, Lionel Messi is a threat at any given moment able to turn a game on its head with his individual brilliance and genius. In the latter department, he is only just receiving credit yet it is credit entirely-deserved for a player continually improving in his 15th year at the top.</p>
