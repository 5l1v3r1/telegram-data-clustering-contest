      <p>AN MDC National Executive Council meeting on Saturday was almost disrupted by skirmishes allegedly planned by former secretary general Douglas Mwonzora in the Central Business District with three people reportedly injured.</p>
      <p>The MDC Youth Assembly Sunday released a statement demanding an investigation against Mwonzora.</p>
      <p>The MDC NEC was held at the party’s Morgan Tsvangirai House headquarters in central Harare.</p>
      <p>MDC youths accused Mwonzora of mobilising some disgruntled party youths to try and bring back former party deputy president Thokozani Khupe.</p>
      <p>Khupe left the main opposition in frustration early last year to form a breakaway party following sharp differences on who to succeed late founding leader Morgan Tsvangirai.</p>
      <p>“As MDC youth assembly, we would like to make it clear that we are not going to treat those who betray in our midst with kid gloves.</p>
      <p>“In this regard, we demand that Mwonzora be investigated on these allegations.</p>
      <p>“We also want to categorically make it clear that the leadership question within the party was resolved at our 5th elective Congress held in Gweru,” warned the MDC Youth Assembly.</p>
      <p>The youths also accused the Zanu PF led government of sponsoring the violence.</p>
      <p>“The MDC youth assembly is deeply disturbed by provocative moves of what is visibly state sponsored violence on our party headquarters and its leadership.</p>
      <p>“We have it on good authority that a NEC member working in cahoots with political renegade Rhino Mashaya organised a clandestine meeting somewhere at Africa Unit Square to ambush and attack our leadership.</p>
      <p>“The Herald photographers embedded in company of some hired rogue youths whom we later discovered were borrowed from Zanu PF is a clear pointer that the whole thing was preconceived and pre-planned to soil our party image,” read part of the statement.</p>
      <p>Mwonzora withdrew his candidature from contesting Chamisa for president at the party’s elective congress May this year.</p>
      <p>He later also lost his general secretary post to Charlton Hwende.</p>
      <p>Reached for comment, the opposition Senator said the claims were false.</p>
      <p>“Those allegations are rubbish. They are false. However, I will issue a statement on Monday after my meeting with the President (Chamisa) regarding the matter,” he said.</p>
