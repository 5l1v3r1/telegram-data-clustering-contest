      <p>A man was arrested off a flight by police Tuesday <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/us/american-airlines-flight-diverted-sex-offense-trnd/index.html">after allegedly grabbing another passenger's crotch</a> and causing the captain to divert to the nearest airport after the incident. James Clayton Cholewinski-Boy was charged with abusive sexual contact.</p>
      <blockquote>The alleged victim, identified as "E.J." in the complaint, was seated between Cholewinski-Boy and her daughter. Shortly after takeoff, he began touching the woman's arm and she repeatedly pushed his hands away, according to the complaint. Cholewinski-Boy then "forcibly grabbed her by the crotch," the complaint said. The woman again pushed his hand away and demanded that he stop.</blockquote>
