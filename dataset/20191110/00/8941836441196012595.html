      <p>SAN DIEGO (AP) - Brown is back for the San Diego Padres.</p>
      <p>The Padres unveiled new uniforms Saturday night that feature a brown and gold color scheme, similar to the one used from the franchise’s inception in 1969 through 1984.</p>
      <p>The new uniforms were unveiled at Petco Park in front a few thousand fans by players Fernando Tatis Jr., Eric Hosmer and Manny Machado.</p>
      <p>Machado modeled the home white uniform with brown pinstripes that included the word Padres in brown on the front, trimmed in gold.</p>
      <p>Hosmer showed off the solid brown primary road jersey with a yellow San Diego across the front, with sand pants.</p>

      <p>Tatis modeled a tan alternate road jersey with brown pinstripes. That jersey had San Diego across the front in brown and trimmed in gold.</p>
      <p>Fans have clamored for years for a return to the brown. The team’s primary color scheme for several years has been blue and white.</p>
      <p>“People wanted brown and we gave it to them,” executive chairman Ron Fowler said. “Now we’ve got to start winning baseball games.”</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be different, it’s going to be unique and like they said, they’re going to know who’s playing right away when they see the brown on the field,” said Tatis, whose phenomenal rookie season was cut short by a stress reaction in his lower back.</p>

        <p>The Padres continue to build what they hope is a contending season. They’ve missed the playoffs for 13 straight seasons and haven’t had a winning record since 2010.</p>
        <p>“I think that’s the way everyone’s looking at it, is we can turn the page of those tough times,” Hosmer said. “We’re trying to start a new wave now, a new culture, and the brown really represents the beginning of all that.”</p>
        <p>The Padres finished last in the NL West at 70-92. Manager Andy Green was fired with eight games to go. Rookie manager Jayce Tingler was hired late last month.</p>
