      <p>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission plans to sample deer carcasses for chronic wasting disease during the coming firearm season, Nov. 16-24.</p>
      <p>The state wants to assess the spread and prevalence of the disease.</p>
      <p>Samples will be taken at check stations in northeast, central and northwest Nebraska. Game and Parks will accept voluntary samples from any hunter who kills an elk.</p>
      <p>Chronic wasting disease affects deer and elk and is always fatal. No human cases have ever been recorded.</p>

        <p>The disease was first discovered in Nebraska in 2000 in Kimball County. It’s been found in 42 Nebraska counties, but no deer population declines attributable to the disease have been identified.</p>
