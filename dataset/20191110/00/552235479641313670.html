      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>The family of a woman brutally murdered in Irvine 25 years ago say they still believe the 'smallest piece of information' could help bring her killer to justice.</p>
      <p>Shona Stevens was 31-years-old when she was found dead on a footpath just a few hundred yards from her home in Alder Green, Bourtreehill on November 10, 1994.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one had had been battered in a frenzied broad daylight attack - an horrific murder that police are no nearer to solving a quarter of a century on.</p>
      <p>Now, on the anniversary of Shona's death, officers are launching a fresh appeal for information, believing the answer to solving the cold case still lies within the local community.</p>
      <p>Shona's mum Mhairia, 85, and daughter Candice, 32, say they are as hopeful as ever that justice will be done despite more than two decades of anguish.</p>
      <p>Both released pre-prepared statements to the media this week, pleading for members of the public to come forward with information.</p>
      <p>Mhairi said: "It has been 25 years since Shona was taken from us and we are still as hopeful as ever that those responsible for her murder can be brought to justice. <br/><br/>“I cannot emphasise enough how important even the smallest piece of information could be in being able to give me and my family closure. <br/><br/>“I want to know who was responsible for this attack and why they did it.</p>

      <p>Shona was attacked in Bourtreehill Park shortly after 1.10pm - some 200 yards to the rear of the home in Alder Green she shared with her mum and daughter. She had been making her way back from the local Co-op store in nearby Bourtreehill Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>She was found at 1.20pm within an area of trees and bushes, not far from the footpath, with serious head injuries that ultimately resulted in her death.</p>
      <p>Her daughter Candice said: “I was only seven at the time of my mum’s murder but that does not make it any easier to deal with. <br/><br/>“I spent a large part my childhood years growing up without my mum and I would please ask anyone who knows anything about the incident to please come forward.”</p>
      <p>Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Superintendent Paul Livingstone, said he was open minded about the possibility of the killer still living in Irvine.</p>
      <p>He said: "Shona was a young mother who was subject to an unprovoked attack that has left her family devastated and we want to trace those responsible. <br/><br/>“The footpath that Shona was murdered on was used on a regular basis by members of the public to access Bourtreehill Shopping Centre and we believe that someone may have vital information that will help bring this investigation to a close.</p>

      <p>"There could be somebody who's been sitting there for 25 years and maybe saw something or knows something and has thought it insignificant. My message to them would be, let us be the judge of that.</p>
      <p>"We will act on every bit of information we get and it could just be that that's the key that unlocks this mystery.</p>
      <p>"I firmly believe somebody's probably saw who has been responsible for this and maybe not just put it together and that's why we really need them to come forward and tell us that.</p>
      <p>"In 25 years, people's allegiances can change. If somebody has that information I would say don't be worried about that. The important thing is that you come forward and give us that information so we can give those answers to Shona's family. <br/><br/>“Police Scotland are committed to bringing those responsible to justice and giving Shona’s family closure on what is such a horrific incident in which they have suffered for too long.” <br/><br/>Anyone with any information can contact the dedicated number on 01236 818326 or alternatively 101.
