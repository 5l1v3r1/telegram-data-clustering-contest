      <p>Tyrrell Hatton won the 2019 Turkish Airlines Open at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal and with it he reiterated that he is a seasonal kind of guy.A Fall Guy, if you will.</p>
      <p>Because whilst he is well capable of playing very fine golf at any time of the year the Englishman has proved, time and time and time again, that he loves playing golf in October and November.</p>
      <p>His three previous starts in those months this year? All of them top 20s.</p>
      <p>His last top five finish? Last October.</p>
      <p>His last win? October 2017, when he was victorious not once, but twice.</p>
      <p>Incredibly he has not finished outside the top 25 in his last 22 starts in those two months, a run stretching back to 2015 and including three wins and two second placed finishes.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, of course, October and November are known as dark months and, as if to celebrate that notion, the tournament was actually completed beneath ink black skies after 72 holes left six men (Hatton, Matthias Schwab, Kurt Kitayama, Erik Van Rooyen, Victor Perez and Benjamin Hebert) tied on 20-under 268.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, this half dozen needed more than the odd hole to separate them so officials were breathing a sigh of relief that the course boasts floodlights down the 18th hole.</p>
      <p>Cue an unusual golfing scene: The skies turned first orange and then black, the fairways glistened Wizard of Oz green, the players cast multiple shadows.</p>
      <p>Hebert was an early casualty, losing a third play-off of the season. Perez and Van Rooyen joined him on the sidelines after wayward drives. Kitayama, seeking an unprecedented third win in a rookie campaign, missed an eight-foot birdie putt for the win before becoming the fourth man to step down.</p>
      <p>It left the long-term leader Schwab and Hatton in a head-to-head, a vivid contrast in temperament; the former almost eerily calm, the latter comically bad-tempered; Tyrolean versus Tyrrell-ean.</p>
      <p>Hatton had chipped over the green on the first extra hole, but then chipped in to keep his hopes alive. Schwab drained a lengthy birdie putt on the second to do the same.</p>
      <p>Eventually Hatton triumphed when making par to Schwab’s bogey at the fourth extra hole.</p>
      <p>“It's just been a crazy day,” he said. “Obviously the play-off was mental, surreal, and I'm just so happy to win again.</p>
      <p>“I actually can't believe that I've won. It's been quite a difficult year in terms of things happening off the course and the last month I really found my game again.</p>
      <p>“I said to my team that if I was lucky enough to win again, then I would definitely savor the moment, because I think it's quite easy to take it for granted.</p>
      <p>“Sport's great when it's going well, but when it's not going well, it kind of hits home, so I'm absolutely thrilled.</p>
      <p>“It's incredible to get my fourth win on The European Tour and obviously that wraps up a spot in the Masters for next year, as well, which was definitely on my mind coming into the tournament.”</p>
      <p>With victory the 28-year-old Englishman jumps to sixth in the Race to Dubai. He will take next week off and then play in the DP World Tour Championship, the European Tour’s seasonal finale.</p>
      <p>The good news for him is that it finishes before the end of November. The Fall Guy might not be done.</p>
