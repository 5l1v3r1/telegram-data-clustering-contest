      <p>AEW Full Gear aired a hit-or-miss pay-per-view as Cody heartbreakingly lost to Chris Jericho after MJF threw in the towel. After an extended period of crocodile tears, MJF turned heel on his former best friend. Cody will now never be able to challenge for the AEW World Championship again. Full Gear’s main event saw Jon Moxley prevail over Kenny Omega in an unsanctioned Lights Out match.</p>
      <p>AEW viewership saw a slight bump to 822,000 as WWE NXT <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/07/wwe-nxt-surges-to-within-9000-viewers-of-aew-dynamite-after-raw-invasion/">moves in on the pro wrestling audience with help from main roster stars.</a></p>

        <b>Proud and Powerful def. The Young Bucks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even without a ladder, two elite AEW tag teams managed to find new and innovate ways to almost kill each other.</p>
      <p>The Young Bucks continue to be committed to putting guys over with yet another loss in AEW.</p>
      <p>I wasn’t even around during the prime of the Rock N’ Roll Express and I still feel like they’re taking me back to the good ol’ days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hangman Adam Page def. PAC</b>
      </p>
      <p>When the 30-minute time limit was announced, I became nervous. When the 15 minute mark of a slowly paced match passed, I damn-near panicked.</p>
      <p>PAC’s heel work is simply phenomenal.</p>
      <p>I despised this match until maybe the last six minutes. But boy were they a great six minutes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shawn Sears def. Joey Janela</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reaction to Shawn Spears’ entrances can only be described as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic_silence">Monk-like</a>.”</p>
      <p>Is there less of a star with better theme music than Shawn Spears.</p>
      <p>AEW is actually giving an honest effort to getting Shawn Spears over as a top heel. God love them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SoCal Uncensored def. The Lucha Bros and Private Party—AEW World Tag Team Championships</b>
      </p>
      <p>After PAC and Hangman Page lowkey dropped the ball in having a great match, this match felt like it had more pressure to deliver. And deliver it did.</p>
      <p>Even Christopher Daniels, dressed as Pentagon Jr., was performing his patented moves, it took a long time for this crowd to figure out whom the fake Pentagon wrestler was.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Riho def. Emi Sakura—AEW Women’s Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>If I hear “Student vs. Teacher” one more time...</p>
      <p>The video package promoting this match felt like it could double as an advertisement for a TED Talk.</p>
      <p>Emi Sakura as the heel who acts like a babyface is more enjoyable every time I see it.</p>
      <p>One of the highlights of a mostly quiet match was Jim Ross trying to pronounce “Emi Sakura,” struggling mightily and frustratingly blurting out “god [expletive].”</p>
      <p>Jim Ross pointing out his own mistakes bottomed out when Good Ol’ J.R. grumbled “I suck!” on air.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chris Jericho def. Cody—AEW World Championship</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ron Simmons beat Vader in this same building. There is an opportunity for more black history in Baltimore pro wrestling should Brandi Rhodes' husband defeat Chris Jericho.</p>
      <p>Cody Rhodes chose to be announced as the father of a husky rather than the brother of a bizarre one. Dustin Rhodes broke his arm for nothing.</p>
      <p>The judges will be officiating this match simply on gut instinct. As bad as the judging is in combat sports, this is one of the worst judicial formats I’ve ever seen.</p>
      <p>As if we needed another reminder tonight, the Rhodes Family is the greatest family in the history of bleeding in pro wrestling.</p>
      <p>Jim Ross furiously insisting Jack Hager be “fired” for interfering in this match made up for any mistake he made tonight.</p>
      <p>If this match ends with MJF throwing in his Burberry scarf on behalf of Cody I swear to god...</p>
      <p>Excalibur reasoned that if this match ends in disqualification, one would assume Cody would get an immediate rematch. If that’s the finish of this match AEW will have a hard time getting $50 out of me.</p>
      <p>Including the heel turn, this is an incredible storyline.</p>
      <p>I have to imagine the people who threw a drink on MJF were plants. Either that, or AEW security is awful.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jon Moxley def. Kenny Omega—Unsanctioned Lights Out Match</b>
      </p>
      <p>An unsanctioned match is one way to politic one’s way into the main event.</p>
      <p>The past month has taught me just how much I need a barbed-wired broom in my life.</p>
      <p>This match was doing its best impression of ECW and might have been trying too hard at some points. Namely the nonsense with the mouse traps.</p>
      <p>Excalibur noted “these fans here in Baltimore having a hard time trying to decide who to root for, <i>what </i>to root for.” That’s sounds like an indictment feud that ultimately missed the mark.</p>
      <p>Jon Moxley climbing through broken glass to get to the ropes would have been made better if done to the score of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY3XiM7oGj0">Chariots of Fire.</a>”</p>
      <p>The fans chanting “fight forever” during a match like this might be adrenaline junkies.</p>
