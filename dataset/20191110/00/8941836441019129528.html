      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Lexie Hull was so focused on playing defense, she didn’t even notice her own scoring total until it was over.</p>
      <p>“I had no idea,” said Hull, who scored 27 points to help No. 3 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> beat <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a> 97-71 Saturday in the first college basketball game played at Chase Center, the Golden State Warriors new facility in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>.</p>
      <p>“I was focused so much on guarding No. 21 (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ioanna-krimili/">Ioanna Krimili</a>) that I shot it when I was open and that was it.”</p>
      <p>DiJonai <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrington/">Carrington</a> added 17 points for the Cardinal (1-1), who are 24-9 in its series with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>. Alyssa Jerome added 11.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ioanna-krimili/">Krimili</a> scored 17 points for the Dons (1-1). Mikayla Williams added 14 points and Lucie Hoskova scored all 10 of her points in the first half. Julia Nielacna also scored 10.</p>

      <p>“We were out-sized, out-skilled, out-everything,” Dons coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/molly-goodenbour/">Molly Goodenbour</a> said. “We never backed down though, and we can learn from this.”</p>
      <p>Hull, referred to by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">Tara VanDerveer</a> as “playing like a woman possessed” after the season opener, did nothing to tarnish that image. She was 10 of 12 from the field, including 5 of 7 from 3-point range. She also added eight rebounds and three assists.</p>
      <p>“I’m feeling more confident and it’s easier to play without as much pressure,” said Hull, who recorded a double-double in her first career game last year, got hurt and never fully recovered. “I’m playing in the moment.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrington/">Carrington</a> also grabbed eight rebounds. Freshman Ashten Prechtel led <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> with nine boards.</p>

        <p>“We’re still trying to put the puzzle together,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> said. “I think we can score a lot and play good defense.”</p>
        <p>The Cardinal scored the first seven points of the third quarter and held onto a double-digit lead the rest of the way. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> eventually opened a 21-point advantage when Hull hit a 3-pointer midway through the quarter.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> shot 55.6% from the field in the first half, with Hull and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrington/">Carrington</a> combining for 10-of-15 and a 44-32 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>Hoskova and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ioanna-krimili/">Krimili</a> were a combined 8 of 16 for 21 points but the rest of the team went 4 of 21.</p>
        <p>CHASE CENTER</p>
        <p>Both teams were impressed by the latest NBA arena and getting the chance to play there.</p>
        <p>“It was fun for our players to be the first collegiate game played at Chase Center,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/molly-goodenbour/">Goodenbour</a> said. “It’s a fantastic facility and hopefully we get a chance to play her again. It’s a great place to host a tournament.”</p>
        <p>Said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a>: “It was exciting playing here. It’s a great arena and the crowd came out. It was a little bit like tournament time.”</p>
        <p>FROSH FROM GREECE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/molly-goodenbour/">Goodenbour</a> pointed to freshman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ioanna-krimili/">Krimili</a> when asked about the biggest difference from last year. “She can be a special player,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/molly-goodenbour/">Goodenbour</a> said. “She’s very valuable to us. She’ll only get better the more she plays.”</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a>: Not that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> was worried, but having <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrington/">Carrington</a> respond with a big game eases any doubts about her ability to continue what she started last year in a breakout season. Lacie Hull, who missed all four of her shots in the season opener, recovered with a nice shooting afternoon Saturday.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco/">San Francisco</a>: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/molly-goodenbour/">Goodenbour</a>, who played for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tara-vanderveer/">VanDerveer</a> at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stanford/">Stanford</a> and was part of its two national championships, is starting four underclassmen and a junior as she builds her program. Saturday’s game was her 95th as the Dons coach and 399th game overall.</p>
