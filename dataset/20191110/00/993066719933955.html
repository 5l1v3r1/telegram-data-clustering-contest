      <p>Strictly Come Dancing’s Karim Zeroual says he is too busy to take notice of any “curse” rumours.</p>
      <p>The CBBC star said speculation about his chemistry with dance partner pro Amy Dowden does not worry him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really know about any rumours. I’m too busy learning to do this waltz than to worry about stuff like that,” the 25-year-old said.</p>

      <p>The presenter has a longterm girlfriend, while Dowden is also in a relationship and preparing to tie the knot with her fiance Ben Jones.</p>
      <p>Welsh dancer Dowden, 28, said: “Karim is coming to my wedding next July…. I’m so excited.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether the Strictly judges were also invited, she said: “We’ll have to wait and see!”</p>

      <p>And Zeroual quipped: “I’m doing a speech but she doesn’t know that!”</p>
      <p>The star dismissed any suggestion he had dance experience before Strictly, saying: “I  was a singer in musical theatre, The Lion King, when I was about eight! There’s no movement in it!”</p>
      <p>And the popular CBBC presenter said he hopes Strictly gives him a springboard into other TV work, saying: “I definitely want experience on other telly.”</p>
      <p>But he added: “Kids’ telly is amazing… this is the best job in the world. It’s not even work, I get paid to have a pie in my face!”</p>
      <p>Strictly Come Dancing continues with the results show at 7.20pm on Sunday night on BBC One.</p>
