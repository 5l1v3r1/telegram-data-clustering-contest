      <p>For the past five seasons, the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated the NBA in offensive rebounding. From the 2014-15 season through the 2018-19 season, they were first in the league in offensive rebounds every year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2014-15: 12.8 offensive rebounds per game (1st in NBA)</li>
        <li>2015-16: 13.1 offensive rebounds per game (1st in NBA)</li>
        <li>2016-17: 12.2 offensive rebounds per game (1st in NBA)</li>
        <li>2017-18: 12.5 offensive rebounds per game (1st in NBA)</li>
        <li>2018-19: 12.6 offensive rebounds per game (1st in BA)</li>
        <li>2019-20: 8.6 offensive rebounds per game (27th in NBA)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, early in the 2019-20 season, they are the fourth worst offensive rebounding team which is limiting their field goal attempts as well as points per game.</p>

      <p>After being in the top seven in field goal attempts per game for five straight seasons, Oklahoma City is seeing a significant dip in this category as a direct result of their offensive rebounding struggles. Not only are they pulling down four less offensive rebounds per game this season, but they are also 19th in the NBA in pace in the 2019-20 season after being 6th last season.</p>

      <p>The combination of lack of offensive rebounding and slower pace of play has resulted in them being one of the league’s lowest volume shooting teams. Oklahoma City’s 84.1 shot attempts per game this season is 9.9 fewer than last season, also resulting in 8.5 fewer points per contest.</p>
      <p>It is safe to assume the slower pace of play is due to the absence of Russell Westbrook, who had a style of play that was always extremely quick, moving the ball up the court and scoring in transition as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Westbrook was also one of the better offensive rebounders for the Thunder in previous seasons. In fact, last season Russell Wesbtook, Paul George, and Jerami Grant combined for 4.1 offensive rebounds per game. All three of these players were traded away this summer and no leave a major void for Oklahoma City on the offensive glass.</p>
      <p>One of the best offensive rebounders in the NBA, Steven Adams has been battling injury all season and struggled on the offensive boards in comparison to previous seasons. After pulling down 4.9 offensive rebounds last season, he is down to 3.4 per game this season. Nerlens Noel is also experiencing a drop in offensive rebounding production, down to 1.o per game this season after 1.6 in the 2018-19 season. Luckily for the Thunder, young guards Hamidou Diallo and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander are averaging 1.6 and 0.9 offensive rebounds per game respectively this season, picking up some of the slack.</p>
      <p>Overall, Oklahoma City is not having trouble rebounding the ball. Rather, it is strictly on the offensive end. They are currently seventh in the NBA in defensive rebounding with 36.9 per contest, putting them at 18th in total rebounding with 45.4 per contest.</p>
      <p>With a brand new roster, this Oklahoma City Thunder team is playing a much different style of basketball. A slower-paced offense, moving the ball with less isolation play along with the offensive rebounding struggles has them near the bottom of the league in both shot attempts and points per game. While this could change as the season goes on, for now the Thunder will have to rely on their stout defense to win many of their games.</p>
