      <p>The most unique color scheme in North American sports has officially made its return and it’s a glorious return, at that. After spending the past four seasons only wearing brown during Friday home games, the San Diego Padres will be wearing their traditional color scheme for all home games and all road games as well. Brown is indeed back and it’s a return that was both well-received and much needed.</p>
      <p>The uniform unveiling and announcement came with some interesting wrinkles other than the fact that the Padres have finally given their fans what they’ve wanted for so long. For starters, only one hat was unveiled for their primary set of uniforms. There could be more hats on the way since San Diego is due to unveil a couple more alternate uniforms later today but it’s still a pleasant change of pace to see a team stick with just one hat. Then again, one hat is all you need when your color scheme is as strong and unique as the Padres color scheme now is.</p>
      <p>Additionally, appearances aren’t as they seem. You would think that the pinstriped road sand uniforms would be the primary away uniform. While it’s not exactly a gray uniform, it’s still close enough to the typical road uniform archetype that you’re used to seeing when it comes to baseball. However, that is the alternate uniform. The brown jerseys are actually the primary road uniform and they come with sand-colored pants that don’t have pinstripes.</p>
      <p>Having a colored jersey officially designated as the primary road uniform is something that MLB hasn’t seen since a handful of teams did so during the 1970s and 1980s. In fact, the Padres were one of those teams that did so and this is a bit of a return to the old days for San Diego in more ways than one.</p>

      <p>It’s also interesting to see the team go with the brown jerseys as their primary road look since the alternate road uniform matches up directly with the primary home uniform. The most distinctive part of the uniform other than the pinstripes is the striping around the collar and the sleeves. The brown-gold-brown stripes provide a lovely bookend for those particular parts of the uniform and it caught my eye almost solely due to the use of the color scheme. It’s a design element that you don’t normally see on a pinstriped uniform but it works wonderfully with this particular uniform.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the return to brown-and-gold also marked the return of an old friend from the shadows as the Swingin’ Friar logo also returned to its traditional color scheme. While a slightly-updated interlocking “SD” logo will still serve as the primary logo, the Friar logo will be the secondary logo and is also on the right-hand sleeve of each jersey. It’s a welcome addition and continues to give the Padres’ new look a truly unique and distinctive flavor to it.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, “unique” is probably the best part of all of this. Instead of blending in with the rest of the blue-colored teams across baseball, the Padres are once again in a position where they can truly stand out. Additionally, they did so without choosing to go with a garish uniform set. The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/demetriusbell/2019/01/25/san-diego-padres-brown-uniforms-2020-baseball/#679987dd2190">reported focus testing</a> was put to good use and the finished product is one that Padres fans can be proud of and one that neutral fans can truly appreciate.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of anticipation and just as much hype surrounding the unveiling of these uniforms and the Padres have lived up to it with their new look. It took far too long for this change to happen but it’s still great that the fans got what they wanted and got it in a high-quality package as well. The Padres now have one of the better looks in MLB and it’s a huge upgrade from what they had before.</p>
