      <p>TORONTO (AP) - Sean Couturier scored the shootout winner to give the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Philadelphia Flyers</a> a 3-2 victory over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> captain Claude Giroux also scored in the shootout. William Nylander was the only successful <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> shooter. Last weekend in Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> went a club-record 11 rounds to beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> in a shootout.</p>
      <p>“That last game in our building and tonight, they’re hard-fought games,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> coach Alain Vigneault said. “Our focus was on bringing a real strong game on the road. “It’s a big two points.”</p>
      <p>Phillipe Myers and Oskar Lindblom scored in regulation for Philadelphia, and Brian Elliott stopped 38 shots.</p>
      <p>Nylander had a goal and an assist, Travis Dermott also scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> and Frederik Andersen made 30 saves. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Maple Leafs</a> had won a season-high three games.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> also lost star winger Mitch Marner to an ankle injury early in the second period. Marner was hurt after falling awkwardly on his right leg off the second period’s opening faceoff. The 22-year-old struggled to get to the bench and went the locker room. He returned during a television timeout to test his ankle, but once again headed off and was done for the night.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know the extent,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> coach Mike Babcock said. “I don’t know if it’s a few days or weeks or whatever. “There’s no sense on dwelling on it.”</p>
      <p>Kevin Hayes hit the post in overtime for Philadelphia before Ivan Provorov deked Andersen to the ice, but sent a backhander wide. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a> got a power play late in the extra period, but Elliott denied Nylander.</p>
      <p>Myers and Lindblom gave the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/philadelphia-flyers/">Flyers</a> a 2-0 lead in the first period, with Lindblom scoring on a power play. Dermott scored midway through the second, and Nylander tied it early in the third.</p>

        <p>“It was a good hockey game up and down the rink,” Babcock said. “We had opportunity, they had opportunity. They got the second point and we didn’t.”</p>
        <p>NOTES: Auston Matthews had two assists for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto/">Toronto</a>. … Both teams were playing the first game of a back-to-back. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-maple-leafs/">Leafs</a> winger Andreas Johnsson played the 100th game of his NHL career.</p>
