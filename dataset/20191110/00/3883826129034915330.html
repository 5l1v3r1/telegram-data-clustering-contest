      <h1>Marking the memories of a million service personnel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:18:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:18</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Beale</a></address>
      <p>The act of Remembrance takes place every day of the year for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.</p>
      <p>It works to maintain more than one million headstones and memorials in 154 countries around the world to mark those who died in World War One and World War Two.</p>
      <p>Tyne Cot cemetery near the town of Ypres in Belgium is where almost 12,000 soldiers who fought in World War One are buried.</p>

      <p>"We are probably the world's largest gardener," Peter Francis from the Commission says, with staff mowing the equivalent of 1,000 football pitches every week.</p>
      <p>The headstones are the same size surrounded by uniform lawns and flowers.</p>
      <p>The Commission says everyone who died is treated equally, adding it "doesn't matter whether you were killed in battle and awarded a Victoria Cross or whether you died from influenza".</p>

      <p>The Commission employs 13,000 staff around the world - many of them locals. Four generations of the Jaradah family have been tending the Gaza cemetery that dates from WW1.</p>
      <p>"I'm a son of the cemetery," Ibrahim, the youngest member of the family, says. "I've grown up with these men."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile it's a husband and wife team, Shadrack Paull and Lusia Axalte, that look after the cemetery at Morogoro in Tanzania.</p>

        <figcaption>There is something familiar but different about each site, the Commission says, with design often dictated by the climate<cite>CWGC</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ben More Assynt in north-west Scotland is the most remote war grave in the UK. In April 1941 an RAF Anson bomber crashed on the mountain killing all six crew on board.</p>
      <p>The grave was originally marked with a cairn, a man-made stack of stones, which deteriorated over time. In 2012 they flew in a new granite marker by RAF helicopter to replace the original stones.</p>

      <p>Continuing conflict can make the job of maintaining war graves more difficult.</p>
      <p>However, the Commission has recently managed to restore hundreds of graves at Habbaniya war cemetery, west of Baghdad in Iraq.</p>
      <p>There are 54,000 war dead remembered in Iraq alone.</p>

      <p>War-torn Yemen is another challenging location. The CWGC was recently informed of vandalism at the Maala cemetery in the south of the country.</p>
      <p>It says it has already made replacement grave markers, but is waiting for safe access to the site to carry out repairs.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Currently it is not considered safe for Commission staff to undertake the necessary repair work<cite>CWGC</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Encroachment is another problem. In Nairobi farmers have been using the Kariokor cemetery to dry cow hides for sale.</p>
      <p>The CWGC says it is working with local authorities to find a long-term solution.</p>

      <p>Though each cemetery has familiar themes with gardens and flowers, no two sites are exactly the same.</p>
      <p>Portland stone is often used for the headstones at the large cemeteries in Belgium and France while in Scotland granite is often used.</p>
      <p>In Turkey the graves are marked with plinths rather than headstones because of the harsher climate.</p>

      <p>"Remembrance is still a living, breathing process," says the CWGC.</p>
      <p>It recently completed a memorial in Abuja, Nigeria, commemorating more than 2,000 Nigerian nationals who lost their lives serving with Commonwealth forces.</p>
