      </figure>
      <p>At the age of 24, after losing her mom to breast cancer, Sarah Jane Douglas was struggling and often in trouble. When she decided to start climbing Scotland’s highest peaks in honor of her mother, her life turned around.</p>
      <p>This inspiring memoir follows her journeys as she ultimately becomes Munroist number 5764 (meaning she has climbed all of Scotland’s mountains that are more than 3,000 feet high). Douglas, who writes the popular blog, Smashing Cancer in the Face, is down-to-earth and relatable, and her book has a breezy tone that sucks you in. Her hillwalking actually grounds her and reminds all of us that sometimes all you can do is put one foot in front of the other and just keep going. Price: $16.53</p>

        <figcaption>Around the World in 80 Trains by Monisha Rajesh<cite>Lois Alter Mark</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Monisha Rajesh spent seven months circumnavigating the globe via rail with her fiancé, reliving the romance of train travel along with its quirkiness. Along the way, they meet a wild variety of passengers and learn valuable lessons in history, culture and patience.</p>
      <p>Because not every train is the luxurious Venice Simplon-Orient-Express on which they indulge in chicken oysters and damask sheets, the couple experience different levels of comfort and safety as they make their way from London to Russia to the United States. “Americans who have never ridden on their railways have no idea what they are missing,” writes Rajesh. Her first-hand account changes that and is likely to cause a surge in Amtrak ridership. Price: $28</p>
