      <h3>BITCOIN’S LONE WHALE?</h3>
      <p>Researchers have cast fresh doubt over whether<b> bitcoin's epic bull run</b> happened organically, suggesting it may have been caused by a single, large player <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/08/real-reason-behind-bitcoins-epic-rally-revealed/"><b>manipulating the bitcoin market</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to a new report, <b>an unidentified Bitfinex account</b> used <b>tether</b> to manipulate the bitcoin price between March 2017 and March 2018 by creating unprecedented demand for the digital token. Over that period, the total market value of bitcoin soared from <b>$16 billion</b> to <b>$326 billion</b>.</p>
      <h3>MICROSOFT’S DIGITAL MINT</h3>
      <p><b>Microsoft</b> is taking its secret platform for creating crypto tokens out for a test drive. The tech giant’s new crypto-assets mint lets enterprises <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/11/04/microsoft-to-help-enterprises-mint-their-own-ethereum-tokens/"><b>design, issue and manage a wide range of digital assets</b></a>. Several companies, including a video game outfit and a virtual reality platform, have already used the platform to create experimental tokens, while others like <b>General Electric</b> are waiting in the wings to create their own.</p>
      <p><b>Big picture:</b> Major companies like <b>JPMorgan</b> have already minted similar tokens, and Facebook is working with a group of companies like <b>Uber</b>, <b>Spotify</b> and <b>Vodaphone</b> on the Libra Project. Microsoft’s work, using the same standard as the other participating blockchain developers, could pave the way for an explosion of similar enterprise-grade tokens.</p>
      <h3>CRYPTO MARKETS</h3>
      <p><b>Stellar</b>, the tenth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw its price soar this week after the Stellar Development Foundation "burned" more than half the digital token's supply—<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/05/bitcoin-rival-stellar-suddenly-soars-after-shock-move/"><b>worth a staggering $4.7 billion</b></a>.</p>
      <p><b>Bitcoin</b> remained largely flat following the news, while other smaller tokens, including Ripple's <b>XRP</b>, rose slightly.</p>

      <h3>BLOCKCHAIN JOBS REPORT: POSTINGS UP, SEARCHES DOWN</h3>
      <p>Recent data gathered by popular employment site Indeed shows that over the past year, the share of blockchain and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminpirus/2019/11/07/bitcoin-and-blockchain-job-hunts-drop-53-over-past-year/"><b>cryptocurrency job postings is up more than 25%</b></a>, while the share of searches for those jobs has <b>fallen by more than half</b>. For the same period two years ago, Indeed saw a 14% bump these types of job searches.</p>
      <p>The companies with the most job blockchain and crypto job postings on Indeed over the past year were mainstream powerhouses like <b>Deloitte</b>, <b>IBM</b>, <b>Accenture</b> and <b>Cisco</b>. </p>
