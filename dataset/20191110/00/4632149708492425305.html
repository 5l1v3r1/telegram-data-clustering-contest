      <h1>Day one of the Bangalore Literature Festival, the city’s landmark literary outing, offered multiple views of the written and spoken word</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jayanthi Madhukar and Sowmya Rajaram</a></address>
      <p>Day 1 of the eight edition of Bangalore Literature Festival (BLF) began under the spectre of the Supreme Court’s impending final verdict on Ayodhya. It was almost fortuitous for the BLF that former chief bureau of BBC, Mark Tully, was a panellist. Tully was one of the first journalists to report on the demolition of Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. Just after the verdict, he commented, “It’s important that the verdict is not celebrated with triumphalism, and in that spirit, PM Modi’s statement that the verdict should not be seen as anybody’s win or defeat, was the right one.” When asked whether he agreed with the verdict, he said he could not comment, not having read it in the full. “I had thought that they would follow the Allahabad High Court judgment.” <br/><br/>The talk of the day also centered around Lucky Ali’s conspicuous absence. The singer was to have participated in the session Rudiments of Music with Rzhude David, and Flute Bhutto, but apparently communicated to the organisers that he was advised not to appear at the venue following the verdict. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, on the lawns of The Lalit Ashok, five distinct stages held back-to-back sessions on books, politics, economics, music, religion, folktales, the art of illustration and the craft of writing books. <br/><br/>The highlights of the day included the session on the late Girish Karnad, who passed away this year. His life and work were discussed in the panel titled Writer, Playwright, Humanist by veteran actress and creative director of Spandana, B Jayashree, Kannada writers Jayant Kaikini and K Marulasiddappa. Kaikini echoed the sentiments of Karnad’s fans when he commented, “In spite of Karnad being on oxygen during his last days, he was like ‘oxygen’ for us.” <br/><br/>The first session saw actor Pankaj Kapur read out from his debut book Dopehri. Answering a question from the audience, he said, “The book was written as a film because I wanted people to know that I can make one. But I didn’t realise that what I wrote was literature.” <br/><br/>Ex-McKinsey CEO Rajat Gupta’s crowded session was titled Mind Without Fear, also the title of his autobiography about his arrest for insider trading in 2012. Gupta said, “It is relatively easy in hindsight to question my choices but I regret that I did not testify at my trial. I also regret not having resigned from Goldman Sachs when I said I would. I take full responsibility for these.” <br/><br/>The late Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Congress politician and MP Shashi Tharoor, was the focus of the session by journalist Sunanda Mehta and author Ravi Subramanian. Mehta has penned the book The Extraordinary Life and Death of Sunanda Pushkar. Incidentally, the two Sunandas were schoolmates at Ambala and Jhansi. Asked if her friend’s death was a suicide or not, Mehta said, “Sunanda loved life and had seen worse ups and downs. She really loved her son Shiv, so I don’t believe it was a suicide.” Mehta also commented on Tharoor’s refusal to answer any of her questions for the book because it was sub-judice, adding that she hadn’t seen the 3,000-paged chargesheet because of Tharoor moving the court to not make it available to the public. <br/><br/>Journalist Ed Luce and author Keshava Guha made a tantalising comparison between Narendra Modi and Donald Trump at the session Making sense of Trump. According to Luce, the Sangh Parivar and the RSS’s “longer-term rewriting project” makes PM Modi a “much bigger threat globally to liberal democracy than Trump”. The damage done by Trump, Luce believes, “could be undone”, because the “courts are still independent, as is the media”. <br/><br/>Making a case for freedom of expression at the Looking for Miss Sargam session, singer Shubha Mudgal answered a question on whether new-age musicians were tampering with classical music traditions, “India is so diverse. There are people writing what some might call inane, and there’s beautiful poetry. They should all <br/><br/>get the chance to be sung. There should be peaceful coexistence.” <br/><br/>Acid attack survivor Reshma Qureshi who wrote her memoir Being Reshma with Tania Singh rued the fact that even today two of her attackers roamed free. Author Vikram Sampath made the case for a more nuanced reading of Veer Savarkar in Savarkar: Misunderstood Messiah. He also spoke of the torture Savarkar (and others) endured at Kala Pani and questioned the narrative of ‘Savarkar as a coward who wrote a mercy petition’. <br/><br/>A hot day turned into a cool evening with a concert by Manasi and friends. Day One also had the LitMart running on the sidelines. Three, one-hour sessions on the final pitches of aspiring authors were heard by a jury. And an almost separate festival for children, with two stages within the premises, conducted storytelling and activities.</p>
