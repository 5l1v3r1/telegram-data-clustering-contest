        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liliana Segre, who at the tender age of 13 was sent to Auschwitz, is credited with the creation of a parliamentary committee against hate, racism and anti-Semitism in Italy. She’s now under police protection after receiving online and offline anti-Semitic threats (“Auschwitz survivor becomes symbol of tensions in Italy,” Web, Nov. 7).</p>
      <p>This is one of many all-too-frequent examples of anti-Semitism both at home and abroad. The world of hatred we now inhabit saddens and angers me. Like many, I awake daily worrying and fearing how much worse things might get, and go to bed emotionally depleted. I hope we can stop circling the drain — that rationality and humanity will prevail. Some have advised me for sake of mental tranquility and peace of mind to simply stop watching. Alas, I cannot. As Elie Wiesel reminds us: “For the dead and the living, we must bear witness. For not only are we responsible for the memories of the dead, we are also responsible for what we are doing with those memories.”</p>
      <p>All I can do is keep bearing witness, being mindful of the Serenity Prayer: “Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I should, and wisdom to know the difference.”</p>
