      <p>The Only Watch auction has been held biennially since 2005, with 100% of proceeds going to benefit research towards a cure for <a href="https://www.mda.org/disease/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy">Duchenne muscular dystrophy</a>, a genetic disorder that strikes children. To date, Only auctions have raised more than $40 million, but today’s sale will add CHF 38,593,000 to that total. The auction was started by Luc Pettavino after his son, Paul, was diagnosed with the disease and passed away in 2016 at the age of 21. Luc Pettavino received the Special Jury prize at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève two days ago. Here are the top five watches from today’s sale:</p>
