      <p>The two best <i>League of Legends</i> teams in the world, G2 Esports and FunPlus Phoenix, will compete in the <i>League of Legends</i> World Championship final later today, and you can watch all of the action live on Twitch and YouTube. Both teams have been competing to reach this stage for almost a month, and now stand on the edge of becoming World Champions for the first time. G2 headed into the competition as one of the favourites after winning the Mid Season Invitational earlier in the year, while FunPlus Phoenix were also in the conversation, but certainly more of an outside favourite to make it this far. </p>
      <p>G2 and FunPlus Phoenix are in Paris, France, ready to compete in the final at the Accorhotels Arena with a packed crowd. The best of five matchup will determine who becomes a world champion and who goes home disappointed. </p>
      <p>The broadcast for the final gets underway at 12 CEST, 11am GMT, 6am EST, and 3am PST, with the pre show, which will be followed by the opening ceremony, which is always worth a watch, around an hour later. The actual in game action is expected to kick off shortly after the opening ceremony. </p>
      <p>With this being a best of five series the action could theoretically be over within three hours, or it could go as long as six plus hours depending on how long the games are and how close the overall series is. </p>
      <p>You will be able to watch all of the action live on both <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/riotgames">Twitch</a> and YouTube for free. </p>
      <p>G2’s journey to the final has already seen them take down all three Korean teams who were all expected to do well in the competition. In the group stage they took a map off Griffin, before beating DAMWON Gaming 3-1 in the quarter final and then beating three time world champions SK Telecom T1 3-1 in the semi final. They have looked very impressive at Worlds, and will undoubtedly be the crowd favourite playing in their home region. </p>
      <p>FunPlus Phoenix topped what was arguably the easiest group in the competition, but then went on to take down last year’s runner up Fnatic in the quarter finals with a 3-1 score and then last year’s world champions Invictus Gaming in the semi finals with another 3-1 win. They will now be hoping to take down the MSI champions to prove that they really have beaten all the major challengers to the title at Worlds.</p>
