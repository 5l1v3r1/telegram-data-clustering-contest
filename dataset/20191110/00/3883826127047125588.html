        <b>The killer of a woman who was murdered 25 years ago has been urged to "search your conscience" by police.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shona Stevens was savagely attacked in broad daylight 200 yards (180m) from her home in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1994.</p>
      <p>Ms Stevens, 31, suffered "horrific injuries" and died three days later.</p>
      <p>Her mother and her daughter, who was only seven at the time, joined police in marking the anniversary with a fresh appeal for information.</p>
      <p>Asked if he had a message for the killer, Det Supt Paul Livingstone said: "It has been 25 years. It is a huge burden. Shona's family have endured this for too long now. Do the right thing and come forward."</p>

      <p>On Thursday 10 November, 1994, Ms Stevens left the Co-op at Bourtreehill Shopping Centre and was last seen alone on Towerlands Road at 13:10.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes later her body was found in bushes near a footpath, close to the rear of her home in Alder Green in the Bourtreehill Park area.</p>
      <p>Det Supt Livingstone described the attack as "vicious and frenzied".</p>
      <p>He said: "Her family have had to endure this for too long now. That's why we are having this appeal 25 years on, because I firmly believe that the answer lies in the local community."</p>
      <p>Officers believe a weapon was involved but it was never recovered.</p>
      <p>Det Supt Livingstone also said the inquiry team were keeping an open mind as to a motive for the crime.</p>
      <p>He would not disclose whether officers had a DNA profile of the suspect but said technology was constantly creating new forensic opportunities.</p>
      <p>During the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-27348203">Elaine Doyle murder trial</a> in 2014 a court heard that convicted killer Gavin McGuire was interviewed in connection with Ms Stevens' murder.</p>

      <p>Despite extensive media coverage, including a reconstruction of Ms Stevens' final movements, the suspect has so far evaded justice.</p>
      <p>The senior detective also encouraged anyone who knew the identity of Ms Stevens' attacker to consider the devastating impact the crime has had on her family, especially her daughter.</p>
      <p>He said: "Shona was a young mother who was subject to an unprovoked attack that has left her family devastated and we want to trace those responsible.</p>
      <p>"I think everyone can assume for themselves what it must have been like for any child to grow up without a parent.</p>
      <p>"That to me is all the catalyst that anyone should need that, if they have any information, to come forward and tell us about that."</p>
      <p>He added: "This is very much an open case and we will keep working away until we find who is responsible and bring them to justice."</p>
      <p>He said the footpath where Ms Stevens was found was regularly used by the public to access Bourtreehill Shopping Centre.</p>

        <figcaption>Shona's mother, Mhairi Smith, issued an emotional appeal to the media a week after the murder in November 1994</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>As part of the new appeal Ms Stevens' family issued brief statements through Police Scotland.</p>
      <p>Daughter Candice, who is now one year older than her late mother, said: "I was only seven at the time of my mum's murder but that does not make it any easier to deal with.</p>
      <p>"I spent a large part of my childhood years growing up without my mum and I would please ask anyone who knows anything about the incident to please come forward."</p>
      <p>The victim's mother Mhairi Smith said: "It has been 25 years since Shona was taken from us and we are still as hopeful as ever that those responsible for her murder can be brought to justice.</p>
      <p>"I cannot emphasise enough how important even the smallest piece of information could be in being able to give me and my family closure.</p>
      <p>"I want to know who was responsible for this attack and why they did it. If you have any information about Shona and her murder please contact the police."</p>
