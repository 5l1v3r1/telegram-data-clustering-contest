      <p>The ridiculously swanky suite has THREE en-suite bedrooms, a lounge with a pool table, its very own state-of-the-art cinema room, and even its own lift.</p>

      <p>Wondering what the price tag is on the room? Well, it's completely free - although it is reserved for 'high rollers' aka ultra-rich gamblers who have been known to bet millions of pounds over a weekend.</p>
      <p>As for the activities? There's no risk of guests twiddling their thumbs.</p>

      <p>In fact, the resort boasts its very own casino and full-service spa, while sports fans have a plethora of activities to choose from including golf courses, the Racquet Club, water sports, a gym, fitness classes, croquet, basketball and heaps more.</p>
      <p>Everything about the resort is lavish - even the pool parties where waitresses soak the guests in champagne, and you need to spend at least $300 on food and drink if you want to use a deckchair (for the cabanas, that minimum spend can jump up to $3,500).</p>

      <p>Even the restaurants can be the ideal place for over-indulging. The resort's exclusive steakhouse has a 1.5kg steak 'The Tomahawk' which costs $265 - but you get it completely free if you can finish the whole thing by yourself.</p>
