      <h1>Puel revival goes on as Saint-Etienne beats Nantes to go 3rd</h1>

      <p>PARIS (AP) - Resurgent Saint-Etienne twice came from behind to win 3-2 at Nantes on Sunday and move into third place in the French league under new coach Claude Puel.</p>
      <p>Saint-Etienne has not lost since former Leicester coach Puel took charge five weeks ago with the club mired in the relegation zone, and won a hard-fought encounter with two goals from striker Denis Bouanga.</p>
      <p>The match featured two storied French sides sharing 18 league titles - a national record 10 for Saint-Etienne - but none since Nantes was crowned champion in 2001.</p>
      <p>After Ludovic Blas gave the home side the lead in the 15th minute, Peruvian defender Miguel Trauco leveled seven minutes later. An action-packed first half saw Imran Louza restore the lead for Nantes in the 26th after being assisted by fellow midfielder Blas, only for Trauco to set up Bouanga for a header in the 34th.</p>
      <p>Bounga also scored the winner last weekend against Monaco, and this time latched onto playmaker Ryad Boudebouz’s clever pass behind the defense in the 67th.</p>

      <p>Puel’s side is behind second-place Angers on goal difference, with both teams trailing nine points behind league leader Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
      <p>Later Sunday, nine-time champion Marseille could move into second place with a home win against seven-time champion Lyon - which has won the past five league meetings between them.</p>
      <p>OTHER MATCHES</p>
      <p>Striker Gaetan Laborde grabbed his first goal of the season as Montpellier beat struggling Toulouse 3-0 to climb into fifth place, with the home side’s other goals coming from midfielders Damien Le Tallec and Teji Savanier.</p>

        <p>Rennes moved up to 10th place with a 3-1 home win against Amiens, which took the lead in the 35th minute through striker Serhou Guirassy.</p>
        <p>Midfielder Adrien Hunou equalized four minutes later and striker Mbaye Niang put the Brittany-based side ahead in the 62nd before Brazilian forward Raphinha added a late penalty.</p>
        <p>Defending champion PSG won 2-1 away to Brest on Saturday in a scrappy performance.</p>
