      <h1>New Surface Details Confirm Microsoft’s Louder Sound</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ewan Spence</a></address>
      <p>Following the innovation packed into the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-x/8vdnrp2m6hhc?activetab=overview">Surface Pro X</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-laptop-3/8vfggh1r94tm?activetab=overview">Surface Laptop 3</a>, what is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> planning for the next generation of Surface hardware? As always, the published patents from the R&amp;D teams at Redmond give us a pretty good idea, and it sounds like the Surface Pro could receive an audible upgrade. The recently published patent, titled “<a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20190335258.pdf">Expandable Enclosure For Electronic Device Resonance Box</a>” describes a way to increase the effectiveness of a speaker. <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2019/11/05/surface-pro-louder-and-advanced-speakers/">Mayank Parmar has taken a closer look</a>:</p>
      <p>"The idea described in the patent would definitely make sense and it could significantly improve the speaker quality of thin devices like Surface Pro.</p>
      <p>“An electronic device, comprises a display and an expandable enclosure positioned opposite the display. The expandable enclosure is operable between at least a closed configuration and an open configuration, such that in the open configuration, the expandable enclosure defines faces of a resonance box,” the filing reads.” </p>

      <p>Naturally, the appearance of a patent does not mean that a feature will be included in the retail release - and a glance at the specifications of the newly announced Surface hardware shows that it is not present.</p>
      <p>But a second glade at the new Surace hardware shows that the internal design is changing. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+X+Teardown/127703">The Surface Pro X</a> is geared towards easier repair and includes an easily removed SSD, while <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Laptop+3+(15-inch)+Teardown/127277">the Surface Laptop 3’s key components</a> (such as the screen and the keyboard) are also easier to switch out by an authorised repair centre.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/surface-pro-7/8n17j0m5zzqs?activetab=overview">Surface Pro 7</a> has not received as extensive a redesign as the Laptop 3 or picked up the features that have arrived in the Surface X. I’d expect the customer feedback to influence the presumptively named Surface Pro 8 to carry the same repairability influence.</p>
      <p>And that redesign leaves scope for hardware features such as the aforementioned speaker.</p>
