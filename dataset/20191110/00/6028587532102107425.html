      <h1>New Content Platform From China Tries Out Nasdaq</h1>

      <p>For some understanding of how heated the Chinese startup market has been, consider that a China-founded media platform covering the action, 36Kr Holdings, went after a Nasdaq listing only nine years after its founding in Beijing by a first-time entrepreneur Chengcheng Liu. Liu told me he went for the trophy IPO in the U.S. for “improving our brand image.” He acknowledged that it is a tough time for Chinese companies to go public in New York, considering the ongoing tensions over trade and tech power between the two superpowers China and the U.S.</p>
      <p>The going public move was a bold one for the 30-year-old, who has seen dozens of Chinese startups he’s covered over the years go down the same road. His own move paid off, sort of. His startup filed to raise $57.6 million but slashed the offering size and tumbled by 10 percent in its Nasdaq debut to end up raising $20 million. That’s a small sum compared with the $50 million in venture capital that 36KR has taken in from investors including subsidiaries of China’s ride-sharing leader Didi Chuxing and smart phone and smart device maker Xiaomi as well as Matrix Partners China and Infinity Ventures.</p>
      <p>The business as a standalone media operation covering China’s new economy probably wouldn’t have made nearly this far except for a 2017 transition to business services. Its model has switched to providing news and commentary and also selling data to companies and offering consulting instead of relying on advertising revenues and subscriptions – the traditional business models for media. With managers still trying to figure out China or enter the market, such business services has become a fast-growing business.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of the company’s revenues come from business services that can help large companies connect with newly established entrants, Liu said. He added that 36Kr has been profitable for four years, and has grown to 470 staffers in China, Singapore and Japan.</p>
      <p>Not all of its new operations have worked out so well. For instance, 36Kr got into the co-working space and opened Kr Space, but has since closed several locations and cut staff in this overheated sector.</p>
      <p>One key to the company’s scale is that the founding team don’t come from media backgrounds but rather have a stronger foundation in technology. That has helped 36Kr see the new opportunities in platforms such as in Chinese social media and news platforms WeChat, Weibo and Toutiao.</p>
      <p>In today’s tech-oriented economy, it doesn’t matter so much what career training or education founders have today. Seemingly anyone can create content or become a media commentator. It matters more how to leverage technology to gain an advantage. It also helps to have China’s fast growth as a lever.</p>
      <p>The founder of 36Kr received his bachelor's degree in communication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2010 and his master's degree in data mining from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2014.</p>
      <p>The next step will be how to move to the next level. Its Twitter feed in Chinese has slightly more than 9400 followers but most of its content is on Chinese app WeChat.</p>
