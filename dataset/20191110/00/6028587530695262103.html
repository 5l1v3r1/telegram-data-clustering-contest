      <h1>Smithsonian Channel Documentary On Famed ‘Memphis Belle,’ WWII B-17 Bomber, Debuts Tonight, Features Newly Restored Footage</h1>

      <p>Smithsonian Channel continues its annual initiative honoring Veterans Month with a new special airing tonight, <a href="https://www.smithsonianchannel.com/shows/memphis-belle-in-color/0/3475928"><i>Memphis Belle in Color</i></a><i>.</i>This tells the story of the famed <i>Memphis Belle</i> – a B-17 bomber plane that became a symbol of the Allies’ desperate fight against the German Luftwaffe during WWII – with vibrant color footage of the iconic aircraft in combat.</p>
      <p>The documentary examines the role that B-17 bombers, nicknamed “Flying Fortresses,” played across airborne battlefields.</p>
      <p>By the summer of 1942, American B-17 airmen were facing chaotic, deadly and frigid battles at altitudes of five miles with a paltry 25 percent survival rate.</p>

      <p>The B-17 <i>Memphis Belle</i> and her 10 crew members managed to beat these odds, becoming the first B-17 to earn a trip home. They were also the focus of William Wyler’s 1944 film, <i>Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress</i>. </p>
      <p>The documentary uses newly-restored 4K footage from this iconic film to uncover the story of the famed plane and the contribution of B-17 bombers to victory in the war. Veterans of B-17 missions tell their hair-raising, first-person tales of combat, while the film also explores the full restoration of the <i>Memphis Belle</i> at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The restored plane was placed on <a href="https://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Upcoming/Boeing-B-17F-Memphis-Belle-Exhibit-Opening-May-17-2018/">permanent display</a> at the museum last year.</p>
      <p>According to the museum, the Memphis Belle was chosen by the United States Army Air Force for a highly publicized war bond tour from June to August 1943, “and its crew was celebrated as national heroes. The aircraft and crew were also the subject of two widely-seen Hollywood movies,” <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036152/">Wyler’s </a>in 1944, and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100133/">another in 1990</a>.</p>
      <p>In an interview last week, John Hampton Luckadoo, a 97-and-a- half-year-old Allied B-17 pilot, said it was impossible for the documentary to convey “the horrendous cold” he and other pilots “endured at high altitudes in unpressurized cabins. We‘d sit for hour after hour in minus-50 to 60 degree weather and have to function. That’s really not portrayable in a documentary film.”</p>
      <p>He said he and other pilots wore electric underwear under their flight suits and used sheepskin lined flying equipment, but “oftentimes this did not function.”</p>
      <p>“Ironically, in the heat of the battle, we perspired profusely. The moisture froze constantly and blocked the flow of oxygen. I prayed a lot and hoped the conditions would change pretty soon, that I could get to a lower altitude.”</p>
      <p>One thing that stood out, he said, ‘was the extremely low possibility that a crew could complete 25 missions without getting shot down. The odds were so slim, it was almost inevitable you couldn’t finish your tour.”</p>
      <p>Of the 40 members of his class at the Twin Engine Flight School in Valdosta, Ga., only four, including him completed their tours, hence his nickname “Lucky.”.</p>
      <p>Luckadoo said he was “pleased” the Smithsonian Channel documentary was made, since he believes it will provide future generations “some understanding of what took place for the defense of freedom.”</p>
      <p>A retired Denver real estate developer now living in Dallas, Luckadoo is the namesake of <a href="https://www.flightmuseum.com/luckadoo-annual-lecture/">an annual lecture</a> at the Frontiers of Flight Museum in Dallas. Endowed by his daughter and son, the lecture allows guest speakers to share their experiences about aviation and space flight with students, as part of the museum’s commitment to STEM education.</p>
      <p>Luckadoo left college to serve in the USAAF after the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. He graduated from flight school in February 1943 and was assigned to the 100<sup>th</sup> Bomb Group, which flew B-17 heavy bombers. </p>
      <p>On one particularly dangerous mission he bombed the German industrial city of Bremen; of the 18 planes sent out that day, only six returned. Bullet holes in the fuselage of Luckadoo’s plane let in so much freezing air he developed frostbite in both feet and struggled to get the plane back to England.</p>
