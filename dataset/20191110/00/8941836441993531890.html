      <p>DENVER (AP) - The early season snowstorms that hit the Rocky Mountain region this fall have boosted snowpack levels between two and three times the average.</p>
      <p>A U.S. Department of Agriculture report shows snow water equivalent above 150% and 200% of average throughout Idaho, northern Colorado and western Montana. Those levels are also scattered across Wyoming and parts of northern Utah.</p>
      <p>The highest snowpack levels are in northern Colorado, with some areas reporting three times the normal snowpack for early November and ski resorts opening earlier than usual.</p>
      <p>The Denver Post reports that the snowpack statewide is 212% of average, though parts of southwestern Colorado are below average.</p>
      <p>Even with the snow, most of Colorado and Utah and part of Wyoming is experiencing dry or drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monito r.</p>
