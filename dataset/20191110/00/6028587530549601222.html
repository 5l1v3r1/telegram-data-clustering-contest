      <h1>A Timely ‘Bible’ For Women</h1>

      <p>It’s more than passing strange that in an age of so much scientific and medical progress so many people remain in the dark about the science of their own private parts. That this can be a cause of embarrassment is one of the least of the harmful consequences of such ignorance. As Dr. Jen Gunter makes clear in her new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vagina-Bible-Vulva-Separating-Medicine/dp/0806539313/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=FZ16Z91VLQXF&amp;keywords=the+vagina+bible&amp;qid=1573145672&amp;sprefix=The+Vagina+Bible%2Caps%2C140&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVVNUQk5FUU5PSFImZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA1NjYzMzlQRFdJNUpOQVdYU1cmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMTAwODA5NTQwMUtDUzZWSVhQRCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">The Vagina Bible</a>, women in particular have suffered a great deal of anguish over the centuries, and her no-nonsense guide to vaginal health is an attempt (if I may appropriate the phrase from an entirely different context) to stand athwart history and yell ‘Enough!’</p>

      <p>Gunter, an obstetrician and gynecologist, writes a regular column on women’s health for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/style/my-vagina-is-terrific-your-opinion-about-it-is-not.html">New York Times</a>, and she maintains a lively <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJenGunter">Twitter</a> feed.</p>
      <p>“It is very difficult in our society to have non-sophomoric discussions about sex,” she writes. “Because of this, it is women who typically suffer. Female anatomy is erroneously labeled as ‘dirty,’ and from an early age, girls are given messages about what a patriarchal society has determined a ‘nice’ girl should and should not do.”</p>
      <p>Gunter writes with a sense of humor–sometimes understandably rueful–as when she notes how historical ignorance of female anatomy contrasted with the male’s. “Most ancient physicians, probably like many other males of the time, were unsure of the role of the clitoris and likely thought it unimportant. This stands in sharp contrast to the anatomic glory of the penis.” Such neglect was not confined to medicine. “Think about all those ancient Greek statues with defined scrotum and penises... The vulvas of the time were but mysterious mounds concealed by crossed legs.”</p>
      <p>Gunter’s book really is a bible of sorts, as it devotes separate sections to the basic medical facts of the vulva, the vagina, pregnancy and childbirth, menopause, sexually transmitted infections, as well as recommendations an advice about exercise, skin care, even diet–each chapter ending with convenient ‘Bottom Line’ summaries.</p>
      <p>And last but not least, Gunter devotes a chapter to the myths and ‘Old Wives Tales’ about female sexuality and health that still persist even in the medical profession. Indeed, it’s amazing to learn what kind of things a woman is encouraged to do to herself for the promise of improved health.</p>
      <p>For example: coffee enemas? “Dear God, no,” Gunter writes. “People, even some doctors promote this to treat depression! I. Just. Can’t Even. First of all, this is a waste of good coffee. Medically speaking, to believe coffee in your rectum could treat anything is ludicrous. I mean, why doesn’t drinking it have the same effect? It is a rabbit hole of epic proportions.”</p>
      <p>Then there’s the supposed promise of placing magnets next to the vagina to treat hot flashes: “Just clip in your underwear and go! Therapeutic magnets are a multibillion dollar industry and there is no evidence they do anything but lighten your wallet.”</p>
      <p>My favorite old chestnut: drinking eight glasses of water per day, a myth which persists in spite of the best efforts of doctors to kill it. “What everyone forgot,” Gunter writes, “is that calculation also included the water that we take in with food–which is how we get most of our water. Just drink when you’re thirsty.”</p>
      <p>That Gunter has been attacked for blowing up so many myths and misinformation about female anatomy and health is perhaps the best reason a book like hers is so timely. “To me, the idea that women can take away what serves them from the morass of half-truths and lies about their bodies is the greatest perversion of choice. True choice–weighing your personal risk-benefit ratio and making a decision for your body on that information–requires facts. And it is this quest to give women facts that keeps me up at night.”</p>
      <p>Highly recommended. And yes, men will get almost as much–perhaps even more–from reading it.</p>
