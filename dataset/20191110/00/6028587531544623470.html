      <h1>UK Gets Fourth Dolby Cinema Screen As Odeon Luxe Birmingham Opens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Benny Har-Even</a></address>
      <p>Dolby has announced that the fourth Dolby Cinema in the UK is now open, with Birmingham the latest city to gain the premium format screen. As with all its other screens the opening is again in conjunction with Odeon Luxe and the Dolby screen is located in the Broadway Plaza complex. The news shows how the mighty Dolby train is continuing to roll in the UK. Dolby Cinema first arrived on UK shores at the end of last year at the Odeon Leicester Square, following a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bennyhareven/2019/02/24/odeon-and-dolby-cinema-join-forces-to-take-on-imax/#65c77b4c5d8e">long refurbishment of the flagship cinema</a>, and the second opening was at the Odeon Luxe in Leeds, which I had the fortune to visit and led me to ask if it was, “the best cinema in the UK”. The Old Trafford Centre in Manchester was the third venue to gain a Dolby screen, and Birmingham rounds off Dolby’s expansion plans for 2019.</p>

      <p>So, what's all the fuss about Dolby Cinema you may ask? On a technical level, the format combines two key Dolby technologies; Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. The former refers to proprietary laser-based projection technology that offers unrivalled brightness (31-foot lamberts in 2D and 14-foot lamberts in 3D if you’re asking). This is combined with high dynamic range, delivering the greatest range between white and black with the deepest, truest blacks, the widest color gamut and the highest contrast ratio you can get in a cinema. In other words, the picture is amazing.</p>
      <p>Dolby Atmos audio meanwhile is an “object-based” format’ that can place sounds at any point in a circle around you thanks to numerous speakers located in front, at the sides and above you. In other words, the sound is amazing.</p>
      <p>All this tech is combined with custom-designed theaters with décor optimised for the best viewing experience. In other words, the seats are amazing.</p>
      <p>The tech is also capable of showing films in advanced new formats such as high frame rate (HFR) as used by recent films such as <i>Gemini Man</i>, (and you can read what I thought about that experience here).</p>

      <p>The overall aim of Dolby Cinema then is to create a cinematic experience that is dramatically better than what the vast majority of people will have in their homes–to create that truly immersive experience that directors aim for, while from the cinema chain’s perspective it should translate to more bums on seats.</p>
      <p>The Birmingham Dolby screen is located in screen 3 at the <a href="https://www.odeon.co.uk/cinemas/birmingham_broadway_plaza/212/">Odeon Broadway Plaza</a> and at the time of writing is showing <i>Joker</i>. Audiences can look forward to upcoming major releases to be shown there such as <i>Frozen 2</i> and <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>.</p>
      <p>Dolby revealed that it has seven screens planned for an initial rollout in the UK, so by an incredible feat of deduction, we can expect three more to arrive in 2020. While I’m hoping, (for not selfish reasons at all of course), that one opens in the Watford area, it seems more likely that with the South, the North and now the Midlands covered, that Wales or Scotland might be next. We shall wait and see.</p>
