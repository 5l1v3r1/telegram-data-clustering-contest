      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - Honolulu officials say they want to remake a deteriorating war memorial facility into an open circulation, saltwater pool.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu Star-<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/advertiser/">Advertiser</a> reported Sunday that the city designated the plan as a preferred option for redeveloping the site of the Waikiki War Memorial Natatorium.</p>
      <p>The facility opened in 1927 as a monument to Hawaii residents who served during World War I, but closed in 1979 due to disrepair.</p>
      <p>The city designated the plan as a preferred option in a final environmental impact statement released to the public Friday.</p>
      <p>The statement estimates a construction price of $31.8 million, including management and engineering costs.</p>

      <p>The city council must approve a special use permit and funding.</p>
