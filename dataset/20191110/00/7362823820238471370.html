      <h1>April Ryan clashes with actor Isaiah Washington over GOP candidate running for Cummings' old seat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:15:26+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Dorman</a></address>
      <p>CNN commentator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/april-ryan-politicon-clash-press-enemy">April Ryan</a> clashed with actor Isaiah Washington Saturday after Washington appeared to mock her while defending a Republican woman running for the Baltimore House seat held by the late <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-elijah-e-cummings-dead-at-68">Rep. Elijah Cummings</a>.</p>
      <p>Their exchange started after Kimberly Klacik, a Republican strategist, announced on Fox News that she would enter the special election. President Trump put a spotlight on Klacik over the summer by retweeting her videos of Baltimore's living conditions, serving as fuel for his criticisms of the now-deceased congressman at the time.</p>
      <p>Ryan was apparently not happy about Klacik's work, tweeting on Saturday that she was responsible for the fiery feud between Cummings and the president.</p>
      <p>"This is the woman who created all the controversy that made <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a> go after <a href="https://twitter.com/RepCummings">@RepCummings</a> and Baltimore. Cummings never got over the attack on him and the city," she said. "It is all because of her."</p>

      <p>Washington, who said earlier this year that he had <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/greys-anatomy-star-isaiah-washington-opens-up-about-decision-to-leave-the-democratic-party">"walked away" from the Democratic Party</a>, responded with a sarcastic tweet claiming that Ryan's apparent criticism helped boost Klacik's electoral prospects.</p>
      <p>"Way to go <a href="https://twitter.com/AprilDRyan">@AprilDRyan</a> ! You have just given <a href="https://twitter.com/kimKBaltimore">@kimKBaltimore</a> the massive attention she needed not only for her campaign announcement and fundraising, but ‘this’ tweet will most likely ensure her WIN," he said.</p>

      <p>"Your sarcasm is just as entertaining as your performance in Love Jones!" Ryan tweeted in response, referring to a 1997 film in which Washington <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119572/">starred</a>.</p>
      <p>Ryan also joked that Washington was letting her know how much power she possessed as a media figure.</p>

      <p>Klacik, for her part, retweeted Washington's criticism of Ryan as well as his <a href="https://twitter.com/IWashington/status/1193276142666432512">endorsement</a> of her. She also seemed to dismiss Ryan, saying she would leave the CNN analyst and others to bicker and gossip "amongst themselves."</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"America's News HQ: Weekend"</a> with host Ed Henry, Klacik said that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrats</a> talk about everything but helping black neighborhoods and "actively vote against things that offer the black community more opportunities."</p>

      <p>She added that Democrats put the needs of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants">illegal immigrants</a> ahead of the needs of United States citizens -- adding that living conditions on the border "were better than the living conditions in some areas of West Baltimore." "That has to end," she said.</p>
      <p>She also called for changes in Washington, specifically criticizing socialism and the "Squad" of progressive freshman lawmakers.</p>
      <p>"First of all, they're not getting any work done -- if we're going to be honest," she told Henry. "But also, we need stronger <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/senate/republicans">Republican</a> voices against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/socialism">socialism</a>, against the 'Squad'...just helping with his policies and draining the swamp. And I think, honestly, the American people need stronger voices on transparency within <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress">Congress</a>."</p>
