      <p>The long-running beef between KSI and Logan Paul will finally be settled in the ring.</p>
      <p>But unlike the last time they faced off, the stakes are even higher - and that is because they have entered the world of professional boxing.</p>
      <p>The last time the two faced off, it was purely as an amateur fight but they have decided to raise the stakes for their fight this evening after getting their licences to approved.</p>
      <p>It means that the head guards have been lost, the gloves are lighter and the difficulty levels go through the roof for both men when they step through the ropes.</p>
      <p>Here is all the key rules for the fight...</p>

      <h3>How many rounds are they fighting?</h3>
      <p>The fight between KSI and Logan Paul is scheduled for six rounds.</p>
      <p>It is the professional debuts of both men and the California State Athletic Commission has granted them the six round fight.</p>
      <p>The pair fought for six rounds in the first staging of the fight, although that was with head guards and heavier gloves due to the amateur status of the fight.</p>
      <h3>How can they win the fight?</h3>
      <p>For those not familiar with professional boxing, you can win either by having the fight stopped, or on the judges scorecards.</p>
      <p>The judges only come into play at the end of the six rounds, should the fight go the distance.</p>
      <p>A referee will be in the ring and will stop the fight if he feels either fighter is in no state to continue, or if one of the fighter's corners throws in the towel.</p>
      <p>If a fighter is knocked to the ground, they have 10 seconds to prove they are in a state to continue or the referee will wave off the fight and declare the other competitor the winner.</p>
      <h3>What size gloves are they wearing?</h3>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul will be fighting with 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>They are two ounces lighter than the ones that they used when they wore head guards 12 months ago.</p>
      <h3>What weight class is the fight?</h3>
      <p>Both men are fighting in the cruiserweight division.</p>
      <p>That means they will be around 200lbs in weight.</p>
      <h3>What time is the fight going to start?</h3>
      <p>The ring walks are scheduled for just after 4am UK time.</p>
      <p>It means the fight will begin about 20 past.</p>
