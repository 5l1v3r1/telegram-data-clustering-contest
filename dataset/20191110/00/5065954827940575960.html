      <p>CLARK FREEPORT—Leading industry enabler of digital solutions ePLDT Inc., together with PLDT Clarktel, officially launched what is probably the biggest disaster recovery facility in Asia here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The VITRO Clark DR Site was launched as the first stand-alone disaster recovery (DR) facility in North Luzon to service Philippine enterprises.</p>
      <p>Strategically located beside the VITRO Clark Data Center along Gil Puyat Avenue here, the site is the country’s largest DR facility and probably in Asia, boasting of an expansive 6,909-square-meter floor area, according to PLDT Clarktel Chief Operating Officer Lito Mercado.</p>
      <p>With Clark composed of several business and transit hubs, such as the Clark Special Economic Zone, Clark Freeport Zone, and the Clark International Airport, it continues to rise as a premier business and tourist destination—attracting both local and foreign investors alike.</p>
      <p>Clark is also among the cities cited by the government as a recovery site in the national contingency plan—making it an ideal location for the DR site. </p>
      <p>Through this world-class facility, the ePLDT Group promised to support the business continuity efforts of enterprises in the country—offering services such as data backup and alternative office spaces.</p>
      <p>Enterprises interested in fortifying their disaster-recovery plans can choose from the facility’s dedicated or shared seats—with the former providing companies with an office space that mirrors their current headquarters, and the latter providing a more cost-efficient space, shared with other tenants.</p>
      <p>While the site can initially house 246 DR seats, it is set to expand to over 2,300 throughout its continued development, with the mission of becoming the top-of-mind backup facility for enterprises.</p>
      <p>It also boasts of the same features that are a signature of ePLDT’s VITRO Data Centers—being seismic zone 4-compliant, making it able to withstand earthquakes of up to intensity 8; having a N+1 Genset Configuration meant to ensure operational continuity in the event of power failures; and 24/7 physical security and customer support.</p>
      <p>“We at ePLDT recognize that disaster recovery is a top priority for our customers, which is why we are fortifying our capabilities to ensure that we provide them with the means to safeguard their operations at all costs,” said ePLDT President and CEO Jovy Hernandez.</p>
      <p>“With the launch of our VITRO DR Site in Clark, we make it easier for our customers to enable their business continuity and resiliency plans. This is in line with our mission of simplifying the complex for our customers,” he added.</p>
      <p>ePLDT Chairman of the Board Al Panlilio said the launch of the DR Site embodies the PLDT group’s mission of nation-building.</p>
      <p>“We have always believed that our business goes beyond ICT and digital services. We’re providing our customers with solutions that will improve their operations and in turn, allow them to better serve their customers and our society as a whole,” he said.</p>
      <p>“This initiative is but a testament to that commitment—allowing us to provide true end-to-end support for our customers, no matter the circumstance,” Panlilio added.</p>
      <p>Among other key investments in Clark Freeport are the VITRO Data Center facility along Ninoy Aquino Avenue here, the first of its kind in Central Luzon, and the deployment of the country’s first 5G network launched at Clark Marriott Hotel in November last year.</p>
