      <h1>Peter Morley, Patient Advocate, Risks His Own Health To Protect Yours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Pedro Nicolaci da Costa</a></address>
      <p>When Peter Morley first came to Washington in July of 2017 to protest Republican efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act, he had no idea he would end up visiting Washington, D.C. some 25 times and getting to know prominent members of Congress on both sides of the aisle on a first name basis.Less than two years later, Morley has not only testified in Congress, he is a known and welcome face in the halls of Congress as he dots his way through ambitious meeting schedules with every possible representative, senator or aide who will meet with him.</p>
      <p>And a ton of them do, as anyone can see from the informative videos posted frequently on his Twitter feed, often flanked by a prominent member of Congress discussing key issues in healthcare. </p>
      <p>His primary mission is to share the hundreds of stories of patients around the country who, like Morley himself, live with so-called “pre-existing conditions” which were crucially protected under the law enacted by President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>In addition, Morley has found himself seeking to bridge the divide between those who want to cut the government’s role in healthcare and those who want to extend it, potentially into something that is now being called “Medicare for All.” </p>
      <p>When you ask Morley what plan he’s for, he doesn’t hesitate for a second: “All of them.”</p>
      <p>In other words, he wants to make sure everyone has the best possible care and that not only is recent progress not rolled back, but also that attempts at expanding coverage even further do not happen so rapidly as to disrupt the delicacy and continuity of care required for many patients with one or more pre-existing conditions.</p>
      <p>Morley himself has several, including Lupus, which is a debilitating disease that saps his energy and requires regular infusions in the hospital.   </p>
      <p>One of my favorite "Morley Moments" happened just this week: ABC’s Eyewitness News picked up a video of Peter and his lovely dog Natasha, who has also made the occasional Washington visit to brighten the halls of Congress.</p>
      <p>Then there’s the time I got to accompany Peter on a portion of one of his marathon visits through the Capitol, and to see first hand just how much his enthusiasm and passion can light up the room and inspire people to action. </p>
      <p>Like many activist-minded Americans, Morley felt to need to step up his involvement after the election of Donald Trump, who ran on repealing Obamacare without offering any alternatives to the popular and successful plan.  </p>
      <p>“To me as a patient this is a point—it felt like we are going to take away your healthcare,” Morley said in an interview. “It felt like my access to healthcare would be limited or more limited. I live on a fixed income, does this mean i have to pay more? I see 17 different doctors.” </p>
      <p>“It was scary, it felt like my life was threatened, literally. I needed to do something to empower myself.”</p>
      <p>That something was to dive headlong into the issue of healthcare, first by digging deep into all the various policy proposals and then by listening to other patients who began reaching out to Morley as his social media presence grew. </p>
      <p>Now, he uses his own prominence and newfound fame, about which he always exceedingly humble, to go a step further and advocate for policies that maximize the availability of care for everyone, especially the country’s most vulnerable populations.</p>
      <p>One small but important step is just making sure people know the options that are available to them under the existing law, since part of the Republican plan to kill Obamacare is simply to obfuscate its dissemination.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, Morley, always upbeat despite his own health challenges, is an inspiration to everyone he meets. This comes through clearly in all of his interactions–from anonymous patients on Twitter to high-ranking members of the U.S. Senate.</p>
