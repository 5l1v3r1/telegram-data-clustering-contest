      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>For a restaurant symbolising the easygoing nature and chilled vibes of Jamaica, Ting Irie isn’t doing the best job – and we say that in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Bopping with excitement, loud chatter and a vibrant sense of community, Dubai’s first Jamaican <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants">restaurant</a> and lounge isn’t exactly your top spot for a leisurely dinner. But we’re here for the buzzing vibe, and we’re not disappointed by the lively <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/bars">bar</a>.<br/><br/>Follow the crowd, as they say, and as soon as we arrive we’re easily drawn to the banter-filled bar area, albeit a tighter spot to dine. Booths are definitely a desired spot, being attached to its bar section. The restaurant is quieter and not so fun, so get there in good time to secure your bar spot.<br/><br/>As we expect, the menu is filled with jerk everything, from fried rice and chicken pasta to jerk-infused aubergine risotto – a definite star of Ting Irie’s veggie menu. This <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gallery/410668-50-best-dishes-in-dubai-of-2019">dish</a> doesn’t hold back on its creamy coconut risotto, tofu chunks and wedges of aubergine.<br/><br/>The more meaty side of, erm, tings, has us wanting to order everything in sight, but the hefty load of Jerk’s Fried Rice wins out, and won’t disappoint.<br/>It could only be made better if it was set by the beach – Ting Irie’s bar is a true slice of Jamaica in the Middle East.<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>Tings are definitely irie at this buzzing Jamaican hot spot<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>A bopping atmosphere and wealth of jerk dishes make this a hit</p>
