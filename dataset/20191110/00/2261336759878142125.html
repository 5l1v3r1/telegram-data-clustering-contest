      <h1>Robert Whittaker on match-up with Darren Till: That’s the fight I’m currently interested in</h1>

      <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker wants his first fight after losing his title to be against Darren Till.</p>
      <p>Whittaker (20-5) suffered his first middleweight loss, to Israel Adesanya, at UFC 243 last month—after winning eight straight fights at 185-pounds. ‘The Reaper’ was promoted to middleweight champion in December 2017, and technically never defended the belt, despite beating Yoel Romero at UFC 225—as Romero missed weight for the bout. Talking to <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/subscribe/news/1/?sourceCode=DTWEB_WRE170_a&amp;dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fsport%2Fufc-star-robert-whittaker-admits-relief-at-loss-to-adesanya-and-whats-next%2Fnews-story%2F69a3321bcfa9302cb6b831234cab935f&amp;memtype=anonymous&amp;mode=premium&amp;nk=70cf0fa517c16c6df0594e19321feb71-1573251707">The Daily Telegraph</a>, Whittaker said he is targeting a return to the Octagon against Till for his next fight.</p>
      <p>“That’s the fight I’m currently interested in,” Whittaker said. “Plus I’ve never been to Europe before, so what better reason to go?”</p>
      <p>While Whittaker was defeated in his last fight, Till (18-2-1) moved up to middleweight at UFC 244, beating Kelvin Gastelum by split decision in a lackluster contest. Till formerly challenged for the welterweight title, in September 2018—losing to Tyron Woodley by second-round submission.</p>
      <p>Whittaker is hoping his planned fight with Till will headline UFC London, which is likely to take place in March 2020, when the promotion visits the English capital again.</p>
