      <p>It’s been a nail biter for months, but the answer came on Friday from a Workers’ Party (PT) picked, and packed, Supreme Court. They voted 6 to 5 to change a ruling about prison terms that freed ex-president and PT founder Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after roughly two years in jail on corruption charges. The market for Brazil equities fell as much as 3.5% on the news, but recovered and closed at 3.39% instead. Brazil was the worst performing emerging market thanks to that Supreme Court ruling.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian real weakened to its lowest level since September 14, 2018, hitting R$4.17 to the dollar before settling a tad stronger at R$4.167.</p>
      <p>The sell-off shows Brazil’s susceptibility to political risk now that Lula is out of jail and agitating against President Jair Bolsonaro, and his anti-corruption chief Sergio Moro.</p>
      <p>Sergio Moro was the lead judge handling ex-political figures involved in the Petrobras bribery scandals known as the Car Wash investigations. Moro handed Lula his prison sentence, to which Lula appealed twice and lost.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court’s ruling didn’t just lead to Lula’s release, but also to the release of his former chief of staff and Che Guevera <i>companheiro</i> Jose Dirceu. A host of mid-level traders and Petrobras executives soaked by the Car Wash will also walk.</p>
      <p>Other politicians jailed on unrelated corruption charges are expected to be freed in the days ahead.</p>
      <p>After market trading suggests Wall Street is not worried about Lula. The iShares MSCI Brazil (EWZ) exchange traded fund was trading higher on Friday after the closing bell. If emerging markets look good on Monday, Brazil will look good. If Brazil looks bad, blame Lula.</p>

      <p>Amid honking horns and shouts of the new PT fanbase slogan – “Lula livre!”, which means Free Lula in Portuguese – his exit was met by an equal number of protests on Saturday.</p>
      <p>People dressed in the Brazilian colors of yellow and green crowded Avenida Paulista to let the Bolsonaro government know how they felt about the Supreme Court decision.</p>
      <p>For his part, Bolsonaro warned his 5.3 million supporters (Lula has around 1.2 million) twice on Twitter recently not to engage with PT supporters in the streets or on social media. “You’ll just amplify their message, which is what they want,” he warned.</p>
      <p>Lula’s release does not change the fact that he cannot run for office for at least 8 years. He still has some six more Car Wash-related cases against him, though it looks safe to say that he will not serve a day in prison should he lose any of them.</p>
      <p>Wall Street may be right to view Lula as a has-been, with little ability to rabble rouse beyond his traditional union-base, a base that saw many vote Bolsonaro in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, no one should doubt Lula’s connections within the left-wing activist movements of South America like Grupo de Puebla and their ability to agitate against the right-leaning governments.</p>
      <p>In fact, as soon as Lula got out of jail, new Argentina leaders Cristina Kirchner and Alberto Fernandez were letting their followers know of the good news. So did Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who still believes Hugo Chavez, metamorphosed into a tiny bird, is whispering advice into his ear on how to carry out (still!) the fantastical Bolivar Revolution throughout Latin America.</p>
      <p>For his part, Lula said he was ready to continue with “the struggle”, a popular ode to left wing causes.</p>
      <p>Should Lula be able to create chaos, two scenarios are likely for investors.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Buy Bolsonaro:</b> Bolsonaro’s political base rallies around the president. They have been a bit weak on that front for the past year. The center-right could circle the wagons. Brazil remains a neutral to slight overweight providing reforms continue.</li>
        <li><b>Sell Lula:</b> Lula gains some surprising traction and manages to get people out into the streets waving their red PT and Communist Party flags. Bank windows are smashed. Brazil’s stock market crashes by a good 10,000 points, and the Brazilian real goes to R$4.25 to the dollar in a heartbeat.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <b>Imagining A Worse Case Scenario</b>

      <p>Lula's release is likely to increase political polarization in the short term, says Robert Wood, principal economist for Latin America at The Economist Intelligence Unit. “We don’t believe that it will materially impact the piecemeal advance of the government's reformist economic agenda,” he says.</p>
      <p>The worst case scenario looks like what we saw in Chilean headlines, with young people busting things and pundits bemoaning inequality as the only explanation for unrest against a conservative government led by billionaire president Sebastian Pinera.</p>
      <p>Chile is the richest and most equal of all Latin American countries. Protests have been going on for about a month.</p>
      <p>Having told his supporters in a series of tweets that the new government was failing them, Lula gets out of prison only to throw a wrench into Brazil’s half broken machine. It is deeply irresponsible for him to come out and attack the country like this, but not entirely shocking in these times. There is no interest in healing, only prolonging the pain.</p>
      <p>If Brazil is like the U.S., then Lula is, oddly enough, their version of Hillary Clinton, if one is to look at this through an American lens. Brazilian lawyers connected to Lula might even suddenly find whistleblowers, or start suing prosecutors to continue to sew doubts into the legitimacy of the Car Wash scandal. It would be unprecedented, but these are unprecedented times and so much of Brazil’s politics looks like the Trump-era here at home. Bolsonaro faced the Brazilian version of the Woman’s March before he was even elected president. His government faces a mostly unfriendly domestic and international political press: <i>“Globo lixo”</i> is the Brazilian version of “CNN sucks.” He and his supporters are called fascists, racists and homophobes. Lula is using buzzwords like “alt-right” in one Twitter rant after the next to win over the international press, already against Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>It will take a while before a worst case scenario unfolds. It unfolds only if Lula wants it to unfold and he succeeds at bringing Chilean style civil strife to Brazil. Such a move would come at a time when the country is still trying to dig itself out of the meteoric crater left by the PT.</p>

      <p>Petrobras nearly went bankrupt on PT’s watch thanks in part to price controls and corruption. It is the most important state owned company in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Inequality declined under Lula’s two-terms in office because of foreign direct investment into Brazil – led by oil and sugarcane ethanol – and government spending. The new government is not cutting key social welfare programs like “Bolsa Familia”, which Lula expanded.</p>
      <p>Culturally speaking, Brazil is not known for days-long protests. Single day or weekend-long protests have sprouted up since 2015 during the impeachment of PT president Dilma Rousseff. They’ve also sprouted up over the last four years in support of Sergio Moro, or against pension reform, which has now passed.</p>
      <p>The last time Brazil was mired in weeks of disruptive protests was during the dictatorship years; years that some in the PT seem willing to relive – one last romantic, return-to-youth, fight before they leave this big bad world.</p>
      <p>For now, Wall Street can care less about Lula.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The market seems fairly convinced the center-right will rally around Bolsonaro.</p>
      <p>There is also the possibility that the general public in Brazil has had enough of Lula and his antics. They have had enough of PT and its political offshoots like the Socialism and Liberty Party, or PSOL, a super-minority party with just enough A-list names and drama among them to keep them in the headlines.</p>
      <p>I think Brazil can live with <i>Lula livre.</i></p>
      <p>The takeaway: look for any attempt to bring chaos to Brazil to be met with virtuous support from the press over “rising inequality” – an inequality caused entirely by the economy PT blew up – but the chaos will be short-lived.</p>
      <p>If it is not short-lived, then it is because the opposition is looking for violent reactions from the government to prove a point. Bolsonaro will be tempted to take that bait. If he brings out the tanks, he feeds the PT beast their narrative of Bolsonaro as anti-Democratic militant. That could be too much for the reformists in his cabinet to bear. Would Wall Street favorite, Paulo Guedes, leave Bolsonaro’s cabinet under such circumstances, fearing the government is now bogged down in political warfare instead of economic policy debates? I think so. Then all bets on Brazil’s economy would be off, and its market, the best in Latin America, would crash hard.</p>
