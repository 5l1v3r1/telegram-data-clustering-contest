      <p>I’ve been following the Samsung Galaxy S10/S11 Lite <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/samsung-galaxy-s10-lite-design-may-have-just-been-revealed">rumours</a> and trying to figure out why the Korean company would release yet another, cheaper, variant of the Galaxy S10. This year’s S10e - and the 'e' range in general - plays the role budget flagship reasonably well. It has S10 branding, most of the core S10 functionality and design (save for a third telephoto lens), but cuts back on display resolution and - of course - is a lot cheaper than the full price variant. </p>
      <p>But the S10 Lite sounds like it would fulfil a similar role, so how would it fit in alongside other S10 models? It could be a market specific device, it could be a rebrand of the 'e' line, or it could be Samsung testing the waters for a reorganisation of which models are considered flagships. </p>
      <p>All are possible, but the last two would be the most interesting move by Samsung. If the S10 Lite ever becomes a reality, where it fits in may depend on what Samsung plans to do with the Galaxy Fold range. </p>
      <p>The Galaxy Fold 2 will likely be unveiled in April next year and if the Korean company can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/10/26/samsungs-galaxy-fold-2-can-outflank-motorolas-razr-v4/#2573793a4df2">bring the price down</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/10/29/samsungs-galaxy-fold-2-can-replace-the-note/#41ec43a218c4">tidy up some of the execution</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/03/motorola-razr-v4-can-beat-samsung-galaxy-fold-2-with-two-features/#a923e6b41e86">build a better design</a>, then the Fold - and foldable phones in general - will move away from concept devices and into flagship territory. </p>
      <p>If so, then it’s possible the Fold could replace the current generation flagship Galaxy S line. Samsung has form here. The curved display edge technology first debuted in the Note Edge in 2014, which was eventually incorporated into the main flagship line. The same could happen with the Fold, with it either replacing the Galaxy S, or foldable technology being incorporated into the Galaxy S line. </p>
      <p>Either possibility could push the price of the Galaxy S range up (the current Fold retails at around $2000). That would leave space for a cheaper - current gen design - Galaxy Lite, perhaps aimed at people who don’t want a foldable phone but would like to stick with Samsung.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers don’t like to ditch customers who are fans of their products by completely redesigning a device they’ve been regularly buying for last few years. Apple eased its all-screen display in by launching the iPhone X alongside the more familiar-looking iPhone 8, and Samsung did the same with the Note Edge. We could be seeing the same process happening again with the Fold and Galaxy s Lite. </p>
