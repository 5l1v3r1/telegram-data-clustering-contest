      <p>The cost of developing Formula One engines has been revealed in new research which suggests that an auto maker needs to commit to spending around $1.4 billion (£1.1 billion) in order to win the championship.The high-octane cost has already driven two of F1’s four engine suppliers to consider whether to remain in the race series and the crossroads is rapidly approaching. At the end of next year F1’s contracts with its ten teams reach the end of the road and it is using the opportunity to introduce new regulations in a bid to spice up the action after six years of dominance by Mercedes.</p>
      <p>Since the current 1.6 liter V6 turbos were introduced to F1 in 2014, Mercedes has won 73.7% of the races followed by Ferrari with 14.4%, Renault on 10.2% and Honda a lowly 1.7%.</p>
      <p>According to Helmut Marko, motorsports consultant for the Honda-powered Red Bull Racing team, changes need to be made in order to keep the Japanese auto giant in F1. Last last month Marko <a href="https://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/helmut-marko-interview-honda-motoren-entwicklung-kosten/">told</a> German publication Auto, Motor und Sport that Honda “are waiting until the new regulations are on the table. Then they will analyse them and make a decision.”</p>
      <p>Marko explained that reducing Honda’s costs is “very important” and he warned that “if it doesn’t get cheaper there will scarcely be anyone left.” Ominously, he added that it would not be wise to retain the current engine specification because that “only works if everyone is at the same level. At the moment Ferrari is ahead of everyone in qualifying, Mercedes included.”</p>
      <p>It is ominous because F1 announced the new regulations last week and although the aerodynamics of the cars is due to change significantly in 2021, the engine will stay the same.</p>
      <p>Renault too recently announced that it is re-considering its involvement with F1 following a 1.6% crash in its revenue to $12.6 billion (€11.3 billion) in the third quarter. Interim chief executive Clotilde Delbos told analysts that French auto maker is examining all aspects of the business including its longtime, high-profile participation in F1.</p>
      <p>Honda and Renault supply engines to more than a third of F1’s teams so if they both pull out it would make a huge dent in the race series which is owned by Liberty Media and listed on the Nasdaq with the ticker FWONK. Finding two new auto makers which are prepared to back an F1 engine program would be no mean feat.</p>
      <p>Rival auto makers may be attracted by Mercedes’ success which has seen its brand value grow by $16.7 billion since 2013, the year before it won its first F1 title. According to Interbrand, it hit $48.6 billion in 2018 with F1 making an important contribution to Mercedes’ status as the eighth most valuable brand in the world. That’s not all as Mercedes has also mastered the art of transferring technology from F1 to its production cars.</p>
      <p>As we have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/csylt/2015/06/18/how-mercedes-uses-formula-one-to-rev-up-its-road-cars/">reported</a>, Mercedes rotates engineers between its production car operation and its F1 team. It has also used technology from its F1 cars in the next generation of its S-Class sedans.</p>
      <p>As Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff told us, “many people say technology transfer is just a marketing story. I can tell you, here it is not. The S-Class is running on a 6 cylinder turbo engine and the way we optimise our engines in terms of efficiency and power deployment translates directly into road cars.</p>
      <p>“We are using some technology for cooling invented here and that technology is being used in the next generation of S-Class as well. It is all because of the development on track absolutely. So that is happening. It is a reality and this is why the hybrid 6 cylinder turbo engines are so important for us.”</p>

      <p>Mercedes is taking this partnership to a new level with the upcoming launch of the Mercedes-AMG One hypercar which will have a top speed of 218 miles per hour and a price tag of $2.7 million. It has driven a great deal of exposure as it is the first production car powered by an F1 engine. However, if other auto makers want to stand even a chance of copying Mercedes’ success they would have to match its turbocharged commitment.</p>
      <p>The financial statements of Mercedes’ engine division reveal that since development began on the V6 engine, its costs have come to a total of $1.2 billion (£914.4 million). The company’s latest results are for the year to 31 December 2018 and, as we recently <a href="https://www.cityam.com/revealed-how-lewis-hamilton-and-mercedes-retained-their-formula-one-titles-but-kept-a-lid-on-costs/">revealed</a> in British newspaper the CityAM, its costs only rose by $4.7 million (£3.6 million) on the previous year. If this trend continues it will bring its spending over the V6 era to $1.4 billion.</p>
      <p>The story doesn’t stop there though as Mercedes gets an estimated $37 million annually from supplying its engines to the Williams and Racing Point teams. However, a new auto maker wouldn’t be able to bank on signing any supply agreements so it would have to budget for covering all of the costs itself. In addition, it would have to build (perhaps literally) an F1 division and develop an engine from scratch.</p>
      <p>Mercedes isn’t even believed to have the most expensive F1 engine program. That honor is understood to go to Ferrari but it can’t be verified as the Italian team doesn’t file separate financial statements for its F1 team or engine division as they are integrated into its production car operations.</p>
      <p>British auto maker Aston Martin was planning to supply engines to F1 from 2021 but did a U Turn in 2018 after Liberty scrapped the cap on investment in them. No other suppliers are believed to be in the running so if Honda or Renault do bring the checkered flag down on their time in F1 Liberty could end up in a race against time to replace them.</p>
