      <p>No one knows quite how to sell skins like Riot Games and League of Legends. After finding success with K/DA, a concept that turned some of its heroes into a pop star girl group, they’re back at it again with a new band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVZpHFXcFJw">True Damage</a>, which is more focused on hip-hop.As the story goes, after K/DA, Akali made it her mission to recruit a new hip-hop group. That group is True Damage and in addition to her, includes Yasuo as DJ, and Ekko, Senna and Qiyana as the featured artists.</p>
      <p>Riot has just rolled out an animated music video for True Damage’s first song Giants, and it’s pretty damn good. The actual artists performing it are Becky G, Keke Palmer, (G)I-DLE's Soyeon, Duckwrth, and Thutmose, and the song will be featured ahead of the League of Legends World Championship Finals which will be later today.</p>
      <p>All five members of True Damage each have their own skins for purchase, similar to what Riot did with K/DA previously. In case you missed that whole thing, it’s definitely worth checking out K/DA’s POP/STARS video from a year ago:</p>
      <p>Different animation style, same concept. I suppose it’s up for debate which group/song/video is better, though I’m leaning toward K/DA. To say Riot’s idea to turn its characters into music stars is a success is an understatement. The POP/STARS video has 279 million views, and it’s anyone’s guess how many copies of the track Riot sold. As of right now, the Giants video has 350,000 views and it only came out a few hours ago.</p>
      <p>It stands to reason that Riot is going to keep doing this every year around Worlds, and we should see a new musical group with a new style form next year. League of Legends bluegrass band, anyone?</p>
      <p>The finals are in a few more hours, and the True Damage skins are available in League of Legends itself right now, which naturally are going to cost you a pretty penny.</p>
      <p>I really do love this concept and it shows that Riot can have fun with their fantasy characters in unusual ways. It also gets me excited for the coming League of Legends anime.</p>
      <p>I’ve listened to Giants a few times already, and will probably be playing it on repeat the rest of the day. Now, to buy some skins…</p>
