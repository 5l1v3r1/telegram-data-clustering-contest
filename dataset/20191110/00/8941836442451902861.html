      <p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) - Some Alaskans are calling for greater financial transparency from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hilcorp/">Hilcorp</a>, the company seeking to buy BP’s North Slope assets.</p>
      <p>The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hilcorp/">Hilcorp</a> asked the Regulatory Commission of Alaska to allow recent years of financial records to remain confidential.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/british-petroleum/">BP</a> has announced plans to sell its Alaska assets including the Prudhoe Bay oil field to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hilcorp/">Hilcorp</a> for $5.6 billion.</p>
      <p>The regulatory commission is responsible for the aspects of the transaction involving the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.</p>
      <p>Public comments indicate some residents want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hilcorp/">Hilcorp</a> to open its records to ensure it has the means to respond to a costly accident in the region that includes the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.</p>

      <p>The privately held company based in Houston, Texas, says disclosure could hurt its competitive advantage.</p>
