      <p>While the world’s top skiers head to Bormio for the <a href="https://www.bormioski.eu/en/calendar/fis-ski-world-cup/">FIS Alpine Ski World Cup</a> races (December 28-29 in 2019), a time when this town near the Swiss border turns up in the media spotlight, the resort is a little-known destination for many international schussers, who are more likely to aim their Rossignols and K2s down power pistes in St. Moritz, Courchevel or Cortina d’Ampezzo. Bormio has long remained in the shadow of these and other glittery resorts, but skiers looking to experience a different, yet important venue, should consider a stop in the town, a future Olympic site and home to one of Italy’s most famous courses the <a href="https://www.bormioski.eu/en/skiing/active/ski-racing/">Stelvio</a>, often compared to Kitzbühel’s famously tough Streif run. American skier Bode Miller won the downhill and Super G on the Stelvio in 2005 (for the World Championships) and the downhill in 2007. Last year, Italian racer Dominik Paris dominated, his third time taking first prize in the downhill. (He also won the Super G.) The course with a 1010-meter vertical drop and <a href="http://www.scuolascibormio.com/en/ski-area/">63% gradien</a>t will host men’s Alpine races for the 2026 Olympics, awarded to Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo last June.</p>

      <p>But you don’t have to be an Olympic contender to be happy here, with the majority of runs classified for intermediates and beginners. You also have access to the Santa Caterina ski area, good for beginners, and Cima Piazzi-San Colombano, for some 1<a href="https://www.bormioski.eu/en/ski-pass/ski-pass-prices/bormio-skipass/">10 kilometers of slopes</a> if you get the Bormio Ski Pass. While not all the action is on the slopes, a lot of it is; on certain Fridays in January and February there’s night skiing on the famous Stelvio course, should your idea of apres-ski be, well, more skiing (and if you have the requisite expertise). For less strenuous outings, or after a day navigating the slopes, you can explore the <i>centro storico</i>, or historic district, and walk the Via Roma, with its buildings dating from the late Middle Ages and 1500s, some covered in frescoes.</p>

      <p>Like many stategically-located mountain towns in Italy<b>, </b>Bormio, in the province of Sondrio, saw rulers come and go (among them the duchy of Milan, the Swiss canton of Grisons, France and Austria), leaving their mark on the local culture without overwhelming it. As for cuisine, what you’ll find is a hearty cooking style that developed around products found in the Valtellina valley (Bormio lies in the upper part of it). Local dishes include pizzoccheri, a very substantial first course made with buckwheat pasta, cheese, potatoes and cabbage; sciatt, a fried cheese fritter frequently spiked with a dash of grappa; the uniquitous bresaola and Valtellina cheeses like Bitto and Casera.</p>

      <p>Long before Bormio became an important ski destination, it was known for its therapeutic thermal waters. To soothe piste-weary muscles, head to one of the town’s thermal spas; take in the stunning mountain views from the outdoor pool of the <a href="https://www.qcterme.com/en/bormio/qc-terme-bagni-vecchi/thermal-bath">Bagni Vecchi</a>, a site used since Roman times. The five-star <a href="https://www.qcterme.com/en/bormio/hotel-bagni-nuovi">Grand Hotel Bagni Nuovi </a>has easy access to thermal spa facilities and seven outdoor pools.</p>
