      <p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Derryck Thornton scored 22 points, Nik Popovic had 15, and Boston College rallied past South Florida for a 74-60 victory Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Boston College (2-0) capitalized on a 38-29 rebounding advantage, led by Steffon Mitchell with 13 and Popovic with eight. Julian Rishwain helped the Eagles with 11 points, and C.J. Felder added 10.</p>
      <p>South Florida (1-1) forced 28 turnovers but failed to take advantage with 40.7 percent overall shooting, costly fouls and 21 turnovers of its own.</p>
      <p>The Eagles went on a 20-4 run late in the first half after five lead changes. Popovic, a 6-foot-11 senior forward, capped the surge with a buzzer-beater from the left corner to make it 43-32.</p>
      <p>South Florida was in control for most of the first half, taking its biggest lead at 26-17 seven minutes before the break.</p>

      <p>David Collins led the Bulls with 19 points and seven steals. Laquincy Rideau scored 14 points, and Ezacuras Dawson finished with 11.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Boston College: A pair of newcomers have the Eagles off to a flying start. Thornton, a graduate transfer from USC, produced 45 points in his first two games. Freshman guard Jay Heath has 24, including 18 in a season-opening victory against Atlantic Coast Conference rival Wake Forest.</p>
      <p>South Florida: The Bulls are missing star forward Alexis Yetna, who suffered a season-ending knee injury during a preseason practice. The redshirt sophomore was the American Athletic Conference Freshman of the Year last season with a league-leading 9.6 rebounds per game and 15 double-doubles.</p>
