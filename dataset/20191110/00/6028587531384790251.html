      <p>Warner Bros.’ <i>Doctor Sleep </i>fell victim to <i>Blade Runner 2049 </i>syndrome. By that I mean the sequel to <i>The Shining </i>was heavily marketed specifically to fans of Stephen King’s 1979 book and Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 movie, to the point where it didn’t offer that much else to general audiences. While I recognized the marketing strategy (it was kind of hard to miss), I wasn’t that concerned going into the weekend, since a performance akin to <i>Blade Runner 2049 </i>($89 million domestic and $242 million worldwide) would have been fine on <i>Doctor Sleep</i>’s $45 million budget. Alas, <i>Doctor Sleep </i>earned just $14.1 million this weekend. That was well below the over/under $25 million tracking guestimates and frankly lower than any number of recent non-IP horror flicks in recent years (think <i>Lights Out </i>or <i>Don’t Breathe</i>). It earned a B+ from Cinemascore and a 2.7x weekend multiplier, playing 57% male and 74% over 25-years-old. At best, we’re probably looking at a $40 million domestic finish, but something closer to $30 million wouldn’t surprise me. The curse of <i>Blade Runner 2049 </i>lives again. It’s another reason to fear for Legendary and WB’s <i>Dune</i>.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I drank the Kool-Aid a little bit this time, but audiences clearly didn’t care about the property. <i>The Shining </i>was a solid hit in 1980, earning $44 million domestic, its popularity is comparatively confined to horror junkies and film nerds. And, yeah, it’s a slow-burn 143-minute horror flick, so it’s not something that gets introduced during family movie night. For that matter, whatever nostalgia for the property was blunted by being a 152-minute, R-rated horror movie. So, you can’t bring the kids and that babysitter will cost you a little extra.</p>
      <p>The film was an adaption of Stephen King’s 2013 novel while acting as essentially a sequel to three versions of <i>The Shining </i>(the book, the first movie, and the ABC mini-series). Much of the media attention was focused on King’s long-standing displeasure with the Kubrick version and how director Mike Flanagan took all three prior versions of <i>The Shining </i>as well as the <i>Doctor Sleep </i>book, in order to make a hybrid adaptation/sequel of sorts. While ambitious and interesting, that info was only valuable to audiences already interested in a sequel to <i>The Shining </i>while being potentially off-putting to those who just wanted a post-Halloween horror flick.</p>
      <p>There’s a case to be made that <i>Doctor Sleep </i>could have filled a seasonal gap, since this past Halloween didn’t have a big horror flick. Sure, <i>Joker, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>and <i>Zombieland: Double Tap </i>kinda-sorta filled the bill, but <i>Doctor Sleep </i>could have been positioned as this year’s <i>Saw</i>, <i>Paranormal Activity </i>or what-have-you. To be fair, New Line’s <i>It Chapter Two </i>was a huge hit in September and Warner Bros.’ <i>Joker </i>benefited from the lack of a scary movie in the marketplace. The Ewan McGregor/Kyliegh Curran/Rebecca Ferguson/Cliff Curtis horror flick grossed just $14.4 million over the weekend.</p>
      <p>We’re still only talking about a $45 million flick that could play better overseas, but this is one of those scary situations where an IP/brand adaptation performs noticeably worse than a proverbial original in the same respective genre. Think <i>Storks </i>playing better than <i>LEGO Ninjago Movie</i>, with the lesson in this case being that the Stephen King name isn’t enough to drive audiences otherwise uninterested in the movie. I wasn’t high on the movie, but there’s plenty to appreciate and, if you’re a fan, it’s not like WB was thinking about <i>The Shining 3 </i>had this performed better.</p>
