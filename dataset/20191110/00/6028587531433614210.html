      <h1>At Our 25th Reunion, Stanford Grads Were All About Purpose</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">MeiMei Fox</a></address>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/23/us/gender-gaps-stanford-94.html">2014 New York Times cover story</a> about our last reunion, five years ago, Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Jodi Kantor wrote: “In the history of American higher education, it is hard to top the luck and timing of the Stanford class of 1994.” As a member of this fortunate class, I concur. We arrived at the center of Silicon Valley at a time when the modern, Internet-based tech industry – the Dot.com era – was just being born. Ask any of us and chances are, back in the day, we met a founder of Google, WhatsApp, Yahoo, PayPal, or some other tech giant that has since become a household name.</p>

      <p>Kantor’s insightful article examined how, in spite of the phenomenal success many Stanford graduates from our year had experienced in the tech industry, the majority nevertheless were male. What had happened to the women, she wondered? Why did Silicon Valley, which claims to be both socially progressive and a meritocracy, still have such a remarkable gender gap?</p>
      <p>We very much appreciated Kantor raising awareness of a critical issue, which certainly begs consideration. Later, she would break the story of Harvey Weinstein’s decades of sexual abuse and play a critical role in starting the #MeToo movement. And, as our 25<sup>th</sup> reunion approached, that article led two of my classmates – Jen Kramer Tate, who just finished making a short documentary film, <a href="https://karaokepeoplemovie.com/">Karaoke People</a>, about how karaoke brings us together, and Christina Milano, who helped launch <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/09/16/transgender-health-training-program/">OHSU's Transgender Health Program</a>, the first academic, interdisciplinary program of its kind in the US – to ask a few follow-on questions…</p>
      <p>If we women of Stanford ’94 aren’t rocking the tech world, what are we doing? Undoubtedly a gender bias still exists in Silicon Valley. Could it be that other factors also have played a role? Aside from pursuing wealth and power through the creation of technology companies, many of us seem to be pursuing life paths driven by meaning and purpose. We may not be cashing in on billions of stock options, but have we lived up to “our potential” in other ways? Are we, by and large, feeling fulfilled?</p>

      <p>Having just returned from our 25<sup>th</sup> Stanford reunion, I can say that the answer is an unequivocal “yes.” I felt inspired by our classmates, both male and female. Rather than bragging about their latest start-up, corporate acquisition, promotion, or accolades earned, the vast majority spent the three-day gathering discussing a topic dear to my heart, one that I write about each week for Forbes: <i>Purpose</i>.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/how-an-own-senior-exec-753196">Tina Perry</a>, who in addition to serving as a senior executive at Oprah’s OWN also founded The Mistake Room, an art space in downtown LA, in order to support up-and-coming artists and thinkers. Or <a href="https://www.studiocake.com/press">BethAnn Goldberg</a>, who turned her passion for cake design and baking into a business, Studio Cake, and has twice won Food Network’s gold medal. Or Martha Gabi Cervantes, who has worked for two decades as a public school teacher for the LAUSD.</p>
      <p>Now look. I’ve attended both high school and college reunions before. Often, in spite of being a social butterfly, I don’t enjoy them very much. I love to connect with old friends, but I quickly grow tired of the surface-level banter, swapping facts with an endless stream of folks about what we’ve accomplished since graduating, and – in the most unenlightened moments – commenting on who has gained weight or lost hair.</p>
      <p>That didn’t happen at our 25<sup>th</sup>. At least not much. People were real. They talked openly about challenges they’d faced, from divorce to the loss of a parent to illness to struggles with their careers. They weren’t afraid to get vulnerable. As Stanford Alumni Association President Howard Wolf put it, by this age, “the chest-beating craziness is mostly behind us.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Even better, I found most classmates had honed in on pursuing their passions – from companies and non-profits they’d created, to projects they’d completed, to courses they’d taught, to children they were raising. In one of my favorite moments, Tony Farrell, who lived in the same frosh dorm at me, rushed up to tell me that his entire career as a high school teacher has been focused on helping young people discover their purpose.</p>
      <p>I give partial credit for the change in perspective from money and awards to meaning and impact to the wisdom that comes with age (thank heavens, because so do hair loss, weight gain, and menopause). But unfortunately, we must also recognize the role that the state of the world plays in all this. Our country is in crisis (thank heavens for our celebrity classmate <a href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/03/16/maddow-visits-stanford-for-first-time-since-graduating/">Rachel Maddow</a>, who is helping to shed light on all that is going on). So is our entire planet. We may have talked about “being green” while we were undergrads, but only now is the reality of climate change hitting us full force in the gut.</p>
      <p>As we approach 50, we are conscious of our privilege at having attended Stanford. Some of us dealt with student debt and some did not, some attended on full financial need-based or athletic scholarships. But none of us faced the kind of loan burdens that young people must struggle with today. We know that we are lucky, and we appreciate our responsibility to give back.</p>
      <p>Rather than bragging about what we’ve done, most of us feel humbled by how much there is still to do. We discussed revelations that technology companies are turning us into zombies and recording our every move with their spyware. We chatted about extreme wealth inequality, children being separated from their parents at the US border, the #MeToo era, the biggest refugee crisis in history, the melting of glaciers and warming of oceans that is causing mass extinction. We talked about how we feel called to help – whether by working in hospitals or schools or the arts, through nonprofits or corporations with a triple-bottom-line commitment, or by raising responsible children. We owe it to the world to passionately pursue not only our individual purposes, but our collective purpose as human beings.</p>

      <p>On the last day of our reunion, both Northern and Southern California started to burn. From our haven in picturesque Palo Alto, we watched the skies turn brown. The taste of ash touched our tongues. The DJ at the Stanford 25<sup>th</sup> Reunion Class Party chose as our last song of the evening “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Even those of our classmates who had been hovering at the edges of the dance floor all evening came rushing forward to jump up and down, arms entwined, and sing along.</p>
      <p>It felt like more than a trip down memory lane. It felt like an anthem. A call to life.</p>
