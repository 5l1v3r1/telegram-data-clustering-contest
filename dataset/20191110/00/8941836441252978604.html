      <p>HILO, Hawaii (AP) - Two former employees of a Hawaii physician’s office that was raided for illegal distribution of prescription opioid painkillers have pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hawaii-tribune/">Hawaii Tribune</a>-Herald reports the women were employees of Dr. Ernest Bade, whose Hilo office was shut down in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old doctor was charged with 40 counts of unlawfully distributing and dispensing controlled substances, but was found incompetent to stand trial due to dementia.</p>
      <p>Court records say 55-year-old Yvonne Caitano and 60-year-old Theresa Saltus pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to prescription drugs.</p>
      <p>Records say Caitano’s 33-year-old daughter Sheena Strong and 81-year-old mother Marie Benevides also pleaded guilty to separate drug counts.</p>

      <p>Authorities say the women flew to Maui and collectively obtained more than 10,000 oxycodone pills after pharmacies stopped filling Bade’s prescriptions.</p>
