      <p>This skill is so underrated that you can get pretty far in your career without anyone really noticing that you don’t have it or can’t apply it well. I’m talking about effective decision making. All sorts of people get through years of working; they even make it all the way to the C-suite without anyone ever even discussing this. But lose half a million in a quarter, cause a $50 million disaster, create a major service quality deficit or hire the wrong people for the wrong jobs too many times and people surely start to take notice.The powers that be will surely notice that decision making – a skill you were likely never evaluated for – is suddenly getting in the way of your success and causing the organization to suffer.</p>
      <h3>Education Can’t Outrun Poor Decisions.</h3>
      <p>No amount of education or experience can outrun or outweigh poor decision making in the long run. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2012/12/28/the-cost-of-bad-decisions-always-surface/#ee5d1321ec30">The costs of bad decisions always surface</a> and find a way to make you and the entire organization look bad. Observe the top ranks in any organization, and you will likely find highly qualified, educated and experienced executives and directors, but you’d be well advised not to assume that they can or will apply effective decision making when the moment requires it or the situation demands it. By the time leaders are exposed as deficient in this area, the organization has already taken huge hits and the culture and employees surely feel it.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at what effective decision making is and what it isn’t as well as why it’s a necessary component of career and organizational success.</p>
      <h3>Effective decision making is a necessary but most underrated skill.</h3>
      <p>The higher up the career ladder you go, the more responsible you are for decision making. You become responsible for your own ability to make good decisions and accountable for the decision making – or lack thereof – of others on your team. If you find your career progression has struggled or stalled or that you are not getting the respect you seek, consider whether or not your decision-making methods could be hindering your success and how.</p>
      <p>Decision making is underrated because people tend to credit others as competent in it without making any meaningful observations or assessments. Yet, a skill deficit in this area can create disastrous results for employees and organizations. Its importance is most appreciated after organizational leaders try to reactively remedy a catastrophe rather than when they should have been proactively trying to prevent one in the first place.</p>
      <h4>Very smart people can (and do) make very bad decisions.</h4>
      <p>Some of the smartest – and most accomplished – people in the world have been in rooms when some of the worst decisions have been made (think Enron, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster and the 2019 Boeing 737 Max FAA disasters). Then there are the decisions that organizational leaders make every day which lead to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reduce-the-staggering-costs-of-poor-operational-decisions/">staggering operational inefficiencies</a>, unnecessary redundancies, poor quality output, ineffective and contradictory policies, bad customer service and flawed hiring. How can this be?</p>
      <p>There are myriad reasons for bad, unethical or grossly negligent decisions including poor leadership, the lack of decision-making processes, ego, peer pressure, etc. But the top reasons would be resistance to critical thinking and analysis as well as the lack of an established decision-making process that accounts for <a href="https://arvisinstitute.com/ethical-leadership-circumstances-challenges-and-conflict-2/">human biases and ethical gaps</a>.</p>
      <h3>Effective decision making is not synonymous with decisiveness.</h3>
      <p>Organizations go to great pains to recruit and reward decisive leaders when they should, instead, be working harder to secure effective ones. Certainly, decisive leadership has a proper time and place, but decisiveness is not synonymous with effectiveness. Further, when applied improperly or excessively, it can be a detriment to effective leadership and an impediment to effective decision making.</p>
      <h4>Sometimes being decisive can work against you.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://terinaallen.com/the-four-perils-of-decisive-leadership/">These four perils to decisive leadership</a> can create long-lasting harm to organizational and career success. You’ll want to avoid this kind of decision making whenever possible.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b><i>Ready-shoot-aim</i></b>. A decisive leader could have a shoot-first mentality whereby he will make a decision and ask questions later (if ever) with little regard for short or long-term consequences.</li>
        <li><b><i>Acting is more important than thinking</i></b>. A decisive leader could believe that he’ll be rewarded for quick decisions even if those decisions may do greater harm in the long run. The goal becomes to just do something, and do it as fast as possible.</li>
        <li><b><i>Decisions aren’t connected to data</i></b>. A decisive leader can become driven to achieve some predefined outcome regardless of whether the data supports the outcome or not. What is best for the outcome overrides what is best for the organization or the internal or external stakeholders.</li>
        <li><b><i>The ego can get bigger than the organization</i></b>. A decisive leader may not tolerate or encourage dissent. In the worst cases, people are punished for disagreeing and rewarded for perpetual agreement. Hence, the decider creates – rather than reduces – higher levels of organizational risk.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Effective decision making requires analysis.</h3>
      <p>The best decision makers understand that regardless of <a href="https://hr.mit.edu/learning-topics/teams/articles/models">which decision-making model they use,</a> they must be strategic about it. Effective decisions are well-thought decisions with the results or consequences being weighed and considered beforehand.</p>
      <p>Effective decision makers are often <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2018/11/20/3-unmistakable-signs-youre-a-strategic-thinker/#1895112a6921">better strategic thinkers</a> too because their processes start with better questions like these:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Why do I/we need to care about this issue? Or, what prompted the need for this decision to be made?</li>
        <li>What happens if I/we don’t decide on this issue? Is the status quo acceptable? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>What outcomes are we trying to achieve? Who cares about them and why?</li>
        <li>What are my/our biases, prejudices, interests or values? Are they congruent with the defined decision options?</li>
        <li>Whom will this decision mostly affect? How?</li>
        <li>What are the positive and negative consequences of this decision? What is this based on?</li>
        <li>Who are the short-term and long-term beneficiaries? Who gets to define them?</li>
        <li>What is the worst result this decision can bring? Can I/we live with that?</li>
        <li>What are forces for or against this decision? Do I/we care? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>What is the second choice/option or fallback position? Is it viable, and how do I/we know?</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Effective decision making is necessary for professional and career success.</h3>
      <p>Decision making is indeed a skill, and it is critical for personal, professional and career success. It applies to all areas of the business including hiring, operations, marketing, finance, etc. And it is most helpful when contemplating and deciding on your next career moves.</p>
      <p>Those who are able and willing to apply effective decision making to their career will better understand which job opportunities to accept and which ones to decline and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/09/27/the-best-way-to-achieve-the-career-success-you-want/#77968c3a713e">which career risks to take and which ones to pass</a>. They are better able to gauge which extracurricular projects to accept and which ones to turn down.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, by making better decisions, you will take more calculated risks to advance your career, and you will know where to focus your time and efforts for career building and networking so you can realize the greatest benefits over time.</p>
