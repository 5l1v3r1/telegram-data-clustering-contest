      <p>In new release news that isn’t <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, the top movie of the weekend is Lionsgate’s <i>Midway</i>. Roland Emmerich’s (depending on who you ask) $70-$100 million World War II actioner came into theaters with little buzzy and mixed-negative reviews, along with a cast where the biggest “butts-in-seats-star” was Nick Jonas. Nonetheless, the film (which I will catch on Monday as I like most of Emmerich’s action dramas) earned $17.5 million in its opening weekend. That’s higher than the over/under $14 million pre-release projections, but it’s more notable for its ranking than for the actual gross. That’s not a blow-out debut, but it’s a fine showing for a movie that most of us underestimated and for which Lionsgate is mostly on the hook only for U.S. and UK distribution. The film, which stars Ed Skrein, Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Aaron Eckhart, Nick Jonas, Etsushi Toyokawa, Tadanobu Asano, Luke Kleintank, Jun Kunimura, Darren Criss, Keean Johnson, Alexander Ludwig, Mandy Moore, Dennis Quaid and Woody Harrelson, earned an A from Cinemascore. Lionsgate is hoping for legs akin to <i>Hacksaw Ridge</i>, which grossed $67.2 million domestic in November of 2016 from a $15.19 million debut.</p>
      <p> It’s not an apples-to-apples comparison, as the Andrew Garfield war actioner had better reviews, Oscar nominations and the “Let’s write about Mel Gibson” factor pushing it into the new year. Still, even a 3x multiplier and $53 million domestic cume would be solid presuming that the film does well enough overseas. Its status as the top movie of the weekend is more about <i>Doctor Sleep </i>underperforming, but a mild win is a mild win, especially for Lionsgate which isn’t on the hook for the production budget.</p>
      <p>As for the “why” factor, credit Lionsgate’s nostalgic and patriotic ad campaign, offering an old-school movie from an old-school blockbuster filmmaker (yes, Roland Emmerich’s blockbusters now qualify as quaint in the MCU/<i>Fast and Furious </i>era) released right on Veteran’s Day weekend. The opening night audience was 87% over-25 and 61% male, and it’s another solid performance for Lionsgate in the realm of old-school action. Okay, so <i>John Wick: Chapter 3 </i>and <i>Angel Has Fallen </i>were much bigger wins than <i>Anna </i>and <i>Rambo: Last Blood</i>, but it’s still a niche as long as the price is right.</p>

      <p>Paramount’s <i>Playing With Fire </i>slightly overperformed over the weekend, opening with $12.77 million. That positions the John Cena/Brianna Hildebrand/Keegan-Michael Key/John Leguizamo/Judy Greer/Tyler Mane/Dennis Haysbert kiddie comedy for an okay $34 million-to-$40 million domestic finish. And with that cast, I frankly don’t care if the PG-rated “firefighters look after displaced kids” comedy isn’t all that good, and I’ll probably see it tonight as my younger kids are very much into it. Yes, I’m finally at that stage where my younger kids want to see kid movies, for better or worse.</p>
      <p>Universal’s <i>Last Christmas </i>stumbled with just $11.6 million over the weekend. Combine that with poor reviews and a B- Cinemascore grade, and even the 2.8x weekend multiplier doesn’t bode all that well. The Paul Feig-directed, holiday-themed romantic comedy got plenty of media attention in the run up to release. Alas, the reviews weren’t great and much of the publicity for the Emilia Clarke/Henry Golding/Michelle Yeoh/Emma Thompson flick centered on whether or not the trailer gave away a major third-act twist. Without going into details, this is a situation where Universal’s marketing probably should have lied their butts off.</p>

      <p>No spoilers, but they should have shot scenes for the trailers never intended to be in the final film and/or doing something to throw pundits off the scent. This (around) $30 million comedy may leg out in the holiday season. And it’s always possible that this distinctly British melodrama will pull a Richard Curtis overseas and end up globally successful. But the theatrical rom-com is the one arena where Netflix originals have successfully approximated the so-called genuine article. Why pay movie theater cash for <i>Last Christmas </i>when you can watch <i>Let It Snow </i>for free?</p>
      <p>In platform debut news, Amazon’s acclaimed <i>Honey Boy </i>opened in four theaters on Friday with a solid $288,824 weekend. The good news is that gives the autobiographical Shia LeBeouf flick (where he plays his own father) an excellent $72,206 per-theater average. The bad news is that the film earned $105,920 on Friday alone, giving the film a mere (for a platform release) 2.72x weekend multiplier. This was never going to be a mainstream smash, but well see how it holds up as it expands over the next month.</p>
