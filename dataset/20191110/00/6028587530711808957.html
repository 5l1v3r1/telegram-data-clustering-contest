      <p>WWE has been changing up its rosters with some huge moves–including the Universal and WWE Championships switching shows–and now, many of its biggest superstars could be undergoing significant character transformations in the form of major babyface turns.Over the past several months, a number of marquee stars have already switched from one side of the babyface/heel alignment to the other. Former world champions like AJ Styles and Finn Balor have turned heel while the opposite is true of fellow world champions Kevin Owens and Daniel Bryan, who already find themselves ranking among the most popular fan favorites in the entire company in their new roles. As WWE’s viewership for <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/how-was-this-week-wwe-raw-viewership-with-crown-jewel-661781/">Raw</a>, <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/10/wwe-smackdown-viewership-down-from-last-week-660945/">SmackDown</a> and <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/aew-dynamite-and-wwe-nxt-viewership-increase-this-week-661876/">NXT</a> all have disappointed in recent months, WWE will need to take some more calculated risks in attempt to create new stars who can carry the company into the future.</p>
      <p>The success of WWE’s babyface stars depends heavily upon the ability of the creative team to book them in engaging storylines that make fans want to cheer them. On that same token, however, many stars get over with the crowd organically–Becky Lynch is a prime example of this–to the point that WWE is left with no choice but to turn them babyface. In looking at WWE’s current roster, it’s not difficult to see that there are many marquee names who are either naturally gaining the support of the crowd or are in desperate need of a character change, which may necessitate a full-fledged babyface turn.</p>
      <p>Here are five huge face turns WWE is clearly building toward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shinsuke Nakamura Or Sami Zayn</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Will it be Shinsuke Nakamura or Sami Zayn who turns on his partner?<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sami Zayn is current serving as the obnoxious mouthpiece for Shinsuke Nakamura, a mutually beneficial move that gives Nakamura the manager he desperately needs while giving Zayn the opportunity to <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/backstage-news-on-why-wwe-put-sami-zayn-with-shinsuke-661888/">recover from injury</a> and showcase his elite mic skills.</p>
      <p>But the end goal of their partnership? For the two stars to eventually feud. According to WrestleVotes (h/t <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/08/new-sami-zayn-shinsuke-nakamura-storyline-possibly-leading-658903/">Wrestling Inc</a>), “one of the ideas discussed for the Nakamura - Zayn storyline when it was decided on was to eventually resemble the friendship storyline with Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho from 2016 and 2017. This would lead to a ‘big time blowoff match’ between the two.” The unforgettable Owens/Jericho storyline is one of the best storylines WWE has done in recent years, and it helped set the stage for Owens to eventually morph into a top-level babyface a couple of years later.</p>
      <p>WWE could and should take a similar route with Zayn and Nakmura, two stars who have both demonstrated the ability to perform well as a heel or babyface and could benefit in a major way from a well-executed babyface turn. It’s not clear which star would be the one to turn, but one could argue that Nakamura–who’s consistently fallen down the card during his tenure on the main roster–needs it more than Zayn, who is surprisingly better as a heel due to his abilities as a talker.</p>
      <p>Nakamura once had one of the strongest crowd connections of anyone on the main roster, and given the right booking of a split with Zayn, he could immediately reestablish that and give WWE another top fan favorite to build around on SmackDown.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lacey Evans</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5da46e63cd594c000620fb67/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>WWE may be grooming Lacey Evans to be its next big babyface.<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After WWE <a href="http://www.pwmania.com/wwes-nixed-plans-for-lacey-evans-at-wrestlemania-35-ariya-daivari-miz-maryse">nixed huge WrestleMania 35 plans</a> for Lacey Evans and then had her fall short in her Raw Women’s Championship feud with Becky Lynch, it looked like she was destined to get lost in midcard purgatory.</p>
      <p>But Evans’ recent feud with Natalya shockingly resulted in WWE teasing that it would transition Evans, a very natural heel, into a babyface role, or so it would seem. Perhaps because the WWE Draft left SmackDown without a clear-cut No. 1 babyface in the women’s division, Evans appears to be in the early stages of a face turn that could catapult her to the top of the card on the blue brand. After all, Evans reportedly <a href="https://www.ewrestlingnews.com/news/vince-mcmahon-reportedly-high-on-lacey-evans">has one huge supporter in Vince McMahon</a>, who sees her as “the next big superstar” in the women’s division, which explains why she was chosen to wrestle Natalya in the history-making first-ever women’s match in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>While it’s apparent by the way she’s been pushed that Evans has a lot of supporters in WWE, it remains to be seen just how much WWE will commit to a full-blown face turn for the rising superstar. Though Evans is a great public representative for the company and always does well in media interviews and appearances, she has been booked so poorly on the main roster–where she’s been forced into too big of a role too soon–that she’s got a lot of work to do to get fans on her side, especially after she became so hated as a heel and didn’t turn babyface organically.</p>
      <p>But alas, Evans’ military background, look and athletic ability make her the perfect candidate to be pushed as a huge fan favorite moving forward, even if the crowd doesn’t buy into it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Samoa Joe</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Samoa Joe has been long overdue for a babyface turn.<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/10/samoa-joe-currently-out-of-action-with-injury-660524/">breaking his thumb</a>, Samoa Joe has been out of the storyline loop over the past few months, only appearing as a guest analyst during the WWE Draft.</p>
      <p>Joe did a fantastic job in that role, one in which he ultimately shed his heel persona, but wound up slipping in the draft–at least in storyline–as a result of that injury. During his appearances as an analyst and as part of the “whodunit?” storyline involving Roman Reigns and Bryan, Joe certainly seemed to be portraying more of a babyface character, which has led to speculation that he will soon become a fan favorite on the main roster for the first time. While Joe is a phenomenal heel, WWE has largely booked him poorly in that role, where he’s been used simply as someone for top stars like Brock Lesnar and Styles to beat.</p>
      <p>That’s a monumental waste of talent because Joe is clearly one of WWE’s best all-around performers, and as someone who was <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2018/09/samoe-joe-reveals-that-he-was-the-number-two-merchandise-645523/">once WWE’s No. 2 merchandise seller</a>, he obviously has a great connection with the WWE Universe as well, one that could solidify him as a huge babyface with the right booking. Joe has long been a cult favorite of sorts among WWE fans, and because he’s also been underutilized on the main roster, he is one of those stars who fans would really get behind with the proper push.</p>
      <p>And given that WWE has exhausted all its options with Joe as a heel, why not bring him back as a face?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Randy Orton</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5da46e9f6763cb000608a7ff/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>WWE has been testing out a potential face turn for "The Viper."<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Even though Randy Orton has a <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2017/09/randy-orton-is-sick-of-being-a-babyface-632668/">well-known disdain for performing as a babyface</a>, WWE recently <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2017/09/randy-orton-is-sick-of-being-a-babyface-632668/">“tested” out a potential face run</a> for “The Viper” by having him work as a fan favorite during an untelevised segment.</p>
      <p>If you look at and listen to the crowd reaction that Orton has been generating in 2019, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that–despite technically being a heel–he is one of the most popular superstars in the entire company. Even though Orton spent much of this year feuding with two incredibly popular babyfaces in Styles (a face at the time) and Kofi Kingston, his RKO finisher is such a big hit among fans that anytime he hits it the crowd goes absolutely bonkers. If it wasn’t for the RKO, WWE might have a much easier time booking Orton as a heel, but every time he hits an RKO out of nowhere in impressive fashion, he becomes even more popular.</p>
      <p>While Raw could really use Orton as a heel given that it already has a few top babyfaces in names like Ricochet, Rey Mysterio, Seth Rollins and Kevin Owens, it wouldn’t be surprising to see that positive crowd reaction essentially force WWE to book Orton as a babyface going forward, especially with <a href="https://lordsofpain.net/randy-orton-confirms-new-five-year-deal/">Orton locked down under a new five-year contract</a>. Of course, Orton’s character doesn’t have the flexibility as a good guy that it does as a villain, but because he’s grown to be so respected as a performer and because his RKO is one of the most popular finishing moves in WWE history, keeping him as a heel may prove to be impossible.</p>
      <p>And if the crowd wants Orton as a face, WWE should listen. At the very least, he should be a tweener, right?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bray Wyatt</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5da46fd7db402600061ffca9/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>WWE may have a difficult time keeping Bray Wyatt heel.<cite>WWE.com</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Despite some very questionable booking of Bray Wyatt thus far, WWE’s reported long-term plan is <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/the-fiend-bray-wyatt-is-getting-a-lot-of-praise-from-his-peers-in-wwe/">to turn “The Fiend” into one of the company’s biggest babyfaces</a>.</p>
      <p>One could argue, however, that WWE has already inadvertently accomplished that goal during Wyatt’s feud with Seth Rollins that has made Rollins come across as an unlikable heel while simultaneously causing fans to rally behind Wyatt. As has been the case with other stars with characters similar to Wyatt’s (think: The Undertaker and Kane), it is virtually impossible for a talented and unique performer like Wyatt to remain a heel when he’s consistently knocking it out of the park with his performances as one of the most innovative characters in WWE history.</p>
      <p>An effectively booked heel Wyatt could thrive in that role for years, but when WWE skyrocketed “The Fiend” to the top of the card only to pull back on his push as soon as he challenged for the Universal title, WWE made him a huge babyface–whether it intended to or not. Wyatt ultimately went on to win the Universal Championship at Crown Jewel, and it was there that WWE <a href="https://wrestletalk.com/news/report-wwe-planning-seth-rollins-fiend-double-turn/">seriously considered a huge double turn</a>, with Rollins getting a much needed heel turn and Wyatt embracing the cheers to become a full-fledged babyface.</p>
      <p>For now, Wyatt and Rollins have moved on from one another, but the possibility of Wyatt officially turning babyface certainly remains as he continues to morph into one of the company’s most popular stars.</p>
