      <p>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> surged eight points clear at the top of the Premier League by beating Manchester City 3-1 on Sunday, establishing a strong lead after 12 rounds.</p>
      <p>Fabinho and Mohamed Salah scored inside the opening 13 minutes before Sadio Mane headed in after the break to make it 11 wins out of 12 for unbeaten <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>, which is chasing its first championship since 1990.</p>
      <p>Further hindering City’s pursuit of a third straight title, Leicester and Chelsea are directly behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> while the champions are nine points behind in fourth place. </p>
      <p>Just a point separated City and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> when the season ended in May. The gulf is vast now between the English and European champions.</p>
      <p>Where last season’s title race was tense and thrilling, Juergen Klopp’s path to the title looks smooth.</p>

      <p>Even the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> fans reined in their rancor for the City bus arrival at Anfield. No hurling of objects or smashing of windows like in 2018. Just a chorus of jeers as the visiting coach snaked around the narrow streets into the stadium as a haze of red smoke formed.</p>
      <p>City thought it was the referee’s vision obscured after five minutes when a penalty wasn’t awarded for Trent Alexander-Arnold’s outstretched right arm handling the ball. But City midfielder Bernardo Silva had already helped the ball on with his hand in contravention of the new laws of the game.</p>
      <p>With play continuing, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a> launched a counterattack that saw Mane charge down the left flank from inside his own half.</p>
      <p>A cross into the penalty area was half-cleared to Fabinho who struck from distance past Claudio Bravo, who was filling in for the injured Ederson.</p>

        <p>A VAR review confirmed referee Michael Oliver was right not to roll back play and award City a penalty at the other end, much to Pep Guardiola’s fury on the City bench.</p>
        <p>And City’s makeshift defense was breached again in the 13th minute, again from a rapid move down the left.</p>
        <p>When Andy Robertson sent a cross into the penalty area, Salah got ahead of Fernandinho to head past Bravo.</p>
        <p>But far from being demoralized, City made the rest of the half uncomfortable for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liverpool/">Liverpool</a>.</p>
        <p>Left back Angelino, on only his second Premier League start, saw a shot deflect off the post. And Sergio Aguero dragged a shot wide in a stadium where he has not scored now in eight appearances.</p>
        <p>Any prospect of a comeback appeared to be extinguished six minutes into the second half when City was picked apart from another cross.</p>
        <p>Mane got on the end of Jordan Henderson’s delivery from the right, heading in at the back post.</p>
        <p>On a frustrating trip across the northwest for City, Bernardo Silva pulling one back in the 78th minute with a low strike was as good as it got.</p>
