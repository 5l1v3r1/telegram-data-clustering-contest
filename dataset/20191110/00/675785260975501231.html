      <h1>Arsenal face Bernd Leno transfer battle as Bayern Munich 'eye Manuel Neuer replacement'</h1>
      <h2>Bundesliga giants are reportedly lining up a swoop for Leno after Neuer suffered injuries and loss of form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T00:51:12+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 00:51</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal will face a battle to keep hold of goalkeeper Bernd Leno this summer as Bayern Munich are reportedly lining him up as a replacement for Manuel Neuer.</p>
      <p>Germany's first-choice keeper Neuer was once regarded as the best in the world, but the 33-year-old has suffered with injuries and loss of form.</p>
      <p>Neuer's contract with Bayern is due to expire in the summer of 2021 - so the Bundesliga giants must weigh up whether to bring in a younger keeper and recoup some cash from selling their current No1.</p>
      <p>And Gunners keeper <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bernd-leno">Leno</a> is high on Bayern's list of potential replacements, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10313670/arsenal-transfer-news-bernd-leno-bayern-munich-neuer/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen would be their first choice, but Bayern recognise it would be difficult to tempt the Catalans into selling.</p>

      <p>Leno is Germany's third-choice keeper behind Neuer and Ter Stegen.</p>
      <p>And his Premier League experience since joining <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for £19.3 million from Bayer Leverkusen last year makes him an attractive proposition.</p>
      <p>Leno has put in some impressive performances between the sticks for Arsenal, but has kept only two clean sheets in 12 Premier League games this season.</p>
      <p>There have been serious question marks over the Gunners' defence all season, which has not helped Leno, with Arsenal now down to sixth in the Premier League following Saturday's 2-0 defeat to high-flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City.</p>

      <p>Last month, <i>Mirror Football</i> reported that Leno <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bernd-lenos-dismal-record-should-20636894">has the worst clean sheets record</a> of all the goalkeepers who have played for Arsenal in the Premier League era.</p>
      <p>Leno had averaged one clean sheet every five games since his league debut against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> in September 2018.</p>
      <p>That is two matches more than any other keeper in Arsenal's history.</p>
      <p>Legendary Gunners keeper David Seaman managed one every 2.4 matches, while Jens Lehmann kept the opposition at bay every 2.7 games.</p>

      <p>They were beaten by Alex Manninger (2.1) who holds the best record having played significantly less games.</p>
      <p>Petr Cech, who joined Arsenal from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in 2015 before retiring at the end of last season, averaged one every 2.8 matches.</p>
      <p>Neuer, meanwhile, kept a clean sheet for Bayern as they beat Borussia Dortmund 4-0 on Saturday to climb to third in the Bundesliga table.</p>
