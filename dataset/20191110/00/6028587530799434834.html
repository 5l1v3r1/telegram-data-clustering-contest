      <p>John Gokongwei Jr., chairman emeritus of JG Summit, one of Philippine's largest conglomerates, died Saturday evening in Manila at the age of 93. Gokongwei, whose control of JG Summit had helped make him <a href="https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/6ZwwCDkwn3sMDRmmfW_r0s">Philippines' third-wealthiest person</a>, had a net worth of $5.8 billion at the time of his death.The Cebu-native was the eldest of six siblings and grew up in an affluent ethnic Chinese family, until his father, an owner of movie theaters, died of typhoid fever. The family soon discovered that much of his father's business was built on debt, forcing Gokongwei to drop out of school at age 15 and help the family make ends meet.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei sold everything from soaps and tires and later traveled to the U.S. to source secondhand goods --shoes, clothing, and newspapers, among other items-- to sell back in Cebu. In 1957, he entered the cornstarch business and caught his big break.</p>
      <p>Together with his brother, James Go, 13 years his junior and a gifted student who studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he expanded the business and in 1993 took JG Summit public on the Philippine Stock Exchange; by then the company had raked in $135 million in sales. By its 50th anniversary in 2007, sales had reached $1.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Today JG Summit has interests in air transportation, telecommunications, banking, food, power, and property. His brother, Go, remains at the helm as chairman and chief executive, posts he has held since 2002. Gokongwei had retired in 2001.</p>
      <p>Gokongwei is survived by his wife Elizabeth and six children, some of whom are involved in different areas of the business. His only son, Lance, is president and also chief executive of JG Summit; eldest daughter, Robina, is the president of Robinson Retail, Philippines' second largest multi-format retailer; and another daughter, Lisa, runs Summit Media.</p>
