      <p>Chinese side FunPlus Phoenix have become the League of Legends world champions after beating European side G2 Esports 3-0 in the grand final at the Accorhotels Arena in Paris, France. FunPlus Phoenix showed just how good they are in this series. While the first game of the best of five series was the closest as soon as the Chinese side got a big lead it was clear the momentum was in their favour, and they never lost it again. Game one lasted a whopping 40 minutes, but game two was just 25 minutes and then game three was 30 minutes long, although it was clear FunPlus Phoenix were playing safe to make sure they took home the championship. </p>
      <p>While many predicted that this would be a close final, it was in fact the exact opposite. FunPlus Phoenix looked in control of every single game and it seemed like G2 posed little threat for most of the series. What was supposed to be one of the best finals in Worlds history will probably be remembered as one of the more disappointing to ever take place. </p>
      <p>The rest of the tournament had featured some great matches between teams. Out of 11 best of five matches in the competition just two ended as a 3-0. One was Splyce vs Royal Youth in the Play In Stage, the other was the grand final between G2 Esports and FunPlus Phoenix. </p>
      <p>The win makes them the second Chinese team in a row to win the competition with Invictus Gaming lifting the Summoner’s Cup last year. Interesting IG also beat a European team, Fnatic, in the final with a 3-0 scoreline. Not only do FunPlus Phoenix become the World Champions, they will also take home a minimum of $834,375 and get their own skins in the game to immortalise their achievement forever. </p>
      <p>G2 Esports will undoubtedly be disappointed with the way they lost the final, but for them it has been a massively successful year. They won the Mid Season Invitational, dominated the LEC in both Spring and Summer, and made it to the final of Worlds. Few European teams have ever had a season as successful as that. </p>
      <p>Now the competitive League of Legends scene will take a break for the off season, before the regional leagues will one again get under way at the start of next year for a new season that will eventually build up to another World Championship. Maybe Europe will finally go all the way next year.</p>
