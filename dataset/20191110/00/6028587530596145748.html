      <p>She may be one of the most beloved pop stars in the U.K. right now, but even Dua Lipa’s new smash couldn’t dethrone Tones And I, who rules the singles ranking in that country for a sixth consecutive frame. The Australian talent’s breakout tune is now the third-longest-running leader of 2019, coming in just behind Lewis Capaldi’s “Someone You Loved” (seven weeks) and Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber’s “I Don’t Care” (eight weeks). Dua Lipa’s comeback single (though she never really went anywhere) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oygrmJFKYZY">“Don’t Start Now”</a> narrowly misses becoming her third chart-topper, but it does kick the second era of her career off nicely. The catchy cut is now her seventh top 10. The song is assumed to be the first taste of the pop singer’s upcoming sophomore album.</p>
      <p>Behind “Don’t Start Now,” no new tracks enter the top 10, and this frame’s uppermost region remains fairly stagnant.</p>
      <p>DJ Regard slips from second place to third with his sole hit “Ride It,” which is pushed out of the runner-up rung by Dua Lipa’s immediate success. Behind that track, a pair of giants trade places, as Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Cardi B’s “South of the Border” returns to its No. 4 high point while Post Malone’s “Circles” falls from fourth to fifth.</p>
      <p>After reaching a peak of No. 3 last frame, Selena Gomez’s “Lose You to Love Me” descends three spots to No. 6, landing just ahead of Lizzo’s first top 10 “Good as Hell” at No. 7 and Maroon 5’s “Memories at No. 8. Both of those two titles are stationary from the previous week.</p>
      <p>Once again, two songs swap spots, with Lewis Capaldi’s “Bruises” climbing from No. 10 to No. 9 while Dermot Kennedy’s “Outnumbered” does the exact opposite.</p>
