        <li>59% of enterprises consider data science and machine learning critical to their business in 2019.  </li>
        <li>48% of enterprises say Cloud BI is either critical or very important to their operations, which is an all-time high for the survey.  </li>
        <li>Marketing &amp; Sales and R&amp;D place the highest levels of importance on IoT today.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing, Financial Services/Insurance, and Technology enterprises are the most likely to describe IoT technologies as critical to their business.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These and many other fascinating insights are from <a href="http://dresneradvisory.com/">Dresner Advisory Associates’</a> <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/IHLIk"><i>2019 Edition of IoT Intelligence</i><sup><i>® </i></sup><i>Market Study</i></a><i> </i>now in its 5<sup>th</sup> year of publication. Internet of Things, or IoT, is defined as the network of physical objects, or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to collect and exchange data. The study reviews organizations’ interest in and demand for applying business intelligence (BI) to IoT data, systems, and processes. R&amp;D and Marketing &amp; Sales departments assign the highest levels of IoT importance, as do larger manufacturing, financial services/insurance, and technology organizations. Please see page 11 of the study for specifics regarding the methodology and respondent demographics.</p>
      <p>Key insights from the study include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Marketing &amp; Sales and R&amp;D place the highest levels of importance on IoT today, significantly above IT, executive management, and finance.</b> Dresner’s research team interprets the results as Marketing, Sales, and R&amp;D partnering to experiment and develop new products, services, and business models that capable of delivering revenue growth. <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/news/digital-engineering/">Capgemini’s Digital Transformation Institute predicts the global manufacturing industry could expect to see between $519B to $685B in value-added revenue by 2020</a> through the development and sale of smart, connected devices.</li>

        <li><b>Manufacturing companies consider IoT technologies the most critical to their operations than any other industry included in the study.</b> Financial Services/Insurance and Technology-based businesses are also most likely to consider IoT critical technology for their current business operations. Advertising and Healthcare assign the least importance to IoT in their operations today.</li>

        <li> <b>IoT’s importance increases as an enterprises’ size increases, reflecting the higher number of digital initiatives, new products, services, and business models under development large-scale organizations can take on.</b> Dresner’s research team found that IoT is the most valued in enterprises with more than 1,000 employees. An interesting from the study is how between 4% to 6% of all organizations, small to large, consider IoT critical today.</li>

        <li><b>Enterprises are prioritizing investments in data supply chains and IoT analytics this year.</b> Dresner’s research team observes that enterprises are defining IoT as an integrated series of technologies, ranging from sensors at the infrastructure level to data collection, storage systems that together comprise the data supply chain, in addition to investments in IoT analytics. Investments in technologies enabling data supply chains are leading all three categories this year.  </li>

        <li><b>Those championing IoT adoption or IoT Advocates have more significant expertise and insight into how best to apply big data, data mining, IoT, and IT analytics to enterprise challenges than the overall sample of respondents</b>. One of the most valuable insights from the study is how critical the role IoT champions or IoT Advocates are to the successful adoption of IoT technologies today. Members of the R&amp;D, Marketing, and Sales teams are leading the advocacy efforts across the majority of enterprises today.</li>

        <li><b>Enterprises’ adoption of data science and machine learning techniques is broadening, as evidenced by nine different features being considered critical and very important in 2019.</b>  The scope of data science and machine learning techniques enterprises are experimenting with and adopting into production scenarios is increasing.  The most popular among these features support traditional statistical methods, including range of regression models, hierarchical clustering, and textbook statistical functions. These three leading features are, at minimum, important to more than 90% percent of 2019 responding enterprises.</li>

        <li><b>48% of enterprises say Cloud BI is either critical or very important to their operations, which is an all-time high for the survey.</b>  Compared to the early years of the study, Cloud BI appears to have conquered skepticism and crossed a threshold of credibility, according to the Dresner research team. The three most popular features contributing to Cloud BI’s growing adoption are advanced visualization, ad-hoc query, and personalized dashboards.</li>

        <li><b>One of the enterprises’ most significant challenges about Cloud BI adoption is closing the gap in awareness of security standards.</b> Dresner’s research team continues to find gaps in the awareness of security standards across enterprises. This year’s most-required standards (for personal data protection, cloud-specific controls, and payment card security) are requirements to only 30% of enterprises.</li>

        <li><b>Google Analytics and Salesforce continue to be the two most popular Cloud BI third-party data connectors with enterprises today.</b> MySQL is the only third cloud BI data connector that has shown adoption momentum year over year in the study’s history. As each Cloud BI data connector is unique and deployed to enable a specific business outcome, each connectors’ level of adoption needs to be compared historically to get the best possible context.  </li>
