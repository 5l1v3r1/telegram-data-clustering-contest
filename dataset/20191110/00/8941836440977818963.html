      <p>CHICAGO (AP) - For <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">James Harden</a>, a missed shot simply means the odds of him making the next one improve.</p>
      <p>That attitude served the All-Star guard well Saturday night as he rebounded from a slow start to put up big numbers again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> narrowly missed his first triple-double of the season, finishing with 42 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Houston Rockets</a> pulled away in the second half and beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Chicago Bulls</a> 117-94.</p>
      <p>After going 2 for 7 (including 1 for 5 on 3-pointers) in the first quarter, he went 10 for 20 the rest of the game, including 8 for 14 on 3’s.</p>
      <p>“That’s the confidence I have,” he said. “That’s the confidence that I’ve built off of the work I put in. It’s more of a mindset.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nba/">NBA</a>’s leading scorer, entered the game averaging 36.5 points on 38.7% shooting, including 27% on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>“I feel like a broken record sometimes, but he’s a master of getting what he wants,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> coach Mike D’Antoni said of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>. “I think sometimes he might get bored in the game and tries different stuff.”</p>
      <p>Russell Westbrook scored 26 points as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> won their third straight.</p>
      <p>Wendell Carter Jr. had 13 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago, which has dropped six of eight.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> were a woeful 4-for-32 shooting from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>“I know how well we can shoot and tonight we just didn’t make them,” Chicago forward Lauri Markkanen said.</p>
        <p>Chicago led 27-20 after one quarter behind eight points from Markkanen and eight <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> turnovers.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> led by nine points (31-22) early in the second before the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> used a 24-7 run to take control and open a 46-38 lead with four minutes left in the first half. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> had nine points during the run.</p>
        <p>Chicago closed within 50-49 at halftime on a 3-pointer by Zach LaVine. That was the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> second make in 17 first-half attempts from long range. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> quickly reclaimed control with a 30-9 run in the opening 9:41 of the third, taking an 80-58 advantage.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> had an 86-67 lead entering the fourth, helped by 7-for-14 shooting from 3-pointers range in the third. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a> led the way with 11 points in the quarter.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> couldn’t get closer than 14 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>“I think we did really good in the first half; they just broke it open in the third quarter,” LaVine said. “We played a good first half and a bad second half.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/james-harden/">Harden</a>, who has 35 regular-season triple-doubles in his career, had several minutes of garbage time in the fourth quarter to get additional assists, but was unsuccessful before leaving with a little more than three minutes remaining.</p>
        <p>“I didn’t even know I was one assist away,” he said. “I’m happy we won, though.”</p>
        <p>NUMBERS GAME</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> went 19 for 44 (43.2 on 3-pointers to clearly outclass the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> from behind the arc.</p>
        <p>“They made 19 threes, we made four, so we lost the 3-point line by 45 points,” Chicago coach Jim Boylen said. “It’s hard to win a game.”</p>
        <p>DEFENSE</p>
        <p>Westbrook believes the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a> had a lot to do with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a>‘ poor shooting.</p>
        <p>“If you’re gonna win in this league, you’ve got to defend,” he said. “There are no nights off. You’ve got to defend every single night against some tough teams.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston-rockets/">Rockets</a>: G Eric Gordon (left hamstring) returned after sitting out Wednesday against Golden State. He had nine points and 21 minutes off the bench. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> has won the last seven games against Chicago, including the last four at the United Center.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a>: F Otto Porter sat out with a left foot sprain.
