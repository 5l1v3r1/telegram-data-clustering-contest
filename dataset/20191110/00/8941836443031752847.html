      <p>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) - Even Jürgen Klopp cannot quite believe Liverpool’s lead over Manchester City this early in the season.</p>
      <p>“That’s crazy, nine points,” the Liverpool manager said. “You cannot imagine that something like this can happen.”</p>
      <p>It’s very real after Liverpool beat City 3-1 on Sunday thanks to goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“Other people 100% said already that from now on Liverpool can only lose it,” Klopp said. “Well that’s a very negative approach, but you can see it like this. We don’t care.”</p>
      <p>Only 12 games have been played, with another 26 to go in the pursuit of a first title since 1990 for the 18-time English champions.</p>

      <p>Klopp is not getting carried away despite Liverpool’s top spot.</p>
      <p>“But it’s not important because who wants to be first in early November,” Klopp said. “You want to be first in May.”</p>
      <p>For the past two seasons that position has been held by City. Now the two-time defending champions head into the international break down in fourth place.</p>
      <p>The side immediately above them is not so unexpected, even if Chelsea’s ability to reinforce the squad was hampered by a transfer ban. But it’s the presence of Leicester in second place, reviving memories of its incredible 5,000-1 shot title win in 2016, that is shaking up the league.</p>

        <p>It leaves the record 20-time champions far from sight of the Champions League places, even after Manchester United beat Brighton 3-1 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>United is nine points adrift of neighbor City in seventh place. Wolverhampton is only behind United on goal difference after beating Aston Villa 2-1 in a central England derby on Sunday.</p>
