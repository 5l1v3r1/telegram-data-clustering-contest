      <h1>Winston throws for 358 yards, Bucs beat Cardinals 30-27</h1>

      <p>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Jameis Winston threw for 358 yards and one touchdown, helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rally to snap a four-game losing streak with a 30-27 victory over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Matt Gay kicked three field goals and Peyton Barber scored on a 1-yard run to finish a 92-yard, game-winning drive Winston put together after the Bucs (3-6) ended Kyler Murray’s NFL rookie record streak of 211 consecutive pass attempts without an interception.</p>
      <p>Barber’s TD with less than two minutes left was set up by a booth review that determined Cardinals safety Jalen Thompson committed pass interference against Mike Evans in the end zone, giving Tampa Bay a first down at the Arizona 1.</p>
      <p>Murray threw for 324 yards and three TDs to Christian Kirk, whose 15-yard scoring reception put the Cardinals up 27-23 midway through the fourth quarter. Kirk also scored on receptions of 33 and 69 yards and finished with six catches for 138 yards.</p>
      <p>Murray, the first overall pick in this year’s draft, set the rookie record for most pass attempts without an interception on an 11-yard completion to Larry Fitzgerald, moving ahead of Derek Carr (2014) and Dak Prescott (2016) who both had streaks of 176 consecutive passes without an interception in their first seasons.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The 2018 Heisman Trophy winner hadn’t thrown an interception since Sept. 29, a span of six games in which the Cardinals (3-6-1) have gone 3-3.</p>
      <p>Arizona also hurt its chances by losing a fumble for the first time all season and a huge second-half drop by tight end Maxx Williams that cost the Cardinals a sure touchdown early in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Winston, meanwhile, overcame throwing two interceptions - one of which led to a field goal - with a 10-yard TD pass to O.J. Howard and leading 60-yard drive that Ronald Jones finished with a 7-yard scoring run.</p>
