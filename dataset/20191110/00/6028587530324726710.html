      <p>In holdover news for the weekend, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>continued to underperform in North America, earning $10.8 million (-63%) in weekend two for a $48.587 million ten-day cume. It’s a sign that making a better sequel couldn’t save a franchise for which general audiences stopped caring decades ago. The Linda Hamilton/Arnold Schwarzenegger/Natalia Reyes/Mackenzie Davis/Gabriel Luna flick will end its domestic run with around $65-$70 million domestic. That’s about what <i>Rise of the Machines </i>earned in its first five days and what <i>Terminator: Salvation </i>earned ($65 million) in its Thurs-Mon Memorial Day launch back in 2009. The film is being released in North America by Paramount but everywhere else (save China) by Fox/Disney. It earned an additional $29.9 million overseas, including a chart-topping $6 million debut in Japan, for a new $150.9 million overseas cume (including $45 million in China) and $199.2 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>It earned 26% of its money in North America this weekend, compared to 24% of its money earned in the running total, meaning China’s opening inflated the overseas might last weekend. At this rate, it’ll end its run with around $65-$70 million domestic and around $270 million worldwide. Yes, I’m been beating the drum on this one’s failure, because, like <i>Dark Phoenix</i>, it’s an example of the studios looking at the threat posed by VOD and streaming and giving theatrical audiences exactly what they don’t want.</p>

      <p>Warner Bros.’ <i>Joker </i>earned another $9.2 million (-32%) in its sixth weekend, giving the Joaquin Phoenix drama a $313.492 million 36-day domestic cume. The film had a sixth-weekend gross right between <i>Avengers: Endgame </i>($8 million) and <i>Avengers: Infinity War </i>($10.5 million). If it continues to hold like this, and it’s warded off <i>Gemini Man</i>, <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</i>, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>and <i>Doctor Sleep</i>, we could see a domestic final gross closer to $340 million than $325 million.</p>
      <p>It’ll pass <i>Thor: Ragnarök </i>($315 million in 2017)<i> </i>in a few days. And, yeah, it’s still pulling ridiculous numbers overseas. The film became, in terms of budget versus gross, the most profitable comic book movie ever late last week. With a new cume of $671 million overseas and $984 million worldwide, it’s now about a week away from topping the $1 billion mark. When it tops <i>The Dark Knight </i>($1.004 billion in 2008), it’ll be the biggest global grosser, sans inflation or exchange rates, ever to never play in China.</p>
      <p>In better news for Disney, <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>continued to somewhat compensate for a merely “eh” domestic performance with comparatively robust overseas box office. The Angelina Jolie sequel earned $8 million (-38%) in North America this weekend and $19.9 million overseas in 57 territories, giving it a $97.3 million domestic, $333 million overseas and $430.3 million worldwide cume. That’s not great for a $185 million sequel, but a $475 million cume isn’t a disaster, especially when you factor the film’s value as an A-level Disney+ offering.  </p>

        <figcaption>'Harriet'<cite>Focus Features</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Buoyed by an A+ Cinemascore grade, Focus Features’ <i>Harriet </i>earned $7.23 million (-38%) weekend for a new $23.463 million ten-day cume. That’s not huge for Cynthia Erivos’ $17 million Harriet Tubman biopic, but it’s a solid performance thus far that points to a $40 million domestic finish. In a refreshing change of pace, people who claim to want a (perfectly solid) Harriet Tubman biopic, one directed by Kasi Lemmons no less, actually showed up for <i>Harriet</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Jojo Rabbit </i>will earn $3.9 million this weekend (+71%) as Fox Searchlight expanded it to 802 theaters, giving Taika Waititi’s World War II/Nazi comedy a decent $9.1 million 24-day domestic cume. Neon’s <i>Parasite </i>continued to pack them in, relatively speaking. The Bong Joon Ho-directed thriller will earn $2.53 million (+0%) in 603 theaters for a terrific $11.3 million 31-day domestic cume. The South Korean thriller that has already earned $100 million worldwide. It’ll soon pass the domestic gross of <i>The Farewell </i>($17 million) to become the year’s biggest foreign-language release. </p>
      <p><i>The Addams Family </i>will have $91 million domestic after a $3.71 million (-55%) weekend as it’ll just miss $100 million domestic, but it already has earned $154 million worldwide (it’s distributed by United Artists in North America and Universal overseas) on a $42 million budget. Warner Bros.’ <i>Motherless Brooklyn </i>held surprisingly well in weekend two, with a $639,000 (-39%) Friday and a $2.27 million (-35%) weekend. That’s still a terrible $7.427 million ten-day cume, but I digress.</p>
