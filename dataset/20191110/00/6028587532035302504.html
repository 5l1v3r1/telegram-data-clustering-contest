      <p>Zachary Winston, the younger brother of Michigan State All-America guard Cassius Winston, died Saturday when he was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in Albion, Michigan.</p>
      <p>Zachary Winston, 19, was a 6-foot-2 guard on the Division III Albion College basketball team. Albion played Michigan State in an exhibition on Oct. 29, but Zachary did not play due to injury.</p>
      <p>Michigan State planned to have a moment of silence in Winston’s honor before its game Sunday night against Binghamton. According to Brendan Quinn of The Athletic, Cassius Winston was dressed and expected to play Sunday night. His youngest brother Khy, a freshman on the Albion team, was seen comforting him before the game.</p>
      <p>“Our hearts are filled with sorrow for the Winston family,” Spartans coach Tom Izzo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Their pain over the sudden loss of Zachary is unimaginable. It’s impossible to find the right words in this moment, other than to say that we will support the family in whatever way they need.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2019/11/10/michigan-state-cassius-winston-brother-dies-hit-train/2554882001/">According to the Detroit Free Press</a>, Amtrak media relations spokeswoman Kimberly D. Woods said via email the Amtrak 355 Wolverine Train bound for Chicago “came into contact with a person on the track” at 8:41 p.m. and was temporarily suspended. There were 65 passengers on board, and there were no reported injuries on the train. Woods said the Albion Police Department is investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/11/10/zachary-winston-dies-brother-cassius-train/2555596001/?utm_source=feedblitz&amp;utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&amp;utm_campaign=usatoday-newstopstories">reported</a> “Albion Public Safety chief Scott Kipp told the Battle Creek Enquirer that Zachary Winston intentionally stepped in front of the train, according to his department’s interview with the engineer and based on further police investigation.”</p>
      <p>Zachary Winston averaged 2.6 points in 13.8 minutes per game last season as a freshman.</p>
      <p>“Last night, our family lost a student," Albion College said in a statement via the Free Press. "And as families do in difficult times, we must come together to mourn and to embrace one another. We have been in close contact with the student’s family and are doing everything we can to support them. In accordance with the family’s wishes, we are not sharing a name or details at this time. Please keep the family close in your heart. We plan to offer grief counseling to our community and will be sharing details later today."</p>
