      <h1>What does the SC judgment say on critical aspects of the long-standing dispute</h1>

      <p>The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court formulated 26 points to be determined by it in its judgment, which runs into 1,045 pages. Mumbai Mirror takes a look at a few critical aspects of the dispute, on which the judgment was delivered by a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer. <br/><br/><b>The issue of possession</b> <br/><br/>SC ruled that Hindus had proved possession of the outer courtyard, where they have continued worship, and that evidence presented by the Hindus was better than the one presented by Muslims so far as possessions of the disputed site was concerned. <br/><br/>On the inner courtyard, the SC said there was evidence on a “preponderance of probabilities” to establish worship by the Hindus prior to 1857 and the Muslims had offered no evidence to indicate that they were in exclusive possession of the inner structure prior to 1857 since the date of the construction in the sixteenth century. “The Hindus have established a clear case of a possessory title to the outside courtyard by virtue of long, continued and unimpeded worship at the Ramchabutra and other objects of religious significance,” the judgment reads. <br/><br/>The court, however, also observed that there is evidence to show that namaz was offered in the structure of the mosque and the last Friday namaz was on 16 December 1949. Neither side could conclusively prove possession to the inner courtyard, however, the SC observed, “The evidence in respect of the possessory claim of the Hindus to the composite whole of the disputed property stands on a better footing than the evidence adduced by the Muslims, the Muslims were dispossessed upon the desecration of the mosque on 22/23 December 1949 which was ultimately destroyed on 6 December 1992.” <br/><br/><b>On placing of idols in 1949 and demolition of the mosque in 1992<br/></b><br/>The Supreme Court criticised both the events. The court said that the ouster of Muslims in 1949 was not through any lawful authority “but through an act which was calculated to deprive them of their place of worship.” The court noted that worship of Hindu idols was permitted only after proceedings under Section 145 of CrPC were initiated and a receiver was appointed following the attachment of the inner courtyard. <br/><br/>“During the pendency of the suits, the entire structure of the mosque was brought down in a calculated act of destroying a place of public worship. The Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago,” the court observed. <br/><br/>“Justice would not prevail if the Court were to overlook the entitlement of the Muslims who have been deprived of the structure of the mosque through means which should not have been employed in a secular nation committed to the rule of law,” the bench added further. <br/><br/><b>Archaeological Survey of India’s report on structure before the Mosque<br/></b><br/>The SC observed that the Babri Masjid was not built “on a vacant land and that there was evidence of a temple-like structure having existed on the land before the mosque was built”. The SC, however, did not rule that the earlier structure was a temple. The judgment titled this aspect of the case as “the unanswered question of demolition”. <br/><br/><br/><b>Was the site of Babri Masjid thebirthplace of Ram<br/></b><br/>While the Hindus has claimed that the birth-place of Ram was beneath the central done of Babri Masjid, the Waqf Board submitted that the scriptures do not contain a reference to the site called Ram Janmabhumi, and there is an absence of evidence that the place below the central dome was worshipped prior to 1950 by the Hindus as the birth place of Lord Ram. They claimed that after 1855, the Chabutra was being worshipped as the place of birth of Lord Ram, which belies the notion that the place below the central dome was believed to represent Lord Ram‘s birth-place. However, the Court has steered clear from specifically stating whether the cite Babri Masjid was the birthplace of Lord Ram by holding that “faith is a matter for the individual believer,” and the only duty of the court would be to test if the belief is genuine and not test the basis of the belief. <br/><br/><b>Can Ram Janmabhumi be a legal entity?<br/></b><br/>SC refused to declare Ram Janmabhumi as a legal entity, saying, “The elevation of land to the status of a juristic person fundamentally alters its characteristics as immoveable property, a severe consequence against which a court must guard. Nor is it a valid safeguard to postulate that the court will decide on a case to case basis where a particular immoveable property should have a juristic status.”</p>
