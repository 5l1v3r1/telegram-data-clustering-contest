      <h1>‘The Walking Dead’ Ship Debate: Daryl And Carol Versus Daryl And Connie</h1>

      <p>There are not all that many “ships” in <i>The Walking Dead</i> compared to most other properties, mostly because this is a cast that keeps killing people off routinely, so it’s hard to root for couples when they keep getting split apart by murder (Glenn and Maggie), zombie munching (Rick and Lori) or elaborate disappearing acts (Rick and Michonne). Yet there is one character that is the subject of endless speculation in terms of his romantic prospects, or lack thereof, Daryl Dixon.</p>
      <p>Daryl has never had a true love interest in the series, not really, anyway. While every other character was getting paired off to some extent eventually, that never happened with Daryl. It got to the point where fans wondered if his sexuality was being suppressed, and eventually it would be revealed that Daryl was gay, which actor Norman Reedus said he would be totally open to.</p>
      <p>And yet that theory did not pan out. Today, we have two main camps of Daryl ships, Daryl and Carol, a saga which has been going on pretty much since the beginning of the series a decade ago, with both being season 1 characters, and Daryl and Connie, with Connie being a new character introduced this year. And fans get <i>heated</i> about this debate.</p>

        <b>Daryl and Carol</b>
      </p>
      <p>Daryl and Carol are quite literally the two OGs of the show at this point. There are now other season 1 cast members left, as even the lead of the series, Rick Grimes, has left at this point. Even Michonne didn’t really arrive in full until season 3.</p>
      <p>The two have always enjoyed a close, sometimes flirtatious, but mostly, completely platonic relationship. They are best friends, as Daryl said outright this past season, and yet fans are still rooting for them to get together in the end, believing them to be soulmates.</p>
      <p>While Daryl has had no true romantic interests in the last decade, Carol has had a few. When the show started she was still attached to her abusive husband, who was killed off quickly, and once she lost him, that’s when she started to grow attached to Daryl. Eventually, during a somewhat odd Alexandria arc, Carol ends up dating Tobin (who is dead now). Then of course, her most high profile relationship was with King Ezekiel, where for a spell, she became Queen Carol. But the Kingdom fell, their surrogate son Henry was killed and they split up with Ezekiel now dying of cancer, though Carol doesn’t yet know that. He has not had a great year.</p>
      <p>As much as I appreciate the relationship between Carol and Daryl, at this point it is genuinely hard to get behind the idea that the two are ever going to end up romantically linked. In theory, there’s no <i>real</i> reason for this not to happen. They’re both straight, a similar age, and clearly love each other. But just not like <i>that</i>, no matter how much a certain sect of fans may want that to happen. I do think there was some true flirtation between the two in earlier seasons, back on Hershel’s farm perhaps, but since then? It’s been very, very platonic.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Daryl and Connie</b>
      </p>
      <p>Less platonic? That would be Daryl and Connie, with Connie being the new arrival in Magna’s group. If the show is making it pretty clear that Daryl and Carol will stay platonic, it’s also making it equally clear that Daryl and Connie will probably not just stay friends. Kelly, Connie’s sister is wink wink nudge nudging her about Daryl at every turn. And much to the dismay of some fans, Carol is starting to press Daryl on Connie, and that is expanded on further in a scene in tonight’s episode I won’t get into, but the gist of it is “what’s going on there, Daryl buddy?”</p>
      <p>The Daryl and Connie storyline has been indisputably cute. She lights up whenever she sees him. He is learning signing language to speak with her better. His dog loves her. All the ingredients are there except for the fact that Daryl…just doesn’t date people. Last episode Connie told Daryl that he was “family” which doesn’t sound particularly sexy, and yet the entire vibe of this relationship is that these two will end up together at some point.</p>
      <p>If Connie doesn’t die first.</p>
      <p>In the past, I would say this was almost a guarantee. <i>The Walking Dead</i> is obsessed with tragedy, and killing off Connie to enrage Daryl against the Whisperers seems like a move they’d do. And yet I have more faith in the Angela Kang era of the show which seems less interested in cheap thrills like that, and more about developing real character relationships. I just can’t imagine they would build up this Daryl and Connie thing for two years only to fridge her right when it starts.</p>
      <p>With apologies to Daryl and Carol fans, I simply don’t think it’s going to happen. Granted this is TV and <i>The Walking Dead</i> feels like it’s going to be on forever, so never say never. But for now, Connie is the clear choice, and Carol and Daryl’s BFF status isn’t going anywhere.</p>
