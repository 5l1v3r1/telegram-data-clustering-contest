      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 10 — Pakatan Harapan (PH) must be given the mandate in the Tanjung Piai parliamentary by-election to continue the development agenda and programmes planned by the late Datuk Dr Md Farid Md Rafik.</p>
      <p>Bersatu secretary-general Datuk Marzuki Yahya said a victory for PH candidate Karmaine Sardini in the by-election would also ensure continuity of Dr Md Farid’s good work.</p>
      <p>“It’s such a waste if Dr Md Farid’s hard work is not appreciated and translated into (votes) in the by-election. Just look at his dedication to helping schools and implementing various community development programmes in the constituency.</p>
      <p>“If they don’t vote for Karmaine, how can we continue the late Dr Md Farid’s legacy,” the Deputy Foreign Minister told Bernama here today.</p>
      <p>On the district polling centres (PDM) which have been categorised as black, grey and white, Marzuki said PH had its own strategies to be used to reach out to voters.</p>
      <p>“Just like what we did in the 14th General Election (GE14), we will go all out to give explanations about current issues and government policies to the people,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also said that voters in Tanjung Piai were wise enough to decide which party was qualified and rejected racial politics.</p>
      <p>The Tanjung Piai seat fell vacant after Dr Md Farid, 42, who was also Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, died on September 21 due to heart complications.</p>
      <p>In GE14, Dr Md Farid of PH won the seat by a 524-vote majority in a three-cornered contest against Datuk Dr Wee Jeck Seng of Barisan Nasional (BN) and Nordin Othman of PAS.</p>
      <p>The polls will be a six-cornered fight between Karmaine, Wee from BN, Gerakan’s Wendy Subramaniam, Datuk Dr Badhrulhisham Abdul Aziz of Pan Malaysian Islamic Front (Berjasa) and two independent candidates — Faridah Aryani Abdul Ghaffar and Dr Ng Chuan Lock.</p>
      <p>The Election Commission (EC) has set November 16 as polling day for the Tanjung Piai by-election and November 12 for early voting. — Bernama</p>
