      <p>A bungling robber is being hunted following a brazen attempt to snatch a cash box outside Aldi.</p>
      <p>The botched robbery took place outside the busy budget supermarket in Birmingham Road, Great Barr, on Monday, November 4.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage shows the suspect - who is wearing a hi-vis jacket and a mask to hide his identity - running up to the security driver from behind. The would-be crook can then be seen making a grab for the container as a struggle ensues.</p>
      <p>Luckily the guard was unhurt as he fought off his assailant, who fled the scene empty handed in a silver Ford Mondeo.</p>
