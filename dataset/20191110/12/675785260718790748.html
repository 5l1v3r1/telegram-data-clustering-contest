      <h1>Coca-Cola confirms Christmas truck tour is returning for 2019</h1>
      <h2>It's official, holidays are coming and the Coca-Cola Christmas truck will once again be doing the rounds in the UK spreading festive cheer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:20:46+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>It's as synonymous with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> as the John Lewis advert.</p>
      <p>Each year, when you hear the jingle and see the illuminated red truck drive across your television screen, you know that holidays are most certainly coming.</p>
      <p>We're talking of course about the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coca-cola-christmas-truck-tour">Coca-Cola Christmas truck,</a> which features in the company's festive ads each year and goes out on a tour of the UK.</p>
      <p>And if you're yet to see the joly sight in person, then we've got some very good news for you - it's returning once again for Christmas 2019.</p>

      <p>No official tour dates or stops have been released as of yet.</p>

      <p>Coca-Cola's iconic trucks were first created in 1995 by the W.B. Doner Agency and back then they were known as 'Christmas Caravans'.</p>
      <p>The illuminated lorries were made more enchanting with special effects by the world-famous Industrial Light and Magic, the company behind the Star Wars films.</p>
      <p>Images of Santa Claus adorned the sides of the trucks, which were created by artist Haddon Sundblom.</p>
      <p>Since then, the iconic image has undergone various changes to become the fleet of trucks you see today.</p>
      <p>Last year the truck visited 24 different locations on its tour, including Glasgow, Exeter, Newcastle, Bristol, Manchester and London.</p>
