      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:19:54+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>Tom Zanetti has horrified fans by posing with a fake gun in a controversial publicity stunt made to look like an armed robbery.</p>
      <p>The DJ, 30, is promoting a new book and was seen holding up a copy of the novel as he posed for the picture with a dummy pistol in a corner shop.</p>
      <p>In the picture, Zanetti was seen holding a gun at the check-out while reading a copy of Nine Foot Tall by Daz Courtney.</p>
      <p>In the caption, he included a plug for the book but failed to explain the mocked up robbery scene.</p>
      <p>However, he later returned to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to hit back at critics who accused him of promoting gun crime with the tasteless stunt.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "I am not promoting gun crime, before anyone starts getting deep and overly critical.</p>
      <p>"I’m promoting the story in the fictional book. Millions of film covers, books and pictures of characters like Bond have pics of guns and more on them."</p>

      <p>However, it was too much for many fans who slammed the star for sharing such a controversial image.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Looks like an armed robbery to people who don't know the book. Why even promote the storyline."</p>
      <p>Another simply added: "Seriously" along with a despairing emoji.</p>
      <p>The stunt is part of Zanetti's bizarre publicity campaign for the book.</p>

      <p>Another showed him appearing to mock the devastating flooding that hit the country this week.</p>
      <p>He was seen standing naked in a pool of water reading the book.</p>
      <p>Zanetti wrote: "Even when the floods f**ked my night up I make time to read a chapter of ‘Nine Foot Tall’ sickest book I ever read."</p>
