      <h1>Retiring from the military led to a new career for Calgarian Scott Hausberg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:00:58+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Yolande Cole</a></address>
      <p>When Scott Hausberg joined the military, he thought it would be a temporary move, but by the time he retired 13 years ago, he had 25 years of combined service.</p>
      <p>After starting in the naval reserve in Calgary in the ’80s, then joining the regular force of the Royal Canadian Navy after a few years, Hausberg and his wife moved back to the city upon his retirement to be close to family. Luckily, the transition to the civilian workforce wasn’t that challenging, given the boom Calgary was experiencing at the time.</p>
      <p>But the first job Hausberg got at Shell Canada in 2006 was also thanks to the qualifications and experience he set himself up with to make the transition to the private sector easier.</p>
      <p>“One of the things the private sector doesn’t do very well is recognize the value that military people bring,” he said. “It really all comes down to, ‘Have you worked in this kind of job before? Do you have qualifications?’ So when I was about to make that transition, I worked beforehand to make sure that I had some of that stuff that they would be needing.”</p>
      <p>After obtaining his MBA through the military, Hausberg worked at Canadian Armed Forces headquarters in Ottawa in compensation and benefits — a field he had never been in before.</p>
      <p>“That’s one of the things the military does, they just throw you into a job and you figure it out, right? They say you’ve got the right skill sets … you’ll figure that out.”</p>
      <p>He soon discovered that he liked the work and that it could be something he could turn into a civilian occupation.</p>
      <p>“So on my own, I took some courses while I was working there and got a designation,” Hausberg said. “I was accepted on the civilian side, so that was part of my prep. And that’s what I’ve done ever since I got out.”</p>

      <p>Hausberg now works as a compensation consultant for Gallagher Benefit Services. Last year, when he was unemployed due to the downturn, he turned to the Forces@WORK program, where he got help with refining his resumé.</p>
      <p>He said there are now a lot more programs available to help veterans transition to the civilian workforce, compared to when he retired.</p>
      <p>“It was really here you go, you’re on your own,” he said. “And I got lucky with the timing of it, with the boom going on here in Calgary, but I’m sure it’s not always that great for some people.”</p>
