      <p>The battle of supremacy between Kohli and Smith was re-ignited when the Aussie decided to steal the show in the Ashes 2019. While Kohli continued to smashing every record that came his way during Smith’s one-year ban from the game, the latter came back and snatched the No. 1 spot in the Test rankings after his Ashes heroics. Chappell, a former Aussie skipper himself, reckons the two are massive headaches for coaches who base their approach on modern-day methods.</p>
      <p>“Kohli is a great role model for young players searching for a way to build their game for international success. He’s also a headache for coaches who theorise on modern methods and disparage traditional approaches as being old-time cricket. Smith and Kohli are adequate proof that batting is very much an individual exercise and whatever works for you is the correct method,” Chappell wrote, reported TimesNowNews.Com.</p>
      <p>“And therein lies the success to Smith’s batting; he’s fashioned a method that works for him and he’s been mentally strong enough to resist all attempts to alter his style. For all his eccentric movements and mannerisms, when Smith actually plays the ball he’s in a good position to execute his choice of shot,” Chappell added.</p>
