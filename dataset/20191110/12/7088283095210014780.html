        <b>A famous academic associated with ISSEP, a French institute founded by far-right politician Marion Maréchal, admitted to killing and dismembering his 24-year old student lover. He has since been expelled by the institute.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oleg Sokolov, a prominent Russian academic specialising in Napoleonic history, confessed to murdering his young lover and former student Anastasia Yeshchenko and dismembering her body.</p>
      <p>According to local media, the university professor was drunk and fell into the river as he tried to dispose of body parts.</p>
      <p>Sokolov told investigators he killed his lover during an argument and then sawed off her head, arms and legs.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly planning to dispose of her corpse and later publicly commit suicide dressed up as Napoleon.</p>
      <p>Police discovered the decapitated body of 24-year-old Anastasia Yeshchenko at Sokolov's house.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Both the professor and his deceased lover studied French history and co-authored a number of works.</p>
      <p>They seemingly shared a liking for period costumes.</p>
      <p>Reports say Sokolov liked dressing up as Napoleon and impersonating the former French emperor.</p>
      <p>Some students said he was a 'freak' who called his lover 'Josephine' (Napoleon's first wife) and asked to be addressed as 'Sire'.</p>

        <b>An ardent francophile respected in France</b>
      </p>
      <p>The historian is the author of books on Napoleon Bonaparte and had acted as a historical consultant on several films.</p>
      <p>He received France's Legion d'Honneur in 2003.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was also a member of France's Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (ISSEP) founded by Marion Marechal, the niece of far-right leader Marine Le Pen</p>
      <p>ISSEP announced in a statement that he had been stripped of his position on its scientific committee.</p>
      <p>"We learn with horror ... the atrocious crime of which Oleg Sokolov is guilty...," it said.</p>
      <p>As an academic of such standing, the statement added, "we could never imagine that he could commit such an odious act".</p>
