      <h3>MERALCO gave its best in the fourth quarter to bring down NorthPort, 103-89, and keep its hot streak going in the PBA Governors’ Cup on Sunday at the Ynares Center.</h3>
      <p>The Bolts fought the Batang Pier in an intense contest for three full quarters before they seized control in the fourth period and chalk up their fifth straight win in the season-ending conference.</p>
      <p>With their eighth win in 10 outings, the Bolts have now cemented their place in the top four and earned twice-to-beat advantage in the 8-team quarterfinal round.</p>
      <p>As usual, Allen Durham delivered yeoman job for the Bolts, scoring 26 points and cornering 19 rebounds as he continued to tally big numbers that could pretty bolster his chances for another best import award.</p>
      <p>However, it was Anjo Caram and Chris Newsome who spewed steady fires for the Bolts who sent the Batang Pier reeling to their sixth loss in nine games.</p>
      <p>Caram cut loose with 30 points, including four triples, while Newsome added 17 points and seven rebounds</p>
      <p>“This win is really nice because we really had a goal of making it to the top four and we really want to get the twice-to-beat advantage to have a slight advantage going into the playoffs,” said Meralco coach Norman Black.</p>
      <p>“I’m really happy for my players. They are focused on the goal and they achieved it tonight by getting their eighth win. It wasn’t a pretty game but a lot of games aren’t pretty. Just have to grind it out and win it,” added Black.</p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>Meralco (103) - Caram 30, Durham 26, Newsome 17, Almazan 8, Pinto 8, Maliksi 6, Faundo 4, Hugnatan 2, Amer 2, Quinto 0, Jackson 0, Jose 0, Hodge 0, Jamito 0.</p>
      <p>NorthPort (89) - Qualls 27, Standhardinger 20, Anthony 19, Mercado 9, Lanete 8, Taha 3, Ferrer 3, Elorde 0, Cruz 0, King 0, Escoto 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 20-23, 50-45, 72-69, 103-89.</p>
