      <p>A teacher went above and beyond the call of duty for a pupil who was forced to sit a test 50 miles away from her classmates.</p>
      <p>Curtis Darragh jumped in his car and made a 100 mile round trip to Ballymoney to make sure Morgan Trotter saw a friendly face after she sat the AQE transfer test.</p>
      <p>The 10-year old was forced to sit her exam elsewhere due to it being oversubscribed at Wheatfield Primary School in Belfast.</p>
      <p>Her mum Kimberley told <a href="https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/aqe-test-surprise-north-belfast-17229725">Belfast Live</a> : "I had put Belfast Royal Academy as her first choice but unfortunately it was already filled. So the second choice I put down was Dalraida.</p>
      <p>"Everyone else in her school was going to Belfast Royal Academy and the teacher was planning to go and see them all before the test.</p>
      <p>"I thought because my daughter was the only one doing the test so far away that he couldn't be in two places at once.</p>
      <p>"But, he got into his car, drove for over an hour just to be standing outside the gate where Morgan was coming out, just so she didn't feel left out.</p>
      <p>"I was so shocked that he did it. He told me that he had to do it for her, he didn't want to leave her out. It was just a brilliant effort from him.</p>
      <p>"It really made Morgan's day. She's glad to get the test done and she's been on the phone telling all her friends and family about what happened."</p>
