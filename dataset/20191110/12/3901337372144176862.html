      <p>Kaizer Chiefs head coach, Ernst Middendorp responded to the ‘thuggish behaviour’ remarks made by his counterpart.</p>
      <p>Rulani Mokwena was fuming after their 3-2 loss to Chiefs at the FNB Stadium yesterday, with the Orlando Pirates’ interim head coach describing some of the actions in the encounter as ‘thuggish behaviour’ from Amakhosi.</p>

      <p>However, speaking to the media after the game, Middendorp pointed out how he felt that there were mistakes made from both sides on the day.</p>
      <p>“I have a good education and my parents told me, that at a certain time, don’t talk, don’t start wars or fights, just show that you are a grown up,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is normal that here and there you are winning and losing that is why over the decades FIFA introduced yellow cards, fouls and penalties when something (has) happened.”</p>
      <p>“I think (the) Fortune Makaringe and Katsande incident was quite a heavy duel, there is no doubt about it.”</p>
      <p>Referring to Eric Mathoho’s red card booking, he said, “I spoke to Eric and he said he was just on the way to protect his own players, protect the group and while going at each other at this moment, somebody fell apart.”</p>
      <p>“If it is a foul in the penalty area what should the referee do? Should he go to the opponent coach to ask if he should give it, or should he phone someone? I think it was a very clear penalty, it was a foul and something like this to use words to describe it, I am far away from it, I don’t think it is how it works, there was a number of goal-scoring and mistakes from both sides,” Middendorp added.</p>
