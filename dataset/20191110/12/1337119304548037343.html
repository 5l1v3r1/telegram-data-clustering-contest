      <h2>True Damage takes the stage in Paris</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:37:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster" target="_blank">Andrew Webster</a></address>
      <p>Once again, a virtual music group stole the show at one of the biggest e-sports events of the year. Back in 2018 the opening ceremonies for the <i>League of Legends</i> World Championships featured <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18064106/league-of-legends-opening-ceremony-performance-kda-pop-stars-ar-music-video">an incredible augmented reality K-pop performance</a>. This year, developer Riot took things a step further with a stunning concert featuring holographic performers that opened the show before Europe’s G2 took on China’s FPX.</p>
      <p>The event, which took place in Paris, featured the debut of a brand-new in-game musical group called True Damage that was revealed earlier this year. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton">Some of the characters even have outfits designed by Louis Vuitton.</a>) A large, nearly invisible screen on the stage featured holographic projections of in-game characters and other special effects alongside the real-world performers; at times, multiple versions of the performers were displayed, and it was genuinely hard to tell what was real. At one point a giant tornado tore across the stage.</p>
      <p>The three-song performance was a stunning combination of technology and choreography. It ended with a dramatic reveal of the Summoners Cup — <i>League</i>’s massive championship trophy — which, naturally, was housed in a high-tech Louis Vuitton trunk.</p>

      <p>The 2018 performance featured a similar fictional K-pop group called K/DA, and it proved to be a massive hit. The music video for the song “Pop/stars” has been viewed more than 270 million times on YouTube, and the characters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/11/18076272/league-of-legends-virtual-k-pop-new-audience">inspired a deluge of fan art</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/21/18147146/league-of-legends-k-pop-beat-saber-vr-kda-pop-stars-version">The song even made it into the hit VR game <i>Beat Saber</i></a>.</p>
      <p>It’s an increasingly busy times for <i>League</i> and Riot. Outside of the competitive scene for the game, <i>League</i> recently celebrated its 10th anniversary with a slew of announcements, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915315/league-of-legends-wild-rift-mobile-console-launch">a mobile version</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915338/league-of-legends-animated-series-fighting-game-cards-arcane-runeterra-project-l-trailers">an animated series, a fighting game, and lots more</a>.</p>
