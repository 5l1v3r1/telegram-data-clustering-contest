      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T12:33:58+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McGivern, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcgivern/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fan-terror-revealed-stabbed-20850829">Celtic fan Conor Weir</a> reveals he's lucky not to to have been badly hurt after he was jumped by cowardly ultra fans.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old, one of three fans to be attacked in Rome, was treated in hospital but still managed to finish off the celebrations of a historic win on Friday night.</p>
      <p>His flight was delayed because of the hospital stay and Conor, of Bo’ness, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/westlothian">West Lothian</a> , escaped with just three stitches in a back wound after masked men jumped out of a car and ran up behind him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I wasn’t wearing a Celtic strip, just a green t-shirt, but they must have been driving round looking for people to target and I was unlucky enough to get it.</p>
      <p>“It was cowardly. They weren’t looking for a fight, just to hurt somebody and escape without getting any comeback.</p>

      <p>“It was over so fast I hardly knew what was happening until I felt a sensation in my back and I felt blood on my top.</p>
      <p>“The other three people I was with scattered in panic and I tried to run myself but they grabbed me and stabbed me before I could break free.”</p>
      <p>Conor said he became aware of a car stopping as he approached a McDonald’s restaurant on the main Viale Giulio Cesare street, near the Vatican at 2.30am on Friday.</p>
      <p>He had been partying and in high spirits but was preparing to get to bed when the attack happened.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m ok and I’m lucky to escape with what I did.</p>
      <p>“I got a local person to phone an ambulance and they were brilliant, very calm and they got it sorted right away.</p>

      <p>“After I got to hospital I was given a few stitches and I was out within a few hours. I phoned home to say I was ok then I went back and had some rest.</p>
      <p>“But I was determined not to let some idiots spoil my trip, so I was out again on Friday night and had a great time. It was one of the best ever results for Celtic in recent times and it was great to be there to see it in person.”</p>
      <p>Conor, who works for construction form Norbord Europe in Cowie, which makes MDF boards, was the third of three Celtic fans to be stabbed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/third-celtic-fan-stabbed-rome-20839411">Two other fans were jumped at the Flann O’Brien bar</a> on Via Nazionale, where travelling supporters were enjoying a drink on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Another bar in the trendy Trastevere part of the city was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-ambushed-rome-amid-20837836">raided by ultras</a> on Wednesday night, smashing chairs against a window as Celtic fans enjoyed a peaceful drink inside.</p>

      <p>Celtic’s 2-1 win was their first in Europe against an Italian team.</p>
      <p>The tie looked certain to bring trouble after ultra fans marched through Glasgow a fortnight ago, making fascist salutes in tribute to former dictator Benito Mussolini.</p>
      <p>In turn, Celtic ultra made their own anti-fascist protest, erecting a banner that depicted Mussolini hanging upside down and telling ultras top “follow your leader”.</p>
      <p>The Green Brigade and many other fans also repeatedly chanted “F*** Lazio” and another “Brigate Verde” banner appeared to be based on the logo of a left-wing terrorist organisation.</p>
