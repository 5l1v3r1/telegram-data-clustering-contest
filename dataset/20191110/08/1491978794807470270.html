        <i>Professional bodies fear distrust of proposals will hit patient care this winter</i>
      </p>
      <p>Senior doctors have rejected the government’s solution to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/11/ministers-to-overhaul-pensions-to-unblock-operations-backlog">NHS pension crisis</a>, amid growing problems for hospitals and GP surgeries as winter approaches.</p>
      <p>Only one in seven consultants and specialists plans to take advantage of flexible pension contributions that ministers hope will end the dispute, a survey shows. Doctors’ lack of interest in the plan is a blow to health secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock">Matt Hancock</a> and for prime minister Boris Johnson, who has pledged to find a solution.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.hcsa.com/">Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association</a> found that just 15% of 803 members it polled last month planned to take advantage of the flexibilities. Over half (54%) said they would not do so and the other 31% did not know.</p>
      <p>Under the proposals doctors would be able to choose how much goes into their pension pot every year to prevent its value growing too quickly leading to a tax bill that could amount to tens of thousands of pounds. That threat has led to large numbers of doctors reducing their hours, forcing hospitals to cancel operations and cut the number of CT and MRI scans, lengthening waiting times for care.</p>
      <p>Claudia Paoloni, the HCSA’s president, said that without more radical pension reform “these well-meaning proposals are set to fail”. HCSA members’ scepticism that the Department of Health and Social Care’s plans will remove the risk of receiving a large tax bill comes after the <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/">British Medical Association</a> and grassroots doctors signalled their opposition.</p>
      <p>“Understaffing is at the root of the crisis and we know that for many hospital doctors pensions taxation has proven to be the last straw. They feel they have been flogging themselves to bridge the gaps in care created by vacancies and have been rewarded with tax bills running into tens of thousands,” said Paoloni.</p>
      <p>“The truth is that even with tax changes not all of these will now be coaxed back into working overtime. They have reassesssed their work-life balance and chosen life.”</p>
      <p>The HCSA also found more than a third (34%) of doctors have cut their hours, and 39% have turned down or given up medical leadership roles in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a>, because of their pension concerns. Worryingly, around half of those who have taken either course of action said that no other doctor had stepped in to take over their work.</p>
      <p>The findings add to NHS pension difficulties facing the government, which hopes to introduce the flexibilities from next April. The BMA has already dismissed the plan as a mere “sticking plaster” and warned that “doctors are trapped in a dilemma between wanting to care for patients and not wanting to end up worse off”. <a href="https://www.aisma.org.uk/category/aisma-in-the-news/">The Association of Specialist Medical Accountants</a> recently told ministers that flexibilities amounted to “uninformed tinkering”.</p>
      <p>NHS bosses are increasingly alarmed that the number of doctors scaling back their hours will leave hospitals struggling even more than usual when the traditional winter crisis hits. The issue is making it harder for hospitals to have enough A&amp;E specialists, anaesthetists and surgeons on duty. It is believed to be a key factor in the recent sharp escalation of delays facing patients awaiting treatment for breast cancer, for example.</p>
      <p>A Conservative spokesperson said: “We have already taken action to give staff more flexibility over how much they put into their pension pots and introduced new rules that will allow senior clinicians to take on additional NHS work and be fairly rewarded. It’s imperative trusts implement these new rules.”</p>
