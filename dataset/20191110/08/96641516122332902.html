      <h1>AMC Games' first title is the intentionally boring 'Airplane Mode'</h1>
      <h2>Think 'Desert Bus' with bad WiFi and leg cramps.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-desert-bus-for-hope-fundraiser-childs-play.html"><i>Desert Bus</i></a> won't be the only big name in town for games that are purposefully, excruciatingly boring. AMC is marking the start of its game publishing division by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNn-ImYfgtA&amp;feature=youtu.be">unveiling</a> <i>Airplane Mode</i>, a game from Bacronym that tasks you with sitting through a nearly six-hour transatlantic flight... in real time. You have to stave off the tedium using the all-too-familiar resources of a cramped coach seat, including the (sometimes flaky) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/16/american-airlines-satellite-wifi-mainline-fleet/">in-air WiFi</a>, outdated shows on the seatback entertainment system and crossword puzzles in the airline's travel magazine. It's not even predictable -- you may have to deal with random delays, turbulence and crying babies.</p>
      <p>There's even an in-flight safety video produced by AMC's IFC channel, in case you need to be reminded how to use the overhead oxygen mask.</p>
      <p>The title arrives on PCs sometime in 2020 and is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/931310/Airplane_Mode/">available</a> to add to your Steam wishlist. Yes, this is ultimately a commentary more than a game you'd want to play. It's a "meditation on life between destinations," as AMC put it. With that said, we can see it being ideal for Desert Bus for Hope-style fundraisers (it even made a premiere there) where the game plays second fiddle to the charity and its hosts. And consider this: in some ways, it's a more realistic depiction of how people really fly than even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/30/flight-simulator-2020-hands-on-pre-alpha/">the most ambitious flight simulators</a>.</p>
