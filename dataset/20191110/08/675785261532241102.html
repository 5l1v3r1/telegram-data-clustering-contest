      <h1>Pep Guardiola's awful record vs Jurgen Klopp ahead of Liverpool vs Man City</h1>
      <h2>The Catalan heads to Merseyside on Sunday for the biggest game of the Premier League season so far, and he'll be attempting to improve a poor record against the Liverpool boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:00:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>History is against Manchester City whenever they go to Anfield.</p>
      <p>That's because despite the vast improvements made by the club ever since the Abu Dhabi takeover 11 years ago, you've still got to go all the way back to May 2003 for their last victory in front of the Kop on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Anelka - who had been on loan at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> the previous season - scored both of City's goals in a 2-1 win, as a side featuring the likes of Robbie Fowler and Peter Schmeichel put a huge dent in the top four hopes of Gerard Houllier's men, who ultimately missed out on the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Plenty of excellent City sides have tried and failed to win at Anfield since then, and it will again be up to Pep Guardiola to overcome the club's curious hoodoo.</p>

      <p>To do that, though, he's going to have to overcome a hoodoo of his own.</p>
      <p>That's because, by his own very high standards, Guardiola has an awful record against Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>As per stats from <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/pep-guardiola/bilanztrainer/trainer/5672">transfermarkt</a> , in 17 meetings between the two managers, Guardiola has won seven, lost eight and drawn two.</p>

      <p>And although some of those are cup matches, if you were to place a value of three points for a win onto all of those meetings, that gives Guardiola an average of just 1.35 points per game against Klopp.</p>
      <p>That is a terrible record compared to most other bosses he's faced, and you've got to go all the way down to managers he's only come up against four times for a record as poor as that.</p>
      <h3>Pep Guardiola's fewest points per game vs opposing managers (minimum 5 games)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Jurgen Klopp</b> - 1.35 ppg (17 games)</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho - 1.77 ppg (22 games)</p>
      <p>Arsene Wenger - 1.93 ppg (14 games)</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino - 1.94 ppg (18 games)</p>
      <p>Massimiliano Allegri - 2.00 ppg (6 games)</p>
      <p>Markus Weinzierl - 2.14 ppg (7 games)</p>
      <p>Claude Puel - 2.22 ppg (9 games)</p>
      <p>Gregorio Manzano - 2.22 ppg (9 games)</p>
      <p>Dieter Hecking - 2.25 ppg (8 games)</p>
      <p>Mircea Lucescu - 2.29 ppg) (7 games)</p>
      <p>So as well as City's poor record, their manager will go into Sunday's titanic tussle with his own demons to slay.</p>
      <p>Can he do it?</p>
