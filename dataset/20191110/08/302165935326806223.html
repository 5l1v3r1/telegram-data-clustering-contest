      <p>PERTH, Nov 10 — Ajla Tomljanovic hauled Australia back into the Fed Cup final today, beating France’s Pauline Parmentier to send the tie in a deciding doubles clash.</p>
      <p>The Croatian-born 26-year-old, in her Fed Cup debut for Australia, had been thrashed 6-1, 6-1 by Kristina Mladenovic in the opening singles rubber on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But captain Alica Molik kept faith with her and she bounced back to beat Parmentier, preferred by France skipper Julien Benneteau to Caroline Garcia, 6-4, 7-5 at Perth Arena.</p>
      <p>The match now goes to a deciding doubles rubber, with Ashleigh Barty and Samantha Stosur scheduled to face Garcia and Mladenovic.</p>
      <p>Tomljanovic, ranked 51, came on court after 40<sup>th</sup>-ranked Mladenovic stunned world number one Barty in a three-set epic to give France a 2-1 lead as they target a first title since 2003 and third overall.</p>
      <p>But Tomljanovic rose to the occasion as Australia look for an eighth title and first since 1974.</p>
      <p>She went neck-and-neck with the 122<sup>nd</sup>-ranked Parmentier in the first set until she grabbed a crucial break in the 10<sup>th</sup> game, despite only getting 31 percent of her first serves in.</p>
      <p>Another break in the second gave her a 4-2 lead before Parmentier rallied to take it to 5-5. But, backed by a partisan crowd, Tonljanovic dug deep to keep her country’s hopes alive.</p>
      <p>“Really glad I got a second chance today and got the win and kept us in (contention),” she said courtside. “The team has been unbelievable all week and it is such a privilege to play for you guys.” </p>
      <p>Earlier Barty, who has been in scintillating form, thrashing Garcia 6-0, 6-0 yesterday after winning the WTA Finals in China last weekend, was stunned 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/1).</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to speak, you know on this kind of stage, to play the world number one and it was such a thriller,” said an emotional Mladenovic afterwards as the tears flowed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘I just kept believing’</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I just kept believing because I felt I was out there fighting and giving her a hard battle. I’m just so proud how I kept pushing and obviously won the game.”</p>
      <p>Barty started where she left off after the “double bagel” of Garcia on Saturday, breaking Mladenovic’s first service game with a net volley to extend her streak to 15 games this weekend.</p>
      <p>But Mladenovic held serve to end the Barty run and it became a closer affair before the Australian began forcing errors to take the first set.</p>
      <p>Barty saved five break points in the opening game of the second set, but Mladenovic finally worked a first crucial break with some quality passing shots, with a forehand long from Barty giving her a 5-4 lead. She held her nerve to serve out the set.</p>
      <p>Mladenovic, who beat Barty on clay in Rome earlier this year, was on a roll with the French star breaking then holding for a 3-1 third-set lead.</p>
      <p>Stung, Barty rallied for 3-3 but the errors again crept in and she was broken again. </p>
      <p>Mladenovic lost focus serving for the match and the see-sawing set ultimately went to a tense tie breaker.</p>
      <p>“From my point of view I fought as hard as I could and I hope that I did my team proud and all Australians proud. I fought with everything I had left,” said Barty. — AFP</p>
