      <h1>Stadia leak provides glimpse at television UI and Pro ‘Worm Game’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:00:54+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>Ahead of Stadia <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-launching/">launching in nine days</a>, Google’s game streaming service is beginning to leak as it enters wider testing. The first provides another live glimpse at the TV homescreen on a Chromecast and shows something called “Worm Game.”</p>
      <p>Our <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/15/google-stadia-ui/">first look at the Stadia interface</a> came from an official video released at Made by Google 2019. Confirmed by subsequent early hands-on <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/stadia-native-games/">pieces</a>, the Chromecast TV interface prominently shows your last played game with large cover art. A play button presumably starts the experience, while there’s a docked “Your games” carousel below.</p>
      <p>Expanding presents a carousel with cards that you can swipe through. Today’s Stadia UI leak (via <i><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/du7zb3/worm_game/">Reddit</a></i>) shows this up close with an orange border used to highlight the current selection. <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> was the last played game in this example, while the carousel also shows <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i>. These items are presumably arranged by what was last opened.</p>

      <p>What’s new today is <i>WORM GAME</i> and how there is a red “PRO” badge in the bottom-left corner. This looks to denote what games $9.99/month Stadia Pro subscribers have access to that are not purchases, and should also be appended to <i>Destiny 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the newly revealed game in this Stadia UI leak could be a basic demo experience akin to classic Snake — as suggested by food items in the artwork that players presumably have to collect. One possible use is ensuring that your controller and connection works. Otherwise, no publisher has mentioned such a title in development for Stadia. The graphics are whimsical and Google Doodle-esque in nature. Alternately, it could be a game aimed at kids.</p>
