      <p>KABUL, Nov 10 — Afghanistan’s Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah called today for a halt to a recount of the recent presidential election, saying he would not accept “fraud-marked” results.</p>
      <p>The move adds a fresh layer of uncertainty following the September 28 poll, which already has been marred by record-low turnout and continued bickering between Abdullah and his rival, President Ashraf Ghani.</p>
      <p>“The recounting should be stopped. We are trying to save the process from fraudsters,” Abdullah said at a rally of his supporters in Kabul. </p>
      <p>“A fraud-marred election will not be accepted. The result should be based on the clean votes of our people,” he added.</p>
      <p>Abdullah, who unsuccessfully ran in the previous two presidential elections and is fighting for his political future, has repeatedly raised questions about the validity of hundreds of thousands of votes.</p>
      <p>The election was meant to be the cleanest yet in Afghanistan’s young democracy, with a German firm supplying biometric machines that were supposed to stop people from voting more than once.</p>
      <p>But nearly a million of the initial votes were purged owing to irregularities, meaning the election saw by far the lowest turnout of any Afghan poll, with only about 1.8 million votes from a total of 9.6 million registered voters in a population of around 37 million people.</p>
      <p>Abdullah has said problems remain with about 300,000 of these high-tech votes, claiming various issues including that photos attached to some ballots had been taken from fake identity cards, and not actual voters.</p>
      <p>He said his observers would be boycotting the recount, a move that will only fuel further claims of problems with the electoral process.</p>
      <p>The ongoing uncertainty raises the possibility Afghanistan is headed for a repeat of the crisis that followed the last presidential election in 2014. </p>
      <p>Then, Ghani and Abdullah fought a close and angry race that sparked widespread allegations of fraud and saw the US step in to broker an awkward power-sharing agreement between the rivals under a unity government.</p>
      <p>Initial results from the September poll were supposed to be released on October 19, but the announcement has already been delayed twice—with election officials citing various technical problems.</p>
      <p>A new date has been set for Thursday, but officials have hinted the announcement may be pushed back yet again.</p>
      <p>Abdullah, who has previously said he believes he secured the most votes, last week told AFP he would “absolutely” respect the result of recent polls—if the process is fair and transparent. — AFP</p>
