      <h1>Liverpool blitz past Arsenal in social media followers with rapid six month growth</h1>
      <h2>The Reds have had a rapid rise in their social media following over the past six months after their success on the pitch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:30:00+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Recent success has seen Liverpool soar past Arsenal in social media followers.</p>
      <p>Only <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> now boast more combined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> followers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , two of England’s most successful teams, have long been the dominant forces at the top of the English game.</p>
      <p>Both have significant accolades to their name: Liverpool are England’s most successful team in Europe, while Arsenal are the only team in Premier League history to have gone an entire 38-game season unbeaten.</p>
      <p>Between them they’ve won 31 league titles, 20 FA Cups and ten League Cups.</p>
      <p>But, there’s still one piece of bragging rights to be accounted for: the size of their fan base.</p>

      <p>It might not be your traditional major honour but the total amount of social media followers is something fans often use to get one over their Premier League rivals.</p>
      <p>Recent findings by <a href="https://footballpredictions.net/">FootballPredictions.NET</a> have found that Liverpool’s social media following across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (69.06 million) has surpassed Arsenal’s following (69.04 million), with the Gunners social blade having plateaued.</p>
      <p>The Reds' online popularity has soared in recent seasons thanks to their improved performances on the pitch and the world class talent they’ve managed to bring to Anfield.</p>
      <p>Star man Mohamed Salah has over 33million Instagram followers, even more than the official Liverpool page (20.8 million), which is one reason why the club has had such a massive boost of followers in such a short space of time.</p>

      <p>Yet the undoubted main reason for the increase in numbers is their remarkable run of form which has seen their social media scores skyrocket, sometimes in timescales of just seven days.</p>
      <p>Their semi-final Champions League comeback against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> saw an increase of 1.2 million new followers in a single week.</p>
      <p>That’s more than the entire following of Premier League club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> who have a combined Facebook, Instagram and Twitter following of 1.14 million.</p>
      <p>Yet despite Liverpool’s dramatic increase in followers, they are still quite a way behind Chelsea and Manchester United who boast followings of 80.9 million and 125 million respectively.</p>
