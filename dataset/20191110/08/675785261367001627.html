      <h1>Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian questions Reds' "obsession" with winning Premier League</h1>
      <h2>The Anfield shot-stopper insists Sunday afternoon's showdown with Manchester City is not pivotal to Liverpool winning a first title for 30 years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:40:37+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian has questioned the Reds' "obsession" with winning the Premier League - and insists this afternoon's crunch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> clash is not pivotal to the title race.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> have a six-point advantage over Pep Guardiola's side going into the game as they bid to claim a first top-flight crown for 30 years.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp led the Reds to within a point of glory last year but City sealed the title on the final day - before Liverpool won a sixth European Cup in Madrid with victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a></p>
      <p>And Adrian insists the Premier League should not be placed under greater importance than glory on the continent.</p>

      <p>“They [the fans] are excited like we are, but you don’t have to become obsessed with winning the league so soon,” he told <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a> .</p>
      <p>“We want to lift it but we’re not going to give up the Champions League to do so. Anyone would want to have it back at Anfield.</p>
      <p>“There are many months of competition left but it is a match that will have a certain impact.</p>
      <p>“They want to reduce that gap and we try to extend it. The more the better. But Christmas is hard this year, more so for us with the Club World Cup in between.</p>
      <p>“The Premier League title is not decided in November.”</p>
