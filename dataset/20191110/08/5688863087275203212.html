        <b>When it comes to runouts and stumpings in international cricket, nobody trumps MS Dhoni except Ross Taylor who is more often than not at the receiving end. Another such instance of a spectacular run out occurred as Sam Billings recreated MS Dhoni's genius to run Ross Taylor out in the fifth T20I.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s never a good sign for New Zealand when <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ross_taylor">Ross Taylor</a> gets run out and England made sure that he did. The shortened(11 overs) fifth T20I, also the decider of the series, saw an emulation of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a>’s exceptional run out of Taylor in the final ball of New Zealand's innings. The hosts batted brilliantly and got to 145 in the penultimate delivery of the final over as Ross Taylor tried to clip a low full-toss by Tom Curran, on the final ball, past square leg. </p>
      <p>There was no second run there, but Taylor decided to take the risk with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/jimmy_neesham">Jimmy Neesham</a> at the other end. But an accurate throw from Sam Curran to the wicketkeeper Sam Billings saw Ross Taylor being uprooted. Billings took no time and in one swift action, without even looking at the stumps, flicked the ball at the wickets to dislodge the bails. It was similar to Dhoni's 'no look' run out of Taylor from an ODI in 2016, when New Zealand toured India.</p>
      <p>In the 45th over of the said ODI, the then Indian captain Dhoni collected a throw from <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/dhawal_kulkarni">Dhawal Kulkarni</a> and pulled off a blinder when hitting the stumps as an immediate reflex, making no mistakes. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the T20I game from Sunday went on to be tied between the two World Cup finalists and a Super Over this time had New Zealand fall behind by 9 runs. Hence, England won the five-match series 3-2.</p>
