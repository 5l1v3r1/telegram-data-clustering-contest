      <p>DUBAI: Chrissy Teigen hit the red carpet on Saturday night for the 2019 Baby2Baby gala in Los Angeles donning a design by Lebanese couturier Georges Hobeika. The model and author sizzled in an emerald gown that featured sequin details on the bodice and a thigh high slit. The asymmetrical dress also boasted a sheer cape that manifested into a train.</p>
      <p> She elevated the ensemble with diamond jewelry, strappy stilettos and a matching box clutch. The 33-year-old donned brushed-out waves parted to one side, kohl-rimmed eyes and rose lipstick.  </p>

      <p>She and her husband of seven-years American singer John Legend celebrated the star-studded event with guests that included Paula Abdul and Kate Hudson to name a few. Also finding favor in Arab designers was Gina Rodriguez, who stepped out in an embroidered, powder blue number from Zuhair Murad. </p>
      <p>The celebrity-filled event helped raise funds for the Baby2Baby non-profit organization, which provides resources to children who are living in poverty. </p>
