      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The stars of I'm A Celebrity 2019 are flocking to Australia to enjoy their last few days of luxury before heading into the jungle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T08:48:14+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p>The first celebrity to land in Australia for the new series of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">I'm A Celebrity</a> is Ian Wright.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old star touched down at Brisbane Airport on Sunday, a week before the ITV show kicks off</p>
      <p>After landing at Brisbane airport the former Arsenal and England star was being coy about going into the jungle.</p>
      <p>Ian, 56, claimed to be coming out of retirement, joking: "I’m here to see Robbie Fowler.</p>
      <p>"I’m doing some training with the Brisbane Roar."</p>
      <p>Told he was the bookmakers' favourite to win I'm A Celebrity, he said: "Win what?</p>
      <p>"I don’t know how many other players are in the golf tournament.</p>
      <p>"All you can do is play your best and hope that you bring the right stuff on the day."</p>

      <p>Others names expected to join them in the jungle include US reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, GMB breakfast TV presenter Kate Garraway and former Girls Aloud singer Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>More arrivals are expected over the next couple of days before filming begins.</p>
      <p>Caitlin is expected to arrive in Australia over the next few hours as she was spotted jetting out of California yesterday.</p>

      <p>Bookmakers Ladbrokes have Ian Wright as favourite to win, although last year's King of the Jungle Harry Redknapp told the Mirror he was worried about him keeping his temper in camp</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d tell him ‘Keep calm, Wrighty’. He’s got a short fuse. I played golf with him the other day and he threw a bit of a wobbler with another player.“</p>
      <p>You have to bite your tongue in the camp. It’s hard. You can get tetchy as there’s nothing to do. It gets boring."</p>
