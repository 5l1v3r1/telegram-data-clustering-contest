      <p>British boxer Billy Joe Saunders has retained his world title by beating Argentinian Marcelo Esteban Coceres in a technical knock out in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>In what was his first fight in America, the super-middleweight was hoping to make the most of his opportunity on the undercard of KSI’s rematch with Logan Paul.</p>
      <p>But the crowd was not impressed with the slow pace, and the fight was greeted with silence and occasional booing.</p>
      <p>In the 11th round, though, Saunders found his form and dropped Coceres three times before the Englishman was declared the winner on a TKO.</p>
      <p>“There’s no excuse, that performance was not worthy of Canelo or any of the other big names,” Saunders said.</p>
      <p>“I knew by round nine that I had to get him out of here. My timing wasn’t right, my head wasn’t right, nothing was right.</p>
      <p>“I’m not one for excuses. I needed to let him gas out then attack.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got the win and I’ve got to thank the American fans and I hope they tune in again because that wasn’t the best of me.”</p>
