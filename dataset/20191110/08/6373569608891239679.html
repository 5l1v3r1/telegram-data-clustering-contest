      <p>Josh Grant’s first FA Cup match of his career still him rise to the challenge of playing a new position in Plymouth Argyle’s 1-0 first round win away to Bolton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old loan signing from Chelsea was used in a midfield holding role by Pilgrims’ boss Ryan Lowe.</p>
      <p>Grant’s primary responsibility was to restrict the supply to Bolton’s two experienced strikers, Daryl Murphy and Chris O’Grady, and he did that effectively.</p>
      <p>Also, when he got on the ball, Grant was able to get Argyle going forward and onto the attack.</p>
      <p>Grant had previously played for the Pilgrims this season as a central defender or at wing-back.</p>
      <p>However, he was put into his new midfield role by Lowe against Bolton after Joe Riley was ruled out after a training ground injury on Friday.</p>
      <p>Joe Edwards took over from Riley at right wing-back and Grant went into the key midfield role.</p>
      <p>Grant said: “The Gaffer spoke to me and said I have got some qualities that I can bring to it, and it was an opportunity for me to play and play well.</p>
      <p>“I had to step up my performance today and I feel like I did well.”</p>
      <p>Grant had come off the bench a couple of times late in games to play the deep midfield role.</p>
      <p>But the first round tie at the University of Bolton Stadium gave him the opportunity to try it out from the start of a match.</p>
      <p>Grant said: “I’m looking at Joe’s performances and I have started to learn the new position, and that’s all I can do as a young kid, just keep learning.</p>

      <p>“As I’m a defender, I can help the back three out and stop things going into their strikers.</p>
      <p>“I also want to get Danny (Mayor) and Sarce (Antoni Sarcevic) on the ball as much as possible because they are two great players.”</p>
      <p>Grant was grateful for the support he received from his team-mates around him, particularly the central defensive trio of Scott Wootton, Niall Canavan and Gary Sawyer.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s my first time playing there really from the start of the game and those three were excellent to me.</p>
      <p>“They didn’t stop talking to me the whole game. I knew what I was doing through them, and that’s the help I need if I’m going to try a new role.”</p>
      <p>With Argyle defending strongly as a unit, from front to back, goalkeeper Alex Palmer did not have many saves to make.</p>
      <p>The threat of the powerful strike duo of Murphy and O’Grady was certainly nullified, with Grant more than playing his part.</p>
      <p>Grant said: “We looked at their qualities and saw their strengths. The Gaffer thought I was the man for the job today.</p>
      <p>“It could be anyone in this team. We have all got to chip in every now and then.”</p>
      <p>Argyle’s winning goal against Bolton came in the 11th minute when Callum McFadzean fired home off the underside of the crossbar.</p>
      <p>That was McFadzean’s fifth goal of the season, making him the club’s joint top scorer with Joel Grant.</p>
      <p>“This team are going to need goals from left, right and centre. I don’t think it’s just relying on strikers,” said Josh Grant.</p>
      <p>“I think we are all going to chip in now and then and he (McFadzean) has done it today.”</p>
      <p>Grant added: “The concentration we showed and the bravery to play in this lovely stadium, we could have had more goals and we should have had more goals, but we still got the win at the end of the day.”</p>

      <p>The victory over Bolton also went some small way towards making amends for Argyle’s 4-0 Devon Derby drubbing at Exeter City a fortnight earlier.</p>
      <p>Grant said: “We know that we weren’t at our best on that day. All we could do was put it right in the next game, and that’s what we have done today.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we want to keep on doing. We want to find that consistency, and keep going and keep going.”</p>
