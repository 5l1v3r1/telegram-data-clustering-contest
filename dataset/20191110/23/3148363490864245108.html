      <h1>Spain: Populists Make Massive Gains, Salvini Predicts 'Racist' Smears</h1>
      <h2>The national populist Vox party has made massive gains in the Spanish elections — prompting Italy’s Matteo Salvini to predict they will be smeared as “racists” and “fascists”.</h2>

      <p>Spanish voters were heading to the polls for the fourth time since 2015 — and the second time this year — after Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez found he was unable to govern, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/EuropeElects/status/1193661817798758401">election results</a> did not increase his mandate.</p>
      <p>In fact, Sanchez has actually lost some ground, and the left-wing Unidas Podemos (United We Can) party which is the Socialists’ most natural ally in the Cortes Generales, as the Spanish parliament is known, has lost even more.</p>
      <p>So-called independentist parties in Catalonia, which have a leftist bent despite their ambitions for sovereign statehood — <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/11/09/eus-juncker-appears-to-attack-poison-of-catalan-nationalism/">scorned by the European Union</a>, regardless of the Catalans’ europhilia — have also performed poorly, and may not be well-disposed towards Sanchez in any case, given he had <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/08/spain-pro-eu-socialist-prime-minister-backs-prison-terms-for-catalan-independence-referendum/">harsh words</a> for them during the election campaign.</p>

      <p>The “centre-right” People’s Party which led the country before Sanchez and the Socialists made some modest gains after a historically poor result earlier in 2019, while the europhile Ciudadanos (Citizens) party — which the mainstream media often describes as centre-right, even though it describes itself as “post-nationalist” — has collapsed to less than 7 per cent of the vote.</p>
      <p>The breakout stars of the election, meanwhile, are the national populist Vox party led by Santiago Abascal, which campaigned on a platform emphasising border securit, including <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/10/build-a-wall-spanish-populists-pledge-impassable-barrier-to-stop-african-illegals/">building a wall</a> to stop <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/08/25/migrant-smugglers-president-prime-minister-organising-violent-attacks-spanish-border/">violent incursions</a> into Spain’s African cities of Ceuta and Melilla by illegal aliens hoping to reach EU soil, and national unity, including proposals to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/10/17/exclusive-vox-leader-abascal-says-party-ban-separatist-parties/">outlaw parties seeking secession</a> from the Spanish state.</p>
      <p>This was a strong contrast with the Socialists, who allowed Spain to become Europe’s <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/07/28/illegal-migrant-sea-crossings-europe-2018-break-55000/">number one</a> entry point for illegal migrants, declared that the continent needed <a href="https://twitter.com/BreitbartLondon/status/1024588050670661632">“new blood”</a>, and vowed to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/06/15/spains-socialist-government-dismantle-border-fences-obstructing-african-migrants/">dismantle</a> their African exclaves’ existing border security.</p>
      <p>Having increased its vote share by around 50 per cent, Vox will now will leapfrog both Podemos and Ciudadanos to become the third-largest party in the Spanish parliament, after having only just entered it for the first time in April.</p>

      <p>Italian populist leader and former Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also riding a wave of increasing support in his country, <a href="https://twitter.com/matteosalvinimi/status/1193628450722111488">welcomed</a> the “Great advances” by his “friends” in Vox — but predicted the backlash by the establishment would be swift.</p>
      <p>“I bet there are already ready-made titles of news and newspapers on ‘extreme right-wing victory, racists, sovereignists, fascists’,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Not at all racist and fascist”, he objected preemptively. “In Italy as in Spain we just want to live peacefully in our own home.”</p>
