      <p>After unleashing his "When It Comes To You" earlier this year, garnering much success overseas, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/SeanPaul/profile">Sean Paul</a> has returned with a remix to the track recruiting <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/YG/profile">YG</a> for a verse on the updated new selection.</p>
      <p>The track, produced by Supa Dups, sits in a comfortable hybrid that Paul describes as "poppy dancehall," and finds him flirting with the boundaries of his beloved genre.</p>
      <p>"Whether it's <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/JustinBieber/profile">Justin Bieber</a> or the most hardcore Jamaican artists, if the backbeat has a dancehall pattern, to me, it's dancehall," he once told Billboard. "In most of my songs, I like to be on the cutting edge of what's (considered) pop and what's (considered) dancehall."</p>

          <b>Quotable Lyrics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to you, there ain’t no satisfaction<br/>Every night with you is harder than the last one<br/>There ain’t no, no such thing as enough of your love</p>
