      <h1>Steam is having a Singles' Day sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:13:36+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jody-macgregor/" target="_blank">Jody Macgregor</a></address>
      <p>November 11 is Singles' Day because 11/11 is made entirely of ones, a tradition that started in China as a jokey excuse for blind dates and parties where singletons could meet. It's become a day that's more about shopping thanks to e-commerce site Alibaba using it as an excuse to throw a sale, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/alibabas-singles-day-sets-online-shopping-record-with-31b-in-sales/">now it's the world's biggest online shopping event, with almost $US 31 billion made last year</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/SinglesDay2019">Steam are having their own Singles' Day sale right now</a>, with a mix of singleplayer and multiplayer games being discounted. It's a pretty eclectic selection. For instance, you can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 for 45% off</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/11949/The_Telltale_Batman_Bundle/">a bundle of Telltale's Batman games for 67% off</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323470/DRAGON_BALL_XENOVERSE/">Dragon Ball Xenoverse for 80% off</a>.</p>
