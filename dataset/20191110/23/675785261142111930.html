      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emily-atack">Emily Atack</a> gave fans a sneak peak of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a> camp.</p>
      <p>The Inbetweeners star, 29, roamed freely behind the scenes of the £7million campsite where reality stars - including Caitlyn Jenner - will shun their lives of luxury.</p>
      <p>It got emotional for the actress when she passed the spot where she was greeted by her mum on her exit from the snake-infested jungle.</p>
      <p>Camera panning showed the dense forestry and the sprawling rope bridges.</p>
      <p>However, Emily abruptly stopped filming when she come up to a spot earmarked by TV bosses as a private spot.</p>

      <p>In the cameras, she said: "Oh my god this is where my mummy was when I came out. One of the bridges out.</p>
      <p>"I'm not allowed to film past here so goodbye."</p>
      <p>It comes after Emily's first class flight from the UK to Australia.</p>

      <p>The I'm A Celeb star treated herself to a prosecco as she reclined in her airport seat on Thursday ahead of her I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp appearance.</p>
      <p>After coming runner-up to Harry Redknapp on last year's jungle series, she has accepted the invitation to host the spin-off show this year.</p>

      <p>Emily has always looked back on her jungle memories with a fondness.</p>
      <p>The jungle princess admitted doing the reality show was the best decision after she had faced a crossroads in her life.</p>
      <p>She previously said: "I'd reached a point in my life where everything came to a crossroads and I was having a bit of a quarter-life crisis. I was just very lost. I didn’t really know what I wanted from life and everything was at a standstill.</p>
      <p>"I got really bored of sitting around waiting for work or for the next movie to come along that only 100 people would see. I got bored of being skint, of twiddling my thumbs, wondering how to take my life to the next stage. I was frustrated.</p>
      <p>"I’ve made some stupid decisions both in work and in my personal life But I'm A Celeb was the best, hands down. It flipped everything on its head, I was doing something wild and showing people who I am as a person." </p>
