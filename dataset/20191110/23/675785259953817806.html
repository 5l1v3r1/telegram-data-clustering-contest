      <h1>Ant McPartlin thought the public had had enough of him after his stint in rehab</h1>
      <h2>Ant opened up about his struggles with alcohol and prescription medication during his new show with presenting partner Declan Donnelly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:48:32+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:48</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey was an emotional roller coaster for fans of the Geordie duo.</p>
      <p>One particularly tear-jerking moment saw Ant - who has battled with alcohol and prescription medication addictions - reveal his anxiety around his career path following a stint in rehab.</p>
      <p>The presenter checked in to rehab for his addictions back in 2017 - but the 41 year old reckoned this could have been the end of the road for his telly career.</p>
      <p>He was also fined Â£86,000 for a drink driving offence, having caused a three car collision in south London - Ant had been walking his dog with his mum, who was also in the car at the time.</p>

      <p>"I thought the public had had enough," he said bluntly, "I didn't think I'd be allowed to do what I love anymore.</p>
      <p>"But coming back and being on screen and love and support shown to us in overwhelming.</p>
      <p>"I can't thank people enough."</p>
      <p>Dec also got emotional about the past few years, saying: "It's been a tough couple of years. It's really tested the bond that we've shared since we were like 13 years old.</p>

      <p>"I was incredibly angry at the start. So angry. Disappointed in him that he didn't ever come to me and say, 'I'm struggling, I need you.'</p>
      <p>"I thought that if the shoe was on the other foot I would have gone to him and said, 'I'm in trouble and I can't handle this, I need your help.'</p>
      <p>"He never came to me - and that hurt me a lot."</p>
      <p>Later he added: "There was a point that I thought...that that was it."</p>
      <p>Ant was very honest about his feelings of guilt, saying: "My actions affect nor only me but they affect him and his family and his loved ones."</p>

      <p>The duo are back together once more - Ant returned to presenting duties for Britain's Got Talent: The Champions earlier this year, and the pair have both landed in Australia for the newest series of I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Ant sat out last year's show to focus on his rehab, meaning Holly Willoughby went Down Under in his place.</p>
      <p>While many fans wanted DNA Journey to show Ant and Dec are actually related, they were left shocked by the revelation that Dec's related to US wrestling star Dixie Carter.</p>
      <p>Dixie flew out to Ireland to meet Dec and his pal, with Dec joking that Ant could get the boot in favour of his newfound American cousin.</p>
