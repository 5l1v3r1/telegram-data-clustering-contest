This champion, whose goes by the name of '<b>The Gym Lab</b>' (<b>Seo Ji Yeon</b>), has been revealed to be a close relative of BTS's <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/rap-monster">RM </a>from their paternal side. </p>
      <p> </p>

      <p>When she shared that she will soon attend a concert invited by her male cousin, the interviewer asked her if that he was a musician. The champion answered affirmatively and shared that that it was indeed RM, a close relative whose families have always spent time together during the holidays. </p>
      <p>"<i>I've seen him since I was really young, but once he became such a giant star, it became difficult for me to approach him at first. But RM later encouraged me to keep on practicing as a sportswoman</i>," shared the MMA fighter.</p>
