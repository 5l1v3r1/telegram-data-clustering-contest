      <address><time datetime="2019-11-10T23:29:06+00:00">10 Nov 2019, 23:29</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Declan Donnelly shed a few tears on new documentary Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey as he talked about his close friendship with Anthony McPartlin.</p>
      <p>The presenter, 44, cried when he talked about his "close bond" with Ant, 43, and said "it was fate" when they met.</p>
      <p>He discussed when they first met, and their success as a presenting duo.</p>
      <p>Dec admitted: "It's not lost on us how lucky we are that we met each other.</p>
      <p>"And you do think every now and again, 'What if we never met, what turns would my life had taken if we never met?'"</p>
      <p>He continued: "It feels like it was kind of written in the stars that we were going to bump into each other at some point, because we get on so well.</p>
      <p>"I'm getting emotional now," he gushed. "We have such an incredible bond, the two of us, that it was fate that we were going to meet."</p>

      <p>From Byker Grove and SMTV to Britain's Got Talent and I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here, for three decades the pair have been as attached on-screen as off.</p>
      <p>They attended the same drama school, scored the same GCSE grades and ended up living next door to each other in the luxe London suburb of Chiswick.</p>
      <p>They bought a racehorse and matching Portugal villas together. Even their dogs Hurley and Rocky were best mates.</p>

      <p>And in their new documentary they've embarked on a two-year journey tracing their genealogy which is set to be an emotional roller coaster for the childhood friends.</p>
      <p>In an emotional speech shown on their documentary, Ant said: "The last few years have been quite emotional, hard... they've been testing I would say how strong your love is, friendship is..."</p>
      <p>And Dec added: "It's been a tough couple of years it's really tested the bond we've shared since we were 13 years old.</p>

      <p>"I was incredibly angry at the start, so angry and disappointed in him that he didn't ever come to me and say I'm struggling, I need you because I thought if the shoe was on the other foot I would have gone to him said I'm in trouble and he never came to me and that hurt me a lot."</p>
      <p>Ant then admitted: "I knew he was angry and understandably so because my action not only affected home but him.</p>
      <p>"There was a point where I thought, 'That was it', there were times I wasn't sure it was gonna survive, times that you didn't know it needed to survive, you wanted it to survive.</p>
      <p>"Focusing on me and repairing relationships and being better person working out what was important."</p>
