      <p><b>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.Â (AP)</b> - Sam Darnold and the New York Jets are feeling a whole lot better about themselves - and their prospects for this season - after a gritty win.</p>
      <p>Even if it came against the equally lowly Giants.</p>
      <p>Le'Veon Bell scored a go-ahead 1-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter after a 33-yard pass interference penalty on DeAndre Baker, and the Jets rallied and then held on to beat Daniel Jones and the Giants 34-27 on Sunday for Big Apple bragging rights.</p>
      <p>"We needed that one," Darnold said.</p>
      <p>Darnold threw a touchdown pass to Jamison Crowder and ran for another score, and Jamal Adams scored on a 25-yard fumble return on a strip-sack as the Jets (2-7) bounced back from an embarrassing 28-16 loss last week at previously winless Miami. It also snapped a three-game skid, during which the seat under coach Adam Gase had grown increasingly hotter.</p>
      <p>"We need every win from now on," said Darnold, who was 19 of 30 for 230 yards and no interceptions. "We've still got a chance. I mean, if we got on a roll here and win out, we've got a chance at the playoffs. Guys in this locker room know this."</p>
      <p>The postseason seems little more than a pipe dream at this point, but the Jets are suddenly optimistic again.</p>
      <p>"Today was not nearly a perfect game," Bell said, "but it was good enough for us to win."</p>
      <p>Jones threw a career-high four touchdown passes, two each to Darius Slayton and Golden Tate, but couldn't prevent the Giants (2-8) from losing their sixth straight game. It's their first six-game skid since 2014, and has some frustrated Giants fans calling for Pat Shurmur's job.</p>
      <p>"We're disappointed we haven't been able to win a game for six," the Giants coach said. "That's the way it works. I am disappointed we didn't win this game. That's where it's at. The state of the team? That's where we are at."</p>
      <p>Saquon Barkley had the worst game of his young career, finishing with just 1 yard on 13 carries. He also had five catches for 30 yards.</p>
      <p>"I just have to get better," said a curt Barkley, who was seen going to the X-ray room after the game but wouldn't discuss it.</p>
      <p>"It makes it a lot easier when you make the other team one-dimensional and take away their biggest threat," Jets linebacker Brandon Copeland said.</p>
      <p>With the Giants trailing 21-19 in the third quarter, Jones marched them down the field on nine plays, capped by a 15-yard touchdown pass to Tate.</p>
      <p>Shurmur opted to go for a 2-point conversion and Jones found Bennie Fowler III in the end zone to put the Giants ahead for the first time, 27-21 with 5:21 left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Sam Ficken's 53-yard field goal late in the third quarter cut the Jets' deficit to three. The drive was kept alive by Darnold's 24-yard run - the longest rush for the Jets this season - on third-and-7.</p>
      <p>The Jets retook the lead on Bell's short touchdown run 8 seconds into the final quarter. After a 25-yard catch by Crowder, Darnold threw a deep pass to Robby Anderson and Baker was called for pass interference in the end zone - a 33-yard penalty that put the ball at the 1.</p>
      <p>"That P.I., I know it won't be on the stats sheet (for Anderson)," Gase said, "but that was really a big play."</p>
      <p>Ficken's 35-yarder made it 34-27 with 7:36 remaining, and the Jets defense held firm from there.</p>
      <p>QUICK STARTS</p>
      <p>Darnold gave the Jets an early lead by running it in from 2 yards out, capping a 13-play, 75-yard drive.</p>
      <p>On New York's next drive, Gase opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the 41 and rookie tight end Trevon Wesco ran for a 2-yard gain. Four plays later, Darnold fired a strike to Crowder for a 23-yard touchdown to make it 14-0.</p>
      <p>Jones, who finished 26 of 40 for 308 yards, got the Giants moving on their next drive, helped by three penalties on the Jets. On first-and-goal from the 5, Jones connected with Slayton to cut the Giants' deficit to 14-7 early in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Jones found Slayton again for a TD later in the quarter when Shurmur opted to go for it on fourth-and-4 from the Jets 39.</p>
      <p>With the Giants looking to tie it, holder Riley Dixon picked up Zak DeOssie's wayward snap on the extra point, but his throw to Kaden Smith for the 2-point conversion attempt fell incomplete to make it 14-13 with 5:24 left in the half.</p>
      <p>ADAMS ALL OVER</p>
      <p>Adams gave the Jets a 21-13 lead just three plays into the second half, when he ripped the ball out of Jones' hands and ran it into the end zone 25 yards for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>The star safety told Gase on the sideline shortly before the play that he was going to cause a turnover.</p>
      <p>"That's just my mindset," said Adams, who had two sacks and two forced fumbles. "Each and every Sunday or Monday, whatever it is, I just try to be the best on the field. I try to be the best in the league."</p>
      <p>ALMOST TIED</p>
      <p>Jones threw a screen to Tate for a 61-yard touchdown in the third quarter and the Giants went for the 2-point conversion - but Tate was called for offensive pass interference.</p>
      <p>Shurmur then opted for the extra point, but Aldrick Rosas was wide right - and the Jets still led, 21-19.</p>
      <p>INJURIES</p>
      <p>Giants: LT Nate Solder left in the second quarter with a concussion. ... CB Janoris Jenkins also suffered a concussion in the second half.</p>
      <p>Jets: RG Brian Winters injured a shoulder in the third quarter and didn't return. ... Bell said he came out briefly with sore ribs, but expects to play next week.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Giants: have a bye-week break before traveling to Chicago to face the Bears on Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>Jets: hit the road to take on the Washington Redskins next Sunday.</p>
