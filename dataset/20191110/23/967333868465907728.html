        <b>A shooting in a pizza parlour occured within minutes of an explosion in Malmo, Sweden, on Saturday night, alarming citizens and causing local politicians to act to curb a crime epidemic which has inflicted the city.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 15-year-old boy was killed and another teen is in critical condition after unknown assailants opened fire in a pizza parlour in Malmo on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>According to the Associated Press, the shooting happened around 9 p.m. and witnesses reportedly spotted the attackers fleeing the square on bicycles.</p>
      <p>The attack occurred just minutes after the explosion of a bomb placed under a car in another district in Malmo, destroying the vehicle and damaging nearby cars. No injuries have been reported and police have not confirmed if the incidents were connected.</p>

      <p>Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, chairwoman of local municipality council, told Sweden's SVT that she was concerned Saturday's events would lead to an escalation of the violence <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201908261076641107-three-people-hospitalised-after-shooting-in-swedish-city-of-malm---reports/">seen in recent years in the Malmo</a>.</p>
      <p>"It is every parent's nightmare to lose a child. It's been a heavy and black night in Malmo," Stjernfeldt Jammeh said, adding that similar events are said by police to be gang-related.</p>
      <p>Ulf Kristersson, leader of the opposition Moderate Party, called for governing Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Lofven to act to solve the violence which has plagued Malmo in recent years.</p>
      <p>Malmo is Sweden's 3rd largest city, home to some 320,000 residents, and has seen a rise of explosions and shootings in recent years, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201907151076247427-swedish-police-embroiled-in-firestorm-for-joining-pride-parade-amid-crime-epidemic/">largely connected with organised crime</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, 3 men were killed in a shooting close to the pizzeria where Saturday's attack took place. The incident was found to be linked to local organised crime.</p>
      <p>According to Swedish news agency TT, 5 fatal shootings and 29 explosions, including the incidents on Saturday, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906101075771373-police-shot-man/">have occured in Malmo</a> this year, a significant decrease from 2018, according to police statistics.</p>
