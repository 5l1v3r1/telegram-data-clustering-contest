        <b>World number four Neil Robertson won a dramatic Champion of Champions final by beating Judd Trump 10-9.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a high-quality match in Coventry, Robertson led the world number one 5-4 at the end of the afternoon session.</p>
      <p>The players were then locked at 8-8 when Trump got a snooker he needed and cleared up from the blue to go 9-8 up.</p>
      <p>Robertson needed a snooker in the next and got it before potting a re-spotted black to take the match into a decider, which he won with a 137 break.</p>
      <p>It was the Australian's fifth century of the match and helped earn him the Â£150,000 top prize.</p>
      <p>"I can't believe the pair of us playing a match like that. It's the best match I've ever been involved in," said Robertson.</p>
      <p>"It had everything. I dug in really deep to force a decider."</p>
      <p>Trump, who hit three centuries, was left to rue a missed red into the middle pocket when he was on the brink of victory at 9-8 up and on a break of 69.</p>
      <p>It allowed Robertson back into the match as he got a snooker, and he potted the remaining reds with the black to tie the scores and secured the frame with a re-spotted black.</p>
      <p>"The standard was very good throughout," said Trump. "Overall, I thought Neil deserved to win. he played the better snooker over the two sessions.</p>
      <p>"I'm not too disappointed. It was a game I enjoyed. Disappointed to lose from the position I was in but onwards and upwards."</p>
