      <p>Viewers said they went though a “rollercoaster of emotions” as Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly told how their friendship was tested in the wake of McPartlin’s drink-driving arrest.</p>
      <p>Many fans said they were sobbing as the pair opened up in ITV’s Ant And Dec’s DNA Journey, which saw them investigating their ancestry together.</p>
      <p>Filming for the programme began in 2017, but was halted after McPartlin crashed his car in March 2018 while more than twice the alcohol limit, before entering rehab.</p>
      <p>The star struggled with a two-year addiction to super-strength painkillers following a knee operation in 2015.</p>

      <p>In emotional scenes in the programme, Donnelly said at times he thought their decades-long relationship would not “survive”.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old also admitted that he was “incredibly angry” that his friend did not confide in him.</p>
      <p>He said: “I was incredibly angry at the start. So angry, disappointed in him that he didn’t ever come to me and say, ‘I’m struggling and I need you’.”</p>
      <p>“He never came to me and that hurt me a lot,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, the friendship did survive the turbulent time, and Donnelly noted: “We are much stronger together now.”</p>
      <p>Viewers said they were moved to tears by some of the scenes.</p>
      <p>One fan posted on Twitter: “That last ten minutes had me sobbing so much. They’ve been a part of my life for 20 odd years, ever since the SMTV days!</p>
      <p>“I’m so proud of Ant for taking control of his priorities and taking a break to focus on himself.”</p>
