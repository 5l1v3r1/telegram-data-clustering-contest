      <p>BRICK, New Jersey -- A New Jersey law that passed in August means that if you received a mail-in ballot in 2016, 2017 or 2018, you automatically received one this year unless you opted out.</p>
      <p>Several counties we checked in with have issued thousands more mail-in ballots this year than they have compared to past years.</p>
      <p>Some were not expecting to receive a mail-in ballot this year, even though county officials say they sent informational letters to voters.</p>
      <p>Dorothy Scott of Brick, New Jersey is filling out a last-minute mail-in ballot at the Ocean County Elections Office in Toms River, skipping the mail and handing it right over to a board of elections worker stationed across the hall.</p>
      <p>Scott voted by mail in 2018, and because she didn't opt-out of future mail-in ballots, she's voting by mail again this year.</p>
      <p>"For me to go to the same place and vote every single time and use this as an exception was always my idea. And then when the letter came if I didn't open it, where would I be tomorrow?" said Scott.</p>
      <p>Ocean County Clerk Scott Colabella says there have been a lot of questions about the new law.</p>
      <p>"As you can imagine there's confusion. Voters are getting ballots in the mail that they didn't request," he said.</p>
      <p>Colabella says more than 40,000 mail-in ballots have been issued for this year's election.</p>
      <p>For comparison, Colabella says, "The last time the state assembly was at the top of the ticket in 2015, we issued a little over 14,000 ballots. So more than double the amount of ballots that have gone to voters."</p>
      <p>And people are filling them out, he says. About half of those 40,000 mail-in ballots have been returned.</p>
      <p>But what if you received a mail-in ballot, and you still want to go to your polling place? You still can, with a caveat.</p>
      <p>"They're not going to allow you into the voting machine, because you've received a vote by mail ballot. But they will offer you a provisional ballot," said Colabella, assuring voters that they will be able to cast a ballot.</p>
      <p>If you want to opt-out of receiving mail-in ballots for future elections, you can fill out a form with your county.</p>
      <p>If you still have that mail-in ballot for this week's election, it must be postmarked by Election Day.<br/>----------<br/>* <b><a href="https://abc7ny.com/new-jersey/">More New Jersey news</a></b><br/>* <b><a href="https://7ny.tv/submitnewstip">Send us a news tip</a></b><br/>* <b><a href="https://abc7ny.com/apps/">Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts</a></b><br/>*<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrlIS7z20CnVaCrMvdkig_g"> Follow us on YouTube</a></b></p>
