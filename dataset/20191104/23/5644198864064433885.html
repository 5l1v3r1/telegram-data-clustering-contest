      <p>LONDON: Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has dismissed Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola's allegation that Sadio Mane is a diver ahead of next weekend's clash between the Premier League title rivals.</p>
      <p>Mane was booked after failing to win a penalty and then provided an assist before scoring the winner in a last-gasp 2-1 victory at Aston Villa on Saturday (Nov 2).</p>

      <p>Guardiola, whose side also scored late to beat Southampton, said of the Senegal international: "Sometimes he's diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute."</p>
      <p>Klopp, preparing the European champions for their Champions League clash against Genk on Tuesday, brushed it off, saying on Monday: "I am not 100 per cent sure if he spoke about Sadio or us in general.</p>
      <p>"I didn't hear Sadio's name or know how we could have known so quick about any incident in the game.</p>
      <p>"I can say Sadio is not a diver. There was a situation in the Aston Villa game where he got contact and went down. Maybe it was not a penalty but there was contact, it's not as if he jumped over a leg and went down."</p>
      <p>Klopp also refused to countenance talk about next Sunday's top-of-the-table clash with City, currently six points behind his side in second place, with the tie at home to Genk to negotiate.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are second in Group E on six points after three matches, one behind Napoli.</p>
      <p>"I am absolutely not in the mood today to talk about Man City," said Klopp.</p>
      <p>Asked if he was banning the words Manchester City until after Tuesday's match, Klopp said: "You can say the words Man City, you just cannot think about it.</p>
      <p>"I don't have to tell them that City is on Sunday, tomorrow is Genk.</p>
      <p>"I don't doubt my players at all. I would feel a bit embarrassed if I had to tell them 'Don't think about Man City already'."</p>
