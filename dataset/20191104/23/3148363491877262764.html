      <p>Asael, who is a patient at UNC Children’s Hospital, got to watch UNC’s football team play from box seats and got to meet the team’s players on Saturday, WTVD <a href="https://abc11.com/sports/8-year-old-heart-transplant-patient-lives-out-sports-dream/5667439/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>After Asael had a stroke in August 2018, doctors told his family that he would need a heart transplant and that he would have to wait at the hospital to get one.</p>
      <p>The boy was on the transplant waiting list for seven months before finding a match on June 3, 2019, and making it through the surgery successfully, according to UNC Medicine’s <a href="https://uncmedicine.org/initiatives/childrens-health/kid-champions/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>“A lot better for him, for us, for the whole family,” Asael’s father said. “It was a big process, so thank you God. He’s up walking, so that makes us very happy.”</p>
      <p>Asael, who is listed on UNC medicine’s website as a “kid champion,” received so many gifts and toys throughout his 290-day hospital stay, but he decided not to open a single one of them until he returned home.</p>
