      <p>McDonald's Corp said on Monday former chief executive officer, Steve Easterbrook, was eligible for six months of severance pay as part of his termination agreement with the company.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: McDonald's Corp said on Monday former chief executive officer, Steve Easterbrook, was eligible for six months of severance pay as part of his termination agreement with the company.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, McDonald's said it had dismissed Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.</p>

      <p>"In consideration for (severance) benefits, Mr. Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favor of the company, to cooperate with the company following his termination," McDonald's said in regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000089882219000080/0000898822-19-000080-index.htm.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook received total compensation US$15.88 million in 2018, according to a regulatory filing. The value of the severance package was not immediately clear.</p>
      <p>McDonald's also said Easterbrook's separation agreement contained a two-year post-termination non-competition covenant, which is six months longer and more expansive in scope than his existing agreements.</p>
      <p>New CEO Chris Kempczinski will have a annual base salary of US$1.25 million, with a target-based bonus of 170per cent of his annual base salary, McDonald's said.</p>
