      <h2>HMS Urge went missing without a trace in 1942</h2>

      <p>The wreck of a Royal Navy submarine which has been missing for more than 70 years has finally been discovered - at the bottom of the sea off Malta.</p>
      <p>HMS Urge vanished on April 27, 1942, shortly after leaving the island's Grand Harbour for Egypt.</p>
      <p>The disappearance of the sub has remained a mystery ever since, despite several failed searches. Until now.</p>
      <p>A marine archaeology survey team from the University of Malta has discovered the wreckage of the boat two miles from the coast, where it appeared to have been struck by a mine.</p>
      <p>It is thought its 32-strong crew, along with 11 <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/royal-navy">Royal Navy</a> passengers and a journalist, were killed.</p>
      <p>The discovery comes three years after a false alarm, when another team mistakenly thought they had found the remains of HMS Urge off Libya.</p>

      <p>Professor Timmy Gambin <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-50260427">told the BBC</a> the wreck was "in absolutely fantastic condition".</p>
      <p>He said: "It's sitting upright on the seabed, very proud, in the direction it was ordered to take on its way to Alexandria."</p>
      <p>Prof Gambin, of the University of Malta's classics and archaeology department, had been leading the hunt alongside Francis Dickinson - grandson of HMS Urge's commanding officer - Canadian naval researcher Platon Alexiades and Royal Navy historians.</p>
      <p>The university said its search results had "established beyond doubt" that a German mine had sunk HMS Urge as it left the British submarine base during World War Two's siege of Malta.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Defence has recognised the site of the discovery as "the last resting place of HMS Urge and those who lost their lives in service of their country".</p>
      <p>It said it was "grateful" to the team that found it and requested that "the vessel is undisturbed and in situ", the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>HMS Urge was commanded by Lieutenant Commander Edward Tomkinson and was one of 19 British U-class submarines lost in the Second World War.</p>

      <p>Among her finest moments were severely damaging the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto and sinking the Italian cruiser Bande Nere.</p>
      <p>A permanent memorial is now to be erected in Malta and a commemorative service there is being planned for next year.</p>
