        <i>Former Air New Zealand CEO will run against Jami-Lee Ross who spectacularly fell out with National party last year</i>
      </p>
      <p>The former chief executive of Air <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> has become the National party’s official candidate for the Auckland seat of Botany, kick-starting speculation that Christopher Luxon is vying – eventually – to become prime minister.</p>
      <p>Luxon, 49, resigned as the national carrier’s chief executive in September after seven years leading the airline through a period of success and growth,– including repeatedly <a href="https://www.airnewzealand.co.nz/press-release-2017-air-nz-named-airline-of-the-year">being named the world’s best airline</a>. He has also held a number of senior roles with the multinational company Unilever over a period of 18 years.</p>
      <p>The socially-conservative businessman says he is focused on “learning” and listening to the people of Botany, but his name <a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/air-nzs-christopher-luxon-makes-appearance-preferred-pm-in-1-news-colmar-brunton-poll">has already appeared on polls as a candidate for preferred prime minister</a>, polling just 5% below current National party leader Simon Bridges.</p>
      <p>Luxon told Morning Report that he was anti-abortion, anti-euthanasia and doesn’t want to legalise recreational marijuana, and the more pressing issue for his constituents was transport.</p>
      <p>“I’m just interested in solving problems, and we have a lot of problems in this country,” <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/402527/ex-air-new-zealand-boss-wins-national-s-botany-candidacy">Luxon told RNZ.</a></p>
      <p>“We are very good at platitudes. We’ve got very good at buzzwords and ideology, but we’re not getting things done for people. That means that we’re not making a difference in people’s lives daily, and that’s something we have to work really hard at.”</p>
      <p>Luxon will stand for the seat against independent Jami-Lee Ross, who fell out with the National party last year<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/16/simon-bridges-new-zealand-opposition-leader-accused-of-concealing-100000-political-donation"> in spectacular fashion</a>.</p>
      <p>The former prime minister John Key has endorsed Luxon’s determined tilt towards politics, describing him as a <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12282362">“world-class candidate”.</a></p>
      <p>Luxon said National party leader, Simon Bridges, had his full support and deserved the top job, saying speculation that he wanted the leadership for himself was premature.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just been elected to be the candidate for Botany. I’ve got a lot of work to do, I’ve got a lot to learn. And more importantly, frankly we’ve got a job to do – to make Simon Bridges the prime minister of New Zealand,”</p>
      <p>Luxon grew up in the Botany area and says his childhood instilled “hard-working, middle-class values” in him.</p>
      <p>“Like the rest of New Zealand, it [Botany] is facing the pinch from a Coalition government that is breaking its promises to Kiwis, hiking the cost of living, and failing to deliver on the things that matter.”</p>
      <p>Luxon is an evangelical christian and is married with two children. He has been a stalwart of the New Zealand business scene for decades, including serving as chair on the current prime minister’s business advisory council.</p>
      <p>Luxon is also the recipient of the Peter Blake Leader Award and the Deloitte CEO of the year.</p>
