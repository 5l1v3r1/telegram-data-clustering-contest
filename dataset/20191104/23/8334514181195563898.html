      <p>(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/9984.T">9984.T</a>) is expected to outline tougher governance standards and restrictions on dual-class share structures on Wednesday after WeWork pulled its IPO, the Financial Times reported on Monday, citing people briefed on the plan.</p>
      <p>The Japanese conglomerate will apply the new standards to future investments and is tightening governance at companies it backs, the FT said. (<a href="https://on.ft.com/2C8I93w">on.ft.com/2C8I93w</a>)</p>
      <p>SoftBank was set to write down at least $5 billion due to a slump in the value of the U.S. office sharing startup and some other top holdings, according to a media report.</p>
