      <p>HOLLYWOOD (KABC) -- Ed Asner celebrated his 90th birthday with a big party in Hollywood. The event also served as a benefit for something near and dear to his heart.<br/><br/>In his long career, Asner has won seven Emmy Awards-- five of them for playing the same character! He got three for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and then two more for "Lou Grant."<br/><br/>Among his hundreds of roles, Santa Claus in "Elf", and as Carl in the Pixar animated movie, "Up." Perhaps his biggest role, though, is promoting self-confidence in differently abled people through The <a href="https://abc7.com/society/ed-asner-launches-camp-ed-an-arts-camp-for-those-with-special-needs/3830830/">Ed Asner Family Center</a>, which opened in Reseda earlier this year.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://abc7.com/society/ed-asner-launches-camp-ed-an-arts-camp-for-those-with-special-needs/3830830/">MORE: Ed Asner Family Center launches Camp Ed, an arts camp for those with special needs</a></b><br/><br/>"I have an autistic son who was able to get a degree from the University of Southern Connecticut, "said Asner. "I want these kids to have that same opportunity and go beyond."<br/><br/>Ed's son, Matt, and his wife have three children on the spectrum. They run the center.<br/><br/>"We've created this center where the entire family can come and have enrichments and mental health support and yoga and meditation while their children are getting enrichments," said Navah Paskowitz-Asner.<br/><br/>For Ed's 90th, which is actually Nov. 15, the stars came out to celebrate him... and to roast him.<br/><br/>"People are supposed to mellow with age, right? Not Ed," said Tom Bergeron. "Didn't get the memo. And I love that. I think that's why he's 90!"<br/><br/>"He's a tough guy. He used to intimidate me but not anymore because, you know, he's incoherent," joked Brad Garrett.<br/><br/>"He puts on that charming, gruff exterior but underneath it, it's all jelly and cushy teddy bear in there," said Rob Schneider.</p>
