      <p>Dutch Olympian Madiea Ghafoor has been jailed for eight and a half years for drug smuggling and trafficking.</p>
      <p>Ghafoor, 27, competed at the Rio Olympics in 2016 in the 4x400m relay.</p>
      <p>She was stopped at a routine border check in Germany in June, when she was found to have £2m worth of drugs in the boot of her car.</p>
      <p>Ghafoo appeared at Kleve District Court on Monday and told the court she thought she was carrying doping materials.</p>
      <p>She was found to have 50kg of ecstasy tablets, 2kg of crystal meth and almost €11,950 (£10,317) in cash.</p>

      <p>The Dutch Athletics Union said: "We are stunned by the judgements.</p>
      <p>"With the ruling of the German court, the Athletics Union rejects the actions of Ghafoor.</p>
      <p>"The Athletics Union condemns any use or trade in doping or drugs and fully commits itself to the Dutch doping law."</p>
      <p>Ghafoor pleaded not guilty to the charge and indicated she is likely to appeal.</p>

      <p>She also refused to say who gave her the drugs, admitting she fears for the safety of her friends and family.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is of Pakistani descent but was born and raised in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>Having caught the eye in the Junior Championships, she has since represented Netherlands at the European Championships.</p>
      <p>She was part of the squad in Rio in 2016, became the first female athlete of Baloch origin to compete.</p>
