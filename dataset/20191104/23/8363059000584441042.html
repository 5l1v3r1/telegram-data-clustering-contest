      <h1>Say Hello to Ming-Na Wen's Badass Mandalorian Character</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T23:00:10+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Whitbrook</a></address>
      <p>Ming-Na Wen. Badass. Interchangeable descriptions, really.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/ming-na-wen-the-mandalorian-star-wars-fennec-shand">Vanity Fair</a> has just dropped a sneaky new teaser for <i>The Mandalorian</i>. It’s got some new footage compared to even last week’s trailer, one that, shock of shocks, actually features a lot more than just <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/breaking-down-the-details-and-mysteries-of-the-mandalorians-final-trailer/">Werner Herzog Werner-Herzogging</a> all over the show.</p>
      <p>Actual dialogue, albeit brief! We get to hear a little more from <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-mandalorian-is-bringing-a-deep-cut-star-wars-creatu-1837713272">Kuuil the Ugnaught</a>, who’s been glimpsed in both merchandise and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/breaking-down-the-details-and-mysteries-of-the-mandalorians-final-trailer/">briefly in the trailers</a> (and this trailer seemingly confirms that he’s indeed Nick Nolte’s <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/11/report-nick-nolte-is-the-latest-mysterious-star-to-join-the-mandalorian/">previously unannounced character</a>) as one of the many associates of Pedro Pascal’s masked Mandalorian – although here he’s telling us he’s never actually <i>met</i> a Mandalorian before, so they’re perhaps not quite really associates just yet.</p>
      <p>But we also get to hear from a character we’ve not seen at all: Ming-Na Wen’s mysterious mercenary (is there anyone in this show who isn’t one of those?), Fennec Shand.</p>

      <p>Although Shand doesn’t have much to say in the footage, just an ominous line to Pascal’s Mando that his name will be “legendary,” Wen did tell Vanity Fair a little more about her approach to Shand. It’s essentially what you’d expect upon first thought when told the sentence “Ming-Na Wen is playing a character in that <i>Star Wars</i> bounty hunter show” – strong, independent, agile, and loyal to no side but her own. Or, more simply? <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/its-official-melinda-may-just-became-the-star-of-agent-1697919991">Melinda May <i>in spaaaaaaaaaace</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“She’s tricky, and yet she’s able to manoeuvre and survive, and be stealthy – so very graceful and agile. I just love that whole image with the name,” Wen told Vanity Fair. “She has quite a few weapons because she’s a very skilled fighter. Just her body is a weapon in and of itself. And she does carry…a big, big gun. A big boy.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully, Fennec’s kickassery is enough to let her stick around for a good while. If Kuuil’s line is anything to go by, it seems like <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/new-mandalorian-details-tease-a-lawless-galaxy-and-its-1837903336">the Mandalorian’s allies</a> might only be so plentiful because not many get to live long enough to know him. We’ll learn more when <i>The Mandalorian</i> hits Disney+ next week, starting 12 November.</p>
