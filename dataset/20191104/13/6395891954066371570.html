      <p><b>BERLINÂ (AP)</b> - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to 10 people killed by a neo-Nazi group in an eastern German city where a tree planted in honor of the first victim was recently destroyed.</p>
      <p>Merkel on Monday visited a park in Zwickau, where 10 new trees have now been planted in memory of the people, mostly immigrants, killed by the National Socialist Underground group from 2000-2007.</p>
      <p>The NSU's only known surviving member was sentenced to life imprisonment last year.</p>
      <p>Merkel renewed a pledge that "we will do everything ... so that such things don't happen again."</p>
      <p>Last month, an oak tree commemorating the group's first victim, flower seller Enver Simsek, was sawed down.</p>
      <p>As Merkel spoke beside the memorial Monday, a handful of far-right protesters nearby chanted for her to leave.</p>
