      <p>“Let me tell you the truth, Vanessa and I broke up in 2018 December. Guys knew about our breakup 8 months after. To people, it was too soon but to us, it took time. I mean almost a year is not a short time to move on,” he intimated.</p>
      <p>“I am happy she found love in Rotimi. I was waiting for the day she will be happy. You know when it comes to love one person moves on after a breakup and one remains and so when I saw she has moved on, in all honesty, I was happy,” he added.</p>
      <p>On the topic of the songstress’s new found love, Olu Rotimi Akinosho, Jux said he is a fan of Power, an American show in which he plays Dre, a drug baron.</p>

      <p>“I watch power a lot and I love Rotimi and the way he acts I love it. I said it in an interview before that if Vanessa finds someone, he has found a good girl because she is amazing and every man wants to be with her. I mean I have been in a relationship with her for 6 years. She is an amazing girl. I am happy for her to be honest,” he said.</p>
      <p>Jux has moved on to a Caucasian woman, Nayika.</p>
      <p>Vanessa and Rotimi on the other hand were house hunting on Sunday and are keeping up appearances especially on social media.</p>
