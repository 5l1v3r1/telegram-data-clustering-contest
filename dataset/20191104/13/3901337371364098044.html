      <p>Kgotso Moleko is a marauding right back, who plies his trade for Kaizer Chiefs. Off the field, he is a game stock farmer who drives an impressive Mercedes-Benz and a bakkie valued at well over R1 million.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has played a bit-part role for Ernst Middendorp’s team this season as he plays second fiddle to the likes of Reeve Frosler and Njabulo Blom.</p>
      <p>Off the field, Moleko likes to get his hands dirty on his farm. </p>
