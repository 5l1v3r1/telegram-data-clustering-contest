      <p><b>COTONOU, BeninÂ (AP)</b> - A Norwegian shipping company says that nine crew members have been abducted in the West African nation of Benin after a pirate attack.</p>
      <p>The J.J. Ugland Companies said Monday that pirates had boarded the bulk vessel MV Bonita early Saturday while the ship was anchored near Cotonou.</p>
      <p>The pirates managed to abduct nine crew members but did not take the Norwegian-flagged ship.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian Shipowners' Association identified the kidnapping victims as nationals of the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The threat of piracy attacks remains high in the Gulf of Guinea, where the association says there are least 50 attempted attacks each year.</p>
      <p>Local authorities said they were investigating whether the hostages were taken to nearby Nigeria.</p>
