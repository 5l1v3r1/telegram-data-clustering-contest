      <p>If you like running outdoors no matter the weather, you need the <a href="http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-earmuffs-and-ear-warmers-on-amazon.html">best earmuffs for running</a>. A solid pair can help keep you warm and <a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/ears-hurt-in-cold/">earache-free when temperatures drop</a>, all while staying firmly put on your head. Below, I’ve rounded up earmuffs to suit a variety of styles, preferences, and budgets.</p>
      <p>Comfort and warmth are probably the most important factors to consider when looking for earmuffs to wear while running. So, you’ll want a fabric that’s warm but breathable, since you’ll presumably start sweating at some point during your chilly run. Almost all of the picks below are made from 100% polyester — a great material for its <a href="https://www.rei.com/blog/run/how-to-pick-the-most-breathable-fabrics">sweat-wicking, quick-drying, and pill-resistant</a> qualities. Some are more specifically a polyester fleece, which is great since <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/explore/all-about-fleece-jackets">it's typically warm and breathable</a>. A few of the selections additionally boast thermal reflective technology, <a href="https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/thinsulate-us/">Thinsulate material for extra insulation</a>, and special sweat-wicking technology, but all of them should keep you toasty and wick away sweat to some degree.</p>
      <p>You can choose from headband ear warmers that fit snugly around any head; adjustable earmuffs for a customizable fit, or band-less earmuffs that slip over your ears like little ear mittens. Most pairs below still allow you to wear earbud or pod-style headphones, but you might consider the pick that has built-in Bluetooth technology for a seamless union of earmuffs and headphones.</p>
      <p>Check out the <a href="http://www.trainfora5k.com/best-ear-muffs-for-runners/">best earmuffs for runners</a>. They’re all highly rated and under $30.</p>
