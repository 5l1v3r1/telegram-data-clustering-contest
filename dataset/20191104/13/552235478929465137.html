      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:45:06+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Morrow, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/daniel-morrow/</a></address>
      <p>A shocked dog walker has issued a warning to pet owners after discovering food laced with a mysterious crystal-like substance and pins during a walk in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> park.</p>
      <p>Local dog walking provider Tartan Pet Services was walking through Titwood Park in the Pollokshields area on Monday morning when they made the discovery.</p>
      <p>A photo from the park shows what looks like two potatoes with around seven pins on each with what has been described as a “white crystal substance” sprinkled on top.</p>
      <p>They have now warned pet owners and parents to be careful around the park, which is used frequently by children and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">dog</a> walkers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, they said: “Pollokshields walk just started and this is what I’ve come across.</p>
      <p>“Seriously what is wrong with people. Please please please be careful.</p>
      <p>“This was found outside the gate at Titwood Park on Glencairn Drive where children and dogs both frequent, so please watch your children and dog in case they anything.</p>
      <p>“There was white crystal substances sprinkled on top and around which has been removed too but just to keep a look out.”</p>
      <p>An update on the discovery reveals that the police have been contacted.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> have been approached for comment.</p>
