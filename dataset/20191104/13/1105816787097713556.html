      <p><b>SRINAGAR: </b>At least one person was killed and 17 wounded on Monday in a grenade blast at a crowded market in Indian Occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar city.</p>
      <p>Kashmir has been on a knife-edge since August 5 when the Indian government moved to strip the region of its autonomy, imposed a lock down, cut telecommunications and detained thousands.</p>
      <p>Doctors at the main hospital said that the deceased was a resident of northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>“Two people are critical,” a doctor said on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Srinagar police chief Haseeb Mughal told <i>AFP</i> that 18 people were injured out of whom one died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Around half of mobile phones remain cut off, as does the internet, while hundreds of local political leaders are still in detention, mostly without charge.</p>
      <p>Markets, schools and public areas remain closed with government forces still patrolling the streets, with periodic security lock downs imposed on many parts of the region.</p>
