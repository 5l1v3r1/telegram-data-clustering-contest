      <p><a href="https://www.slu.edu/news/announcements/2019/october/flu-challenge-study.php">St. Louis University’s Center for Vaccine Development</a> is conducting an <a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/health/clinical-trial-will-pay-you-000-infected-with-flu-virus/9WukC3nGGHwlfI3hBl1Z7H/">influenza study</a> to better understand what happens when a person is infected with the flu and how the body controls the infection. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/health/clinical-trial-will-pay-you-000-infected-with-flu-virus/9WukC3nGGHwlfI3hBl1Z7H/">Researchers</a> are looking for 80 healthy participants 18-49 years old. Each person will receive a nasal spray containing a strain of seasonal influenza. The strain, InfluenzaA/Bethesda/MM2/H1N1, was developed by scientists with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and reliably produces mild to moderate influenza disease in most recipients. </p>
      <p>Pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers are not allowed to participate. Habitual smokers of any kind are also excluded. Participants are not allowed to use drugs or alcohol during the trial.</p>
      <p>Volunteers will need to remain at least seven days in one of the four clinics participating in the trial, then be monitored for about three months after leaving the clinic.</p>
      <p>The lead Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit is the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore. The other VTEUs conducting the trial are: Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center; Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; and Saint Louis University Center for Vaccine Development.</p>
      <p>Participants will be paid $75 for each required clinic visit (four), $300 for each inpatient visit (10) and $10 for each phone call (one). Total is $3,310 for completing all planned study visits.</p>
