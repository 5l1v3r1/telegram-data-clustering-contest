      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:54:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p>In a bid to empower smartphone <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/photography">photography </a>lovers, software major <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adobe">Adobe </a>on Monday introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled camera app that brings Photoshop capabilities right in your palm.</p>
      <p>With "Photoshop Camera", users can capture, edit and share photos and moments - both natural and creative - using real-time Photoshop-grade magic right from the viewfinder, leaving you free to focus on storytelling with powerful tools and effects.</p>
      <p>Leveraging "<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adobe">Adobe </a>Sensei" intelligence, the app instantly recognise the subject in the photo and provide recommendations, and automatically apply sophisticated, unique features at the moment of capture while preserving an original shot.</p>
      <p>"It also understands the technical content (dynamic range, tonality, scene-type, face regions) of the photo and automatically applies complex adjustments," Abhay Parasnis, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, said here during the company's flagship '<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adobe">Adobe </a>Max 2019' creative conference here.</p>
      <p>The app is currently available as a preview for iOS and Android devices and will be available for the public in 2020.</p>
      <p>The new app unlocks the power of the creative community by allowing users to access a curated feed of lenses made by well-known artists and influencers, including chart topper Billie Eilish.</p>
      <p>"Photoshop Camera is a major moment for us to broaden Adobe Creative Cloud as a creativity platform for all. We are committed to investing in accessible tools like Photoshop Camera built for the next generation of consumers and creatives," said Parasnis.</p>
      <p>For the past several years, Adobe has leveraged the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver amazing features to the creative community through "Adobe Sensei", its AI platform and framework.</p>
      <p>"We built Photoshop Camera as a Sensei-first app on our journey to expand our focus to deliver creative tools, including Photoshop, to everyone," said the company.</p>
