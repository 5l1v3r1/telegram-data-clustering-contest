      <p>A jilted lover has been found guilty of murdering a nursing student he was casually seeing because she didn't want to have a serious relationship with him.</p>
      <p>Orlando Tercero, 23, strangled 22-year-old Haley Anderson at his apartment in Binghamton, US, on March 8 last year.</p>
      <p>The court heard the pair were in an "on-and-off" relationship but when Tercero said he wanted things to be serious between them Ms Anderson said no, the <a href="https://eu.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/2019/11/01/orlando-tercero-found-guilty-murder-haley-anderson/4107653002/">Binghamton Press &amp; Sun Bulletin</a> reports.</p>
      <p>After the murder Tercero fled to his homeland Nicaragua but the government refused to extradite him back to the US so his trial took place there.</p>
      <p>The trial was watched by Ms Anderson's family, friends and the US media via a video live stream.</p>

      <p>Witnesses in the US also used the livestream to give evidence.</p>
      <p>The court heard from 17 witnesses who said Tercero killed Ms Anderson because he was jealous that she had reconnected with an ex-boyfriend.</p>
      <p>He then left her body partly tucked in to his bed at the apartment.</p>
      <p>After the murder Tercero carried out a botch suicide attempt and checked himself into a psychiatric hospital after arriving in Nicaragua claiming he was suffering from epileptic seizures.</p>

      <p>However a doctor said Tercero's mental state was fine and he was not receiving any treatment or medicine for psychiatric issues.</p>
      <p>Tercero's lawyers tried to argue that his actions may have been provoked.</p>
      <p>He was convicted on Friday and will be sentenced at a later date following negotiations between Nicaraguan and US authorities. He is facing 30 years in jail.</p>
      <p>Ms Anderson's parents Karen and Gordon said they want to see Tercero face the maximum penalty.</p>

      <p>Speaking directly to their daughter's murderer, Karen said: "I hope that the demons that are inside you that enabled you to commit such a heinous crime are able to get fixed.</p>
      <p>"Because of you, my daughter will never be able to fill her life to the potential that she had.</p>
      <p>"She will never get to see the age of 49 or 50 or beyond."</p>
      <p>Gordon added: "I want to leave you with this. I saw an endearing photo of you and your mother hugging each other.</p>
      <p>"My heart breaks for her, it truly does.</p>

      <p>"Because you stole from your own mother. And, even though she has unconditional love for you, every time she hugs you she will get a glimpse of that monster within you and she'll know that one day you might get out."</p>
      <p>Broome County District Attorney Steve Cornwell in Binghamton said he was "satisfied" with the verdict.</p>
      <p>He added: "We saw something that we haven't seen before, but we saw two governments working together, law enforcement agencies working together.</p>
      <p>"Although not what we wanted, we wanted to have the trial here, but we saw justice take place in a courtroom on an international stage."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Paying tribute to their daughter Mr and Mrs Anderson described her as "beautiful, intelligent and friendly" and "a beacon and a lighthouse".</p>
      <p>Tercreo, who refused to speak to the Andersons in court, will be arrested and tried for second-degree murder charge in Broome County if he enters the US again.</p>
