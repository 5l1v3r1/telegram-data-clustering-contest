      <h1>Rulani: Pirates Were Tactically Superior</h1>

      <p>Orlando Pirates coach Rulani Mokwena insisted that his side, who were a man down just five minutes into the second half of their Soweto Derby Telkom Knockout quarter-final clash away to Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday, were “tactically superior”.</p>
      <p>In the end, the Buccaneers were dumped out of the cup on penalties having gallantly fought and held Amakhosi to a 2-2 draw after extra-time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mokwena, as he has often done since taking over the reins at Pirates three months ago, looked for positives rather wallow in defeat.</p>
      <p>“The first half was very good, complete dominance and unbelievably tactically superior and managed a lot of threats we knew would come against Chiefs. They are a very awkward team to deal with because they mix between building from the back and utilizing their strength with the two strikers,” he told reporters after the game.  </p>
      <p>“We knew we would also deal with the long balls to Castro and Nurkovic. It’s a first half where we were in complete control, going into the break 1-0 up.”</p>
      <p>Mokwena had also sent social media into frenzy with his remarks on television that watching Pirates battle their way during the derby even with a man short was akin to watching a beautiful painting – words he reiterated in his post-match with the press.</p>
      <p>“I was saying I felt like Pablo Picasso because if you love football, you just cannot admire the Orlando Pirates players – they were unbelievable,” he explained.</p>
