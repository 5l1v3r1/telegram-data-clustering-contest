      <h1>Trump: 'Whistleblower' Must Testify; 'Written Answers Not Acceptable'</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump ripped the so-called ‘whistleblower’ on Monday after lawyers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/whistleblower-offers-republicans-testimony-as-trump-seeks-to-unmask-idUSKBN1XD0C1">agreed</a> to allow him to answer written questions from House Republicans.</h2>

      <p>“He must be brought forward to testify,” Trump wrote. “Written answers not acceptable!”</p>
      <p>Trump argued the “whistleblower” gave false information about his call with the Ukrainian president and worked with House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff before coming forward.</p>
      <p>The identity of the “whistleblower” has already been revealed in a<a href="https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/10/30/whistleblower_exposed_close_to_biden_brennan_dnc_oppo_researcher_120996.html"> report </a>by Real Clear Investigations, although lawyers refused to confirm or deny the report but rather pretended his identiy remains a sacred secret.</p>
      <p>Trump taunted the media on Sunday for not following up on his identity.</p>
      <p>“You know who it is. You just don’t want to report it,” Trump <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/03/donald-trump-taunts-cnn-refusing-reveal-identity-whistleblower/">said.</a> “CNN knows who it is but you don’t want to report it. And you would be doing the public a service if you did.”</p>
      <p>The president also questioned the location of the second ‘whistleblower.’</p>
      <p>“Where is the 2nd Whistleblower?” Trump wrote. “He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!”</p>
      <p>Trump said anyone who had questions about his July phone call with the Ukranian president had only to read the transcript which he released.</p>
      <p>“There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning,” Trump wrote. “This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!”</p>
