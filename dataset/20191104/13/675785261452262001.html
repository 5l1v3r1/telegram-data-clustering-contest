      <h1>Roy Keane makes acting debut with cameo role in new series of Young Offenders</h1>
      <h2>The ex-Man Utd skipper, who has been working as a Sky Sports pundit, had a brief role in episode four of the second series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:41:52+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:41</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> has been a regular on TV as a pundit since retiring from football in 2006, but it seems the 48-year-old is keen to branch out into other areas of entertainment.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> skipper has been a huge hit as part of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sky-sports">Sky Sports'</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> coverage so far this season, with his withering putdowns sending watching fans into hysterics.</p>
      <p>The ex- <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">Republic of Ireland</a> midfielder has been outspoken on former club United's current malaise, while he has also not been shy in giving his views on the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dele-alli">Dele Alli</a> .</p>
      <p>And though he has been well received as a pundit, it looks like there could be a career move on the cards for Keane after a hilarious cameo appearance in a sitcom.</p>

      <p>The former Celtic man can be seen in a brief scene from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p07rqtl4/the-young-offenders-series-2-episode-4">episode four</a> of the second season of the BBC Three show 'Young Offenders'.</p>
      <p>The comedy is set in Keane's native Cork and follows the escapades of young criminals Conor MacSweeney and Jock O'Keefe.</p>
      <p>In episode four, the pair have been selling food from a chip van outside of a Cork City match when Keane approaches them following the game.</p>
      <p>After Jock queries who the customer is, Keane is roundly told by the pair to vacate the area, though with a slightly stronger turn of phrase.</p>
      <p>It was a brilliantly funny first foray into acting for the 48-year-old, though of course the former midfield hard man is not the first ex-United star to try his luck in the industry.</p>

      <p>Keane's former Red Devils colleague Eric Cantona has enjoyed a storied career in film and television since retiring from football in 1997.</p>
      <p>The French forward made his acting debut in 1995 and has since gone on to appear in such hits as 'Looking for Eric' and 'The Salvation'.</p>
      <p>Who knows, maybe one day Keane and Cantona will star alongside each other...</p>
