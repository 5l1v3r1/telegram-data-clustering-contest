        <b>A woman woke up to find a bull staring up at her from her back garden.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The weighty bovine, named Arnold, smashed through a fence in his adjoining field on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He trampled the woman's lawn in Raunds, Northamptonshire and took a nap before a farmer arrived to move him on and repair the damage.</p>
      <p>The homeowner, who did not want to be named said although she enjoys living next to the cows she was not expecting to see Arnold at such close quarters.</p>

      <p>She wrote on Facebook: "I don't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
      <p>"We absolutely love having the cows next door - but he's destroyed our grass.</p>
      <p>"He's so heavy he's put loads of massive holes in the garden too."</p>
