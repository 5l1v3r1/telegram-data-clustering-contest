      <p>While <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21savage/profile">21 Savage</a> might initially sound like an odd choice for an <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/AliciaKeys/profile">Alicia Keys</a> remix, he has shown a great ability to adapt to different musical moods. After all, this is the man who <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21-savage-jumps-on-normanis-motivation-remix-new-song.1985005.html">hopped on Normani's extremely poppy "Motivation"</a> last week. The Atlanta rapper also displayed a willingness to get introspective and even test out his singing chops on his last album, <i>I Am &gt; I Was. </i>This remix comes at the perfect time, as <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/21-savage-addresses-ice-detainment-in-new-song-preview-news.94773.html">all the stars seem to be aligning to usher in Savage's return</a>.</p>
      <p>For the "Show Me Love" remix, Savage opts for a heavily-autotuned approach while he fittingly dives into romantic matters. The only change from the original wasn't solely the added rap verse at the beginning. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/alicia-keys-and-miguel-release-gorgeous-new-single-show-me-love-new-song.1984531.html">The version that was shared early in September</a> was stripped-back and didn't have any percussion. The remix is loaded with 808s and other drums with interesting textures. Alicia and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Miguel/profile">Miguel</a>'s buttery vocals layered over each other still give the song a homey feel.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/miguels-back-with-new-single-funeral-new-song.1985043.html">Miguel also dropped a new song, "Funeral", last Friday</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When you walk in the house, show me love<br/>It ain't even gotta be Valentine's Day<br/>I'm gon' still leave some roses by the tub<br/>Go through so much in the skreet<br/>I just wanna come home to a meal and a hug</p>
