      <p>Former Barcelona midfielder Andre Gomes suffered an horrific injury in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese player had to be taken from the field on a stretcher after Son Heung Min’s challenge saw him fall badly as he was caught, appearing to suffer what might well be a broken ankle.</p>
      <p>Son was sent off after VAR looked at the incident, for “endangering the safety of another player&amp;rdquor;.</p>
      <p>“(I) didn’t want to look too much at what happened. I want to send best wishes,&amp;rdquor; said Dele Alli.</p>
      <p>"Son is devastated and in tears. It’s not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you’ve ever met. He can’t even lift his head up, he’s crying so much.</p>
      <p>12 minutes were added on at Goodison Park for the injury and Everton used it to equalise, with Cenk Tosun netting at the death after Alli’s opener.</p>
