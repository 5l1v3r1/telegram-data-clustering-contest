        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): As odd-even vehicle rationing scheme to reduce traffic on the roads of New Delhi kicked off today as part of efforts to combat the toxic air-smearing the city with grey fumes. But some bizarre suggestions from Indian ministers have infuriated local residents.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Suggestions from government ministers ranging from eating carrots and listening to music to performing oblation as ways to counter the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911031077216443-indian-government-says-countrys-north-is-under-emergency-due-to-air-pollution/">pollution-related problems of Delhi</a> have irked residents of the smoke-smeared city.</p>
      <p>Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan suggested in a tweet on Sunday that eating carrots is not only beneficial for blindness but also helps in fighting against <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911041077218280-modi-government-introduces-road-rationing-to-tackle-emergency-like-air-pollution-in-new-delhi/">pollution-related ills.</a></p>

      <p>The Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar, who had been squabbling with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over measures to tackle the public health emergency, recommended “scintillating thematic” music to people struggling for clean air to breath. </p>

      <p>Another suggestion came from Sunil Bharala, a cabinet minister in Uttar Pradesh's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, who suggested that yajna, a fire ritual done as an <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911031077214789-indian-minister-suggests-oblation-to-please-god-of-rain-as-way-to-stop-air-pollution/">oblation in Hinduism</a>, should be performed to please the Rain God. He also said farmers have always practiced stubble burning and that this is a “natural system”.</p>
      <p>The statements from the ministers drew an instant backlash on social media.</p>
