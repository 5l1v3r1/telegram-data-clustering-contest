      <p>NEW YORK -- The Golden Globe Awards will give its new TV special achievement trophy to someone who has been a pioneering sitcom star, a TV talk-show host and a game-show MC -- Ellen DeGeneres.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Monday that the Carol Burnett Award -- the small-screen version of the group's film counterpart, the Cecil B. DeMille Award -- will go to DeGeneres, a multiple Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee.</p>
      <p>It is given annually to honour someone "who has made outstanding contributions to television on or off the screen." The first Carol Burnett Award last year fittingly went to Burnett herself.</p>
      <p>In a statement, association President Lorenzo Soria hailed DeGeneres as "a pioneer who has captivated audiences for nearly 25 years with her undeniable charm and wit."</p>
