      <h2>WARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES: One of the boat's crew was seriously injured while fishing off Cape Carnage in North East Arnhem Land, Australia</h2>

      <p>Several <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sharks">sharks</a> have been filmed jumping out of the ocean to snatch huge prey caught by fishermen.</p>
      <p>Footage posted on social media shows a boat crew hunting for 30kg Spanish mackerel off Cape Carnage in North East Arnhem Land.</p>
      <p>The sharks can be seen lunging for their prey in one of Australia's most infested waters.</p>
      <p>Fishermen catch the fish with great difficulty as the mackerel jump in the air along with sharks that try to eat them.</p>
      <p>Crew members were also filmed holding their catch with huge chunks bitten out of the fish.</p>
      <p>One of the boat's crew was seriously injured when a shark smashed into the hull as she was trying to drag a huge mackerel.</p>
      <p>Her glove did not protect her from the steel cable used to pull in the fish, leaving her with a deep cut across her whole hand.</p>

      <p>The clip, which appeared on the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7645563/Jumping-sharks-compete-fishermen-huge-30kg-mackerel-infested-Northern-Territory-waters.html">Daily Mail</a> , is part of a documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGNMEBd8cSY&amp;t=47s">Fishing The Wild</a> .</p>
      <p>The video makers were not filming when thirty-year veteran Juanita got injured, but they witnessed and described the terrifying scene.</p>
      <p>"She suffered a huge amount of crushed bones and damaged internal structures and required being medically airlifted 700km back to Darwin," they said.</p>

      <p>"We were humbled to witness the day-to-day intensity of their lifestyle and to say that these women are tough is the understatement of the century."</p>
      <p>Fishing in these remote, shark-infested waters, can be extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p>In a previous accident, crew member Prue was stung by a box jellyfish and was rushed to hospital.</p>

      <p>Both women are now recovering and will not suffer long-lasting effects from their injuries.</p>
      <p>Troy Peterson commented on YouTube: "I can’t imagine a more epic adventure to go on as a fisherman.</p>
      <p>"I’ve done a lot of things on and in the water that I thought were wild, but after seeing this incredible footage, I’m not in the same league. Great video!"</p>
