        <b>God of War PC is a far-away dream for the game’s director Cory Barlog, but it will probably never come.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the surprising announcement that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/death-stranding-pc-release-date/">Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding would be coming to PC</a>, Barlog expressed his wish for other games to come to the platform.</p>
      <p>With Playstation fans upset that their proposed console exclusive will soon be playable on PC, Barlog took to Twitter to explain his thoughts on the subject.</p>
      <p>“Does Death Stranding’s non-exclusivity matter?” asked the director. “Not in the least!”</p>
      <p>When a fan replied to Barlog to suggest a full PC port of his recent God of War sequel, Barlog seemed enthusiastic about the subject.</p>
      <p>“You know, I would love that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/corybarlog/status/1189014636902830081?s=20">Barlog replied</a>. “It is, sadly, a decision far above my paygrade. As is proven on a daily basis, I am no Kojima.”</p>

      <p>Sony fans were split on Barlog’s response. One triggered fan retorted, “Pretty dangerous opinion coming from a first-party developer. Maybe Sony needs a new developer.” Others were more understanding, realising that the director would want his work to be seen by more people.</p>
      <p>As of now, God of War PC is <i>technically</i> already a solid reality. As long as you have access to a PlayStation 4 controller and a membership to PlayStation Now, many first-party Sony titles are playable through streaming.</p>
