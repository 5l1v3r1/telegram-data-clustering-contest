      <h1>We summarized Lifehacker’s summary of Blinkist’s book summaries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:28:43+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenextweb.com/author/callum-booth/" target="_blank">Callum Booth</a></address>
      <p>Ever wanted to read a book without, you know, actually reading a book? Well, this is the dream that Blinkist sells.</p>
      <p>If you believe its advertising, the company condenses down entire non-fiction books into 15 minute, easily consumable chunks that you can use to expand your brain box.</p>
      <p>If you’re more realistic? It’s a subscription service where you pay for book summaries. Specifically, works they <a href="https://support.blinkist.com/hc/en-us/articles/218524377-What-about-copyrights-Are-you-stealing-from-authors-">probably haven’t given the authors any money for</a>.</p>
      <p>With that idea in mind, Nick Douglas over at Lifehacker decided to save us all some time (and money) by summarizing some of Blinkist’s book summaries. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/we-summarized-blinkists-summaries-of-bestselling-books-1839366288">And he did a great job</a>.</p>
      <p>Thing is, I’m busy. You’re busy. We’re all busy. Sure, Lifehacker‘s summaries were around 2 minutes long, but do you know how many TikToks I can watch in that time? If I’m going to pretend to read a book, I want to do so with as little effort as possible.</p>
      <p>Luckily for you though, dear reader, we’ve got your back. So, say hello to the TNW summary of Lifehacker’s summary of Blinkist’s summaries of three popular books.</p>
      <p>You are very, very welcome.</p>
      <h3>‘The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,’ by Stephen Covey</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Book reading time: 7 hours / Blinkist reading time: 15 min / Lifehacker reading time: 2 min / TNW reading time: 30 seconds</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>There are seven things successful folks do that you should do, too (according to this Stephen Covey fella at least):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Start by doing things</li>
            <li>Then think about and visualize doing those things</li>
            <li>Organize and plan the way you do things</li>
            <li>Be positive about pretty much everything</li>
            <li>Listen to people talk when they about things</li>
            <li>Be nice to people and the belief they have in things</li>
            <li>Look after yourself (AKA read and go on holiday)… or some such similar thing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>‘The Virgin Way,’ by Richard Branson</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Book reading time: 6 hours / Blinkist reading time: 13 min / Lifehacker reading time: 2 min / TNW reading time: 20 seconds</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Richard Branson is a narcissist</li>
        <li>“Blah blah blah airplanes I’m rich”</li>
        <li>Reading the summary of a summary has reinforced the fact that people are only wealthy because they’re: a) lucky b) already rich c) both</li>
        <li>Branson believes he knows how to run the school system better than people whose job it is to manage education</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>‘He’s Just Not That Into You,’ by Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Book reading time: 2 hours / Blinkist reading time: 12 min / Lifehacker reading time: 1 min / TNW reading time: 10 seconds</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Oh my god this isn’t worth summarizing</li>
        <li>Basically ignore this stupid book and its stupid advice and don’t let men define your worth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There you have it, a completely free breakdown of a free breakdown of a breakdown that cost money. This is what we call efficiency.</p>
      <p>Plus, when someone asks you what you did today, you finally have an answer: you’ve read three entire books. Go on, celebrate. You deserve it.</p>
