      <p>When you consider the prospect of learning a new language, chances are your mind flashes back to those old high school classes where you repeated useless phrases like "Where is the library?" or "what color is the car?"</p>
      <p>Thankfully, language learning has come a long way since then. Whether you're at home or on the go, you can get conversant in a new language with <a href="https://store.boingboing.net/sales/mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages?utm_source=boingboing.net&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mondly-lifetime-subscription-all-languages&amp;utm_term=scsf-346631&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004Mrjy&amp;scsonar=1">Mondly</a>, the app that combines cutting-edge tech with an innovative curriculum to get you speaking a new language faster.</p>
