      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T13:49:30+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Sahadeo</a></address>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/shows/the-real-housewives">Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>” star <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-mma-career-drastic-weight-loss">Joe Giudice</a> has joined Instagram and reunited with wife <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/teresa-giudice-says-husband-joe-giudices-deportation-ruling-is-to-make-an-example-out-of-us">Teresa Giudice’s</a> father in the process.</p>
      <p>“Always a full table,” Giudice <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4aCvrHACzz/">wrote on Instagram</a>, sharing a photo of himself eating dinner with family members along with Giacinto Gorga, father of Teresa.</p>
      <p>Giudice joining Instagram comes in the wake of facing potential deportation to his native Italy after serving his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">41-month prison sentence</a>. Giudice served time on charges of bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and failing to file a tax return.</p>

      <p>Upon release from prison, Giudice was placed in<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/teresa-giudice-says-husband-joe-giudices-deportation-ruling-is-to-make-an-example-out-of-us"> the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE</a>, due to his crimes and not being a U.S. citizen. (Immigrants who have a so-called "green card," or legal U.S. residency, as Guidice is said to have, <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/04/01/rhonj-joe-giudice-immigration-appeal-where-stands-nj-bank-settlement/3302129002/">according to The North Jersey Record, </a>nonetheless are subject to removal from the U.S. if they commit crimes and have not become naturalized U.S. citizens.) After six months, the "RHONJ" star husband was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-leaves-united-states-italy-deportation-appeal">granted permission to travel</a> and reside in his native Italy while waiting on the final decision of his deportation appeal.</p>
      <p>The North Jersey Record said that Giudice came to the United States with his parents when he was just 1 year old, and that he obtained a green card, which enabled him to live and work in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Wife Teresa said she once tried to get Joe to apply for U.S. citizenship but never made it a priority over the years.</p>
      <p>“When I married him, I didn’t know," she said. "I remember I tried to make him, I tried to fill out the paperwork. It was never on my radar. It’s not like I married an immigrant and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I have to make him an American citizen.’ Never thought of that at all.”</p>

      <p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-teresa-potential-irs-investigation-rhonj-andy-cohen">potential deportation</a>, Giudice told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/teresa-joe-giudice-watch-what-happens-live-interview">Andy Cohen</a> last week, “My mistake was I never became a citizen. That was stupid of me.”</p>

      <p>“But when you’re raised here as a kid, you do everything here, not [a] big deal. You’re not a criminal. Busted my ass my whole life. Believe me, I was a hard worker and wasn’t one of these guys who sat around doing nothing all day. That wasn’t me,” he continued.</p>
