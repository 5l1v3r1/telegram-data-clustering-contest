      <p>Cape Town – <b>Nolo Seodisha</b> reached the end of his <i>Idols SA</i> journey in the latest episode of the reality show.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old who hails from Soshanguve started the competition with his brother - who didn't make it to the top 17.</p>
      <p>Nolo was a firm favourite from the beginning sailing through round after round. Unfortunately, his luck ran out, making him miss out on a top 3 spot and a trip to New York.</p>
      <p>We chatted to him about his <i>Idols</i> experience and found out what's next for the crooner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You were one of two guys in the top 10. Did you think you would make it this far in the competition?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I entered <i>Idols</i>, my main aim was to make it to the top 10. As soon as I got into the top 10, I was like 'This is actually what I wanted.' As every week passed, and I made it through to eventually four, it was all a miracle for me every week. I enjoyed it so much, and I learned a lot.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you feel as though you lost momentum as the competition continued because you set the bar so high for yourself in the beginning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some weeks the song choices were off, but I gave it my all every week. As for setting the bar too high, you have to have a good start; I think I came in nice, went out lovely. Everything happened as it was supposed to happen. It was a great experience.</p>

        <b>Is there anything you would have changed about your final performances?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, I enjoyed the two songs from last week, <i>Let's Groove</i> and the<i> Lazy Song</i>. For the second performance I got to wear sporty clothes, and chill – and I got good comments from the judges. I appreciated those performances because I think I redeemed myself.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It's been a tough competition with lots of twists and turns. Who do you think stands a good chance at winning?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a tough question! It is the top three, and everyone is just bringing their A-game. I am just as curious as you are to see who is going to win. I really don't know. Everyone is bringing fire. I can't wait for the finale.</p>

        <b>What's next for you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>For now, I am sharpening my craft in terms of recording. The recording side of the music industry is completely different from the performance side. To continue this career, I need to put out some recorded material. I'll be working on that until I perfect it and I feel that it is good enough for the people to consume.</p>
