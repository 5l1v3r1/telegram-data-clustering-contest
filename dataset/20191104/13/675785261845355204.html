      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ksi">KSI</a> has vowed to “destroy” <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/logan-paul">Logan Paul</a> in their boxing rematch.</p>
      <p>The YouTubers are stepping up their preparations for Saturday’s pro bout at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>KSI took time out of his Las Vegas training camp to watch Canelo Alvarez beat Sergey Kovalev at the MGM Grand at the weekend.</p>
      <p>And he warned Paul that “he’s going to drown” in an expletive-filled interview with <i>DAZN</i> at the fight.</p>
      <p>“I am ready to destroy that p***y Logan Paul,” KSI said.</p>
      <p>“He just wants to look pretty in front of all his stupid little fan girls who think he will win this fight.</p>

      <p>“When he gets in the ring with me, he’ll realise that I’m going to destroy him.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing he can do about it.</p>
      <p>“I’m going to bring him into deep water and he’s going to drown in that m*********** – he won’t be ready.”</p>
      <p>KSI also took the opportunity to taunt Paul over his no-show at Canelo vs Kovalev.</p>
      <p>“The guy’s ducking me,” he added. “He was meant to be at this event.</p>

      <p>“For me, it just shows that he doesn’t care about boxing or anything to do with the sport.”</p>
      <p>The pair’s first fight last year ended in a controversial draw.</p>
      <p>Paul dominated the early rounds before tiring, which allowed KSI to storm back late on.</p>
      <p>He has vowed to go “straight in for the kill” in their rematch, however.</p>

      <p>“I am f****** ready for this,” he added.</p>
      <p>“With my last fight, I was scared of getting hit – I will admit that.</p>
      <p>“I felt like a p***y and only stepped it up after rounds four of five.”</p>
