      <blockquote>"No matter what your views on Trump as a president, the guy's a bad motherf*cker, man — the money that he's made, the obstacles that he's conquered. He's a bad motherf*cker in his own way, you know, no matter what your political views are", Masvidal said, apparently in response to a reporter's question.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier on Friday, Masvidal defeated Nate Diaz via a TKO at UFC 244 at Madison Square Garden. President Donald Trump also arrived in New York to watch their fight but <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911031077211491-watch-mixed-reaction-to-donald-trumps-arrival-at-mma-event-in-new-york-city/">received a lot of ''boos''</a> from the audience.</p>
      <p>This is the second time this day that Masvidal has come into the spotlight, as he also promised to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201911031077215855-fcking-midget-victorious-jorge-masvidal-promises-to-fck-up-conor-mcgregor/">"f*ck up" UFC fighter Conor McGregor</a> should they meet in the octagon in the future.</p>
