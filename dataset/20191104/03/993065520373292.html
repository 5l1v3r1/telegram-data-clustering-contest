      <p>Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron has welcomed the prospect of gender-neutral categories at award shows.</p>
      <p>As more and more artists – including British singer Sam Smith – identify as non-binary, many have suggested scrapping gender-specific awards to accommodate them.</p>
      <p>The MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards was the first major ceremony to adopt the format, with Emma Watson winning the overall best actor prize in 2017.</p>

      <p>And following Smith’s announcement, the Brit Awards, the UK’s highest-profile music awards ceremony, said it was reviewing how it distributed prizes.</p>
      <p>Theron, who is raising her adopted child August as a girl, after introducing her to the world as a boy, voiced her support for the abolition of separate male and female categories.</p>
      <p>Asked when we could see them introduced, she told the PA news agency: “Let’s hope soon.”</p>
      <p>Theron was speaking at the 23rd annual Hollywood Film Awards in Beverly Hills, considered by some as the start of awards season.</p>

      <p>The 44-year-old was honoured with the Hollywood career achievement award.</p>
      <p>She is currently starring in drama Bombshell as US journalist and former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.</p>
      <p>Theron’s portrayal of Kelly has won widespread critical acclaim and she has been tipped as among the front-runners for the best actress Oscar, an award she has already won for 2003 crime drama Monster.</p>
      <p>Discussing her latest role, the South African-born actress said: “The most challenging aspect of it, outside wanting to sound and look like her, was to find out how she carried her emotion.</p>
      <p>“There was an emotional story we wanted to tell and there’s not a lot of access to material where she is really emotional or shows her vulnerability.</p>
      <p>“So that was a process of having to decipher what I had and trying to put a puzzle together and really studying her to see how she handled her heart and soul.”</p>
      <p>Also honoured at the Hollywood Film Awards were Antonio Banderas, Renee Zellweger, Al Pacino and Lauran Dern.</p>
      <p>Rocketman star Taron Egerton was named breakout actor while British actress Cynthia Erivo won breakout actress for her role in biopic Harriet.</p>
