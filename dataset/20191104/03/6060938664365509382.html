      <h1>Novak Djokovic ready for 'big task' to grab 'fantastic' year-end No. 1</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T03:52:15+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 03:52</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>PARIS: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Novak-Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> says he is ready for the "big task" of trying to win the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ATP">ATP</a> Tour Finals in London and claim the year-end world number one spot for a record-equalling sixth time.</p>
      <p>The 16-time Grand Slam champion sealed his fifth Paris Masters title on Sunday with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Canadian Denis Shapovalov, but will be usurped by the injured <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rafael-Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> at the top of the rankings on Monday.</p>
      <p>Nadal said he will fight until it is "impossible" to be fit for the start of the season-ending championships on November 10.</p>
      <p>If the Spaniard does not play or fails to win a round-robin match at the Finals, Djokovic must claim two group-stage victories and make the final to pass him.</p>
      <p>Djokovic would also be sure of the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal does not reach the semis.</p>
      <p>"There's always a chance that I win all my matches in London, that I play well. I have done it in the past, and I like playing there," said the 32-year-old, who has won five ATP Finals titles.</p>
      <p>"But it's (an) extremely difficult task considering who my opponents are going to be.</p>
      <p>"You're playing (a) top-10 player every single match. So that's a big task on my end that I have to focus on.</p>
      <p>"And as a consequence, of course, if I manage to get the year-end number one, that would be fantastic."</p>
      <p>Djokovic is bidding to equal <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pete-Sampras">Pete Sampras</a>' record of finishing six years as the world's best player, while Nadal is looking to achieve the feat for the fifth time.</p>
      <p>"It is a motivation and a goal every day," said Djokovic. "It is a goal that I have as a professional <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tennis">tennis</a> player to win as many Grand Slams as possible and also to be number one worldwide for as long as possible."</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Nadal could have ended the race for top spot by winning the Paris title, but he withdrew before his semi-final against Shapovalov with an abdominal muscle strain.</p>
      <p>Djokovic has enjoyed yet another fantastic season, winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon among his five titles.</p>
      <p>That looked a long way off when his comeback from a long-standing elbow injury suffered a setback last year with a shock French Open quarter-final defeat by Italian Marco Cecchinato.</p>
      <p>But he has since added four major titles, having also claimed the 2018 Wimbledon and US Open crowns.</p>
      <p>Djokovic -- who is closing in on Nadal, who has 19, and Federer, with 20, on the all-time list of Grand Slam titles -- says he is hoping to play on for as many years as possible.</p>
      <p>"I would like to play tennis for a long time. I don't know how long that is going to be, but I wish to really play pretty long.</p>
      <p>"So hopefully you'll be seeing me around for many more years."</p>
      <p>Djokovic's victory on Sunday delivered his 34th Masters title and his 77th on the ATP Tour in total.</p>
