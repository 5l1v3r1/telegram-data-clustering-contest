      <h3>DOUBLE: TOPOLOGY and YOUNG RASCAL</h3>
      <p>TOPOLOGY is fancied to get back to winning form by beating nine rivals for the concluding Matchbook Casino Apprentice Handicap (5.00) at Kempton Park.</p>
      <p>A winner over course and distance three starts ago, Joe Tuite’s six-year-old didn’t get the breaks when a close second to Trailboss here 13 days ago and a 2lb nudge up the weights should not prevent another bold show.</p>
