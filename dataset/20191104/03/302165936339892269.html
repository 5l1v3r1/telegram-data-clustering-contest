      <p>JERUSALEM, Nov 4 — Eyes brimming with tears, 92-year-old Melpomeni Dina Gianopoulou was reunited yesterday with Jewish siblings she had helped hide from Nazis in her native Greece during World War II.</p>
      <p>Holocaust survivor Sarah Yanai, 86, had tears in her eyes as she held Melpomeni’s hand.</p>
      <p>“It is a very emotional feeling, I can’t describe it,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We were hidden in her house. She saved all my family. Six persons... you can’t imagine how dangerous it was for her, for her family, to keep us all,” she added.</p>
      <p>“What can I say. They saved our lives.”</p>
      <p>The highly emotional meeting took place at the Hall of Names, in Jerusalem’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre, a memorial to millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust.</p>
      <p>During World War II, Melpomeni and her two sisters first hid the Mordechai family in a mosque before moving them to their own home in Veria, a small town near Thessaloniki, where they stayed for two years.</p>
      <p>Sarah’s brother Yossi Mor was barely two months old at the time.</p>
      <p>He is now 77, but still carries with him stories he was told about their life in hiding.</p>
      <p>Mor said their situation was “deteriorating” in the mosque, especially that of his small brother Shmuel, who had fallen ill.</p>
      <p>But he said the Greek sisters made a daring attempt to rescue him.</p>
      <p>“They put him on their shoulders and they walked to the hospital in the middle of the night. It was quite far,” Mor said.</p>
      <p>Some days later, the Greek sisters went back to the hospital to visit Shmuel but found him covered with a white sheet.</p>
      <p>“He was dead,” said Mor.</p>
      <p>Yossi Dagan, one of Mor’s grandchildren, said he grew up hearing this story over and over again.</p>
      <p>“For me, the three Greek sisters always symbolised heroism, a model of life,” said Dagan, 28.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Sarah and Yossi brought their children and grandchildren to meet their saviour.</p>
      <p>In all, more than 20 people, young and old, stood in front of the white-haired lady before hugging her, one by one.</p>
      <p>“I would like to have saved more,” Melpomeni said in Greek.</p>
      <p>In 1994, Yad Vashem honoured Melpomeni and her sisters by granting them the title of “Righteous Among the Nations” given to those who helped save Jews during World War II.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Yad Vashem has given the award, on behalf of the State of Israel, to more than 27,000 non-Jewish people around the world as a sign of gratitude for taking huge risks to save Jewish lives.</p>
      <p>Between 1939 and 1945, the Nazi regime killed some six million Jews, more than a third of the Jewish population at the time. — AFP</p>
