      <p>The Nationals have been the toast of Washington, D.C., since they captured their first World Series title on Wednesday. Every moment since has a been a celebration, including <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/news/nationals-world-series-champions-parade">Saturday's championship parade</a>, and the Nats stole the show at Sunday night's Washington Capitals game at Capital One Arena with a Zamboni ride that turned into a party.</p>
      <p>The Nats made a celebratory appearance in the home locker room, where the World Series champs sang Queen's "We Are The Champions" with the 2018 Stanley Cup champions, and they were honored on the ice before the Caps' contest against the Calgary Flames. The rowdy Nats contingent -- almost to a man dressed in white Capitals jerseys -- was highly visible in their suite throughout the game.</p>

      <p>But the highlight of the evening came during the second intermission, as six Nats -- Max Scherzer, Patrick Corbin, Adam Eaton, Sean Doolittle, Trea Turner and Yan Gomes -- piled onto one of the rink's Zambonis with the Commissioner's Trophy. As they made their rounds, the crowd rose to its feet and off came the Nats' shirts.</p>

      <p>The crowd went wild and the Caps -- no doubt inspired by their bare-chested brethren's ride to glory -- finished the job with a 4-2 win.</p>
