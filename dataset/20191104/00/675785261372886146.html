      <p>Actress Michelle Keegan has launched her most glamorous collection of party wear pieces yet.</p>
      <p>The TV star and part-time designed took inspiration from her own wardrobe, adding an 80’s twist to bring to life a range that is a riot of clashing colours, sparkly sequins, exaggerated sleeve detailing, head turning dresses and sharp tailoring.</p>
      <p>Starring in a gorgeous photo-shoot the sultry British beauty models her eponymous collection against an opulent backdrop, providing the ultimate festive styling inspiration to get the party started.</p>
      <p>Michelle, 32, said: “This collection is all about being bolder with your style and standing out from the crowd.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to incorporate statement sequin looks alongside more pared back tailored pieces to make sure that there is something for everyone to look sensational this party season!”</p>

      <p>Michelle is pictured wearing show-stopping designs including an emerald green, off the shoulder dress and a glitzy sequin midi dress which are available now at very.co.uk.</p>
      <p>The new collection shouts high octane glamour and elegance.</p>
      <p>Andrew Roscoe, head of brand at Shop Direct, which operates Very, commented: “With the arrival of the festive season there is an array of events that our customers want to look and feel great for.</p>
      <p>"Michelle’s new collection offers our customers the chance to dress for every occasion and celebrate key moments in the lead up to Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Michelle <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/michelle-keegan-slams-dhead-fan-20762672">fired back at a fan</a> in a shock outburst after he accused her of asking "silly questions" to her followers.</p>
      <p>The Our Girl actress, 32, took to  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  recently to ask if any of her fans had any advice on what to do for dogs who are scared of fireworks.</p>

      <p>One responded that most dogs are scared of them so it was pointless to ask anyone for help.</p>
      <p>This appeared to anger Michelle, who called him a "d***head" and said he was talking "b*****ks " in a feisty tweet back.</p>
      <p>She'd originally posted: "Anyone else’s dog terrified of fireworks???</p>
