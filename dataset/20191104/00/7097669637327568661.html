      <h1>Can't Afford that Shiny F-35? Maybe Pakistan's JF-17 Can Do the Job.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point</b>: Stealth is key in modern warfare.</p>
      <p>In the 2019 Paris Air Show, Pakistan its lightweight JF-17 Thunder jet fighter it began building a decade ago in conjunction with China. You can see the seven-ton fighter performing maneuvers in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d5n4TAUwek">this video</a>.</p>
      <p>Just a few months earlier, Pakistan dispatched what it claimed to be twenty-five JF-17s to launch a <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/new-kashmir-conflict-threatens-nuclear-exchange-between-india-and-pakistan-46152">lightning strike across</a> the Line of Control on targets in Kashmir, in retaliation for an Indian air raid on a JeM terrorist training camp.</p>
      <p>The PAF claimed its JF-17s had shot down two Indian fighters pursuing strike planes into Pakistani airspace. However, while the loss of one upgraded Indian MiG-21 Bison was confirmed and its pilot captured, India subsequently displayed fragments of American-made AIM-120 missiles only compatible with Pakistan’s F-16s, casting some doubt on whether the PAF’s Thunders were responsible for the kill.</p>
      <p>Pakistan currently operate around 100 Thunders in five operational squadrons, plus a testing and training unit. The first Thunders entered squadron service in 2010 and saw action bombing insurgents in Waziristan. Islamabad also confirmed in 2018 a $184 million deal to sell three JF-17s to the Nigerian Air Force in 2018 (which currently operates J-7s and Alpha Jets), and has delivered at least six out of an order of eighteen JF-17Ms to Myanmar.</p>
      <p>The PAF now plans to procure fifty more JF-17s of an improved Block III standard by 2024—with airframes produced jointly by Pakistan and China in a 58/42 percent split—as well as procure 26 two-seat JF-17Bs with additional fuel stored in a dorsal fin and enhanced application to training and possibly strike missions. Extant JF-17s may also be upgraded to the Block III variant, which should make its first flight later in 2019.</p>
      <p>
        <b>F-16 Meets MiG-21—in China</b>
      </p>
      <p>Islamabad and Beijing have been close allies since the 1950s, <a href="https://warisboring.com/in-1971-the-u-s-navy-almost-fought-the-soviets-over-bangladesh/">finding in India a common adversary during the Cold War</a>. Pakistan also nurtured warm ties with the United States, but these waned in the twenty-first century due to its intelligence services enduring ties to Islamist terrorist organizations.</p>
      <p>One facet of these tensions is that the Pakistani Air Force has only sporadically been able to purchase additional F-16s to reinforce the dozens it acquired during the 1980s<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/pakistan%E2%80%99s-long-controversial-love-affair-f-16-fighting-falcon-47682"> that saw a surprising amount of action battling Soviet jets</a> over the Pakistan/Afghan border.</p>
      <p>Thus, as early as the 1990s, Pakistan turned to China for an F-16 alternative to replace its aging Chinese-built J-7 and A-6 fighters, themselves Chinese clones of the Soviet MiG-21 and MiG-19.</p>
      <p>During a period of increasing defense cooperation with the United States in the 1980s, China had<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/f-16-dna-30-years-ago-america-started-designing-fighter-jet-upgrades-china-49802"> actually pursued a joint venture with Grumman to build an upgraded J-7 fighter</a> called the Super-7 or Sabre II, using avionics from the F-16. This and other project fell through after the Tiananmen Square massacre in June 1989 permanently chilled U.S.-China defense cooperation.</p>
      <p>But the Chengdu Aircraft Corporation kept on working on the Super-7 project, and in the 1990s offered to jointly develop an affordable F-16 substitute based upon the Super-7 called the JF-17 Thunder with the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. PAC had formerly principally been involved in re-building old J-7s and Mirages.</p>
      <p>The Thunder, which first flew in 2003, is a no-nonsense evolution of the MiG-21. Instead of the MiG-21’s R-25 turbojet with a nose intake, the Thunder uses an RD-93 turbofan (a variant of the RD-33 on the<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russias-mig-29-fulcrum-super-fighter-or-super-failure-17054"> MiG-29 Fulcrum</a>) with lower fuselage intakes. The JF-17’s maximum speed of Mach 1.6 to 1.8 leaves it marginally slower than its Soviet forebearer, but the Thunder remains highly maneuverable, has a superior range of around 750 miles, and its KLJ-7 doppler radar is far more powerful.</p>
      <p>Of course, in contrast to the F-16, the JF-17 is designed to employ Chinese weapons on its seven hardpoints, including the PL-5 short-range air-to-air missile, LS-6 ‘Thunderstone’ GPS-guided glide bombs, and YJ-12 supersonic and YJ-83 subsonic anti-shipping missiles. (The PAF’s No.2 squadron maintains one squadron in the maritime strike role.) The PAF JF-17s are still awaiting Chinese PL-12 radar-guided missiles with a range of around fifty miles to obtain true beyond-visual range capability.</p>
      <p>Though not directly integrated, the JF-17 can also carry electro-optical/infrared sensors and self-defense jammers on external pods.</p>
      <p>While early JF-17 models priced out to a cheap $15-28 million—cutting edge jets fourth and fifth-generation jets tend to cost $70-110 million)—the Thunders lacked certain basic capabilities. For example, aerial-refueling capability was not introduced until the Block II model.</p>
      <p>The new Block III, which will supposedly cost around $32 million each, now introduces a helmet-mounted display system which should allow more flexible targeting of short-range missiles in close dogfights. The jet intakes are widened to improve airflow, and the Russian RD-93 engine may eventually be replaced by a Chinese manufactured WS-13 turbofan. Additional thrust, combined with lightweight composite materials could potentially boost the type’s speed and range.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most important upgrade is an upgrade of the radar to an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. These have higher resolution, are more discrete and are more jam-resistant than preceding classes of radar. PAC is evaluating a KLJ-7A radar with a wider-angle search field and a detection range of 124 miles for fighter-sized target, and an air-cooled LKF-601E AESA radar.</p>
      <p>The Block III Thunder may also feature an internal infrared sensor and modernized flight control systems and a single-panel multi-functional display for the pilot.</p>
      <p>While the Thunder is not particularly sexy compared to cutting-edge stealth fighters and even 4.5-generation jets like the<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/just-how-stealthy-are-frances-rafales-f42s-66727"> Rafale</a> and<a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/dogfighter-why-russias-su-35-fighter-wont-be-easy-target-anyone-59742"> Su-35</a>, its seems capable for its price, particularly once it integrates AESA radar and the PL-10 missile. It seems likely to show up in the new again if there any future showdowns between Pakistani and Indian aviation.</p>
