      <p>MDC president <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/Nelson_Chamisa"><b>Nelson Chamisa</b></a> will this week present a Hope of The Nation Address to deliver hope for a nation experiencing a myriad of crises last experienced in 2008.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a video he recorded and uploaded on Facebook, Chamisa said that the Address will deal with a number of issues. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>We are going to be delivering the Hope of The Nation Address. It’s going to deal with a lot of issues; our perspectives, economically, politically and socially, our thoughts and the way forward in our view and what has to be done for this country.</blockquote>
      <p>Zimbabwe is currently experiencing severe food shortages, with millions in need of aid. Major hospitals are functioning below par as doctors fail to go to work due to meagre salaries.</p>
      <p>Moreover, inflation is estimated to be over 500 per cent, major cities do not have adequate running water and there is rampant corruption and looting of state resources.</p>
