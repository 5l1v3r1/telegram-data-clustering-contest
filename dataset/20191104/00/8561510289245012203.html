      <h1>Here’s How to Check Your Totalitarian “Social Credit Score”</h1>

      <h3>Permanent Record</h3>
      <p>In China, a formalized social credit score can determine whether you’re allowed to take out loans or even <a href="https://futurism.com/china-social-credit-system-barred-traveling-2018">use public transit</a>. The system is often held up as a particularly dystopian application of big data analytics — and now it seems as though a <a href="https://futurism.com/america-social-credit-system-china">similar thing is happening</a> in the U.S.</p>
      <p>It turns out that a number of companies are aggregating mind-boggling piles of financial records, internet activity, and other personal data, <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html">The New York Times </a></i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/business/secret-consumer-score-access.html">reports</a> — and using it to determine petty metrics like how long companies will make people wait on hold or whether we’re allowed to make returns at a store.</p>
      <h3>Behind The Curtain</h3>
      <p>Some of these companies give people the opportunity to take a look at whatever records they have on them, like Sift, which had accumulated over 400 pages of notes on the <i>NYT</i>‘s Kashmir Hill, ranging from Airbnb reviews to delivery orders.</p>
      <p>Technically anyone can request their records by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@sift.com">privacy@sift.com</a> then filling out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGTJHX9edmQOD8Ez-1NgJP7cbikwLKyAgXl5TYDNAK4mZT9g/viewform">form</a> online. But the <i>NYT </i>noted that some companies, like consumer-tracking database Kustomer, refused to share data while repeatedly saying it would soon.</p>
      <h3>Secret Scores</h3>
      <p>These little-known companies aren’t new, but they’re only just getting attention for their unsettling data projects, which can have a major behind-the-scenes impact on people’s lives.</p>
      <p>Even now, companies like Sift might share the piles of records they’ve accumulated on you — but won’t tell you how other companies are using it.</p>
