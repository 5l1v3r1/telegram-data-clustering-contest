      <h1>Poll: 18 Percent of Americans Have a Positive View of Mitt Romney</h1>
      <h2>Only 18 percent of Americans have a positive image of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), according to a poll released Sunday.</h2>

      <p>An NBC News/<i>Wall Street Journal </i>poll <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6538104-19433-NBCWSJ-Late-October-Poll.html">released</a> Sunday found that only 18 percent of Americans adults have a favorable view of Sen. Romney.</p>
      <p>The survey found that only two percent of Americans had a “very positive” view of Utah’s junior senator, 16 percent had a somewhat positive view, 37 percent were neutral, 19 percent had a somewhat negative view, 19 percent had a very negative view, and seven percent did not or were unsure about Sen. Romney.</p>
      <p>The latest poll is a far cry from October 2012, when NBC News/<i>Wall Street Journal</i> found that 47 percent, or nearly a majority of Americans, had a positive image of Romney right before the 2012 presidential election.</p>
      <p>Romney has served as one of the loudest Donald Trump critics in the U.S. Senate.</p>
      <p>The Utah senator has criticized and opposed President Trump’s national emergency on the border, which allows the president to build a wall.</p>
      <p>Romney also <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/17/mitt-romney-abandoning-kurds-will-stand-as-bloodstain-in-u-s-history/">said</a> that President Trump’s withdrawal of troops from northern Syria amounts to an abandonment of the Kurds. He said that “will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.”</p>
      <p>Sen. Romney was also one of three Republican senators to not <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/10/27/club-growth-president-utah-republicans-disgusted-mitt-romney-impeachment/">sign</a> Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) resolution to condemn the House Democrats’ secrecy on their impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Club for Growth President David McIntosh <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/10/27/club-growth-president-utah-republicans-disgusted-mitt-romney-impeachment/">told</a> <i>Breitbart News Saturday</i> that many Republicans “such as Mitt Romney, were going to use this as a political opportunity to take a whack at the president. In this case, I think he’s jealous that he’s not president.”</p>
      <p>McIntosh said that many Utahns have become “disgusted” with Sen. Romney.</p>
      <p>The NBC News/<i>Wall Street Journal </i>survey was conducted from October 27 to 30 by contacting 900 American adults and has a margin of error 3.27 percentage points.</p>
