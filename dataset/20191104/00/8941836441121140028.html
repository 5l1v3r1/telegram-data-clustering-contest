      <p>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cvs/">CVS</a> is apologizing after employees at an Indiana pharmacy refused to accept a Purdue University student’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/puerto-rico/">Puerto Rico</a> driver’s license as valid identification and questioned his immigration status.</p>

He says they demanded to see a visa. He says a cashier and shift supervisor cited corporate policy that requires customers to show valid ID issued by the U.S., Canada or Mexico.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/puerto-rico/">Puerto Rico</a> is a U.S. territory, and Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.</p>
