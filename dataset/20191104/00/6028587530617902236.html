      <p>Rapid advances in AI and machine learning are defining cybersecurity’s future daily. Identities are the new security perimeter and <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/what-ztx-means-for-vendors-and-users/">Zero Trust Security frameworks</a> are capitalizing on AI’s insights to thwart breaches in milliseconds. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/09/25/10-ways-ai-and-machine-learning-are-improving-endpoint-security/#49e1d8362db0">Advances in AI and machine learning are also driving the transformation of endpoint security</a> toward greater accuracy and contextually intelligence. 69% of enterprise executives believe artificial intelligence (AI) will be necessary to respond to cyberattacks with the majority of telecom companies (80%) saying they are counting on AI to help identify threats and thwart attacks according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/07/14/why-ai-is-the-future-of-cybersecurity/#2db7fee4117e">Capgemini</a>. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3895674">Gartner</a> predicts $137.4B will be spent on Information Security and Risk Management in 2019, increasing to $175.5B in 2023, reaching a CAGR of 9.1%. Cloud Security, Data Security, and Infrastructure Protection are the fastest-growing areas of security spending through 2023. The following ten charts illustrate the market and technological factors driving the rapid growth of AI in security today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>AI shows the greatest potential for fraud detection, malware detection, assigning risk scores to login attempts on networks, and intrusion detection.</b> Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are proving to be effective in identifying potentially fraudulent online transaction activity. By definition, supervised machine learning algorithms rely on historical data to find patterns not discernible with traditional rule-based approaches to fraud detection. Finding anomalies, interrelationships, and valid links between emerging factors and variables is unsupervised machine learning’s core strength. Combining each is proving to be very effective in identifying anomalous behavior and reducing or restricting access.<a href="https://www.kount.com/"> Kount’s </a> <a href="https://www.kount.com/announcements/kount-launches-next-generation-ai">Omniscore</a> relies on these technologies to provide an AI-driven transaction safety rating.

        <li><b>80% of telecommunications executives stated that they believe their organization would not be able to respond to cyberattacks without AI.</b> Across all seven industries studied in a recent Capgemini survey, 69% of all senior executives say they would not be able to respond to a cyberattack without AI. 75% of banking executives realize they’ll need AI to thwart a cyberattack. Interestingly, 59% of Utilities executives, the lowest response to this question on the survey, see AI as essential for battling a cyberattack. Utilities are one of the more vulnerable industries to attacks given their legacy infrastructure.

        <li><b>51% of enterprises primarily rely on AI for threat detection, leading prediction, and response.</b> Consistent with the majority of cybersecurity surveys of enterprises’ AI adoption for cybersecurity in 2019, AI is relied the majority of the time for detecting threats. A small percentage of enterprises have progressed past detection to prediction and response, as the graphic below shows. Many of the more interesting AI projects today are in prediction and response, given how the challenges in these areas expand the boundaries of technologies fast. Source: <a href="https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AI-in-Cybersecurity_Report_20190711_V06.pdf">Capgemini Research Institute, Reinventing Cybersecurity with Artificial Intelligence - The new frontier in digital security</a> (28 pp., PDF, no opt-in).</li>

        <li><b>Enterprises are relying on AI as the foundation of their security automation frameworks.</b> AI-driven security automation frameworks are designed to flex and support new digital business models across an organization. Existing security automation frameworks can crunch and correlate threat patterns on massive volumes of disparate data, which introduces opportunities for advanced cybersecurity without disrupting business. Using alerts and prescriptive analytics for dynamic policies to address identified risks, enterprises can speed deployment of threat-blocking measures, increasing the agility of security operations.
