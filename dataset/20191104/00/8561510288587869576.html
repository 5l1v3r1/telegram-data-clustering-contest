      <h1>Human Traffickers Are Literally Selling Slaves on Instagram</h1>
      <h2>They tried to sell a 16-year-old girl on Instagram. "This is the quintessential example of modern slavery," said a UN representative.</h2>

      <p>Silicon Valley is helping the global slave trade thrive — and critics argue it should be held accountable for facilitating the barbarous practice.</p>
      <p>Posing as a husband and wife, a team from <i>BBC News Arabic</i> found it was disturbingly easy to discover human traffickers selling slaves online on Instagram and other popular apps.</p>
      <p>“In the Gulf, women employed as domestic workers are being sold online via apps approved and provided by Google and Apple,” the investigators say in a <a href="https://youtu.be/Qxz-vmbFXd4">video</a> they released on Thursday. “It’s been called an online slave market.”</p>
      <p>The investigators contacted and met with several of the people advertising domestic workers for sale online, including one in Kuwait who offered to sell them “Fatou” — a 16-year-old girl from Guinea, West Africa — for US$3,800.</p>
      <p>“This is the quintessential example of modern slavery,” Urmila Bhoola, UN Special Rapporteur, Contemporary Forms of Slavery, told <i>BBC News Arabic</i>. “Here we see a child being sold and traded like chattel, like a piece of property.”</p>

      <p>In the wake of the <i>BBC News Arabic</i> investigation, authorities in Kuwait have reportedly “summoned” several of the people behind the social media accounts selling slaves, according to a follow-up <i>BBC News</i> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50266663">story</a> published Friday.</p>
      <p>The authorities told <i>BBC News</i> they also forced the account holders to take down their ads and sign a legal agreement promising to no longer “participate in this activity.”</p>
      <p>However, the update makes no mention of any sort of punishment or legal ramifications for the sales, despite Nasser al-Mousawi, Head of Kuwait’s Domestic Workers Office, telling the <i>BBC News Arabic</i> team during its investigation that “anyone who deals in this type of business will be punished.”</p>
      <p>Instagram, meanwhile, told <i>BBC News</i> it “had removed further content across Facebook and Instagram, and would prevent the creation of new accounts designed to be used for the online slave market.”</p>
      <p>But Bhoola says that’s not enough.</p>
      <p>“Google, Apple, Facebook, or any other companies [that] are hosting apps like these, they have to be held accountable,” she told <i>BBC News Arabic</i>. “What they are doing is promoting an online slave market.”</p>
      <p>American international lawyer Kimberley Motley has taken on the legal case of Fatou — whom authorities located following the investigation and deported home to Guinea where a local family adopted her— and she thinks the big tech companies that facilitated the slave trade should provide monetary compensation for her client.</p>
      <p>“On [the] Apple Store, they proclaim that they are responsible for everything that’s put on their store,” Motley told <i>BBC News</i>. “And so our question is, what does that responsibility mean?”</p>
      <p>Perhaps an even more important question: can Silicon Valley stop their products from being used for human trafficking in the first place?</p>
