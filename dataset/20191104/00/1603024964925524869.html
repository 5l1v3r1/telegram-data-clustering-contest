      <p>While, 28 seats have been reserved for Scheduled Tribes (STs), nine have been reserved for Scheduled Castes (SCs)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Voters and polling</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to data released by EC, Jharkhand has a total of 2.26 crore eligible voters. Out of these, 41,336 are service voters.</p>
      <p>The number of polling stations that will be used by voters across the state is 29,464. This number is 19 percent higher than in 2014.</p>
      <p>To encourage greater constructive participation of women in the electoral process, EC has directed that at least one polling station will be managed exclusively by women in every Assembly constituency. In such stations, all election staff, including security personnel, will be women.</p>
      <p>EC has confirmed that Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs) will be used in this election.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lowdown on the political situation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chief Minister Raghubar Das-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is hoping to retain power in the state. BJP is widely expected to contest the election in an alliance with the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU).</p>
      <p>The BJP-AJSU alliance is being challenged by Opposition parties such as former chief ministers Shibu Soren and Hemant Soren’s Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the Indian National Congress and the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik) (JVM-P). The three parties had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election in an alliance and are expected to fight in this formation again, with the possibility of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) joining hands.</p>
      <p>BJP’s ally in Bihar, the Janata Dal (United), has said that it will contest all 81 seats alone.</p>
      <p>No alliance has declared their seat-sharing formula so far.</p>
      <p>After witnessing below-expectation Assembly election results in Haryana and Maharashtra in October, the BJP is recalibrating its strategy. Many factors that came into play in Haryana and Maharashtra could may play a key role in Jharkhand too.</p>
