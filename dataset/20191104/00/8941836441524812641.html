      <p>ZURICH (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> has warned Cardiff it is facing a transfer ban of three windows if the club fails to send 6 million euros ($6.7 million) to Nantes as the first payment for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emiliano-sala/">Emiliano Sala</a>.</p>
      <p>The threat facing Cardiff was detailed Monday in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a>’s published verdict in a dispute over the Argentine forward who died in a plane crash in January before playing for his new team.</p>
      <p>After getting the written verdict in recent days, Cardiff can appeal against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a>’s ruling at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fifa/">FIFA</a> says an appeal will stop the clock on Cardiff’s 45-day deadline to pay until a binding verdict by CAS. That could take about one year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/emiliano-sala/">Sala</a> was killed when a single-engine aircraft carrying him from Nantes to Cardiff to complete his move crashed near the Channel Island of Guernsey late on Jan. 21.</p>
