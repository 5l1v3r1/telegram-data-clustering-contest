      <h2>SAM QUEK COLUMN: England suffered heartbreak as they were beaten by South Africa in the rugby World Cup final</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:41:08+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 00:41</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Quek</a></address>
      <p>Losing the World Cup final is really going to hurt for the England rugby team – a hurt that will last a long time.</p>
      <p>England were tactically outclassed on Saturday when the Springboks manipulated the game into a physical battle they would always dominate.</p>
      <p>England were bullied in the scrum and failed to break through the ‘Green Wall’ in open play.</p>
      <p>They persisted with their plan, hoping it would lead to a different outcome. It didn’t.</p>
      <p>Straight after the game it looked as though the England lads had taken defeat in their stride.</p>

      <p>Captain Owen Farrell corralled his troops and had them circle for a post-match speech.</p>
      <p>I imagine it was similar to the ones I heard, nothing very insightful or tactically analytical, instead usually something generic with a nod to the future.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t good enough today, but remember this feeling, because we will be back,” or something like that.</p>
      <p>Some of the team seemed to take solace from this.</p>
      <p>But a bit later the speaker system in the Yokohama International Stadium began to pump out the hymn ‘I Vow To Thee, My Country’ on repeat – almost as if the PA announcer had it ready for an England victory.</p>

      <p>As the line for the runners-up medals began to form, the masks of determination and emotional stability began to slip and it started to dawn on them what defeat meant.</p>
      <p>In sport, our entire careers are often broken down to a single TV strapline like ‘Sam Quek – Olympic gold medallist’.</p>
      <p>But that doesn’t tell you about the blood, sweat and tears expended during a gruelling 12-year career.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t tell you about the other tournaments.</p>

      <p>You are defined by your results on the biggest stage you perform on – regardless of whether that summary is fair.</p>
      <p>These England players will now be called ‘World Cup finalist’ or ‘World Cup runner-up’ and every time they will be reminded of what could have been.</p>
      <p>The only way to eradicate that tag is to win their next tournament.</p>
      <p>That is my experience, because no amount of tea and sympathy ever soothed my soul.</p>
