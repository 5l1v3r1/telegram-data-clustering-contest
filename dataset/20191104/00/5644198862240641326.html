      <p>TAIPEI: America's Nelly Korda claimed back-to-back victory in the LPGA Taiwan Championship in a playoff against two players on Sunday (Nov 3) to clinch her second win this year.</p>
      <p>Korda, 21, successfully defended her title in the playoff against Australia's Minjee Lee and Germany's Caroline Masson after they all finished with an aggregate score of 18-under-par 270.</p>

      <p>Korda had a three-shot lead over Lee, who was also runner-up to her last year, after the third round but struggled in the final day hitting five birdies and five bogeys to go into the playoff.</p>
      <p>It was "very dramatic, a little bit harder than I wanted it to be but I am happy I got it done... I was very nervous actually because it was my first playoff," she said.</p>
      <p>Korda claimed her maiden LPGA Tour victory at this event last year to join her elder sister Jessica as a winner on the circuit, extending a family sporting resume which also boasts a Grand Slam tennis title via father Petr.</p>
      <p>Currently ranked eighth in the world, Korda won the LPGA Australian Open in February for her first victory in 2019.</p>
