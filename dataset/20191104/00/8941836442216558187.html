      <p>HONG KONG (AP) - Chinese President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi Jinping</a>’s surprise meeting with Hong Kong leader <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Carrie Lam</a> was a “vote of confidence” in her government’s ability to tackle five months of anti-government protests that have rocked the semi-autonomous Chinese territory, a senior official said Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> met <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Lam</a> on the sidelines of a trade event in Shanghai on Monday night amid signals from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s central government that it may tighten its grip on Hong Kong to quell the unrest that had at times challenged Chinese rule.</p>
      <p>When asked if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> had voiced concern about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Lam</a>’s handling of the unrest, Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said: “The reverse is true.</p>
      <p>“The very fact that he is so busy that he found time to meet (<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Lam</a>) really is a vote of confidence in ourselves” and underlined the importance that Beijing attaches to Hong Kong, Cheung said at a news conference.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> “has a high degree of confidence in the chief executive and also certainly the work of the present government and the political team, so all these are pretty reassuring to us,” he added.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>’s official Xinhua News Agency reported that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> expressed his government’s “high degree of trust” in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Lam</a> to stabilize the situation after she briefed him on the crisis.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> also “demanded unswerving efforts to stop and punish violent activities in accordance with the law” as restoring order was a top priority for Hong Kong, Xinhua said. He also called for more dialogue and efforts to improve people’s livelihoods in one of the world’s most expensive cities.</p>
      <p>The protests began in June against an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent for trials in mainland <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a>, which many saw as infringing on Hong Kong’s judicial freedoms and other rights that were guaranteed when the former British colony return to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> in 1997.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carrie-lam/">Lam</a> abandoned the bill three months into the protests, but the movement by then had grown into calls for greater democracy and police accountability and had become the biggest challenge to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/xi-jinping/">Xi</a> since he came to power in 2012.</p>

        <p>The protests in recent weeks have been marked by violence as hardcore anti-government demonstrators set fires and trashed facilities in clashes with police who used tear gas, and as brawls occurred between the demonstrators and pro-Chinese activists.</p>
        <p>More than 3,000 people have been arrested since June and in one incident of violence Sunday, a knife-wielding man believed to be a Chinese supporter slashed two people after an argument and bit off part of a politician’s ear outside a mall. Police said they arrested the assailant as well as two men who attacked him.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, a mob battered a Beijing supporter unconscious and stripped him naked in a scene captured by local media.</p>
