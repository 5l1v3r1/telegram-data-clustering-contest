      <p>Davinia Taylor has compared her battle with alcohol to “being taken over by a parasite”.</p>
      <p>The former Hollyoaks star has celebrated a decade of being sober, having battled both alcoholism and depression, but said she now does not even enjoy talking to drunk people.</p>
      <p>She told Hello! magazine: “I was in complete denial.</p>
      <p>“I thought if everyone just left me alone and I could have a drink, I would be fine.</p>

      <p>“There wasn’t an ‘Aha’ moment. It was much tougher than that.</p>
      <p>“The first 10 months were harder than the past 10 years. Every single cell in my body was telling me to take a drink.</p>
      <p>“It was like being taken over by a parasite and the only thing you can do about it was to go cold turkey.”</p>
      <p>Taylor, who is now a mother of four and has been in a relationship with builder Matthew Leyden for eight years, used to be a frequent tabloid fixture as part of the so-called “Primrose Hill set” in the early 2000s, which included Kate Moss, Sadie Frost, Jude Law, Jonny Lee Miller and Meg Matthews.</p>
      <p>She said: “Most of that group were ‘going-out’ friendships.</p>
      <p>“We have all moved on – although I am still very good friends with Meg and Sadie.</p>
      <p>“I don’t particularly like going out much any more. I don’t enjoy having conversations with drunk people – I don’t find it funny or interesting, so I tend to turn up, do what I have to do and then go home.”</p>
      <p>Taylor said she is now committed to a daily diet of organic food and gym sessions and attributes her toned physique to “biohacking”.</p>
      <p>She said: “It means using your personal biology to hack into your best self so you can optimise how you sleep, how you think and how you perform physically and mentally.</p>
      <p>“It has been a brilliant journey for me in understanding my past, how I became alcoholic and how I can avoid getting back into that cycle.”</p>
