      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The start to the game was unusual. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s final stat line was not.</p>
      <p>After waiting out a long delay, Antetokounmpo had 34 points and 15 rebounds as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Milwaukee Bucks</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> 134-106 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo, the reigning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nba/">NBA</a> MVP, has posted a double-double in all seven games this season.</p>
      <p>“Once you go out there, you have a mindset that you’re going to play a game, you’re going to go hard,” Antetokounmpo said. “Once you cannot go hard, you’ve got to almost switch mindsets.”</p>
      <p>The game was delayed 50 minutes so one of the baskets could be fixed before tipoff. During pregame warmups, the rim the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> were shooting on was discovered to be crooked.</p>

      <p>“I was making shots,” Antetokounmpo joked. “So I was happy. Once they said the rim is crooked, I was like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s why I was making a lot of shots.’ Yeah, it was disturbing, because everybody was ready to go. We had to wait, like, probably, what was it, an hour?”</p>
      <p>If the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> were thrown off by the delay, it didn’t show. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> shot 53.8 percent from the field.</p>
      <p>Khris Middleton added 26 points to match his season high, and Eric Bledsoe set a season best with 22. Bledsoe also had nine rebounds and six assists.</p>
      <p>“There’s just no excuses,” Middleton said. “We just had to stay professional and be as ready as we could.”</p>

        <p>Andrew Wiggins led the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a> with 25 points. Minnesota played without center Karl-Anthony Towns, who served the second game of his two-game suspension for his part in an altercation with Philadelphia big man Joel Embiid last week. Robert Covington added 15 points.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> outscored the Towns-less <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a> 62-38 in the paint.</p>
        <p>“They’re a good team,” Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders said. “You know, the credit goes to them. They overwhelmed us a little bit in the third quarter.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> broke open the game with a 38-point third that included a 22-6 run.</p>
        <p>Antetokounmpo scored 11 points and grabbed five rebounds in the period.</p>
        <p>“We didn’t make shots. We got stagnant,” Covington said. “We didn’t come out with the urgency that we know we needed to. Just too much playing catch-up.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> were up seven at halftime thanks in part to coach Mike Budenholzer winning a coach’s challenge with 0.2 seconds left in the second quarter. That overturned an offensive foul on Antetokounmpo and resulted in a layup for him.</p>
        <p>Donte DiVincenzo scored a season-best 17 off the bench for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>.</p>
        <p>“A little bit of a strange night between the beginning and different things during the game,” Budenholzer said. “I thought the guys had a great focus. I thought the third quarter was really good.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> guards Wesley Matthews and Pat Connaughton returned to action. Connaughton (right shoulder strain) sat out Saturday’s win over Toronto, while Matthews injured his ankle Saturday and played only nine minutes.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a> center Gorgui Dieng made his second consecutive start in place of the suspended Towns. Backup point guard Shabazz Napier left in the fourth quarter with a strained right hamstring. He is day-to-day.</p>
        <p>KILLING TIME</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> spent the delay in the locker room, telling stories about odd events they’d experienced in their careers or watched on TV.</p>
        <p>“The first thing that came to mind for me was back when prime Shaq was breaking backboards every other game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> center Brook Lopez said.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a>: At the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday, the second stop on a four-game road trip. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> is in the middle of playing nine of 11 away from home.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-timberwolves/">Timberwolves</a>: At the Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday. The Grizzlies have won 27 of 37 meetings in the last decade.</p>
