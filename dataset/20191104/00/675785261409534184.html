      <p>Andy Murray and wife Kim are celebrating the birth of their third child - and have revealed to close friends that it's a boy.</p>
      <p>The tennis ace and his long-term partner are already parents to girls Sophia, three and Edie, two.</p>
      <p>And last week they added a boy to their growing brood, although they have only just broken the gender news to their friends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10272213/andy-murray-kim-son-birth/">The Sun</a> has claimed that the baby - whose name is yet to be decided - is understood to have been born at a hospital in London.</p>

      <p>Andy’s grandfather Roy Erskine, 88, told the publication: “It’s a wee boy.</p>
      <p>“He was born during the week, I don’t know what his name is yet. My wife is away down, she went down this morning.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Murray recently joked after winning the European Open that he needed to get back to touring as his family is getting 'out of control'.</p>
      <p>"I’ve got two young kids and a third one coming. I’ll have three kids under four years old," he said.</p>

      <p>“When I’ve been off the tour the last few years my family has got bigger.</p>
      <p>“I need to get on the road so we’re done before it gets out of control!</p>
      <p>“I’m excited for the third kid. My wife has been a huge support in getting me back on the court.</p>
      <p>"She’s helped me fight to keep playing.”</p>
