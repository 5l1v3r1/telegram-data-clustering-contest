      <p>The Penn Quakers defeated the Brown Bears 38-36 in a roller coaster of a football game on Saturday afternoon at Franklin Field, which ended with a game-winning field goal from sophomore kicker Daniel Karrash.</p>
      <p>With the result, Penn picked up their first win of the season in Ivy League play.</p>
      <p>Despite having never attempted a field goal with the Quakers, Karrash had his number called with five seconds left in the game from 22 yards out.</p>
      <p>“I was just trying to stay composed and keep faith in my guy’s upfront,” Karrash said. “I was just trying to hit a good ball through the uprights. I didn’t try and switch anything depending on what type of kick it is.”</p>

      <p>Before Karrash’s heroic first field goal, Penn and Brown played a back and forth contest. Brown junior quarterback EJ Perry was explosive as usual with 117 yards on 24 carries.</p>
      <p>He also threw for 225 yards and a touchdown but was sacked eight times.</p>
      <p>“EJ is an extraordinarily tough player who’s hard to tackle, and he’s a terrific passer, so he helps us a lot,” Brown head coach James Perry said.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of EJ. He’s a great practicer, just a great kid. It is truly fun for me to see him get better each week. I have no doubt, he’ll take preparation very seriously against Yale.”</p>
      <p>At halftime, Brown trailed Penn 21-19, but the start of the third quarter began the Brian O’Neill show.</p>
      <p>The Quakers’ junior linebacker recorded a sack on the first play of the third quarter, before intercepting a Perry pass on third down.</p>
      <p>“One of their top pass plays is a mesh concept where the two wide receivers cross the middle of the field. I was reading the quarterback’s eyes, and as soon as he extended his arm to throw, I just broke on the ball,” O’Neill said.</p>
      <p>The Quakers went on to score on their first offensive play of the quarter with a Nick Robinson touchdown strike to sophomore wide receiver Rory Starkey.</p>
      <p>However, on Brown’s next offensive possession, senior linebacker Hunter Hayes forced a fumble, which O’Neill picked up and ran to the end zone.</p>
      <p>O’Neill finished the night with another interception on the last play of the game. His final stat line was six tackles, two sacks, two TFLs, two interceptions, a fumble recovery, and a defensive touchdown.</p>

      <p>“We always talk about momentum,” O’Neill said after the game. “Big plays, big turnovers like that really change the momentum of the game.”</p>
      <p>Aforementioned, the Quakers’ defensive front also had an incredible performance, recording eight sacks on the elusive Perry.</p>

      <p>Senior defensive tackle Prince Emili led the game with 9.5 tackles, three tackles for loss, and a sack.</p>
      <p>Along with Emili, Junior defensive lineman Benji Mowatt added two sacks and a forced fumble. While Jake Heimlicher, Zach Evans, Jason McCleod, and Hayes all recorded half a sack each.</p>
      <p>“All those guys really get after it. We ran a bunch of stunts up-front to really get in the quarterback and offensive coordinator’s head, and it paid dividends,” O’Neill explained.</p>
      <p>“This whole week, we’ve emphasized the quarterback spy and a couple of different things to keep him contained in the pocket, and with eight sacks you’ve got to keep doing it,” he said.</p>
      <p>On the offensive side of the ball, the Quakers were without superstar running back Karekin Brooks, who was dressed but did not see any action.</p>
      <p>This season, Brooks has 761 yards and eight touchdowns. In his place, senior wide receiver Abe Willows carried a majority of the rushing load with 16 carries for 63 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>“Early in the season, Abe had an injury coming out of camp that really never resolved itself. He’s always been a talented young man so it was great to have him step in and run the ball very successfully.” Priore said.</p>
      <p>“He (Brooks) had a couple of injuries coming out of the game last week, and he tried to go this weekend,” Priore explained. “We didn’t think in the long-term it would be a good decision to put him out there. I’m hoping this week he’ll be back to full force.”</p>
      <p>Next Saturday, hundreds of alumni will pack into Franklin Field to see if the Quakers can continue their winning ways over Cornell during Homecoming weekend.</p>
