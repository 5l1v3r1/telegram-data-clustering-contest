      <p>Forty-one migrants were found alive in a refrigerated truck in northern Greece on November 4, said police, who arrested the driver.</p>
      <p>The migrants, of apparent Afghan origin, were mostly in good condition. Seven of them were given first aid in hospital, the police said.</p>
      <p>"The truck contained men and boys. Identifying their nationality will require a couple of days," a police source told AFP.</p>

      <p>The truck was immobilised by police on the Egnatia motorway between the towns of Xanthi and Komotini.</p>
      <p>The driver, a man from Georgia, was arrested.</p>
      <p>The discovery came after 39 people, all believed to be Vietnamese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain last month, highlighting the risks of illegal migrant routes to Europe, even for those avoiding perilous travel by sea.</p>
      <p>Another 31 Pakistani migrants were found on Saturday hidden in a lorry on a motorway near the French-Italian border.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
