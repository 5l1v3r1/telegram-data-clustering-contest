      <h1>Here’s What Would Happen if Earth Collided With a Black Hole</h1>

      <h3>Worlds Collide</h3>
      <p>A new online tool calculates just how much cosmic destruction a run-in between the Earth and a black hole would cause.</p>
      <p>The aptly-named <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/black-hole">Black Hole Collision Calculator</a> determines how much a black hole would expand and the amount of energy it would release if it absorbed the Earth — or <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/three-supermassive-black-holes-collide">any other object</a>, since the calculator is totally customizable, <i><a href="https://www.space.com/black-hole-collision-calculator-tool.html">Space.com </a></i><a href="https://www.space.com/black-hole-collision-calculator-tool.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <h3>Big Kaboom</h3>
      <p>Particle physicist Álvaro Díez created the tool, which is hosted on the calculator database project <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/">Omni Calculator</a>. Based on his calculations, a black hole swallowing the Earth would release some 55 quintillion times the planet’s annual energy consumption.</p>
      <p>But even that destructive event would be a light snack for a supermassive black hole — its event horizon would only expand by a hundredth of a trillionth of a percent, per the calculator.</p>
      <p>The main flaw with the calculator? The artistic rendering of a black hole obliterating the Earth that pops up next to the results doesn’t change to match any increasingly goofy collisions.</p>
