      <h2>Cars are turning around on the M25 and driving the wrong way up the motorway after a fatal crash between junctions five and six</h2>

      <p>A busy motorway is expected to remain closed for hours after a fatal crash involving a tanker and a van.</p>
      <p>The M25 clockwise is shut between junctions five and six near Godstone, as police deal with the smash.</p>
      <p>There are reports of cars turning around in the road and driving the wrong way back up motorway.</p>
      <p>Andrew Phillips tweeted: "Cars have begun 3 point turns and heading neck (sic) the wrong way up the m25. Presume we shouldn't?!</p>
      <p>"Huge flow of traffic the wrong way on m25 - presumably directed by police? We really need an update on what we should be doing!"</p>

      <p>One witness told Mirror Online that drivers were turning around on their own initiative and going the wrong way down the hard shoulder.</p>
      <p>He added: "People are just frustrated. Half the carriageway is empty now."</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user said: "Police didn’t direct. I’m near the front, it’s just people being stupid and turning around."</p>
      <p>Early this morning, Highways England confirmed that traffic was being allowed past the crash scene in the fourth lane.</p>
      <p>Surrey Police's Roads Policing Unit tweeted: "M25 junction 5 &gt; 6 is CLOSED while we deal with a fatal collision.</p>
      <p>"If you are stuck between junction 5 and the scene, please be patient. <a href="https://twitter.com/HighwaysSEAST">@HighwaysSEAST</a> officers will be coming to assist but this will take a long time to implement."</p>
      <p>Highways England said the road will not open for several hours.</p>
      <p>At 4.25am, Surrey Police said it expected junction five to reopen soon, hopefully by 5am.</p>
      <p>Drivers are being diverted at junction five, via the A21 south and A25 west, to junction six.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Highways England added: "I can confirm there is now full closure of J5 M25 clockwise.</p>
      <p>"This will also include a closure from the A21 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sevenoaks?src=hashtag_click">#Sevenoaks</a> and a closure from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M26?src=hashtag_click">#M26</a> J2a on to the M25 and this is due to a serious incident .</p>
      <p>"Please be advised it may be closed for some time."</p>
      <p>Paramedics, police officers, Highways England staff and firefighters are at the scene. </p>
