      <h1>The Who's Pete Townsend 'looked down' on bandmate Keith Moon over wild antics</h1>
      <h2>Guitarist Pete Townshend blasts Who wildman Keith Moon's antcs on and off stage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:01:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/</a></address>
      <p>Pete Townshend has admitted he found the wild antics of his bandmates, especially the late Keith Moon, a “waste of time”.</p>
      <p>The Who guitarist, 74, said he looked down on the drummer during his destructive excesses and described him as a “prat”.</p>
      <p>Townshend said: “I was always pretty snobby about rock and roll.</p>
      <p>"As the television went through the window, I would look at Keith Moon and go, ‘what a f***ing prat. What a waste of time’.</p>
      <p>“Then, two or three times I did the same thing, I’d think, ‘what a f***ing prat’. I was in it for the art. I felt we should confine our antics to the stage.”</p>

      <p>Townshend, who admitted he “had some times” himself, said he did not count using heroin or cocaine among his finest moments.</p>
      <p>He put The Who’s longevity – 55 years – down to its faithful male fans, rather than “fickle” teenage girls.</p>
      <p>He said: “They still roll up to see us… and they’re incredibly loyal. It’s like they’re following a crap football team and they don’t care how badly we do.”</p>
