      <p>A school in Manicaland has expelled 10 pupils seen kissing and caressing each other in a viral video.</p>
      <p>The pupils are seen inside a classroom virtually emptied of furniture passionately kissing and touching in pairs in the one-minute-38-seconds video.</p>
      <p>Catholic-run St Therese High School in in Makoni West, 60km from Rusape, sent the pupils home after the video was widely-circulated on social media last week.</p>
      <p>The video is thought to have been recorded by a fellow pupil.</p>
      <p>The Manica Post reported on Friday that all the boys seen in the video are sitting their final Ordinary Level examinations, but some of the girls are in Form 2 and Form 3.</p>
      <p>The schoolâ€™s headmistress Euphrasia Mudiwa refused to comment about the incident, referring questions to the church.</p>
      <p>Edward Shumba, the provincial education director, said the incident was under investigation.</p>
      <p>Manica Post, citing sources at the school, said all the pupils had been expelled. Those writing examinations were now doing so coming from home.</p>
      <p>St Therese was established in the 1960s as a teacher training college before being turned into a day secondary school after independence in 1983. The school introduced a boarding facility for girls in 2016, becoming the first boarding school in Makoni West.</p>
