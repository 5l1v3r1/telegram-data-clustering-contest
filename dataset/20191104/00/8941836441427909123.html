      <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - A West Virginia wildlife official says a monthlong series of fall tours to see elk drew visitors from eight other states.</p>
      <p>Chief Logan State Park naturalist <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lauren-cole/">Lauren Cole</a> told the Charleston Gazette-Mail that 227 people went on the sold-out tours in September and October.</p>
      <p>The elk were at the nearby Tomlin Wildlife Management Area and were imported from Kentucky and Arizona. They’re part of a Division of Natural Resources effort to restore the species to the state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lauren-cole/">Cole</a> says elk were seen on 19 of the 20 tours. She attributed the one tour where elk weren’t seen to a group of hunters who were pursuing raccoons with dogs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/lauren-cole/">Cole</a> says visitors also saw deer, wild turkeys, rabbits and a black bear.</p>
