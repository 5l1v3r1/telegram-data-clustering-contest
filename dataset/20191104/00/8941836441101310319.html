      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/drug-enforcement-administration/">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> is warning that Mexican drug cartels are manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit prescription pills containing the deadly opioid fentanyl.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/drug-enforcement-administration/">DEA</a> said Monday the pills have been showing up on Long Island and New York City, as well as other parts of the country.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/newsday/">Newsday</a> reports the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/drug-enforcement-administration/">DEA</a> found that 27 percent of a sampling of pills seized nationwide between January and March contained potentially lethal doses of the drug.</p>
      <p>Ray Donovan, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/drug-enforcement-administration/">DEA</a>’s special agent in charge of the New York division, says counterfeit pills cause one in four users to die.</p>
