        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The crime-related headlines about Germantown, Maryland, could be a testament to those routinely published about for D.C.</p>
      <p>“Man found dead.” “Police seek two suspects in attempted robbery.” “Teen charged as adult for drug deal.” “Human remains found.” “Man arrested for raping three women.”</p>
      <p>Yet the politician chiefly responsible for ensuring public safety in Germantown has decided to backhand law enforcers and effectively stifle their free speech.</p>
      <p>Yep, you’ve probably learned that Montgomery County Executive <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Marc Elrich</a> barred officers from displaying the Thin Blue Line Flag, a symbol of unity within the Montgomery County Police Department to serve, protect and defend the public.</p>
      <p>He said some people were offended by the symbol.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>That we, the media, are even reporting this flag story is another sign of our misunderstood times. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a>, a Democrat, conceded as much Monday, saying “I think this is really complicated.”</p>
      <p>What’s complicated?</p>
      <p>That <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a> accused the Blue Lives Matters movement, which its black, white and blue lined flag and decals, and said they “appropriated” the Black Lives Matter movement?</p>
      <p><i>Hmm.</i> This is why we need to talk.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a>, 70, was raised in Montgomery County and has been a public servant most if not all of his adult life. He has largely used or depended on taxpayers and voters to become county executive.</p>
        <p>When developers didn’t see his vision, or he couldn’t or wouldn’t envision theirs, he wagged his finger and said “no, no, no.”</p>
        <p>Fine. That’s his political prerogative. No problem.</p>
        <p>His ornery biased position, though, delays inevitable development — a problematic consequence for roads, public transit and small businesses.</p>
        <p>It also could inflame relations with taxpayers, voters and the governor, Larry Hogan, a commonsense pol who appreciates the weight Montgomery County (the state’s most populous) carries in the everyday lives Marylanders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hogan said this weekend he was “offended and disgusted” by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a>’s flag ban. Good for him.</p>
        <p>It seems <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a>, again, failed to envision what the Thin Blue Line Flag actually represents.</p>
        <p>The flag symbolizes what has long been the target of law-and-order antagonists, and that is law enforcers.</p>
        <p>And that’s why the rank-and-file, police unions and sheriffs are flagging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a>’s decision, as they should.</p>
        <p>The flag merely says, “Salute us, please and thanks, because we respond when you need us.”</p>
        <p>Who is <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/marc-elrich/">Mr. Elrich</a> going to call when crime and chaos erupt? Black Lives Matter or the men and women of the thin blue line?</p>
        <p>See?</p>
        <p>In other words, their “blue” lives should always matter.</p>
