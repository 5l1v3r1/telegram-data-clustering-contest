      <h1>Strictly's 'Twirly' Shirley Ballas stuns with jaw-dropping throwback clip</h1>
      <h2>She shared footage of when she was a world champion dancer as fans continue to voice annoyance over treatment of Emma Barton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:34:17+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 00:34</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>She has had her fair share of stick from viewers this series, so anything Shirley Ballas can do to get people onside is worth a go.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> judge diverted a bit of attention but sharing an epic throwback ballroom clip - and she was straight away re-named Twirly Shirley!</p>
      <p>The star shows maybe she has a right to be harsh on contestants after letting fans in on twitter.</p>
      <p>She twists and spins in the vintage world dancing championship clip - and fans love it.</p>
      <p>Fan Ashley Stebbings tweeted her with his amazing find and she enjoyed it, replying: "Where did you find this clip? Trip down memory lane" as she shared it with her 60,000 followers.</p>

      <p>She certainly has the skills to be dishing out the advice in the studio.</p>
      <p>But viewers still say her 'harsh' critique of Emma Barton isn't fair - even if she is well qualified to say what she sees.</p>
      <p>"Don't deny she was a great dancer once upon a time but Strictly needs a judge who can be objective and not bring personal prejudices into their judgements," one wrote on twitter.</p>
      <p>"She is amazing dancer but she is overly rude to certain contestants (usually pretty ones)" another said.</p>
      <p>But one viewer wrote: "Absolutely outstanding dancing,when you see things like this you can understand why she is Head Judge."</p>
      <p>Fans weren't happy about the treatment of EastEnder Emma on Saturday night.</p>

      <p>One tweeted: "Am i f***ing missing something here? emma and anton danced brilliantly yet the judges haven’t barely given her one compliment. it’s a disgrace to hold them to a different level to everyone else on the show. #strictly."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "Trying to figure out how Shirley can give Emma and anton a 5 and Mike a 8 she’s so biased! #strictly #StrictlyComeDancing."</p>
