      <p>BEIJING (AP) - French President Emmanuel Macron is visiting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> this week amid a push for Beijing to open its markets, despite festering trade disputes and weakened consumer spending.</p>
      <p>Macron arrives Monday in Shanghai where he is to visit a sprawling import fair before traveling to Beijing for a state visit on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The trip comes as France and its partners are demanding <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/china/">China</a> make good on its commitments to boost imports of agricultural products and manufactured goods while opening its market for financial products and other services.</p>
      <p>France and the European Union have joined the U.S. in complaints over Chinese trade practices they consider unfair.</p>
