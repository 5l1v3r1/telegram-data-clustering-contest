      <p>The tragic deaths of 39 people found in the back of a lorry in Essex should be “wake up call for the Government” to rethink its approach to illegal migration, MPs warn today.</p>
      <p>The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee warned a policy focused on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes and push them into smugglers’ hands.</p>
      <p>The human cost of so-called “irregular” migration made international partnerships, including with the EU, “essential”, the committee says.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Tom Tugendhat said: “The case of 39 people found dead in a lorry in Essex shocked us all.</p>
      <p>“The full story won’t be clear for some time but this tragedy is not alone.</p>
      <p>“Today, hundreds of families across the world are losing loved ones who felt driven to take the fatal gamble to entrust their lives to smugglers.</p>
      <p>“This case should serve as a wake-up call to the Foreign Office and to Government.”</p>
      <p>The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court last week charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>

      <p>Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p>Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.</p>
      <p>The case has renewed calls for safe routes for migrants seeking better lives in Britain.</p>
      <p>Today’s report, ‘Responding to irregular migration: a diplomatic route’, also raised concerns about deals to limit migration with countries such as Libya, Niger and Sudan as risking fuelling human rights abuses.</p>
      <p>Mr Tugendhat added: “The UK has been relatively isolated from the different migrant crises in recent years - but it’s wrong to assume that we are protected from their impact.</p>
      <p>“The UK has a proud history of helping those fleeing conflict and persecution and cooperating with others to protect human rights.</p>
      <p>“We should lead by example.”</p>
