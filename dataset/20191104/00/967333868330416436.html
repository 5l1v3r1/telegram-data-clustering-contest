        <b>Protests in Iraq started last month when people took to the streets calling for the resignation of the government, the implementation of economic reforms and the elimination of corruption. They soon turned violent, leaving dozens dead and hundreds more injured.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Demonstrators in Baghdad and in the south of the country calling for change to Iraq's political system blocked roads and government buildings on Sunday, which hampered road movement and the work of government agencies.</p>
      <blockquote>"We decided to cut the roads as a message to the government that we will keep protesting until the corrupt people and thieves are kicked out and the regime falls", said 25-year-old Tahseen Nasser in the town of Kut, east of the capital.</blockquote>

      <p>Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi has urged protesters to stop hindering road traffic as they had already achieved their goals.</p>
      <blockquote>"Threatening the oil interests and blocking roads leading to Iraq's ports is causing big losses exceeding billions of dollars", said Abdul Mahdi, warning that demonstrations was pushing up goods prices.</blockquote>
