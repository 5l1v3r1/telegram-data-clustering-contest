      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Kyrie Irving had 39 points and nine assists, and the Brooklyn Nets withstood Brandon Ingram’s career-high 40 points to beat the New Orleans Pelicans 135-125 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Nets had 67 points at halftime and a 20-point lead in the third quarter, but could never get comfortable until the final minute as Ingram kept coming at them.</p>
      <p>He shot 17 for 24 from the field in his first 40-point game and the Pelicans scored a franchise-record 48 points in the third quarter. They got within two in the fourth but could never get enough stops to actually catch the Nets.</p>
      <p>Caris LeVert added 23 points, Joe Harris had 19 and Jarrett Allen finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds for the Nets, who follow this game with a five-game road trip, their longest of the season, with the first four in the West.</p>
      <p>Jrue Holiday and Lonzo Ball each scored 15 points and Josh Hart had 14 for the Pelicans, who fell to 1-6.</p>

      <p>Brooklyn led by only two after Ingram’s three-point play with 4:58 remaining in the half, but the Nets scored 10 straight. Five of them came in one trip when Allen made two free throws after being flagrantly fouled by Ingram - he actually made the shot while being thrown to the ground, but the foul had been called on the floor - and Garrett Temple made a 3-pointer after Brooklyn retained possession.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn later got consecutive jumpers by Irving and a dunk from Spencer Dinwiddie to close a 20-3 run and make it 63-44.</p>
      <p>Irving scored 18 points in the third but the Pelicans were a sizzling 8 for 11 from 3-point range and scored 48 points, trimming a 20-point deficit to 104-98 heading to the fourth.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Pelicans: Their previous best was 47 points in a quarter, and their best third quarter was 41 points. … Ingram played just 13 minutes in his previous game against Oklahoma City on Saturday because of a head injury.</p>
        <p>Nets: DeAndre Jordan limped off early in the fourth quarter with a sprained left ankle after appearing to step on teammate JJ Redick’s foot while running down the court. … Irving has scored at least 20 points in all seven games. The longest streak of 20-point games to open a season by a Nets player belongs to Richard Jefferson, who did it in eight straight in 2007-08.</p>
        <p>GUESTS IN TOWN</p>
        <p>Fourth-ranked Duke practiced at the Nets’ training facility Monday ahead of its game Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden against No. 3 Kansas in the Champions Classic. No. 1 Michigan State and No. 2 Kentucky also meet in the marquee early season doubleheader. The Nets held training camp at Duke under former general manager Billy King, who played for the Blue Devils.</p>
        <p>OKAFOR’S OPPORTUNITY</p>
        <p>Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said he was happy for Jahlil Okafor, now starting at center for New Orleans. The No. 3 pick in the 2015 draft spent part of a season with Brooklyn in 2017-18 after falling out of the rotation in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>“Ultimate professional. Wonderful spirit. Worked his tail off, so I’m really happy for him,” Atkinson said. “I think he fits with New Orleans and I think he’s a young player who’s starting to really get his footing in this league.”</p>
