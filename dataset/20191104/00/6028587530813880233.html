      <h1>What Are Americans’ Biggest Financial Regrets?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">John F. Wasik</a></address>
      <p>It’s slam dunk subject that most Americans don’t want to talk about: Not having enough money. It’s a perennial bugaboo.According to a recent survey from TD Ameritrade, “while politics and religion are topics regularly debated, money conversations seem to be stigmatized or off-limits, and that needs to change.”</p>
      <p>What bugs people the most?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A third of Americans feel that it’s not polite to discuss finances in social settings, and the fear of being perceived as a failure is the number one reason Millennials don’t openly discuss the topic.</li>
        <li>Student loan debt is the most uncomfortable financial topic to discuss (36%), followed by childcare expenses (30%) and living paycheck to paycheck (26%). “While many Americans feel comfortable discussing key financial elements with their spouse/partner/significant other, only 45% feel comfortable discussing student loan debt with them.”</li>
        <li>Half of Americans (51%) and seven in 10 Millennials (71%) think that society would be healthier if people felt they could discuss personal finances more freely.</li>
        <li>Baby Boomers are twice as likely as Millennials to not share their financial mistakes with others (25% vs. 12%).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Financial woes can be addressed. After all, it’s just money. It merits a discussion and there’s plenty of help available.</p>
      <p>First of all, debts can be managed and paid off, particularly student debts. There are several<a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/repaymentEstimator.action"> repayment plans </a>available. See what’s available and what could work for you. The federal student loan program has plenty of options.</p>
      <p>Saving is made easier by hundreds of phone <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/best-money-saving-apps/">apps </a>and online sites. You can save every time you spend money or set up automatic savings plans at work through your 401(k) plan.</p>
      <p>Use three buckets for savings: 1) Short-term (month to month bills), 2) Mid-term (home downpayment, education, emergencies) and 3) Retirement.</p>
      <p>Still flummoxed? I’d recommend writing down all of your spending and see how you can save money – and make it automatic. Then figure out how much you can put away and how much it will grow over time.</p>
