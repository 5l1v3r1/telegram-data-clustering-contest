While the global investment banking industry struggled over the quarter due to reduced client activity, Barclays’ reported a strong performance in rates trading and securitized products – reinforcing the strength of its business model. Trefis highlights the <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/jO3VqC3v/What-Is-The-Importance-Of-Investment-Banking-Division-To-Barclays-?fromforbesandarticle=bcs191104"><b>importance of the Investment Banking Division for Barclays</b></a> in an interactive dashboard, parts of which are summarized below.

      <p>
        <b>#1 Investment Banking Division Makes Up One-Third Of Barclays’ Total Revenues</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Investment Banking is Barclays’ single-largest division – accounting for nearly 35% of the bank’s total revenues.</li>
        <li>After declining over 2015-17, the division’s revenues increased 4.5% to settle above $9.6 billion in 2018</li>
        <li>This growth was driven by strong performance across FICC and Equity trading desks.</li>
        <li>Despite a challenging environment, we expect the division to continue to achieve steady revenue growth and touch $9.9 billion in revenues for FY 2019.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>#2 Barclays’ Investment Banking Revenues Have Fared Better Than Revenues For Other Divisions</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barclays’ total revenue has declined at an average annual rate of 6% since 2015 – losing more than $5.6 billion in total revenues.</li>
        <li>While revenues for the Investment Banking division have also declined, they have fallen at a slower rate than that of the consolidated bank – shedding $1.7 billion in revenues at an average annual rate of 5%.</li>
        <li>Despite operating in a more volatile business, the IB division has fared better than the bank’s other divisions.</li>
        <li>Low interest-rate environment, uncertainty over Brexit, and an overall weakness in the Eurozone have been responsible for the bank’s overall sluggish performance over recent years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>#3 The Division Has Been Operating At A Much Higher Margin</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Investment Banking Division’s three-year average operating margin was 24.2%, well above Barclays’ total operating margin of 16.1%</li>
        <li>Notably, the division has been operating at a similar margin to that of the bank’s less volatile and high-margin retail banking division, Barclays UK.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>#4 Moreover, Barclays’ Investment Banking division is much more profitable than that for its European peers, and also contributes more to the bank’s top line</b>
      </p>

Using this figure with our estimated forward P/E ratio of 11.6x and a GBP-USD exchange rate of 1.3, this works out to a price estimate of $10 for <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/SWPOEvts/Barclays-Stock-(NYSE%3A-BCS)?fromforbesandarticle=bcs191104">Barclays’ stock</a>.</p>
