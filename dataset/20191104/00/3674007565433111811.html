      <p>Plant-based brand Artisan Grains is launching a trio of gluten-free and vegan Falafel mixes across the UK and Europe.</p>
      <p>The Falafel come in three 'on-trend' flavours including Beetroot &amp; Chilli, Pumpkin &amp; Quinoa and Super Greens.</p>
      <p>All three are made with a base of ground chickpeas, herbs and spices with the addition of 'natural, healthy ingredients' including broccoli pearls, beetroot pieces and whole quinoa. They are all natural, high in protein, gluten-free, vegan, palm-oil free and contain no added sugar.</p>
      <p>André Aires, Business Development Manager at Artisan Grains, said: “<i>Alongside the increase in vegan diets and a desire for healthier meat-free foods, we’re seeing a real demand for better tasting plant-based and cruelty-free foods, especially when it comes to Falafel.</i>​</p>
      <p><i>“</i>​<i>Falafels have been an important plant-based staple for hundreds of years and their current surge in popularity has a lot to do with the fact that they’re a great meat-free source of protein, they’re crunchy and delicious to snack on, and they go well with so many different types of foods.”</i>​</p>
      <p>Each six x 150g box of mix makes over 20 Falafel balls and serves four, with a recommended retail price of £1.89.</p>

      <p>Juste Pressé has unveiled a new orange and pomegranate drink. According to the French company, it has counterbalanced the slightly ‘pungent’ taste of pomegranate juice with the sweet taste of orange, resulting in a delicious slightly acidic juice.</p>
      <p>As for the health benefits, pomegranate and orange bring all the richness of plants: vitamins, antioxidants and minerals making it ideal for our immune system and or for strengthening cells, said the company. </p>
      <p>The juice is obtained from a High Pressure Refrigeration process which preserves most of the nutritional properties of the juices and 96% of preserved antioxidants without additives or preservatives and no added vitamins.</p>
      <p>The 500 ml bottles will be available from mid-November at a RRP of €3.95.</p>
