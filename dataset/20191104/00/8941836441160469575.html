      <p>MILLSBORO, Del. (AP) - A Delaware man has been arrested after an 11-year-old overdosed on heroin.</p>
      <p>State police say 31-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gilbert-dickerson/">Gilbert Dickerson</a> was charged last week with offenses including possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.</p>
      <p>News outlets report troopers responded Oct. 28 to a report of a child in cardiac arrest and found several small bags of heroin in the child’s pocket. A Friday police statement says about 30 bags were collected from the scene, and the child was hospitalized. The newspaper says the child’s status was unclear as of Saturday.</p>

        <p>Police say an investigation determined the child got the heroin from one of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gilbert-dickerson/">Dickerson</a>’s children. They say the child had found the drug in an Altoids container in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gilbert-dickerson/">Dickerson</a>’s car and shared it, not knowing it was heroin.</p>
