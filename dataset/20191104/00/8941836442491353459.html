      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">NEW YORK</a> (AP) — An advice columnist who says President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> sexually assaulted her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s is now suing him for defamation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/e-jean-carroll/">E. Jean Carroll</a> filed a lawsuit Monday in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a>. The suit says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> harmed her reputation and career when he said she was lying and he’d never even met her.</p>
      <p>A message requesting comment was sent to a law firm that has represented <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> in other cases.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/e-jean-carroll/">Carroll</a> first made the allegation in a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york/">New York</a> magazine article in June. At the time, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> said she was “totally lying” and called her “not my type.”</p>

        <p>He also said he’d never met her, though a 1987 photo shows him and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/e-jean-carroll/">Carroll</a> in a photo with their spouses at the time.</p>
