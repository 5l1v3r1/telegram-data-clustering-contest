      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/tesla/"><b>Tesla</b></a><b> (NASDAQ: TSLA)</b> stock rallied by close to 24% since it published its Q3 2019 results last week, posting a surprise profit. However, taking a closer look at the underlying numbers and comparing them with the previous quarter (Q2 2019) and the year-ago quarter (Q3 2018), we believe that the markets could be overlooking some negatives in the earnings release.View our interactive dashboard analysis on <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/uCQOrdyC/Are-Tesla-Investors-Overlooking-Some-Key-Trends-In-Q3-Earnings-?fromforbesandarticle=tsla191104">Are Tesla Investors Overlooking Some Key Trends In Q3 Earnings?</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Tesla reported positive Operating Cash Flow in Q2 as well at $864 million, versus only $756 million in Q3, but investors didn’t care to jump and buy TSLA at that time</b>

      <ul>
        <li>Tesla’s operating cash flows were actually lower on a sequential and year-over-year (YoY) basis, partly due to an increase in Net Operating Assets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Tesla’s Free Cash Flow was also positive, at around $614 million in Q2, compared to $371 million in Q3. Investors still didn’t jump with joy in Q2, but in Q3 they bought the stock fast until it spiked ~20%.</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tesla’s Free Cash Flow, calculated as Net Income less CapEx has actually trended lower sequentially as well as YoY, due to lower Operating Cash Flows as well as sequentially higher CapEx.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Tesla’s Earnings need to be subject to more scrutiny, with declining D&amp;A expenses, and higher one-off revenue items</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A bulk of Tesla’s earnings improvement has come from lower Cost Of Revenue for the auto business, which benefited from better cost absorption and lower labor intensity for production.</li>
        <li>Interestingly, Tesla also saw lower depreciation expenses (down 13% sequentially and 5% YoY), which is odd for a company with ambitious growth plans.</li>
        <li>Tesla did not recognize any “Restructuring and Other” charges over Q3. In Q2, it recognized $117 million in charges, contributing to a significant earnings miss.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Tesla’s Automotive Revenues are almost flat sequentially &amp; down YoY</b>
