      <h1>Lawyer: Donald Trump’s phone records back details of Summer Zerv</h1>
      <address> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Peltz</a></address>
      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — President Trump’s cellphone records show a call to a former “Apprentice” contestant on a day when she says he subjected her to unwanted kissing and groping, according to a court filing.</p>
      <p>Records filed in Summer Zervos’ defamation suit and obtained Monday by The Associated Press indicate that Zervos got a call from Trump’s phone on a day in December 2007, when she says he rang to invite her to dinner. She says she went hoping for career advice and ended up being sexually assaulted.</p>
      <p>The records also show a call to Zervos from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s phone the next afternoon and calls from her to his phone in the following months. Her lawyers say the phone calls support that she’s telling the truth.</p>
      <p>Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz said Monday that Zervos’ claims “are entirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.”</p>
      <p>Zervos, a California restaurateur, was on the Trump-hosted reality show “The Apprentice” in 2006. She says she later contacted him in hopes of furthering her career.</p>

      <p>Zervos says the then-businessman made unwanted advances twice in December 2007: once in his Trump Tower office in New York, and later at the Beverly Hills Hotel in California.</p>
      <p>She was among more than a dozen women who came forward during his 2016 presidential campaign to accuse him of sexual assault or sexual harassment over the years.</p>
      <p>Trump called them “liars” trying to harm him with “100 percent fabricated” stories. He also issued a statement denying Zervos’ allegations and retweeted a message calling them “a hoax.”</p>
      <p>Both Trump and Zervos are Republicans.</p>

        <p>Zervos sued Trump for defamation, saying he damaged her reputation by calling her a liar.</p>
        <p>The phone records show “that numerous specific details that Ms. Zervos has provided about those interactions are true,” Zervos attorney Mariann Wang wrote in a previously redacted portion of an Oct. 24 court filing. At the time, Trump’s lawyers were objecting to public disclosure of the phone records, but they have since dropped their opposition.</p>
        <p>The phone records are for a now-defunct Trump cellphone number that leaked during the campaign; he later invited people to call it for a campaign message.</p>
        <p>The phone records show a call to Zervos from Los Angeles on Dec. 21, 2007, when Trump’s calendar shows he was due to fly there and head to the Beverly Hills Hotel.</p>
        <p>A call to Zervos from Beverly Hills followed the next afternoon, a day when Zervos has said she and Trump briefly met at his Los Angeles-area golf course. His calendar records , which emerged previously in the lawsuit, show he was scheduled to be there.</p>
        <p>The phone records also show two calls from Zervos to Trump’s phone on Dec. 26, 2007. Zervos has said she’d gotten what she considered a low-salary job offer from the golf club and told Trump she felt she “was being penalized for not sleeping with him.”</p>
        <p>The records show two more calls from Zervos in January and February 2008. She has said she had “a subsequent conversation about a job” with Trump and was told to stop using his private number, but she hasn’t specified when.</p>
        <p>Zervos is seeking a retraction, an apology and damages.</p>
        <p>Trump’s lawyers have said his statements were opinions and he had a free-speech right to express them. His attorneys have tried to get the case dismissed, or at least delayed until he’s no longer in office.</p>
        <p>The two sides agreed Friday to a Jan. 31 deadline for the president to undergo a deposition, a legal term for sworn questioning conducted out of court.</p>
