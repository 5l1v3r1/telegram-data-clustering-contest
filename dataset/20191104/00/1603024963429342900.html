      <p>At the recently concluded Ducati World Premiere, the company showcased many of its new and upcoming products. Among those was the new Panigale V2, which is a spiritual successor to the Panigale 959.</p>
      <p>The motorcycle bears a striking resemblance to its bigger siblings, the Panigale V4 series. It gets the signature split headlight and the LED taillight from the bigger boys. However, it gets a different fuel tank, fairing and exhaust end can.</p>
      <p>Ducati has equipped the motorcycle with a 4.3-inch fully digital TFT instrument cluster. This is used to control the motorcycle’s electronic rider aids which include a brand-new 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), cornering ABS, Ducati Traction Control (DTC), wheelie control, bi-directional quick-shifter and engine brake control.</p>

      <p>The company has also paid attention to creature comforts. It has revised the motorcycle’s ergonomics, as well as given it a brand-new seat. This offers better longitudinal movement due to a 5mm thick foam padding. The Panigale V2 is also the only motorcycle in the Panigale lineup to get a pillion seat as standard.</p>
      <p>Mechanically, it adapts the 959 Panigale’s 955cc twin-cylinder Superquadro engine, with Euro 5 and BSVI emission compliance. It makes 155 PS of maximum power and 104 Nm of peak torque. It is mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox.</p>
      <p>Though Ducati is yet to make an official announcement, it is expected that the motorcycle will be launched in India in the second half of 2020. It should have a price tag between Rs 16.5 lakh to Rs 17 lakh (ex-showroom).<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
