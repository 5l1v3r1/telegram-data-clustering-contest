      <p>HARARE – Former Transport Minister Jorum Gumbo was arrested on Monday accused of corruption involving a US$70 million deal to acquire four planes from Malaysian Airlines.</p>
      <p>The planes were sold to Zimbabwe Airways, the ill-fated Air Zimbabwe proxy set up to circumvent sanctions.</p>
      <p>Former President Robert Mugabe personally negotiated the acquisition of the four Boeing 777-200 planes which had been retired by Malaysian Airlines.</p>
      <p>Gumbo, currently a Minister of State in the President’s Office in Charge of Policy Implementation, becomes the second sitting minister to be snared by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) after former Tourism Minister Prisca Mupfumira was arrested in July.</p>
      <p>He is expected to appear in court soon, ZACC spokesman John Makamure told ZimLive.</p>
      <p>“He faces charges of criminal abuse of office,” Makamure said.</p>
