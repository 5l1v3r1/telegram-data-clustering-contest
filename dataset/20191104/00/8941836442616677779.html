      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elvis-andrus/">Elvis Andrus</a> is staying with the Rangers after the shortstop passed up on a second chance to opt out of his contract and become a free agent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elvis-andrus/">Andrus</a> has $43 million and three years left on his contract in Texas.</p>
      <p>He just completed his 11th season with the Rangers. The 31-year-old shortstop is the team’s longest-tenured player, and the only player remaining from their only two World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/elvis-andrus/">Andrus</a> hit .275 with 12 homers, 72 RBIs and 31 stolen bases in 147 games this year. He is a .275 career hitter with 73 homers and a team-record 302 stolen bases.</p>
      <p>He also had the opportunity to opt out after the 2018 season, when he was limited to 97 games because of a fractured right elbow. The two potential opt-outs were part of the $120 million, eight-year deal he signed before the 2015 season.</p>

      <p>Texas also reinstated right-hander Jesse Chavez, All-Star slugger Joey Gallo and lefty Taylor Hearn from the 60-day injured list on Monday.</p>
      <p>Tim Federowicz elected to become a free agent after the Rangers assigned the catcher outright to Triple-A Nashville.</p>
