      <p>Researchers from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, <a href="https://news.rpi.edu/content/2019/11/01/living-skin-can-now-be-3d-printed-blood-vessels-included">claim</a> to have 3D-printed skin that’s alive and has blood vessels.</p>
      <p>The new technique could greatly accelerate the healing process for patients who require skin grafts, such as burn victims.</p>
      <p>“Right now, whatever is available as a clinical product is more like a fancy Band-Aid,” lead researcher Pankaj Karande, a chemical engineering professor at the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies, said in <a href="https://news.rpi.edu/content/2019/11/01/living-skin-can-now-be-3d-printed-blood-vessels-included">a statement</a>. “It provides some accelerated wound healing, but eventually it just falls off; it never really integrates with the host cells.”</p>
      <p>In a paper published in the journal <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ten.TEA.2019.0201"><i>Tissue Engineering Part A</i></a> on Monday, the researchers detail how they added cells crucial to the development of blood vessels to animal collagen inside a complex network of 3D-printed tissues, which prompted the cells to form a vascular structure within weeks.</p>
      <p>“We were pleasantly surprised to find that, once we start approaching [the complexity of recreating biology], biology takes over and starts getting closer and closer to what exists in nature,” Karande said.</p>
      <p>Their 3D-printed skin even began to connect and communicate with a mouse’s blood vessels in an animal trial. But that doesn’t mean it’s ready for use on human patients on a clinical level just yet. Donor cells would have to be modified using gene-editing techniques such as <a href="https://futurism.com/tags/crispr">CRISPR</a> to stop the host’s body from rejecting the graft.</p>
      <p>Still, it’s a clever solution that lets the body do what it does naturally — but with a little help up front.</p>
