      <p>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) - An educator has rescued a caged puppy from drowning in a chilly central Illinois lake.</p>
      <p>Bryant Fritz was preparing to fish Saturday in Champaign when he found a black and white puppy submerged in rising water and trapped inside of a dog crate in Kaufman Lake. Fritz says he waded into waist-high, freezing water before reaching the cage.</p>
      <p>The middle school science teacher at Next Generation School in Champaign told The News-Gazette on Sunday that he pulled the dog from the water and dragged the crate to the shore. Fritz noted seeing blood and missing skin from her paws.</p>
      <p>University of Illinois spokeswoman Chris Beuoy says the puppy has been treated for hypothermia and it’s unclear whether her wounds would require additional treatment.</p>
