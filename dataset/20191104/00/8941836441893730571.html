      <p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) - An Afghan official says a roadside bombing has killed at least eight civilians in northern Baghlan province.</p>
      <p>Jawed Basharat, provincial police chief’s spokesman, says six other people were wounded in Monday’s attack in the Dand Shabuddin area outside of Puli Khumri, the provincial capital of Baghlan.</p>
      <p>Basharat says women and children are among the casualties.</p>
      <p>No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the area of the bombing is under Taliban control.</p>
      <p>The Taliban have a strong presence in the province and usually target Afghan security forces in and around Puli Khumri. Scores of civilians are killed in the attacks.</p>
