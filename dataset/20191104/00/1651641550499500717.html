      <h1>Tesla’s latest software update brings support for traffic cones to AutoPilot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T00:25:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>One of the great virtues of Tesla cars is that they are constantly improving via regular software updates. The last update, for example,<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/teslas-latest-update-increases-vehicle-power-introduces-automatic-navigation-and-scheduled-departure/"> improved the power and range of the cars and brought an automatic navigation feature.</a> The latest update brings a useful new AutoPilot features to Tesla cars – the ability to see and respond to traffic cones while in AutoPilot mode.</p>

      <p>The changelog reads:</p>
      <blockquote>“The driving visualization now displays traffic cones. In cases where a traffic cone is detected and Navigate on Autopilot is engaged (requires Full Self Driving Capability), the vehicle is designed to suggest a lane change (or attempt a lane if REQUIRE LANE CHANGE CONFIRMATION is set to NO) to avoid cones. As always, you are responsible for your vehicle and are required to pay attention at all times.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s notable that the feature requires the Full Self-Driving package, which is an add-on many Tesla cars do not have.</p>
      <p>Tesla owners report that at present not all cones appear to be recognized by Tesla Autopilot (<i>though this will improve over time)</i>, making the warning that drivers should always remain aware and in control of their car at all times even more important.</p>
