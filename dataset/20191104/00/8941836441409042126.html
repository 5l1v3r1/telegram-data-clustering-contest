      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nbc/">NBC</a> executive Jim Bell, who has produced the last four Olympics for the network and been in charge backstage at Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight” show for the past year, says he’s leaving <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nbc/">NBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Bell said in a statement that the timing was perfect to forge a new path that would build on his experience in news, sports and entertainment.</p>
      <p>He was a longtime producer of the “Today” show before moving to the Olympics, where he was in charge of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nbc/">NBC</a>’s prime-time telecasts. Since 2017, Bell had been in charge of all Olympics content across all platforms.</p>
      <p>At “Tonight,” he steered Fallon into more live shows. But the show hasn’t gained ground against ratings leader Stephen Colbert at CBS.</p>
