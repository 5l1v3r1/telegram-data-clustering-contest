      <p>Freshworks, the Chennai-based software products and services company, has closed a $150-million (Rs 1,050 crore) funding round with existing investors that include Google, Sequoia and Accel, sources have told Moneycontrol.</p>
      <p>“The funding round was closed on Friday,” said one of the sources. The company also crossed $200 million in annual recurring revenue, Freshworks' founder CEO Girish Mathrubootham told employees at an event to mark the startup's ninth anniversary.</p>
      <p>The latest round of funding, eighth since Freshworks first raised capital in 2011, values the company at $3.5 billion. “This is a pre-IPO (initial public offering) round, which sets the valuation of the company and also puts a benchmark to what each Freshworks share could be valued at,” said a second source.</p>

      <p>Freshworks could raise more funds before listing its shares by 2021.</p>
      <p>Before the eighth round, Freshworks, a business-to-business company, had raised $249 million. Among the company’s earlier investors are CapitalG , the investment fund of Google’s parent Alphabet, and former Flipkart investor Tiger Global Management.</p>
      <p>Freshworks’ rise has been fast.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, the company was the first pure-play provider of software services over the internet to become a unicorn, when it raised $100 million from Accel and Sequoia Capital.</p>
      <p>Earlier known as Freshdesk, the company was started by former Zoho Corporation employees Mathrubootham and Shan Krishnasamy in 2010.</p>
      <p>Mathrubootham was the vice president of product management at Zoho, and the idea of starting Freshdesk, a customer-support software company, struck him when he received a broken LCD television, and he complained about it on social media.</p>
      <p>The issue got resolved. In 2011, Accel Partners, Freshworks’s first institutional investor, bet $1 million on the company because Mathrubootham talked from experience and was solving a real problem.</p>
      <p>“Freshworks’ listing on the bourses show that B2B startups are better bets for investors. India is following what is successfully happening globally,” the second source said.</p>
      <p>In America, website infrastructure and security company Cloudflare, workplace productivity company Slack and software service company PagerDuty have had successful IPOs.</p>
      <p>Listing of B2B startups, a growing startup category, shows that investors believe that they can generate high-value revenue that is recurring and more definite than consumer startups, said the second source.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
