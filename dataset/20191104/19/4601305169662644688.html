      <h1>Utah elementary student wore a Nazi costume to school parade</h1>

      <p>On Halloween, a child at Creekside Elementary School in Kaysville, Utah wore a Nazi uniform as his costume for a parade at school. After some people complained online, the school principal and a teacher were suspended with pay for allowing such a thing. I wish they could suspend the boy's parents from being parents. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, "others (on social media) supported the boy." From the <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/01/utah-elementary-student/">Salt Lake Tribune</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>In a statement, the Davis County School District apologized for the costume. <br/><br/>“[The district] does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,” the statement read. “The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.” <br/><br/>School district spokesman Chris Williams declined to name the faculty members who were placed on paid leave, but the elementary school’s website lists Steve B. Hammer as the principal.</blockquote>
