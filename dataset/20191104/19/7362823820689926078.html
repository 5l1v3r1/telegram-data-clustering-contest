      <p>According to the gossip site, during a filming break, one actor allegedly cut in front of many other extras in line for snacks and coffee. After a female craft services employee witnessed the actor attempting to cut in, she asked the performer to move to the back of the line, which was when things reportedly escalated.</p>
      <p>Insiders told TMZ that the fight allegedly broke out when the hired extra shoved the female craft service employee and was punched in the face by the employee’s husband who was also a member of craft services.</p>
      <p>Sources further told the site that the hired actor landed on the snacks table and was allegedly pummeled several more times by the husband before officers arrived.</p>
