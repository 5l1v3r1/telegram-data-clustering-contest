      <p>“Look, this is my first venture into sharing myself and my views with the world, and I’m a little bit nervous about it because quite frankly, I’m… I know I want to have a monologue, I’m not sure I want to have the dialogue,” he says with a laugh.</p>
      <p>The star went on: “I’m looking forward to sharing who I am with you, I’m looking forward to seeing if who I am translates, if what I want to share translates, if it tickles your funny bone, if it makes you think a second, if it makes your heart swell up a little bit, if it makes you take a quiet moment for a walk and go, ‘I have to check in with the M and the E’.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully all of those things.”</p>
      <p>The actor said he hoped to “have some fun with it”.</p>
      <p>“Again, let’s keep the high eye, not the low eye. High eye,” he said.</p>
