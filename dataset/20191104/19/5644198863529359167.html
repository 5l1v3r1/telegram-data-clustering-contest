      <p>Takeaway.com has changed its line of attack in the battle to buy food delivery ordering service Just Eat , effectively lowering the threshold for approval of its offer to fend off rival suitor Prosus .</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Takeaway.com has changed its line of attack in the battle to buy food delivery ordering service Just Eat , effectively lowering the threshold for approval of its offer to fend off rival suitor Prosus .</p>
      <p>Just Eat had previously agreed on the terms of a 4.7 billion pound all-share deal that prompted internet giant Prosus to weigh in with an unsolicited cash offer of US$6.3 billion, or 710 pence per share, setting an increasingly fractious contest in motion.</p>

      <p>A merger of Takeaway and Just Eat would create one of the biggest food delivery groups outside China, rivaling Uber Eats , with market leadership in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.</p>
      <p>At Takeaway's current share price of 72.45 euros, its offer is valued at 607 pence per share, equating to roughly US$5.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Takeaway announced on Monday that it had changed the structure of its takeover attempt from a scheme of arrangement that needed 75per cent approval by both sets of shareholders to a formal offer that requires 75per cent of Just Eat shareholders to give the nod.</p>
      <p>If the Takeover panel agrees, that could drop as low as 50per cent plus one share.</p>
      <p>"With this switch, we provide additional deal certainty to the Just Eat shareholders," said Takeaway CEO Jitse Groen.</p>
      <p>Just Eat's board unanimously recommended its shareholders accept the Takeaway offer.</p>
      <p>Takeaway spokesman Joris Wilton said the new structure gives the company "increased flexibility" in the fight, including the possibility that the deal could be allowed to go through with a bare majority of 50per cent.</p>
      <p>Shares in Just Eat rose 0.5per cent to 740 pence, significantly above the Prosus offer, indicating that investors expect a higher bid from one side or the other.</p>
      <p>Wilton said Takeaway has no plans to raise its bid or add a cash component. Prosus could not immediately be reached for comment and Just Eat did not respond immediately to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The change also means that a planned Dec. 4 shareholder vote on the original agreement has been put on hold. Takeaway will instead launch a tender offer that is expected to expire before the end of the year, Wilton said.</p>
      <p>"All eyes will be on whether Prosus increases its offer," Credit Suisse analysts said.</p>
      <p>Takeaway and Just Eat share at least six investors, including Cat Rock, Refinitiv data shows.</p>
      <p>The takeover battle heated up last month after Cat Rock accused German rival Delivery Hero , which is 22per cent owned by Prosus, of selling down its 13per cent stake in Takeaway to suppress the value of the shares and lower the attractiveness of Takeaway's offer.</p>
