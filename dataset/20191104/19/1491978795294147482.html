        <i><b>Tuesday</b>: Telegraph argues actor’s defamation payout was too high. Plus, why the media is obsessed with the race that stops – and divides – the nation</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 5 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>The lawyers for Sydney’s Daily Telegraph have argued that $2.9m in damages awarded to Geoffrey Rush in his defamation case against the paper were “manifestly excessive”</b> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/05/geoffrey-rush-defamation-appeal-29m-manifestly-excessive-newspaper-says">out of line with other </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/05/geoffrey-rush-defamation-appeal-29m-manifestly-excessive-newspaper-says">high-profile cases</a>. The Telegraph through its parent company, Nationwide News, began its appeal on Monday against the federal court judge Michael Wigney’s ruling that the Rupert Murdoch-owned newspaper had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/11/geoffrey-rush-defamation-case-actor-millions-news-corp-nationwide">defamed Rush by alleging he “engaged in inappropriate behaviour”</a> during a Sydney Theatre Company production of King Lear in 2015. The first day of a two-day appeal ended on a dramatic note, when in an 11th-hour change of heart the newspaper dropped its claim that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/06/geoffrey-rush-defamation-case-news-corp-to-appeal-claiming-judge-was-biased">Wigney’s conduct in the case “gave rise to an apprehension of bias”</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Donald Trump’s accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors</b>, a <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6538526/11-4-19-Trump-v-Vance-Opinion.pdf">US appeals court tuled</a> on Monday in the latest setback for the US president in his attempts to keep his finances secret. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, <a href="https://twitter.com/dsamuelsohn/status/1191386555623100416">said</a>: “We will be taking this case to the supreme court.” That will preclude the immediate release of the information. Meanwhile, E Jean Carroll, the widely respected New York journalist who alleges Trump raped her in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/04/e-jean-carroll-sues-trump-defamation-alleged-rape-bergdorf-goodman">is suing the president for defamation</a> after he ridiculed her claim on the grounds she was “not my type”.</p>
      <p><b>The animal cruelty scandal has not diminished the coverage of the Melbourne Cup</b>,<b> </b>writes Amanda Meade. The race is “in every sense a sacred occasion, unique to the Western world”, a commentator in the Australian wrote yesterday. There is no shortage of hyperbole when it comes to the print media’s obsession with the Melbourne Cup and Sydney’s Everest. The horse racing writer Ken Callander says race attendances are down but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/04/a-sure-thing-how-australias-love-of-gambling-keeps-horse-racing-alive">gambling keeps the sport alive</a>. “You’ve only got to look at the money that’s invested in horse races with the corporate bookmakers and you realise that there’s still a great interest,” Callander told Guardian Australia. “If you go into any hotel or club on a Saturday afternoon … you’ll be amazed by the interest of the punters in the TAB areas.”</p>

      <p><b>Australia is failing its birds headed for extinction.</b> A 2018 report by the National Threatened Species Hub indicated that some of the birds in this year’s bird of the year poll <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/how-australia-is-failing-its-birds-headed-for-extinction">may not exist in the wild</a> if the vote were to be run in 20 years’ time.</p>

      <p><b>Lucy Clark has drawn back the curtain on Helen Garner’s mind.</b> “Marry the forbidden, voyeuristic pleasure of reading a person’s diaries with the well-known predilections of a writer like Garner, whose reputation for unflinching self-interrogation precedes her, and the anticipation is almost too much,” she writes for Guardian Australia’s The Unmissables. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/05/helen-garner-yellow-notebook-diaries-self-doubt">Is it safe to go in?</a> Do you really want to see the things you will find here?”</p>
      <p><b>The past year has been the worst for Australian retail since the 1990 recession</b>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/nov/05/all-the-government-spin-in-the-world-doesnt-put-more-money-in-peoples-bank-accounts">writes Greg Jericho</a>: “It is clear the tax cuts and interest rate cuts alone are not enough. The latest retail figures are yet more evidence that if the Morrison government wants to have any economic credibility, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook to be released next month must contain some fiscal stimulus measures. And really, given the state of the economy, the government shouldn’t even wait that long.”</p>

      <p>At a BBC editorial meeting in the 80s, managers discussed how to approach the subject of David Attenborough’s retirement. How would they replace the presenter who had become synonymous with their natural history programs but who was now in his 60s? They never found an answer and Attenborough has proved irreplaceable. On Today in Focus, The Guardian’s Patrick Barkham speaks to David Attenborough before his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/audio/2019/nov/04/david-attenborough-the-making-of-a-british-icon">major new series Seven Worlds, One Planet,</a> and tells Anushka Asthana how he became such a cherished figure.</p>
