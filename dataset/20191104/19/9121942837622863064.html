      <p>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Relatives say at least five U.S. citizens, including four children, who live in the Mexican border state of Sonora have been killed in a shooting attack.</p>
      <p>A relative who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals said he had located the burned-out, bullet-ridden SUV containing the remains of his nephew’s wife and her four children.</p>
      <p>Another relative, Julian LeBaron, said on his Facebook page the dead woman was Rhonita Maria LeBaron.</p>
      <p>The first relative said a convoy of three vehicles had set out Monday from La Mora — a decades-old settlement founded as part of an offshoot of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints — but were attacked by cartel gunmen in what he said may have been a case of mistaken identity.</p>
