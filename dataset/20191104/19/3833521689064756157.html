      <p>TORONTO â€” Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he has offered to host a meeting of the premiers in Toronto after what he calls a divisive federal election.</p>
      <p>Ford says he made the offer to play host for a face-to-face meeting during a conference call with almost all of the premiers on Friday.</p>
      <p>He says the idea came up at a recent meeting with New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs in which they looped in Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe by phone.</p>
      <p>Ford says he fully understands the sentiments of Western alienation and how people in the region feel they are being ignored.</p>
      <p>He also says it's important to listen to Quebec, especially given that the Bloc Quebecois won more seats than any other party in that province this election.</p>
      <p>The Ontario premier has been positioning himself lately as a unifying force in Canada, saying he's never seen the country more divided than after the federal election.</p>
