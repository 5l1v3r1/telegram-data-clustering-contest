        <b>Brescia striker Mario Balotelli has criticised the "small-minded" fans who shouted racist abuse at him on Sunday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Balotelli, 29, kicked the ball into the crowd and threatened to walk off the pitch following abuse <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50281847">during Brescia's 2-1 away loss against Hellas Verona.</a></p>
      <p>"This has nothing to do with football," said the Italian, who played for Manchester City and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"You are getting into social and historical situations that are bigger than you, you small-minded people."</p>
      <p>Balotelli <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/mb459/">posted a message on Instagram</a> in response to Luca Castellini, the head of the Verona ultras, who had said "Balotelli is Italian because he has Italian citizenship, but he can never be completely Italian."</p>
      <p>Castellini added they had recently signed a black player "and the whole of Verona applauded him".</p>
      <p>Balotelli, who has played 36 times for Italy and helped them reach the final of the 2012 European Championships, added: "Wake up you imbeciles, you are shambolic.</p>
      <p>"When Mario scored a goal for Italy, and - I guarantee you - I will do so again, you are fine with that, aren't you?"</p>

      <p>Former Tottenham and Portsmouth midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who also faced racist abuse when playing in Italy, says "nothing has changed" in football's fight against racism.</p>
      <p>Boateng, who now plays for Fiorentina, refused to continue playing a friendly for his AC Milan side against Pro Patria in January 2013 in protest at racist abuse from the terraces, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20903561">with the match then abandoned.</a></p>
      <p>"Six years later nothing has changed but we don't give up," he tweeted. "Let's keep fighting all together against racism. #Notoracism."</p>
      <h3>Watford report racist social media post</h3>
      <p>Premier League side Watford have reported racist abuse directed at defender Christian Kabasele to Hertfordshire Constabulary.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Belgian defender had earlier flagged up the abusive post as part of Watford's #BuzzOff campaign, which calls out discrimination on social media.</p>
      <p>Watford wrote on Twitter that they "have already received a crime reference number from the Hate Crime team" and added they would "report back news of any action against the offender".</p>
