      <h1>Netflix adds a ‘skip Trump joke’ button for Seth Meyers comedy special</h1>

      <p>Netflix is implementing a button that lets you skip Trump jokes, if only as a joke itself.</p>
      <p>The button is a one-off to be used in Seth Meyers‘ upcoming stand-up special, <i>Lobby Baby. </i>That makes the button a joke itself – it’s not something the company plans to roll out to every show or film.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html">CNN Business</a>,</i> Meyers says the button isn’t meant to be taken seriously and doesn’t expect people will actually use it, but thought it would be fun to try since he could<i>. </i>“I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, well, that’s a nice touch, but you’re not going to eat the parsley,” said Meyers.</p>
      <p>That’s fine and all, but I’d be curious to see the data and demographics on who actually <i>does</i> end up using the button. Netflix has recently gotten more experimental with its content, from the choose-your-own-adventure <i>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, </i>to testing a feature that lets you <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apps/2019/10/29/netflix-is-testing-a-feature-that-lets-you-speed-up-boring-episodes/">speed up episodes</a> and another that adds <a href="https://thenextweb.com/insider/2019/06/21/netflixs-project-rumble-pak-tests-vibrating-mobile-movies/">haptic feedback</a> for mobile viewers. I wouldn’t be surprised to see more interactive features show up in future Netflix episodes.</p>
