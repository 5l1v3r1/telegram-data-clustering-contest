      <p>A 17-year-old youth accused of murdering a stabbing victim has been remanded in custody until later this week.</p>
      <p>The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, is charged with murdering Cain Jackson in Rugby, Warwickshire, on Thursday October 31, a court spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Mr Jackson, 24, was pronounced dead after emergency crews were called to Meadow Road shortly after 6pm.</p>
      <p>His alleged killer appeared before a magistrate at Warwickshire Justice Centre in Leamington Spa on Monday, and was ordered to reappear for a preliminary hearing before a Crown Court judge on Wednesday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, police investigating the death have issued a further appeal about an altercation believed to have taken place in the Parkfield Road area at about 5.10pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It is also believed "trick-or-treaters" may have seen an incident on Meadow Road, and officers are keen to speak to them as potential witnesses.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Officers have also asked anyone who may have found an iPhone 7 Plus in a grey case in the Parkfield Road area to come forward.</p>
