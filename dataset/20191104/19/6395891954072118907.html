      <p><b>HOPEDALE, Mass.</b> - After being diagnosed with kidney failure, a 10-year-old Hopedale boy and his family have been going through a difficult time. But on Monday, they were in for a super surprise.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Corapi's entire school at Memorial Elementary banned together to give him a superhero's welcome.</p>
      <p>Corapi walked in to school on Monday to find more than 600 students and teachers lining the hallways, cheering and giving him high-fives as he passed by on superhero day.</p>
      <p>Corapi said it was "amazing" because "everyone was there."</p>
      <p>He was only 1 year old when he had to have a kidney removed because it wasn't functioning. His other kidney was working, until recently.</p>
      <p>Now, he needs a new kidney.</p>
      <p>While doctors search for a donor, Corapi has been going to Boston Children's Hospital three times a week for dialysis.</p>
      <p>"He misses a lot," said his mom Kim Corapi. "He misses a lot of school and activities and just childhood things. So, we're just waiting. Waiting for a kidney."</p>
      <p>Despite what he's enduring, his family said they are amazed by his upbeat attitude.</p>
      <p>"It's incredible. With everything he's had to go through. Even when he's sitting in dialysis, he's like I love it here, you know he's always positive."</p>
      <p>His family also said that the support has been positively overwhelming.</p>
      <p>"They're so wonderful here," Kim said. "It's like another family. They're very supportive and they love him probably just as much as we do."</p>
      <p>Nicholas' father Joe Corapi <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/super-nicholas-fund-battling-kidney-failure">created a GoFundMe page</a>, which has raised more than $10,000 of its $20,000 goal. Nicholas also has a <a href="https://nicholascorapi.com/">website</a>.</p>
