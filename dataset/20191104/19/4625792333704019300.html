      <p>Prince Charles has reportedly become caught up in a $136 million art scandal that ended with the fraudulent paintings being removed from a property linked to the prince.</p>
      <p>The paintings — thought to have been done by artists like Monet, Picasso, and Dali — were being displayed at the Dumfries House, where the Prince’s Foundation is based, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/royal-family/prince-charles-is-hit-by-a-major-counterfeit-art-scandal-as-he-sends-back-%C2%A3105m-monet-picasso-and-dali-paintings-lent-by-bankrupt-businessman-james-stunt-after-an-american-forger-claimed-he-painted-them/ar-AAJKqo9?li=BBoPRmx">according</a> to the Daily Mail. The combined works were valued at around $136 million, with one supposed Monet worth almost $65 million.</p>
      <p>The works were on loan to the house from bankrupt billionaire James Stunt, who used to be married to Formula 1 heiress Petra Ecclestone.</p>
      <p>This week American art forger Tony Tetro said that he painted the pictures that Stunt loaned to the foundation.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want any part of this. It has got to be stopped now rather than later. I'm told these pictures went to Dumfries House. There is no question about it: James knew they were mine,” Tetro said.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Prince’s Foundation confirmed that three paintings were removed from public display at the Dumfries House.</p>
      <p>“It is extremely regrettable that the authenticity of these particular paintings, which are no longer on display, now appears to be in doubt,” he said.</p>
