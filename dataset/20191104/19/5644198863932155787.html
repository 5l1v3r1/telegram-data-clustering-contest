      <p>LONDON:Â Jamie Vardy is playing with a smile on his face after "little adjustments" helped him rocket to the top of the Premier League goalscoring charts, according to Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old former England marksman took his tally to 10 league goals with the Foxes' second goal in their 2-0 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday which took them back into third place in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Leicester are ahead of Chelsea on goal difference and six points clear of fifth-placed Arsenal, whom they host next weekend, in the early battle for a place in next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>Vardy's goal was an ideal response to taunts from the Palace fans over his wife Rebekah's public falling-out with former friend Coleen Rooney, wife of former England captain Wayne.</p>
      <p>"Jamie is so thick-skinned and is just one of those boys - that makes him better," said Rodgers.</p>
      <p>"He knows he has taken a wee bit of stick over a couple of games but he is very concentrated on his game and very focused in the game."</p>
      <p>Rodgers, who left Celtic after a successful spell to take over at Leicester after Claude Puel was sacked last season, said Vardy's form had improved due to minor changes.</p>
      <p>"Firstly from a defensive perspective he is not having to press the whole back four," said Rodgers.</p>
      <p>"He is a guy who will run all day for you. Now it is a lot more synchronised in how we want him to press and he is doing short bursts of pressing, which he is very good at.</p>
      <p>"He is so clever at setting traps to press so he is a real focal point in that aspect.</p>
      <p>"He is a really top striker at this level and we have done some little adjustments which have helped him, but he is playing with a smile and really enjoying his football and that is always important as a player."</p>
