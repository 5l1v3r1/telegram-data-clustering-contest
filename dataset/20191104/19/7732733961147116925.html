      <h2>Differentiating Facebook the company from the Facebook app</h2>

      <h4>What just happened? Facebook is in the middle of an identity crisis. The company started as a social media platform but over the years through a combination of both product evolution and various acquisitions, it has become much more. On Monday, Facebook took a major step in helping to clarify its brand with the introduction of a new company logo.</h4>
      <p>As Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lucio <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/11/introducing-our-new-company-brand/">highlights</a>, Facebook will use the new branding to help distinguish Facebook the company from the Facebook app.</p>
      <p>It’ll also use the new branding to help better communicate its ownership in other ventures it operates like WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Portal.</p>

      <p>Facebook described the task of designing its new company branding as a collaborative effort based on three foundational design behaviors: clarify, empathy and creating space. It uses custom typography, rounded corners, capitalization and open tracking to “create visual distinction between the company and the app.”</p>
      <p>From the perspective of an ordinary user that isn’t into typography, it’s little more than the word “Facebook” written in a plain, all caps font that matches the color of its individual brands. It’s nothing if underwhelming but that’s the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82021-yahoo-updates-logo-second-time-25-years.html">design direction</a> that <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/74552-best-buy-refreshes-logo-first-time-nearly-three.html">major companies</a> are taking these days.</p>
      <p>For those that are into typography, Facebook has a <a href="https://facebook.design/companybrand">full blog post</a> on the subject that may be of interest.</p>
      <p>Facebook has been taking a more <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81278-facebook-wants-you-know-owns-instagram-whatsapp-new.html">proactive approach</a> to letting people know which companies and products it owns. You’ll now find company endorsements in many of the products Facebook owns like Oculus and Workplace.</p>
      <p>The new company branding will be rolling out in products and marketing materials over the coming weeks.</p>
