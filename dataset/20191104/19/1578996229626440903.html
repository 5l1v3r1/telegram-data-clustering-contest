      <p>Kendall Jenner's 24th birthday celebrations started Halloween night with <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29664103/kendall-jenner-halloween-party-celeb-costumes/">a big costume party</a> complete with a photo booth and A-list guest list. But on her actual birthday yesterday, Jenner did something special with a smaller group of friends and family: She went driving on a race track. Big sister Kim Kardashian shared footage on her Twitter.</p>
      <p>"For @kendalljenner birthday yesterday went to the race track!" Kardashian wrote, sharing a photo and video in two tweets.</p>

      <p>Jenner got public Instagram birthday tributes from her two of her four sisters yesterday. Older sister Khlo√© Kardashian wrote, "It‚Äôs your birthday boo!! I pray everyone is singing Happy birthday @kendalljenner!! Kendall you are one of the most loyal rare gentle souls I‚Äôve ever known! Since the day that you were born, you have made all of my days brighter! I am so incredibly honored that I was chosen to be your sister but it‚Äôs an even bigger honor that we have chosen to be one another‚Äôs best friends. I am so lucky to have someone as selfless and loving as you by my side. I love you, I respect you, I value everything that you are. I pray today, that you are showered with love. That every wish you‚Äôve ever had comes true! I love you so much. As lame as this sounds I feel like I love my siblings more and more every day. Happy birthday Kenny!! We celebrate you always sister üíã"</p>

      <p>Jenner's mother Kris Jenner had the most adoring post though, as mothers often do: "Happy birthday to my beautiful angel girl @kendalljenner!!! You light up every room you walk into and everyone you meet and you light up my life every single day. You are so beautiful inside and out and I‚Äôm so proud of you Kenny!! You are the most amazing daughter, sister, friend, and I love you more than you can ever imagine. Have the best day, birthday girl!! You are my heart, ‚ù§Ô∏è Mommy #HappyBirthdayKendall üéÇ"</p>
