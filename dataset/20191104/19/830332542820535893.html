      <p>Wisconsin wildlife officials say hunters kill slightly fewer bears in 2019 than last year.</p>
      <p>The Department of Natural Resources said Monday that preliminary data shows hunters took 3,648 bears. That's down slightly from 3,680 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Kills increased by 36% across the southern two-thirds of the state over 2018. Harvest in the north-central region was up 20%.</p>
      <p>More than 120,000 hunters applied for either a bear permit or a preference point for the 2019 season.</p>
