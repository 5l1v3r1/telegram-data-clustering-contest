He worked for Dormans from 1958 until retiring as a production supervisor in 1994. Roger then worked seasonal at Windy Acres for another 12 years. He was a member of St. Victor Catholic Church and the Monroe Moose Lodge #754. Roger loved being outside working in his yard, but one of his main passions was hunting.
