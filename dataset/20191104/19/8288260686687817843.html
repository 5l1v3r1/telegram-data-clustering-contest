      <p>A 37-year-old man has denied attempting to murder a police officer who suffered a fractured skull when he was hit by a car which failed to stop.</p>
      <p>Tekle Lennox also denied a charge alleging that he caused grievous bodily harm to Police Constable Chris Burnham with intent to resist arrest in the Radford area of Coventry.</p>
      <p>Lennox, of no fixed address, will face trial on March 2 next year after being remanded in custody on Monday following a brief hearing at Warwick Crown Court in Leamington Spa.</p>
      <p>The defendant, who admitted a charge of driving while disqualified, appeared in court via a prison videolink.</p>
      <p>The attempted murder and grievous bodily harm charges relate to an incident in which Pc Burnham was struck by a vehicle on September 25 this year.</p>
