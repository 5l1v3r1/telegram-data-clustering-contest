      <h1>Microsoft tried a 4-day work week in Japan. Productivity jumped 40 per cent</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:02:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Toh and Yoko Wakatsuki, CNN</a></address>
      <p>A growing number of smaller companies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/success/four-day-work-week/index.html">are adopting a four-day workweek. </a>Now the results of a recent trial at Microsoft suggest it could work even for the biggest businesses.</p>
      <p>The company introduced a program this summer in Japan called the "Work Life Choice Challenge," which shut down its offices every Friday in August and gave all employees an extra day off each week.</p>
      <p>The results were promising: While the amount of time spent at work was cut dramatically, productivity — measured by sales per employee — went up by almost 40%<b> </b>compared to the same period the previous year, the company said in a<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ja-jp/2019/10/31/191031-published-the-results-of-measuring-the-effectiveness-of-our-work-life-choice-challenge-summer-2019/"> statemen</a>t last week.</p>
      <p>In addition to reducing working hours, managers urged staff to cut down on the time they spent in meetings and responding to emails.</p>
      <p>They suggested that meetings should last no longer than 30 minutes. Employees were also encouraged to cut down on meetings altogether by using an online messaging app (Microsoft's, of course).</p>
      <p>The effects were widespread. More than 90% of Microsoft's 2,280 employees in Japan later said they were impacted by the new measures, according to the company.</p>
      <p>By shutting down earlier each week, the company was also able to save on other resources, such as electricity.</p>
      <p>The initiative is timely. Japan has long grappled with a grim — and in some cases, fatal — <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/11/30/news/economy/japan-workers-overwork-death/index.html">culture of overwork</a>. The problem is so severe, the country has even coined a term for it: <i>karoshi </i>means death by overwork from stress-induced illnesses or severe depression.</p>
      <p>The issue attracted<b> </b>international attention in 2015, when an <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/12/29/news/ceo-resign-employee-suicide-dentsu/index.html">employee at Japanese advertising giant Dentsu</a> died by suicide on Christmas Day. Tokyo officials later said that the staffer had worked excessive amounts of overtime.</p>
      <p>Two years later, a<a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/news/japan-work-overwork-woman-dies-karoshi/index.html"> reporter at a Japanese broadcaster died</a> after working punishing long hours. <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/05/news/japan-work-overwork-woman-dies-karoshi/index.html">Her employer said</a> she had clocked in 159 hours of overtime the month before her death.</p>
      <p>That has led businesses to start searching for solutions. Some companies have begun offering employees more flexibility, and the government <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/news/companies/dentsu-japan-overtime/index.html">has launched a campaign</a> called "Premium Friday," which encourages workers to leave early every last Friday of the month.</p>
      <p>Microsoft, for its part, says it will conduct another experiment in Japan later this year. It plans to ask employees to come up with new measures to improve work-life balance and efficiency, and will also ask other companies to join the initiative.</p>
