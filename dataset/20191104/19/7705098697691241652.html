      <h1>Ming-Na Wen’s Assassin Revealed In The Mandalorian’s New Trailer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T19:28:50+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a> has appeared, and with it, there’s confirmation of the character <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/agents-of-shield"><b>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</b></a> star Ming-Na Wen will play in the series. In the trailer, there’s a closer look at Fennec Shand, an assassin who comes across Pedro Pascal’s Mandalorian. Their conversation isn’t followed in full, but she does have a memorable line: “Your name will be legendary.”</p>
      <p>Wen explained the origins of the character while speaking to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/ming-na-wen-the-mandalorian-star-wars-fennec-shand">Vanity Fair</a>. </p>
      <p>“We got our inspiration from the name. The idea of a fennec fox came to mind. She’s tricky, and yet she’s able to maneuver and survive, and be stealthy — so very graceful and agile. I just love that whole image with the name…Thinking that she’s a mercenary, [her loyalty] can go either way. I think it remains to be seen…She is definitely someone who’s loyal to herself.”</p>
