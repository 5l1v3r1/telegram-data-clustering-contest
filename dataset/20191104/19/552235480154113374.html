      <p>A canny mum has discovered a money saving hack after sneaking cheaper brand condiments past her unsuspecting family.</p>
      <p>Michele Black, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> decided to switch Heinz Tomato Ketchup for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/shopping">cheaper Aldi version</a> in a bid to pay less for sauces.</p>
      <p>Aldi's Bramwells offering costs only 45p for 560g, whilst Heinz's 650g option costs around £2. </p>

      <p>"The husband and son both used it and as they take on EVERYTHING, near enough,' Michele wrote in a post which gathered more than 500 likes. </p>
      <p>"Not one has mentioned it tasting different, and although I don't take it unless on sausages, neither can I.</p>
