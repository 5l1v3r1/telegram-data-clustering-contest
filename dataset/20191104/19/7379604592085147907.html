        <b>A THRIFTY mum has saved <i>thousands </i>on renovations to her former council house - by bagging freebies online.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rebecca Compton, 27, uses websites like Freegle, Freecycle, Freelywheely and Facebook Marketplace to update her home - with brand new carpets, wallpaper and home decor.</p>

      <p>The mum-of-two rents her home in Walsall, Birmingham, but says her landlord is "really understanding" about her desire to update the property.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mum-two-spills-beans-how-20789635">Rebecca told the Mirror</a>: "At the time of moving in, I got a few bits from friends and family, we bought a new bed and sofa – but we had no actual flooring.</p>
      <p>"On our shoe-string budget, we had to think outside of the box."</p>
      <p>Rebecca was already pregnant when she moved in with her partner five years ago and is now a full-time mum to two boys.</p>

      <p>She added: "Once you sign up to the freebie websites, they’ll start sending you alerts every morning. Go on there each day to see what’s been listed – everything is free."</p>
      <p>If you're after something specific, Rebecca recommends putting a request on the sites, as others are often keen to get rid of bulky items like wardrobes.</p>
      <p>Saving money isn't the only benefit, it's greener to pick up unwanted furniture second-hand too.</p>
      <p>Rebecca believes you can get absolutely everything you need for free, as long as you're prepared to wait.</p>
      <p>She recommends using samples from hardware shops like B&amp;Q for upcycling tables, beds and even her mantlepiece - which she also got for free.</p>

      <p>Thrifty Rebecca transformed her son's bedroom into a superhero paradise for just £60 and her bathroom for £50 (with £40 of that being spent on flooring).</p>
      <p>She also transformed her kitchen worktops and cupboards for just £25, and taught herself how to change carpets after bagging yet another freebie - saving £200 on the fitting alone.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, we reported on a mum who created <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10265432/mum-incredible-teepee-ebay-homemade/">an incredible hang-out space for her son using a £24 teepee from eBay</a> - pimped with lights, pom poms and homemade quilt.</p>
