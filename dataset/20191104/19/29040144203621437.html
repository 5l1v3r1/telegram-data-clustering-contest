      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>NBA 2K Playgrounds is a two-on-two arcade-style basketball game licensed by the NBA.</li>
        <li>A version for Android is currently being beta-tested in select regions.</li>
        <li>It will be a free-to-play title with a reliance on unlocking player packs and in-app purchases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>NBA 2K Playgrounds is a two-on-two arcade-style basketball game that first landed on consoles back in 2017. Now, it would seem 2K is keen on bringing the franchise to mobile as a free-to-play title, with beta testing currently underway in select regions.</p>

      <p>2K Playgrounds features exaggerated character models and simplified gameplay that should translate well to mobile. I mean, this is a tried and tested format that we've seen before from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eamobile.nbajam_na_w">NBA Jam</a>. It's nice to see more sports arcade games hitting the Google Play Store, but I am discouraged by the free-to-play mechanics that 2K is building this game around.</p>
      <p>Unlike NBA Jam, which gives you a full roster of NBA talent to choose from, NBA 2K Playgrounds has you unlocking and upgrading your favorite players using a random card pack system. That basically means you're going to need to grind away for hours or spend real money to buy card packs outright for a <i>chance</i> at unlocking your favorite NBA superstars.</p>
      <p>The Google Play listing shows that the game is currently being beta-tested in select regions such as the Philippines. There's no word when the game will be ready for an official release.</p>
