      <p>According to media reports both parties claim the trigger for the violence was a dispute over a lawyer parking his car near the court’s lock-up area. Police said the lawyer was asked not to park there because it would obstruct the movement of jail vans. It led to a heated argument that turned into a scuffle and soon erupted into violence.</p>
