        <b>Leeds United goalkeeper Kiko Casilla has denied a Football Association charge of racially abusing Charlton Athletic forward Jonathan Leko.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49895031">The FA began an investigation</a> into the incident, which occurred during the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49778241">Addicks' 1-0 home win,</a> last month.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3 and it is alleged his words "made reference to race and/or colour and/or ethnic origin".</p>
      <p>Casilla, 33, has until 12 November to provide a response.</p>
      <p>Leeds <a href="https://www.leedsunited.com/news/team-news/25747/club-statement-kiko-casilla">said in a statement:</a> "Kiko strenuously denies the allegation and has proactively worked with the FA during their investigation to date.</p>
      <p>"The next step of this process will be a personal hearing, in the meantime Kiko will remain available for selection."</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid goalkeeper Casilla joined Leeds in January 2019 and has been an ever-present for the Championship club this season.</p>
      <p>Under rules introduced for the 2019-20 season, the minimum suspension for a player found guilty of an aggravated breach of the FA's discrimination rules will be six matches, which can be increased depending on any additional aggravating factors.</p>
