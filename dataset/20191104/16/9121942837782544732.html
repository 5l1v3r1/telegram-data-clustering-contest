      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A fired Hewlett-Packard Enterprise worker who shut down Oregon’s Medicaid system computers as retaliation for losing his job was sentenced to a year of home detention.</p>
      <p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reports 62-year-old Hossein Heydari also was sentenced Monday to 500-plus hours of community service and four years of federal probation.</p>
      <p>Heydari apologized and said his actions resulted from an “irrational outburst.” He pleaded guilty earlier to computer fraud.</p>
      <p>Heydari, of Maryland, had worked for Hewlett-Packard for 16 years and was responsible for providing technical support for Oregon’s Medicaid Management Information System.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 14, 2016, Hewlett-Packard gave Heydari notice that he would be laid off.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say on Halloween 2016, Heydari intentionally shut down the Oregon Health Authority’s Medicaid computers for a day.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the Oregon Health Authority wasn’t able to process services that day for 295 Medicaid recipients.</p>
