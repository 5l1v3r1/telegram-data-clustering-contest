      <h1>Ann Budge responds to Roy Keane and David Moyes Hearts talk as she allays Craig Levein fears</h1>
      <h2>The Jambos owner addressed the media today as she mapped out her strategy to find her next manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:36:51+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Hearts supremo <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> has confirmed that Austin MacPhee is a candidate to become the club's next permanent manager.</p>
      <p>Budge also assured fans that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> will not be involved in picking his successor.</p>
      <p>The manager was fired last week and stood down as director of football, but he remains on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> board until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-moyes">David Moyes</a> have been linked but insists she isn't in the business of speculation .</p>

      <p>She said: "They're being linked by you guys, they're not being linked by me!</p>
      <p>"I don't see why not, to be honest, look at some of the other managers we have in Scotland at the moment.</p>
      <p>"A few years ago we would have been questioning whether that was possible and Hearts is no different.</p>
      <p>"We have to compete with the top clubs in Scotland and to do that I want to ensure that we get a very experience and high-profile manager.</p>
      <p>"Austin MacPhee is definitely a contender, he's the interim manager at the minute, he's done so before and he's done very well when he did it before.</p>

      <p>"Austin's got a lot of experience.</p>
      <p>"Experience of managing the first team? No, but he's still got a lot of experience.</p>
      <p>"I'm not ruling Austin out, he knows what he's got to do to strengthen his case and he'll be working hard to do that."</p>
      <p>That led fans to fear that he'd have a role in picking the next manager, having been in charge of football operations, but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Budge</a> insisted that will not be the case.</p>
      <p>She said: "I've no interest in appointing or replacing a director of football.</p>
      <p>"We'll appoint a different structure which is appropriate for today. We want to get a new manager in place as quickly as possible, but I'll take as long as it takes to find the right person.</p>

      <p>"I'm in no hurry, it's not that we have someone in our sights. I want to go through the process rigorously and thoroughly and explore a lot of avenues so the net will be cast quite wide.</p>
      <p>"One thing I'm convinced of is that running the whole football operation is too big for one person for a club of this size and the size we want to be, so it's important that we have a manager who has the time to focus on the first team and really not worry about the other things.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we have our own nominations group, a subset of the board, but we'll be taking advice from football experts, whether that's a formal appointment of a consultant or whether it's leveraging contacts we now have.</p>
      <p>"One thing I will make clear is that Craig is not part of that process, it won't be Craig who is providing the football expertise.</p>
      <p>"But I've had a number of offers to help and we're also looking at consultancy.</p>
      <p>"The sporting director, to me, is a crucial appointment. And before anyone asks, we won't be appointing Craig as sporting director.</p>
      <p>"But any manager who comes in has to come in knowing that there will be a sporting director."</p>
