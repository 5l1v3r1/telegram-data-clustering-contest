      <h1>Jones is the popular option to stay in charge until 2023</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:49:05+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>There has been a lot of talk regarding <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> head coach <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/it-makes-sense-doesnt-it-rfu-chief-admits-england-keen-on-eddie-jones-beyond-2021">Eddie Jones’ contract</a> in the past few days, as discussions about his future with the Rugby Football Union are yet to be made. </p>
      <p>Jones is fresh from leading England to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> final, where they were beaten by the Springboks 32-12. He is contracted with the RFU until 2021, but it is unclear what the future holds for him, particularly with the risk of knee-jerk reactions after such a loss. </p>
      <p>With his native <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> also without a coach following the resignation of Michael Cheika, Jones will be in high-demand. There is also the question of whether he will want to rebuild a team after coming agonisingly close to winning, particularly as this was his second final that he has lost in his career (the first with Australia in 2003). </p>

      <p>However, the Australian is still a hugely popular figure amongst England fans, the majority of whom want to see him extend his contract through to the 2023 RWC in France. While all involved with England rugby will still be raw after the loss, a silver medal is an accomplishment that merits another bite of the cherry in four years. </p>
      <p>Many fans on social media are keen to point out where Jones has taken England in four years, as he took over in 2015 following their abject performance in the RWC, where they became the first host nation to fail to make it out of their pool. </p>
      <p>Jones also fielded the youngest ever side in a RWC final, and with a host of promising players at his disposal, he must be aware of the potential of this England side, and must even be curious as to how far they can go. </p>
      <p>While this was not the result that any England fan would have wanted, the performance against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> in the semi-final exhibited England at their best under Jones, and why so many are keen for him to say.</p>
      <p>This is what has been said: </p>

      <p>From the RFU’s perspective, history can be the greatest teacher in this circumstance, as they chose to keep Sir Clive Woodward on board after they crashed out of the 1999 RWC in the quarter-final, and he guided them to victory four years later. </p>
      <p>Jones is not blameless following England’s loss on Saturday, but if the RFU were willing to keep Woodward on, they can surely afford the same generosity to him. Furthermore, with the slightly suspect track record of appointing new coaches that the RFU has, the public seem to trust Jones as England rebuild for 2023.</p>
