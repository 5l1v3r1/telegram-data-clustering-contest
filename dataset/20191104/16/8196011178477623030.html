      <p>The Government's use of an “undemocratic veto” in Dáil Eireann has seen more than 50 Opposition bills blocked, despite having majority support in the chamber.</p>
      <p>An Opposition bill, proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit, seeks to unblock that veto over the so-called 'money message' which requires Government approval for a bill to proceed.</p>
      <p>The bill seeks to amend the current Dáil rules to remove the Government's ability to block a bill on money grounds on the basis of potential “incidental expenses and indirect cost” implications.</p>
      <p>While the money message provision is written into the Constitution, those proposing the bill are arguing that Dáil rules go further than that and as a result, many bills are being blocked on frivolous grounds.</p>
      <p>The Constitution stops opposition members from progressing bills that would involve the appropriation of public money.</p>
      <p>“The Dail's Standing Orders go further than what's written in the Constitution.</p>
      <p>"So the standing orders stop opposition bills going forward where they appropriate revenue, as well as a number of incidental administrative expenses.</p>
      <p>"The government have fashioned themselves a near-effective veto on the capacity of the Dáil to pass legislation,” said researcher Conor O'Neill at a press conference in Dublin.</p>
      <p>“We have seen a situation where the government or be able to see the Dáil and vote in an overwhelming majority in favour of a bill, and then veto it on very very vague, very undefined cost grounds,” said TD Richard Boyd Barrett.</p>
      <p>"The use and abuse of the money message by the government amounts to an outrageous sabotage of democracy.</p>
      <p>"The government’s flagrant abuse of the money message to block hills which have been democratically passed by a majority in the Dáil is an equally scandalous instance of the government itself showing complete contempt for the constitution and for democracy,” he said.</p>
