      <h1>Black September's face of terror before slaughter of innocent Olympic athletes</h1>
      <h2>The Munich Olympic Games should have been a celebration of human achievement but ended with 11 Israeli athletes massacred at the hands of Palestinian terrorists</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:49:40+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>It should have been a celebration of human achievement, a glorious coming together of athletes and sports men and women.</p>
      <p>The Munich Olympic Games in 1972 were designed to show a new Germany, relaxed, joyful and open to the world.</p>
      <p>In the words of West Germany's president at the time, Gustav Heinemann the Games would be "to overcome hatred and pave the way for reconciliation".</p>
      <p>It had been hoped it would erase the memory of the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, organised by Hitler.</p>
      <p>Instead in turned into a blood bath after one of the infamous terror attacks in history.</p>

      <p>One photo of a balaclava-clad terrorist became the face of the horror to follow, examined in History's Photos That Changed The World.</p>
      <p>For almost two weeks the Games passed peacefully.</p>
      <p>Police officers and security, deliberately dressed in light blue to promote the party atmosphere, were unaware of a deadly plot at the heart of the Games.</p>
      <p>Broadcaster Barry Davies, who was there to cover the Olympics, said: "Everyone who was there just wanted to help, it was a lovely atmosphere."</p>
      <p>But at 4.30am on September 5, the peace of the Olympics was shattered when eight members of the Black September faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, scaled a fence and made their way into the athletes' village.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Wearing tracksuits, they were carrying bags loaded with assault rifles, pistols and grenades.</p>
      <p>Using stolen keys, they broke into two apartments being used by the Israeli team .</p>
      <p>Heroically, wrestling referee Yossef Gutfreund, heard the break-in and threw his weight against the door, allowing his room-mate to flee.</p>
      <p>Wrestling coach, Moshe Weinberg, tried to fight the intruders but was shot through the cheek and then dragged through the apartment.</p>
      <p>He tried to attack the gunmen, allowing one of his wrestlers the chance to escape, but was then shot dead.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Yossef Romano, a weight lifter, also attacked and hurt one of the terrorists but was shot and killed.</p>
      <p>The gunmen now had nine hostages and started to make their demands.</p>
      <p>They wanted to release of 234 people, jailed in Israel, and to show their deadly intentions, hurled Weinberg's body out of the front door of the apartment.</p>
      <p>Israel instantly insisted it would never negotiate with terrorists but the German authorities entered into talks with the gunmen.</p>
      <p>Professor Kay Schuler said: "They were offered political asylum and a lot of money but the German government misread the intentions of the Palestinians.</p>

        <figcaption>Images of what was happening were beamed across the world and also to the terrorists themselves (Image: AP)</figcaption>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"These were young men who saw themselvesas soldiers and they were willing to die for their cause."</p>
      <p>The eyes of the media, which had previously been trained on the Olympic Games, now recorded the horror that was unfolding in the Atheletes' Village.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, oblivious to what was going on at the heart of the Games, the sports carried on as normal while pressure mounted for Germany to suspend the competition.</p>
      <p>Twelve hours after the first athlete had been murdered, organisers finally bowed to international pressure and suspended the Games.</p>
      <p>But the cameras were still watching and as German troops prepared to storm the building at 4.30pm.</p>

        <figcaption>There were protests calling for the Games to be suspended (Image: AP)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They swarmed onto the roof and the images were being beamed around the world.</p>
      <p>However, they were also being shown inside the apartment occupied by the hostage takers.</p>
      <p>Barry Davies said: "It empowered the terrorists inside the building because they could see exactly what was going on."</p>
      <p>Chilling footage and images show one of the gunmen peer from a balcony door.</p>
      <p>Wearing a balaclava and unrecognisable, this horror mask became the face of the Games.</p>
      <p>Prof Schuler said: "It appears like a skull and reminds the worldof the disruption of what was supposed to be a peaceful and joyful Games."</p>
      <p>The rescue operation had to be abandoned when the terrorists, who could see the police coming, warned authorities they would kill all the hostages.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They then issued a new demand - safe transport to Cairo.</p>
      <p>After speaking to one of the hostages to determine if they were still alive, police were told there were four or five terrorists - a number theny accepted without question which would prove a deadly mistake.</p>
      <p>Germany pretended to agree to the latest demand and provided two military helicopters to transport the gunmen and their hostages to a nearby airbase for their flight.</p>
      <p>The group had to walk 200 metres underground to reach the helicopters and snipers lay in wait to take down the gunmen.</p>
      <p>But one of the snipers was spotted by the terrorists and the operation had to be abandoned.</p>
      <p>A back up plan, using armed officers at the airport was then set in motion.</p>

      <p>The helicopter landed and two of the gunmen walked across the runway to inspect the plane.</p>
      <p>As they made their way back to the helicopter, the five German police opened fire but instead of the five terrorists they were expecting, there were eight.</p>
      <p>It was chaos and 30 minutes into the gun battle the helicopter pilots were shot and their attacker hurled a grenade into the cockpit.</p>
      <p>It incinerated the helicopter and all those on board.</p>
      <p>Just three of the terrorists were still alive and were taken into custody.</p>
      <p>The five killed in the gun battle and explosion were flown back to Libya, where they were given a heroes welcome.</p>

      <p>While the Games was suspended for five days a huge memorial was held in the Olympic stadium for the 11 Israeli athletes who had been murdered.</p>
      <p>Israel's response to the attack was immediate and brutal with bombings and anyone who was suspected of being involved was hunted down.</p>
      <p>Less than two months after the massacre, Black September terrorists hijacked a Lufthansa passenger plane and threatened to blow it up unless the three surviving gunmen were released.</p>
      <p>Their demands were agreed to and all the passengers were freed.</p>
      <p>The remaining three terrorists were welcomed home as heroes and paraded in front of the world at a press conference.</p>
      <p>Since then, it is believed Israel's Wrath of God killed two of them while the third has been in hiding ever since.</p>
      <p>Barry Davies said: "Life has to go on but no one who was at Munich will ever forget what happened."</p>
