      <p>The news was announced by the group on their Instagram page today (October 25). Speaking about the accolade, frontman Yannis Philippakis said: “Hey everyone thanks so much for buying the record this week, we finally got our number 1 this week – long awaited, long deserved!” he laughed.</p>
      <p>He went on: “Thanks so much for all the support over the years and we hope you love the record as much as we do.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/foals-everything-not-saved-will-lost-part-2-review">In a five star review of their latest album ‘Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost: Part 2’</a>, <i>NME’s</i> Andrew Trendell wrote: “Not only a fittingly accomplished conclusion to their most adventurous and masterful project to date, ‘Part 2’ is also a thoroughbred belter of a record and utterly complete album in its own right.</p>
      <p>“Add it all up and the ‘Everything Not Lost’ era is testament to all that Foals are capable of – in sound, in scope and in greatness.”</p>
