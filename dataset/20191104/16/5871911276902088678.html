        <i>A quick snapshot at the weekend that was.</i>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Biggest Upset:</b> Darren Till +175 over Kelvin Gastelum</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Notable New Champions:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Invicta Fighting Championship Strawweight Champion:</b> Kanako Murata</li>
        <li><b>WBO World Female Junior Welterweight Champion:</b> Katie Taylor</li>
        <li><b>WBO World Light Heavyweight Champion:</b> Saul Alvarez</li>
        <li><b>WBC Silver Lightweight Champion:</b> Ryan Garcia</li>
        <li><b>Interim WBA World Female Flyweight Champion:</b> Seniesa Estrada</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>A Few Storylines Going Forward:</b>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>BMFASAP:</b> It wasn’t an ideal outcome to <b>Jorge Masvidal</b> and Nate Diaz, and I’ve seen cuts so deep on fighters that I could see their thoughts, that were allowed to keep fighting. Give Masvidal credit, though, those cuts didn’t open from him wishing really hard, he was absolutely peppering Nate up, and I had it a very clear 30-27 for Masvidal after that third, so Nate would have needed a finish against a guy that was rocking him for fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, they both seem to want to run it back as soon as humanly possible, so I’m looking forward to it, but a fair win to Jorge, the new BMF champ.</li>
        <li><b>Cinnamon! Cinnamon! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNcrrwQwskw">Again and again!</a>:</b> <b>Saul Alvarez</b>, better known to you as Canelo (spanish for cinnamon), is now a three-weight class world champion. Now what? Sergey Kovalev was much more game than I thought he would be, starting very strong, and was right there on the cards for most people until the eleventh-round, where Canelo left him a mess in the ropes. Is the siren song of a third Golovkin fight too much to ignore? Or maybe winning a true world title at super middleweight? Or maybe craving competition he finds his way to Artur Beterbiev? It’ll be a damned interesting matchup for sure, even if he just takes a breather fight.</li>
        <li><b>Johnny Walker Dead:</b> Well, all the dancing, theatrics, and cartwheels had to come to an end sometime, for one <b>Johnny Walker</b>. Some of us thought it was going to be against Jon Jones, but Corey Anderson didn’t let that train get to that station, then very audibly let Walker <a href="https://twitter.com/BroBible/status/1190809108733218818">know</a> about it.</li>
