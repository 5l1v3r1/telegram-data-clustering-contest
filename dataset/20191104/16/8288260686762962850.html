      <h1>Manager reveals why Wolves star Adama Traore phoned him</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers latest | Adama Traore has been in stunning form for Wolves this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:15:45+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Tony Pulis has revealed how he kick-started Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Adama Traore’s career.</p>
      <p>Traore, 23, struggled to make an impact in his first two seasons in English football and couldn’t get a game under Garry Monk prior to Pulis’ appointment as Middlesbrough manager in 2017.</p>
      <p>With a little help from Pulis - who has since dubbed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/adama-traore">Traore</a> his ‘best buddy’ - the rapid flanker ripped the Championship apart during the second half of 2017/18.</p>

      <p>A similar pattern has emerged following his £18million transfer to Wolves as Traore largely watched on from the bench during his first season under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> before exploding into life this term.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard already has two goals and six assists to his name this season and has proved himself to be competent in three positions within Nuno’s system.</p>
      <p>And Pulis has shed some light on his relationship with Traore who he says still calls him to ask for his opinion.</p>

      <p>"I used to have him in my room to talk to him at times because I felt he needed it," Pulis said.</p>
      <p>"When I went to Middlesbrough this kid wasn't being played. He had exceptional talent, I used to bring him in, sit him down, he'd make me a green tea, and we'd just talk about his game.</p>
      <p>"Even today not so long ago he called me to see how I am and asked whether I'd watched one of his games. You make that connection.</p>
      <p>"With others you find they're not your type and you won't spend as much time with them, but they're still important to you so you treat them well."</p>
