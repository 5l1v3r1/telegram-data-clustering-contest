      <p>Microsoft Office may not be the de facto document creation suite it was once seen as, but tens of millions of people still use the suite of apps. Today, a new Office app is rolling out for Android (and iOS). Previously, Microsoft has maintained <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-excel-convert-photo-to-table/">separate apps</a> for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. The new Office app combines these products into one.</p>
      <p>All of your Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files can be found in one timeline. When you go into a document, the UI takes on the color of that product. You still get the feeling of using separate dedicated apps, but now it’s all done from one single download. All the tools and features you’d expect are there. The Microsoft Office app is much smaller than downloading the three apps separately.</p>

      <p>The “Home” tab is where you’ll find all of your recent documents and the “Actions” tab has tools. Some of the tools include the ability to transfer files from your computer to a phone, convert images into text or tables, scan pictures into PDFs, and scan QR codes. Microsoft has also revamped the Office logo from the old boxy design to a new curvy square.</p>
