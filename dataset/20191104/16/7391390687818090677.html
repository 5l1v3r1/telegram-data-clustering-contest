      <p>Sunday night's <i>Strictly Come Dancing </i>episode went viral, and thankfully did so for all the right reasons. For the first time in the series' history, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4akPLslDh_/">an individual same-sex dance took place</a>. Professionals Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima were the chosen pair, spinning and smiling their way across the floor while Emeli Sande belted her heart out.</p>
      <p>For 32-year-old Radebe, the moment was more special than some perhaps realised. "<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50287263">I've never felt so liberated</a>," he told <i>Hello! </i>magazine. "For the first time in my life, I feel accepted for who I am. That says so much about the people of this country.</p>
      <p>Radebe continued: "To be able to dance with a friend I respect and adore is joyous. There's bromance galore between us, but there were no male and female roles, just free movement. It was beautiful, classy, and elegant."</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <i>The Sun</i>, the dancer opened up about being bullied in his native South Africa and just how importance <i>Strictly </i>has been. “I grew up in a country <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10224593/strictly-johannes-radebe-baseball-bat-homophobic-bully/">where homosexuality was frowned upon</a>," he told the paper. “The society around me pointed to me and said, ‘There’s something wrong with you.’ But <i>Strictly</i> has helped me be a better person and accepting of myself."</p>

      <p>Radebe —<b> </b>who was recently voted off alongside <i>Coronation Street </i>star Catherine Tyldesley —<b> </b>and Di Prima are known to be close friends. In fact, both shared their love for their dance on social media.</p>
      <p>"Representation always matters," tweeted 25-year-old Di Prima. Meanwhile, Radebe posted a photo of the pair on Instagram, writing: "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4anP3yHiHn/">Love knows no boundaries</a>." The public reaction was overwhelming with <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/1199602/Strictly-Come-Dancing-2019-Johannes-Radebe-Graziano-Di-Prime-same-sex-routine-tears-BBC">some viewers moved to tears</a>.</p>

      <p>A year ago marked <i>Strictly</i>'s <a href="https://heatworld.com/entertainment/tv-movies/strictly-same-sex-dance/">first same-sex group dance</a>. But the series is yet to feature a same-sex couple unlike rival series <i>Dancing on Ice </i>which has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/dancing-ice-beats-strictly-come-dancing-first-sex-couple-contestants-10885594/">paired pro skater Matt Evers with H from Steps</a> for the 2020 series.</p>
      <p>Both dancers and judges have welcomed the idea of same-sex couples on <i>Strictly</i>. "<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/09/24/strictlys-craig-revel-horwood-backs-campaign-for-same-sex-couples-to-be-added-to-the-show-7974389/">I’m totally for it</a>. I don’t see why a woman can’t dance with a woman and a man can’t dance with a man," Craig Revel-Horwood told <i>Good Morning Britain </i>in 2018, adding: ‘You’ve just got to choose who goes backwards and that’s normally the shorter person. So it’s actually quite an easy thing to achieve."</p>
      <p>Radebe said he "would be the first person <a href="https://www.attitude.co.uk/article/strictlys-johannes-radebe-recalls-the-terrible-homophobic-bullying-he-suffered-as-a-child-1/19582/">jumping up and down with joy</a>" if series bosses listened. Speaking to <i>Attitude</i>, he continued: "Representation is really important. When, or if, the BBC do, it will be fantastic. I would be all up for it."</p>
      <p>In August, the BBC said it is <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/strictly-come-dancing-2019-celebrity-line-up-same-sex-gay-couple-496600">"open" to same-sex couples competing</a> in future series, per iNews. Let's hope it happens soon, because as journalist Scott Bryan wrote in the <i>Guardian</i>: "When you see that chemistry being represented, you feel like your life and your love and your ambitions are being represented, too. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/shortcuts/2019/oct/09/dancing-on-ice-same-sex-strictly-h-steps-itv">That makes you feel valued</a>."</p>
