      <p>GEORGE TOWN (Nov 4): The state government has called for a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of a coastal resort and spa in Batu Ferringhi here.</p>
      <p>Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow today said the period to submit the RFP for the project which was opened to both local and international bidders was between Nov 1 and Dec 31.</p>
      <p>“The 16,997 sq m land (allocated for the proposed coastal resort and spa project) was previously used as a tsunami relocation site,” he told a press conference here adding that a site visit would be held on Nov 21.</p>
      <p>Chow said that the RFP was for a private entity to design, build and operate for a lease period of 30 years, with an option to renew for two consecutive 30-year terms.</p>
      <p>“The private entity must have a minimum paid-up capital of RM5 million. The overall project is estimated to cost between RM10 million and RM100 million depending on the number of proposed rooms,” he said.</p>
      <p>Chow said the proposed coastal resort and spa development project was different from the proposal to reclaim 300-acre (121.41-hectare) off the coast of Batu Ferringhi and Tanjung Bungah by a private property developer.</p>
      <p>He also confirmed that the state government had received the reclamation proposal from a local company, but had yet to make any decision on the matter.</p>
      <p>“The state can (still) decide to turn down the proposal...(but) if the state is interested, we might call for an RFP to invite more proposals from other companies,” he said.</p>
      <p>On Oct 30, Citizen Awareness Chant Group advisor Yan Lee had asked the state government to come clean over the proposed reclamation project for a high-end mixed development project. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
