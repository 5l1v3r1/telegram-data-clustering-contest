      <p>The decision to stick with the 25-year-old rookie effectively ends any hope of German Nico Hulkenberg, who is leaving Renault, securing a race seat in 2020.</p>
      <p>“Antonio has emerged as a very quick driver, even alongside as tough a benchmark as Kimi, and we expect him to develop even further as his experience grows,” said team boss Frederic Vasseur in a statement.</p>
      <p>“His technical feedback, work ethics and positive approach will help us continue to push our team forward, and so will the consistency of an unchanged line-up for next season.”</p>
      <p>Giovinazzi has scored four points from 19 races, compared to 31 for 2007 world champion Raikkonen.</p>
      <p>“We learned a lot this year and I am confident we can make a big step forward next season. I won’t be a rookie anymore so there won’t be any excuses for me,” said the only Italian driver on the starting grid.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg, 32, is being replaced by Frenchman Esteban Ocon at Renault next season and Alfa was one of just two teams left with a potential vacancy.</p>
      <p>The other is Williams, for whom the German made his debut in 2010, but that team is expected to sign Canadian F2 driver Nicholas Latifi.</p>
      <p>Williams have said they are not in talks with Hulkenberg, who has also recognized he is not a contender for that seat.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg holds the Formula One record for the most starts without ever standing on the podium, having finished fourth three times in his 175 races.</p>
