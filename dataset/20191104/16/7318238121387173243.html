      <h1>U.S. white nationalist arrested in Norway for 'national security reasons'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:37:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:37</time> by <a rel="author">Yuliya Talmazan and Caroline Radnofsky and Jean-Nicholas FievetÂ </a></address>
      <p>Norway arrested an American white nationalist before he gave a speech at a far-right conference in Oslo over the weekend, Norwegian officials told NBC News on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/greg-johnson">Greg Johnson</a> was on Saturday scheduled to speak at the Scandza Forum in the country's capital, a far-right event promoted by Counter-Currents Publishing, a white nationalist organization where the American serves as an editor-in-chief.</p>
      <p>Martin Bernsen, senior adviser and spokesman for Norway's domestic security agency, PST, said Johnson was detained under a section of the country's Immigration Act.</p>
      <p>He called Johnson's arrest a "preventative measure."</p>
      <p>"We wanted him out of the country as soon as possible," Bernsen said, adding that the American also has residency in Hungary.</p>
      <p>He added that Johnson was arrested to "prevent him from encouraging right-wing groups and individuals in Norway" and "stop him from contributing to new recruitment" in the country.</p>
      <p>News</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/greg-johnson">Southern Poverty and Law Center, Counter-Currents</a>is "the flag-bearer of what Johnson calls the 'North American New Right,' a concept whose main objective is to legitimize the idea of a white ethnostate."</p>
      <p>Bernsen said no other far-right representatives have been arrested alongside Johnson. He declined to comment when asked why only Johnson was detained.</p>
      <p>He said Johnson is not facing any formal charges, but the immigration act was used by Norwegian authorities to remove him from the country.</p>
      <p>Johnsons' Oslo-based lawyer, John Christian Elden, told NBC News in a WhatsApp message that Johnson has left the country on Monday and is on his way to Lisbon, Portugal for a rally.</p>
      <p>Elden said Johnson was detained in Norway as a "threat to national security" ahead of the conference, but will not face any legal action.</p>
      <p>It also referenced a statement from Johnson made before his arrest, in which he said that he has "always consistently condemned violence and terrorism."</p>
      <p>"I have never supported Breivik's crimes," he said in the statement, referring to Norwegian mass murderer and right-wing extremist, Anders Breivik, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/anders-breivik-makes-nazi-salute-rights-appeal-case-n705106">who killed 77 people in a bomb and shooting rampage in 2011</a>.</p>
      <p>Johnson penned an essay on Breivik in 2012, describing him as "creepy, narcissistic dork," but also talking about "a strange new respect for him."</p>
      <p>Norway experienced far-right extremism earlier this year. In August, a man <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/gunman-multiple-weapons-opens-fire-norway-mosque-injuring-one-n1041126">stormed an Oslo mosque with a gun</a>, but was overpowered by members of the congregation. Norwegian authorities said he had expressed far-right, anti-immigrant views online.</p>
