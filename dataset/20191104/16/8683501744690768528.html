      <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is preparing to begin Phase Four, as we're currently in the midst of the months-long hiatus between film slates. The studio revealed its plans through 2022 this summer, with exciting announcements at both San Diego Comic-Con and the D23 Expo. But there are still a variety of projects that don't have release dates, including <i>Ant-Man 3</i>. Luckily, Michael Douglas has recently gotten a bit chatty about the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483674/ant-man-3-is-officially-happening">highly anticipated threequel</a>.</p>
      <p>Michael Douglas stars as Hank Pym in the <i>Ant-Man</i> movies, and recently had a brief cameo during Tony Stark's lakeside funeral in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. He seemed like an obvious cast member to return for the upcoming third movie, and the 75 year-old actor recently confirmed his appearance in the upcoming blockbuster, also revealing when production will start. As he put it:</p>
      <blockquote>The Marvel world has really been a blast! I love them, I'm having a great time. We're starting a third [<i>Ant-Man</i> movie] in the beginning of January 2021.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that seems pretty cut and dry. Despite the security and secrecy of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Michael Douglas just confirmed two exciting updates for <i>Ant-Man 3</i>. And while he was expected to reprise his role, news about when the movie is filming is especially major. And it's happening in just a little over a year. Although the movie's crew and contents remain a complete mystery.</p>
      <p>Michael Douglas' comments to <a href="https://collider.com/michael-douglas-the-kominsky-method-season-2-ant-man-3-interview/">Collider</a> are sure to excite the rabid Marvel fanbase. <i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i> ended Phase Three, and moviegoers are eager for any information about the shared universe's future. This certainly includes Paul Rudd's Scott Lang and the <i>Ant-Man</i> franchise. Because while the property offers something light and unique for the MCU, Ant-Man was also intimately involved <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477327/ant-man-totally-foreshadowed-scotts-plot-in-avengers-endgame">in the events of</a> <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>While he was noticeably absent in <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, Ant-Man's story moved forward during <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>. Hope became a superhero and Janet was rescued, but Thanos' snap dusted the supporting cast and left Scott stranded in the Quantum Realm. He was eventually rescued <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483398/marvel-fans-theorize-endgames-hero-rat-appeared-in-another-movie">by a heroic rat</a>, reunited with a much older Cassie, and came to the Avengers with the idea of the Time Heist.</p>
      <p>I'm eager to see if the same actress plays Cassie in <i>Ant-Man 3</i>. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476553/that-time-avengers-endgames-cassie-lang-got-in-trouble-by-marvel-security">Emma Fuhrmann replaced</a> Abby Ryder Fortson as Cassie Lang in <i>Endgame</i>, following the five-year time jump. This jump could potentially open up the opportunity for her becoming a superhero as well, just like the comics. As Stature, she has the same growing and shrinking abilities as her father. And <i>Ant-Man 3</i> seems like a great opportunity for that origin story. You can read up on Cassie's life <a href="https://comixology.sjv.io/kXbDn">on the page here</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Ant-Man 3</i> doesn't currently <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482496/has-ant-man-3s-release-date-been-leaked">have a release date</a>, but it's expected to hit theaters following the release of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481441/bummer-black-panther-2-hasnt-really-started-coming-together-yet">Phase Five's <i>Black Panther II</i></a> in 2022. The next installment in the MCU is <i>Black Panther</i> on May 1st, 2020.
