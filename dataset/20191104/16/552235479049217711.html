      <p>A 15-year-old girl was dragged out of a car "by her hair" on Sunday morning during a carjacking in Glenmavis.</p>
      <p>The teenager was sitting in the passenger seat of a Volkswagon Touran at around 9.30am before she was forcibly dragged from the vehicle by a woman who then got into the car with a man and drove off.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the girl wasn't hurt.</p>
      <p>Police are now appealing to the driver of a silver car who picked up three people in North Lanarkshire that Sunday, in the hope that he or she might have information about the robbery.</p>
      <p>Cops are hunting for a white 5'5 female around 30-years-old, of slim build with long blonde hair that was tied up in a ponytail.</p>
      <p>She was wearing grey jogging bottoms and an oversized sweatshirt.</p>
      <p>They also want to find a man of roughly the same age, who is 5'11 in height, of medium build with short brown hair.</p>
      <p>He was wearing navy blue jogging bottoms and a navy blue rain jacket.</p>

      <p>The mother of the daughter who was pulled from the car posted on Facebook: "They grabbed my daughter by the hair and dragged her out the car.</p>
      <p>"She’s okay but we are both really shaken.</p>
      <p>"We are totally overwhelmed by the messages of support."</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Cammy Miller, Coatbridge CID, is leading the enquiry. He said:</p>
      <p>“What we know from our enquiries so far is that three people, two women and a man, were seen getting into a silver van in Condorrat Road, between Condorrat and Glenmavis village, and then being dropped off a short time later - between 9.15 and 9.30 am on Sunday morning - in Coatbridge Road where the car was stolen.</p>
      <p>“Although at this time we cannot confirm if these people were involved, it would be beneficial if the driver of the van, or indeed his/her passengers, got in touch with police.</p>
      <p>“Information can be passed to Coatbridge CID via 101. Please quote reference number 1459 of 3 November 2019 when calling. Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.”</p>
