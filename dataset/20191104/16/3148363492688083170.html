      <h1>Fact Check: Buttigieg Claims Trump Has ‘Broken Every Promise He's Made’</h1>
      <h2>Mayor Pete Buttigieg inexplicably claimed on Monday that President Donald Trump had broken every promise that he made as a candidate.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:59:59+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Charlie Spiering</a></address>
      <p>“We’re gonna win because this president has no good answers, and he’s broken every promise that he’s made,” Buttigieg claimed on CNN on Monday.</p>
      <p>Contrary to Buttigieg’s claim, the president has successfully delivered on a number of promises that he made, including the following successes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal</li>
        <li>Withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and renegotiated NAFTA</li>
        <li>Withdrew from the Paris Climate accord</li>
        <li>Imposed steep economic tariffs on China</li>
        <li>Approved the Keystone XL pipeline</li>
        <li>Bombed “the sh*t out of” Islamic State terrorists</li>
        <li>Ended the individual mandate for Obamacare</li>
        <li>Signed historic tax cuts to boost the economy</li>
        <li>Selected two conservative judges for the Supreme Court</li>
        <li>Rebuilt the military</li>
        <li>Moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem</li>
        <li>Pressured more European countries to keep NATO defense commitments</li>
        <li>Declared China a currency manipulator</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Trump continues working on his promises to build a wall on the Southern border and slow illegal immigration, with demonstrable progress. He has also successfully wielded economic trade tariffs to bring China to the negotiating table on trade, with a first-stage agreement pending. On the economy, the president continues to deliver record low unemployment numbers in the United States and big stock market gains.</p>
      <p>The Buttigieg campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
