      <p>A west Belfast man was allegedly caught "red-handed" trying to burgle a house in Newry where a shotgun had been stored, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said police discovered Edward McKay (54) holding a chisel while a crowbar was wedged into the door of the property.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that he had travelled 40 miles to try to break into the home at Glen Villas during the early hours of October 24.</p>
      <p>McKay, of Shaws Court, faces charges of criminal damage and attempted burglary with intent to steal.</p>
      <p>Police were alerted after a woman spotted a masked man outside her 65-year-old neighbour's house shortly after he had left for work, the court was told.</p>
      <p>Minutes later officers arrived at the scene and arrested McKay.</p>
      <p>Crown lawyer Conor Maguire claimed he was wearing gloves and a balaclava, and dropped a chisel from his hands.</p>
      <p>A crowbar had been wedged into the door frame in an attempt to gain entry, according to the prosecution.</p>
      <p>Opposing bail, Mr Maguire contended: "There's some significance to the fact the householder was a licensed firearm holder, in respect of a shotgun."</p>
      <p>He added: "This occurred in the early hours of the morning, the applicant had travelled over 40 miles from his home to this rural location. That shows considerable intent on his part."</p>
      <p>Mark Farrell, defending, insisted there was no evidence the house had been targeted because of the presence of a gun.</p>
      <p>"There's a strong case that he's caught red-handed," the barrister said.</p>
      <p>But he rejected the suggestion that any attempted burglary was in "the hunt for a lethal weapon".</p>
      <p>Mr Justice McAlinden also heard how McKay suffered a double bereavement earlier this year, losing his daughters Geraldine and Bridget to drugs-related deaths within a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>The judge acknowledged the accused's tragic personal circumstances.</p>
      <p>"It highlights and clearly demonstrates the utter havoc and devastation that drugs are having on our community and in our society," he said.</p>
      <p>Refusing bail, however, he cited the potential risk of re-offending.</p>
