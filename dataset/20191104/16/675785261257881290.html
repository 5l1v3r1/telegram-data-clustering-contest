      <p>Leeds United goalkeeper Kiko Casilla has been charged by the FA over his alleged racial abuse of Charlton player Jonathan Leko.</p>
      <p>The FA have been investigating the Spaniard since the incident which occurred in Charlton's 1-0 win over Leeds in September.</p>
      <p>A statement from Leeds acknowledged the charge and revealed he plans to appeal the charge.</p>
      <p>He would face a minimum six-game ban if found guilty, although he remains available to play with his appeal ongoing.</p>
      <p>The statement read: "Leeds United Football Club acknowledges the charge from the FA today relating to Kiko Casilla and an alleged breach of FA Rule E3 during our Sky Bet Championship match with Charlton Athletic at The Valley in September.</p>
      <p>"Kiko strenuously denies the allegation and has proactively worked with the FA during their investigation to date.</p>
      <p>"The next step of this process will be a personal hearing, in the meantime Kiko will remain available for selection."</p>
