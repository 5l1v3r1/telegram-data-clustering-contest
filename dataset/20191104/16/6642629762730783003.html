      <p>Police in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/greece.html">Greece</a> has found 41 migrants, mostly Afghans, hiding in a refrigerated truck at a motorway near the northeast city of Xanthi.</p>
      <p>The discovery on Monday came 10 days after 39 bodies, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated truck near London.</p>

      <p>Greek police said the refrigeration system in the truck where the migrants were found had not been turned on, and none of the migrants was injured. Eight were treated in a hospital for breathing problems.</p>
      <p>All but two - an Iranian and a Syrian - were from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/afghanistan.html">Afghanistan</a>, while six were minors.</p>
      <p>Police stopped the truck on the Egnatia motorway between the cities of Xanthi and Komotini for a regular check. They arrested the driver, a man from Georgia, and took him and the migrants to a nearby police station for identification.</p>
      <p>Local media reported that police were also seeking a second man from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>Greece is currently struggling with the biggest resurgence in refugee arrivals since 2015, when more than a million people crossed into <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a> from Turkey via Greece.</p>
      <p>About 34,000 asylum seekers and refugees are being held in camps on the Aegean islands close to Turkey.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/vietnam.html">Vietnam</a>, eight more people have been arrested in connection to the 39 people found dead east of London on October 23. </p>
      <p>The incident highlighted the risks of undocumented migration routes to Europe, even for those avoiding perilous travel by sea. </p>
      <p>Most of the victims were believed to be from the Nghe An and the neighbouring province of Ha Tinh, in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs and environmental disaster all fuel migration.</p>
      <p>While some migrants make it safely to England, find employment, and are able to send money home, many others are forced into modern-day slavery when they reach the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>. Physical and sexual abuse is also common during the weeks-long journey.</p>
      <p>A 2016 Al Jazeera <a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2016/uk-slavery-sex-slave-smuggling-investigation/index.html">documentary</a> revealed that many Vietnamese women who were successfully smuggled into the UK manage to find work in nail salons - but some are made to work long hours for little or no pay - and are forced into prostitution in the evening. </p>
