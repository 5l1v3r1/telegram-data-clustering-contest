      <h1>Pixel 4 update lets Smooth Display kick in more often</h1>
      <h2>You'll get more of the 90Hz smoothness you paid for.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T16:58:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Frustrated that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras/">Pixel 4's</a> signature Smooth Display (aka 90Hz refresh rate) only kicks in under very <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-when-does-google-run-pixel-4-smooth-display-90-hz-vs-60-hz.html">specific circumstances</a>? You might want to give it another look. Google has <a href="https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2019-11-01.html">released</a> a November update that invokes Smooth Display in more conditions. Based on early <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-4-90hz-update-reports/">reports</a>, the faster screen tech is considerably more likely to appear -- you don't need a brightness of 75 percent or higher, for example. There's no verdict on battery life at this point, although it won't be surprising if longevity takes a hit with more frequent 90Hz use.</p>
      <p>The same update also brings unspecified "camera quality improvements" to Pixel 4 owners, while those with older models also see improvements for Google Assistant's hotword, Xbox Bluetooth controller mapping and problems with getting stuck during the boot process. If you have a Pixel phone that still receives updates (sorry original Pixel owners), you'll likely want to install this update sooner rather than later.</p>
