      <p>On 4 November 1979, Iranian students belonging to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, a group that supported the Iranian Revolution, took fifty-two American diplomats and citizens hostage. This happened several months after the toppling of Iran's US-backed Shah. The students demanded that Washington hand over the ousted ruler. One Iranian civilian and eight US servicemen were killed during a failed operation to rescue the hostages who eventually spent more than a year inside the embassy.  </p>
