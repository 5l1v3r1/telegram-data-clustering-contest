      <p>Brussels (AFP) - A former senior Rwandan official went on trial in Belgium on Monday accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide in his country.</p>
      <p>Friends and relatives of the alleged victims of 71-year-old Fabien Neretse were present as he arrived at the Brussels court, leaning on a crutch.</p>
      <p>For the first time in a Belgian case, Neretse is explicitly charged with "genocide" over 13 alleged murders between April and July 1994.</p>
      <p>He was arrested in France in 2011, but was not in detention and presented himself at court. He denies all charges.</p>
      <p>"I'm innocent," he declared to journalists outside the court.</p>
      <p>Neretse did not immediately appear in the dock, as Monday's hearing focused on jury selection. The first full hearing is to take place on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Neretse's lawyer, Jean-Pierre Jacques, predicted that the prosecution would find it "very hard to prove" his client had sought to target an entire ethnic group.</p>
      <p>Under a 1993 law, Belgian courts enjoy universal jurisdiction to prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity wherever they took place.</p>
      <p>This is the fifth trial regarding the genocide in Rwanda to have taken place in Belgium, the African country's former colonial power.</p>
      <p>Belgian citizen Claire Beckers was a shopkeeper in the Rwandan capital, married to a man from the Tutsi ethnic group, with whom she had an 18-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>All three were killed on April 9, 1994, three days after the assassination of president Juvenal Habyarimana and the start of mass killings of Tutsi by Hutu extremists.</p>
      <p>Beckers's Belgian sister lodged a complaint, and Belgian prosecutors argue Neretse was a leader in her area who sent armed men to prevent Tutsi escaping the death squads.</p>
      <p>Neretse is also charged with involvement in killings in the Gitaram and Ruhengeri districts, where the agricultural engineer had founded a school.</p>
      <p>Beckers's sister Martine Beckers told AFP that the trial was the "end of a long battle", insisting it is "important to honour the victims".</p>
      <p>According to UN figures, the Rwandan genocide cost the lives of 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi minority but also moderate Hutus.</p>
