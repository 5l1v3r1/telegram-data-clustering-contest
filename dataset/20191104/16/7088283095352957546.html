        <b>Work has begun on the construction of the home of the 2024 Olympic Games, to be hosted in Paris. The development is part of a broader government plan to reinvigorate the poorest urban area in the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Olympic village, which will house some 15,000 athletes and officials, is being built in the Seine-Saint-Denis area north of Paris, part of the urban fringe which has suffered from social tensions and neglect for years.</p>
      <p>But the project is controversial locally because it will force the relocation of residents, businesses and even schools in the area where the village is to be constructed.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Edouard Philippe launched the works, which are set to last over three years, in the suburb of Saint-Ouen.</p>
      <p>After the games the authorities plan to reconfigure the area into a new neighbourhood that will offer a total of 3,000 homes and also increase local participation in sports.</p>
      <p>"If we want the Games to be a success, we must make sure that all this organisation, all this financing and this mobilisation does not just vanish when the Olympic flame goes out," said Philippe as he launched the works.</p>
      <p>"It needs to last," he added.</p>

        <b>'Idiotic acts'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Legacy is now a huge aspect of Olympic developments, especially after the success of the London 2012 Olympics which helped breathe new life into Stratford in the east of the English capital.</p>
      <p>There have already been protests locally against the French Olympic village project, which requires the clearing of a zone that is home to over 20 businesses, three schools, a hotel, a student residence and a hostel for foreign workers.</p>
      <p>"We have been here for 40 years and now there is no longer any space for us," Boubacar Diallo, who represents foreign workers living in a residence, told the AFP news agency.</p>
      <p>Two new residences should be finished by 2022 to house all those affected. But the residents are rejecting the temporary housing on offer until they are completed.</p>
      <p>Responding to the criticism, Solideo, the public company overseeing all the works, insisted the local area would get a boost.</p>
      <p>"What is going to happen over the next 3-4 years is compensation for what has not happened the last 30 years," the company says.</p>
      <p>The budget for the games amounts to â‚¬6.8 billion, 1.5 billion of which will come from the state.</p>
      <p>The French authorities have long expressed concern over the stark disparities in the Paris area, with wealthy citizens concentrated in the centre but northern areas far less well-off.</p>
      <p>A report in June said rising property prices had widened the gap between rich and poor in the Paris region, where the number of people living in poverty has increased.</p>
