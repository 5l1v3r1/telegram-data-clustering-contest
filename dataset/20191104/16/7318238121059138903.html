      <p>The fifth Democratic presidential debate, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post, will be held at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>The debate will be feature four moderators, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/msnbc-announces-four-all-star-all-female-moderators-november-debate-n1071026">all of whom are women</a>: Rachel Maddow, host of MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show"; Andrea Mitchell, host of MSNBC's "Andrea Mitchell Reports" and NBC News' chief foreign affairs correspondent; Kristen Welker, NBC News' White House correspondent; and Ashley Parker, a White House reporter for The Washington Post.</p>
      <p>So far, nine candidates have qualified for the debate stage, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/which-candidates-have-qualified-msnbc-debate-november-n1068916">an unofficial NBC News tally</a>. The venue, founded by and named for entertainment mogul Tyler Perry, is likely to feature a smaller number of candidates than the dozen who participated in the October debate in Ohio. The November debate is also slated to be shorter than that square-off, running from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>The debate will air live on MSNBC and stream on MSNBC.com and the Post's website as well as across mobile devices through NBC News' and the Post's mobile apps.</p>
      <p>To qualify for the stage, candidates have to meet <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/dnc-raises-qualification-threshold-november-debate-n1057751">fundraising and polling criteria</a> laid out by the Democratic National Committee, which includes hitting at least 3 percent in four qualifying state or national polls or 5 percent in two qualifying state polls. The fundraising threshold requires candidates to have received contributions from 165,000 unique donors, including 600 unique donors in 20 states.</p>
      <p>The nine candidates who appear to have qualified to date are former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana; Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif.; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; billionaire activist Tom Steyer; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; entrepreneur Andrew Yang; and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.</p>
      <p>Two other candidates appear to have reached the fundraising threshold, but are short on the polling requirements. They include Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and former Housing Secretary Julián Castro.</p>
