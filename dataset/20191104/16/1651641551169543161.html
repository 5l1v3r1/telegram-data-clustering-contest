        <b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare already feels like a pretty feature complete game, but new Modern Warfare DLC could massively improve the map count.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite already including an impressive 19 multiplayer maps across all of its modes, developer Infinity Ward could be adding a lot more.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dqgzml/38_upcoming_multiplayer_maps_in_modern_warfare/">dataminer has discovered that Modern Warfare lists a whopping 38 extra maps within the game’s files</a>. Not only is this amazing news for fans of the shooter, but for fans of the sub series as a whole as classic maps make a return.</p>
      <p>If the datanine is leading us to real maps, you’ll be able to 1v1 on Rust once again. Also included in the list are Crash, Shipment and Sub Base.</p>
      <p>The full list is as follows:</p>
