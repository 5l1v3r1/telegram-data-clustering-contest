        <b>A man has been jailed for kicking and killing a gull.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A driver witnessed Andrew Lee Jones, 38, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, kicking the bird before finding it dead in the town on 1 May.</p>
      <p>An RSPCA appeal resulted in CCTV showing the incident being provided by the council. </p>
      <p>Jones pleaded guilty to one offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and was sentenced to 12 weeks at Merthyr Magistrates' Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>RSPCA inspector Simon Evans thanked the witness for coming forward, adding: "This horrific incident was also caught on CCTV where the defendant was seen kicking the bird and using his foot to direct it into a corner of the car park.</p>
      <p>"The bird had sustained other injuries before this attack - however, a post-mortem examination found that it would have been the blunt trauma injuries from the defendant's kick that would have been the most likely cause of death.</p>
      <p>"There is no excuse for this kind of deliberate cruelty."</p>
      <p>Jones was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £115.</p>
