      <p>It appears that BMW is a brand many Kaizer Chiefs stars have opted for when visiting the car dealerships. Today, we take a look at some of the flashiest BMWs owned by Amakhosi stars. Check it out!</p>
      <p>As the owner of one of the more luxurious rides at Chiefs, midfielder Willard Katsande can be seen pulling up to training sessions in what is known as a BMW X6. Although he is considered to be a hardman on the field, Katsande seems to prefer the more sophisticated approach off it with his X6.</p>
      <p>Rivalling Katsande is fellow midfielder George Maluleka, who owns an older version of the X6, while a Jeep Wrangler also sits snug inside his garage.</p>

      <p>Defender Daniel Cardoso takes both the old school and new school approach when it comes to his rides, with a BMW 1 Series and a 325i "<i>gusheshe</i>" parked inside his garage.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Bruce Bvuma has often taken to his social media pages to post images of himself posing alongside his BMW 1 Series, while defender Siyabonga Ngezana is said to be the owner of a BMW 3 Series.</p>
