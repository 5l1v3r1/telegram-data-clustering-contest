      <h2>Deputy party leader Jo-Ann Roberts steps into top role</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:13:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/canadian-press-2/" target="_blank">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Elizabeth May says she is no longer the leader of the federal Green party.</p>
      <p>May told a news conference Monday on Parliament Hill that she’s stepping down as leader effective immediately, and appointing deputy leader Jo-Ann Roberts as her successor.</p>
      <p>May, 65, says she promised her daughter three years ago that the 2019 election would be her last as the party leader — though not necessarily her last as an MP.</p>
      <p>Roberts is a former New Brunswick CBC journalist who ran unsuccessfully for the Greens in Halifax in the recent federal election.</p>
      <p>The fact that neither of the other two Green MPs elected last month — Jenica Atwin in Fredericton and Vancouver Island’s Paul Manly — were tapped for the interim job, ensuring they are eligible to seek the permanent job at a leadership convention in October 2020.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Both were elected as Green MPs alongside May last month. Atwin is the first from outside of B.C. to be elected under the Green banner.</p>
      <p>May has led the Greens since 2006, becoming the first Green MP elected to the House of Commons in 2011.</p>
