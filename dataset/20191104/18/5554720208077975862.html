      <p>Colors TV’s reality show Bigg Boss is set to turn quite dramatic this week after a promo by the makers showed that Siddharth Shukla may be evicted out of the house for violence. A promo broadcast by the channel at the end of the Monday night’s episode showed <i>Bigg Boss </i>announce that it was booting out Siddharth for violence during a weekly task.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear what the task was about and how he resorted to violence, but if the Colors TV broadcast on Monday night is true, then Siddharth will become the second most popular TV actor after Rashami Desai to leave the popular reality show.</p>
      <p>The reported elimination of Siddharth has triggered strong reactions from Twitterati.</p>

      <p>The eviction of Rashami and Devoleena Bhattacharjee had stunned many over the weekend. Their eviction was followed by the entry of several new contestants including Tehseen Poonawalla, Khesari Lal Yadav, Shefali Jariwala, Himanshi Khurana, Arhaan Khan, Hindustani Bhau.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, Hindustani Bhau was seen making fun of Tehseen Poonawalla’s teeth. Joining him was Himanshi, Asim Riaz and Mahira Sharma. On one occasion, they burst into unstoppable laughter poking fun at Tehseen’s teeth. Much to the dismay of Tehseen, he was not even aware of the fact that the group was poking fun at his physical appearance.</p>
      <p>Shehnaaz Gill was once again seen breaking down and wanted to leave the show. She later fought with Aarti Singh after the latter addressed her as the biggest entertainer of the reality show. This irked Aarti, the captain of the house for this week, so much that she vowed never to joke with her. Shehnaaz also appeared to have pushed her two other erstwhile friends namely Siddharth and Asim with both of them suspecting her integrity.</p>
      <p>Later in the game, contestants were asked to nominate two housemates. This resulted in the nomination of Siddharth, Arhaan, Paras Chhabra, Tehseen, Himanshi, Shefali, Hindustani Bhau, Shehnaaz. Asim too was nominated but Aarti used her power as captain to give him immunity.</p>
