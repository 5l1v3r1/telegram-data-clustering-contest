      <p>BWG Foods Wholesale and Value Centre Castlebar is aiming to plug a gap in the market with the introduction of its dedicated alcohol free section, coined the “Zero Bar”. with alcohol free options across wine, prosecco, beer, cider and gin.</p>
      <p>Alcohol free range sales have increased 224% since last year, driven by the health and wellness trend, with the worldwide market for non-alcoholic beer projected to double to about more than €20 billion by 2024, according to market research firm Global Market Insights.</p>
      <p>This statistic infers the need and demand for alcohol-free options that still remind consumers of alcohol.</p>
      <p>In response to this Global trend, Value Centre Castlebar has moved quickly to adapt and ensure the tastes of our customers are catered for, especially with the Christmas period approaching.</p>
      <p>Corporate Gifting remains a very strong component of the festive season for businesses in Ireland and Value Centre Castlebar, recognising a gap in the market for innovative gifting ideas, has shifted gears this year and expanded their offering to include healthy and alcohol free hamper options.</p>
      <p>
        <b>* Pictured with Value Centre’s healthy and alcohol free hampers are Gerry Keady, Value Centre Regional Manager, Jenny Egan, Marketing Manager and Paul Bealin, Head of Sales.</b>
