      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:00:27+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Pike, Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/molly-pike/</a></address>
      <p>Shirley Ballas has revealed she 'feels more like herself' after having her breast implants removed just days ago due to cancer fears.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> ’s head judge, 59, said she was in agony after the four-hour surgery but only wanted 'minimal painkillers' when she appeared on the BBC1 show.</p>
      <p>Shirley said: “I’m good. It’s been an emotional week for sure. I made a commitment to the show and wanted to see it through.</p>
      <p>“I made a decision to put them in and I made the decision to take them out. Every day it will get better.</p>
      <p>“It’s about six to eight weeks of recuperation. I won’t miss a show.”</p>

      <p>Prior to the operation, Shirley spoke about the procedure with contestant Michelle Visage, who recently revealed she has had her implants removed too.</p>
      <p>Shirley said: “She wished me well and told me to take my time recuperating. She said she feels like a new woman. So from woman to woman she wanted to share that experience of how much healthier she felt.”</p>
      <p>Shirley admitted she was “still getting used” to life without implants.</p>

      <p>Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine, she showcased before and after photos.</p>
      <p>She added: “All the clothes are a little different. It was a DD and now it’s an AB, so it’s quite a difference in size.”</p>
      <p>Shirley recently urged women to rethink implants, saying: “Don’t think you need to have these procedures to make you look more attractive.</p>

      <p>“If someone is making you feel bad, talk to someone. Don’t do what I did. You can’t make somebody love you, no matter what you do to ­yourself. It’s learning to love yourself.”</p>
      <p>For those still considering implants, she urged them to “do their research” and added: “I did not do mine. I thought if I put them in my husband would think of me as more desirable.</p>
      <p>“I made this choice many years ago, not understanding what I was really doing, except telling myself I didn’t look good enough.”</p>
