      <p>A 80-year-old vintage car enthusiast killed in a smash during the London to Brighton rally was a Canadian oil millionaire, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>Ron Carey ended up on the M23 in his 35mph 1903 Knox Runabout “Old Porcupine” after taking a wrong turn off Sunday’s official A23 route.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said he and wife Billi were thrown into the air “like rag dolls” when they collided with a heavy goods vehicle.</p>
      <p>Ron died at the scene while Billi was flown to hospital with serious head injuries.</p>
      <p>Her condition was stable today.</p>
      <p>Paying tribute, friend Rick Pikulski said: “It’s tragic, gut-wrenching news. I’ve known Ron almost 40 years. He was an avid collector. He would go on these vintage car rallies all the time.”</p>

      <p>Ron, of Calgary, Alberta, worked his way up in the oil industry and founded J&amp;L Supply in 1973. He had a £3.8million classic car collection and was a contributor to two vintage car museums.</p>
      <p>He is thought to have completed the London to Brighton run in 2011, 2012 and 2013.</p>
      <p>More than 400 enthusiasts took part in the 60-mile event this year, which only allows cars built before 1905. One local who saw the smash accused organisers of poor signage and a lack of stewards.</p>

      <p>Jocelyn Gregory said: “If you are not familiar with the area, it is an easy mistake. When the lorry hit, they flew into the air like rag dolls. It was awful.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Veteran Car Run said the car had left the route, adding: “We are doing all we can to support the family and are working with the police.”</p>
      <p>Ron’s death comes two years after David Corry, 68, died in the rally when his 1902 Benz was in a four-car crash.</p>
      <p>A second man, believed to be the lorry driver, was treated at the scene for minor injuries. No arrests have been made.</p>
