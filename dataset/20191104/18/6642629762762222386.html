      <p>German Chancellor <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/angela-merkel.html">Angela Merkel</a>'s government strongly condemned death threats against two leading Green party politicians by a neo-Nazi group, as concern mounts over a rise in right-wing vigilante groups.</p>
      <p>Green party member Cem Ozdemir, who has Turkish roots, revealed at the weekend that police were investigating an email he received from a neo-Nazi group saying he was at the top of its kill list.</p>
      <p>"We are currently planning how and when to execute you. At the next rally? Or will we get you outside your home?" the email read, according to the Funke newspaper group.</p>
      <p>Fellow Greens MP Claudia Roth received a message saying she was second in line to be killed.</p>

      <p>Both emails were sent on October 27 and signed with "Nuclear Weapons Division Germany" (AWD), apparently a German offshoot of a notorious US-based neo-Nazi group.</p>
      <p>"The German government clearly condemns any kind of threats or violence against politicians," Merkel's spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told reporters on Monday.</p>
      <p>"We cannot and will not accept these attacks on our free democratic system," she said, vowing to use the full force of the law against the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the same news conference, Interior Ministry spokesman Steve Alter said federal security services "have already had this group in their sights for some time".</p>
      <p>The US version of the AWD, founded in 2015-16, has been linked to five killings in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a>, he added. The German branch is thought to count several dozen members.</p>
      <h3>'Nazi emergency'</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/germany.html">Germany</a> has witnessed growing anti-immigration sentiment in recent years, fueled by the propaganda of neo-Nazi groups and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/germany-afd-gains-thuringia-state-elections-191027192910248.html">political gains</a> made by the far-right Islamophobic Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. </p>
      <p>The death threats come with German politicians already on high alert following the murder last June of local pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke in the western city of Kassel, allegedly by a known neo-Nazi.</p>
      <p>In October, two people were shot dead in a far-right attack in the eastern city of Halle where the gunman first tried and failed to storm a packed synagogue.</p>
      <p>In regional elections in the state of Thuringia late last month, Greens co-leader Robert Habeck and a local candidate from Merkel's Christian Democrats party received death threats from a suspected far-right group. </p>
      <p>The eastern city of Dresden <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/eastern-german-city-dresden-declares-nazi-emergency-191102180800087.html">declared</a> a "Nazi emergency" last week with a resolution noting "anti-democratic, anti-pluralist, misanthropic and right-wing extremist views and acts ... including violence are occurring with increasing frequency".</p>
      <p>Faced with growing calls for action, Merkel's government last week proposed a series of measures to crack down on the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/spotlight/politics.html">far right</a>, with a focus on weapons sales and online hate speech.</p>
      <p>During a visit to the eastern city of Zwickau on Monday, Merkel placed a single white rose at a memorial tree in honour of the victims of a neo-Nazi cell that killed 10 people between 2000 and 2007.</p>
      <p>The government "would do everything in its power" to make sure "these things never happen again", Merkel promised.</p>
      <p>The police recorded more than 19,000 far-right crimes in 2018, according to the latest government figures, with about 1,000 violent attacks against foreigners, immigrants or political rivals.</p>
