      <p>LIVINGSTON, Wis. - An Illinois man is arrested and could face more charges after a three-vehicle crash in Grant County, officials said. </p>
      <p>The Grant County Sheriff’s Office said the crash happened at about 7 p.m. Friday outside Livingston on Highway 80.</p>
      <p>Officials said a 66-year-old Dodgeville woman was driving a Toyota Prius and slowed down to turn right when 35-year-old Sam Hamra, of Springfield, Illinois, failed to stop and rear-ended the car.</p>
      <p>That car was pushed across the center line and hit a Jeep, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>The Prius driver and passenger, the 27-year-old Montfort woman who was driving the Jeep, and Hamra were all taken to area hospitals for injuries, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Hamara was arrested on suspicion of operating while intoxicated.</p>
      <p>That stretch of Highway 80 was closed for 5 hours during the crash, officials said.</p>
