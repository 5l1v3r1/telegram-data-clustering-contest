      <h1>David Moyes responds to Hearts and Hibs speculation as ex-Manchester United boss delivers emphatic message</h1>
      <h2>The former Manchester United and Everton boss had been linked with the vacant Tynecastle job.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:51:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:51</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Burns, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-burns/</a></address>
      <p>Definitive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/david-moyes">David Moyes</a> has dismissed any chance of returning to Scotland to manage either Hibs or Hearts.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Everton boss had been linked with the vacant Tynecastle job and was in the betting after the Easter Road side sacked <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Moyes wouldn’t close the door on a return to Scotland, although it is likely that it would have to be the Celtic job as it won't be to either <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> or <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> .</p>

      <p>“I wouldn’t say I wouldn’t move back to Scotland. </p>
      <p>“Scotland is my love and Glasgow is where I am from. </p>
      <p>“Hopefully, someday I will be back.  At the moment it is not for just now.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Moyes has been out of football since he left West Ham last year. He has also managed Sunderland, Preston and Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>He also ruled himself out of the Scotland running before Steve Clarke got the job.</p>
