      <p>Genk coach Felice Mazzu insists his squad are not at Anfield to “take photos” but did admit he had brought every available player because the match was a great moment for the club.</p>
      <p>The Belgian club were beaten 4-1 at home by Jurgen Klopp’s side a fortnight ago and have yet to win any of the 15 matches they have played in their relatively small Champions League history.</p>
      <p>A 2-0 defeat against struggling Eupen at the weekend was not the ideal preparation and Mazzu knows his players have to massively improve if they are not to be rolled over again.</p>
      <p>“I brought everyone because I think it is a great moment for the club, for all the players, so my desire was that everyone is here,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is the moment to enjoy but not to be here to take photos. It is to give their life on the pitch and play the best football possible.</p>
      <p>“They play a big game against a big team perhaps for once in our life in a place like this.</p>
      <p>“I know the results are not so good and the way we have played is not so good. I know it’s not an easy moment but I am calm. I don’t feel the pressure.</p>
      <p>“We play against the best team in the world at the moment. I am sure the players’ mentality will be better tomorrow – and I hope the coach’s also.”</p>
      <p>Genk midfielder Sander Berge admits it is a huge occasion for the players but also a massive task for them.</p>
      <p>“I never thought I would play at Anfield with Genk. I am happy to be here,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big dream coming true to play the best team in the world and at Anfield it is something special.</p>
      <p>“They are known for having maybe the best fans in the world and will make sure we do better than last time.</p>
      <p>“We are struggling at the moment, lacking leadership and discipline to make the big solutions in our 18-yard box.”</p>
