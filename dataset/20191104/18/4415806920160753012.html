      <p>Kevin-Prince Boateng says “nothing has changed” in football’s fight against racism since he walked off a pitch almost seven years ago, in the wake of the abuse suffered by Mario Balotelli.</p>
      <p>Brescia striker Balotelli threatened to leave the field during the second half of Sunday’s Serie A defeat at Verona because of apparent racist chanting from home fans.</p>
      <p>In similar circumstances, Boateng, who currently plays for Italian club Fiorentina, refused to continue playing a friendly for AC Milan against Pro Patria in January 2013 in protest at racist abuse from the terraces.</p>

      <p>The 32-year-old former Tottenham and Portsmouth player posted a video of the incident on Twitter, which ended with an image of Balotelli, and vowed to continue fighting the issue.</p>
      <p>“6 years later NOTHING has changed but we don’t give up!,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Let’s keep fighting ALL TOGHETER (sic) against racism! #NOTORACISM #prince10 #handmade”.</p>
      <p>Footage appeared on social media suggesting former Manchester City and Liverpool forward Balotelli was reacting to racist abuse, with monkey chants clearly audible.</p>

      <p>Balotelli, who had picked up the ball and kicked it towards home fans, was convinced to stay by team-mates, Verona players and officials before referee Maurizio Mariani initiated the anti-racism protocol.</p>
      <p>Verona head coach Ivan Juric later denied there was any racist abuse directed towards.</p>
      <p>Boateng also kicked the ball at supporters when he was abused, before his Milan team-mates followed him off the pitch causing that match to be abandoned.</p>
