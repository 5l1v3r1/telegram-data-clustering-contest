      <p>BANGKOK: Talks are still underway with Goldman Sachs on the amount of compensation to be paid over the 1MDB scandal, with Malaysia prepared to take the matter to court, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday (Nov 4).</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir, speaking on the sidelines of the 35th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok, noted that Kuala Lumpur had previously rejected a previous offer from the US bank that was deemed too low.</p>

      <p>Goldman's role has been under scrutiny as it helped arrange bond issues worth billions for 1MDB, with Malaysia claiming large amounts were misappropriated in the process and seeking US$7.5 billion in redress.</p>
      <p>“They’ve caused us to lose about US$7 billion. They may not want to pay us that amount. Their (compensation) offer is too low, because of that we have not accepted their offer,” Dr Mahathir told Malaysian media.</p>
      <p>“But how much we’re willing to accept, of course, it’s based on the negotiation, out of court negotiation. But if we cannot reach an agreement, we’ve to go to court."</p>
