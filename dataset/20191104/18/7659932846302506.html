      <p>Judges, prosecutors and lawyers have staged an unusual protest at Algeria's Supreme Court to demand more judicial independence, amid resurgent tensions in the country's nine-month-old political crisis.<br/><br/>Hundreds of magistrates, many wearing traditional black-and-red robes, joined in Monday's demonstration in the capital Algiers, reported The Associated Press. It was prompted by anger over a military intervention Sunday to dislodge striking judicial officials in a courthouse in the city of Oran.<br/><br/>Many Algerian magistrates have been on strike for days over what they call increasing pressure from the government. They want the justice minister fired.<br/><br/>The government says strikers are a minority and their protests are preventing others from working.<br/><br/>The government wants the magistrates back at work before Algeria's December 12 presidential election, because they ensure elections are carried out according to the law.</p>
