      <h1>Dell is launching a 27-inch 4K monitor for pros that will keep itself calibrated</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:23:34+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>Dell makes plenty of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-monitor/">gaming monitors</a>, but for graphics professionals who demand accurate color reproduction, the company's new <a href="https://blog.dell.com/en-us/dell-brings-ultimate-screen-performance-to-adobemax/">UltraSharp 27 4K PremierColor</a> (UP2720Q) might fit the bill—and it certainly comes with a large one, at $1,999.99 (MSRP).</p>
      <p>One of the reasons for the comparatively high price tag is this is the first 27-inch 4K monitor to come with its own built-in colorimeter. While you can fiddle with a monitor's on-screen display (OSD) controls for a better looking image than what ships out of the box, an external colorimeter is commonly used by graphics professionals to ensure colors are accurate.</p>
      <p>"The built-in colorimeter helps users stay productive and get work done faster with quick and easy calibration—on-demand or scheduled after hours for consistent and optimized color performance every time. Users will also experience a more efficient workflow with a responsive built-in colorimeter that maintains consistency from production to delivery," Dell says. </p>
      <p>Assuming it works as advertised, the pop-up colorimeter along with automatic scheduled calibrations could be a boon for graphics pros.</p>
      <p>According to Dell, the UP2720Q offers 100 percent of the AdobeRGB color space, 98 percent of DCI-P3, and 80 percent of BT2020. In plain speak, this monitor boasts a wide color gamut, which often correlates with image quality.</p>
      <p>The caveat to all this is that this monitor is not exactly brimming with gaming features. Sure, the combination of an IPS panel with a 4K resolution and high color accuracy is desirable (if you have high-end hardware to drive a 4K gaming experience), but you won't find G-Sync or FreeSync support with this one, or other gaming amenities.  The response time is a bit underwhelming, too. It's rated at 8ms (gray to gray) in normal mode, and 6ms in fast mode.</p>
      <p>Of course, Dell isn't pitching this one as a gaming monitor. The reason we're writing about it is because it's the first in its class to have a built-in colorimeter, which is noteworthy. And technically, you <i>could</i> game on this thing (especially in fast mode), just there are better options out there, particularly in this price range.</p>
      <p>For those who are interested in the UP2720Q, though, it will be available in January 2020, after the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> have come and gone.</p>
