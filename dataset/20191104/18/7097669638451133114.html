      <h1>Mexican cartels making 'mass quantities' of fentanyl pills: US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:09:24+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Washington (AFP) - US authorities warned Monday that "mass quantities" of counterfeit prescription drugs laced with the opioid fentanyl are being produced in Mexico for distribution in North America.</p>
      <p>A sample of tablets seized in the US found that 27 percent contained potentially lethal doses of fentanyl, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
      <p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that US authorities blame for more than 100 deaths a day in the United States.</p>
      <p>Mexican drug cartels "are now sending counterfeit pills made with fentanyl in bulk to the United States for distribution," said the DEA's acting chief, Uttam Dhillon.</p>
      <p>"Counterfeit pills that contain fentanyl and fentanyl-laced heroin are responsible for thousands of opioid-related deaths in the United States each year," he said.</p>
      <p>On average, 130 people a day die in the United States of opioid overdoses, according to government statistics, which show that fentanyl is involved in more deaths than any other drug.</p>
      <p>The drug is 50 times more potent than heroine, with only a few milligrams enough to cause death.</p>
      <p>The DEA considers a lethal dose to be about two milligrams, but that varies according to an individual's physical size, tolerance, previous consumption and other factors.</p>
      <p>China, the biggest supplier of fentanyl in the United States, in May banned all precursor chemicals of fentanyl, an action applauded by the administration of Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>But experts at the time said the Chinese action could incentive production of those chemicals elsewhere, including Mexico.</p>
