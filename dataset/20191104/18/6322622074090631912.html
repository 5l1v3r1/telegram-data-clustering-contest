      <p>WASHINGTON (Nov 4): Global manufacturing shrank for a sixth straight month in October, as new export orders extended their longest downturn since 2002. At the same time, output and orders firmed in a sign factory activity is stabilizing.</p>
      <p>The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing Index stood at 49.8, after the prior month’s 49.7 — the third consecutive monthly improvement after bottoming in July. The new orders gauge reached a neutral point, after shrinking the previous five months.</p>
      <p>The production index edged up to a six-month high, albeit barely above the reading of 50 that is the dividing line between growth and contraction. In June and July, it stood at an almost seven-year low.</p>
      <p>Still, sluggish global demand and the effects of tariffs are limiting trade. The measure of export orders remained in contraction territory for a 14th straight month.</p>
      <p>The global purchasing managers’ index is compiled by IHS Markit and based on the results of surveys of more than 13,500 executives in over 40 countries that represent about 98% of global manufacturing value added.</p>
