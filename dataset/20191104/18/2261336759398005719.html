      <p>Darren Till is as real as it gets.</p>
      <p>In perhaps one of the most honest UFC post-fight interviews to date, the Liverpudlian opened up about his demons heading into UFC 244 and admitted he considered faking an injury to pull out of the Gastelum bout.</p>

      <p>The former UFC welterweight title challenger says he was ‘terrified’ of suffering another loss after dropping back-to-back stoppage defeats to Tyron Woodley and Jorge Masvidal.</p>
      <p>“There were times when I thought, ‘This fight’s not happening.’ I know there was a lot given over the weight cut video with Kelvin and that, but Kelvin probably just thought, ‘F*ck this, I’m gonna eat some s*it because he’s not turning up.’ And there was times when I just wanted to do it myself,” Till said after beating Gastelum via split decision in the UFC 244 co-main event at Madison Square Garden (<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/3/20946070/darren-till-discusses-facing-fears-at-ufc-244-i-wasnt-scared-i-was-terrified">h/t Alexander K. Lee of MMA Fighting)</a>.</p>
      <p>“So there was that and then I knew there was gonna be jet lag and I knew there was gonna be water retention for weight cutting. I didn’t know if the fight was happening and I had a few injuries and it’s just like that didn’t mean anything to me. I wanted to just get in there. I didn’t want to win. I didn’t want to lose. I just wanted to be in there and I don’t even know, I can’t say, it’s like I’ve been invincible all my life. I know my skill set I’ve got, I know I can beat any guy in any division, I know that with my skill set, you’ve seen that tonight. No. 4 Kelvin, look at the guys he’s knocking out. I know it wasn’t the most exciting fight, but he didn’t touch me, he just simply didn’t touch me and that’s no disrespect to him. That just shows my skill set.”</p>
      <p>(Also worth watching is Till’s incredibly raw and emotional post-fight interview with Adam Catterall of BT Sports)</p>

      <p>“But before <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/221/tyron-woodley">[Tyron] Woodley</a> there was no guy that could beat me and then two losses like that, it just took a lot away from me, inside of me. I didn’t say it, but I fought some hard demons and then obviously stuff like getting arrested and you lose sponsors, it’s like a f*cking whirlwind and it’s good and it’s bad,” he continued. “I tell ya, I was trying to fake an injury before walking out, I was thinking of an injury to fake because I just simply did not want to get in there. And this is probably things fighters don’t talk about, but you know me, I’m honest and that’s just where I was at. Now I’m here, confidence is back, like f*ck all these middleweights, I’m coming for everyone. It’s back.”</p>
      <p>Till suffered a knee injury in the lead-up to the Gastelum bout but the 26-year-old doesn’t think it will be much of a problem going forward.</p>
      <p>“Since Cowboy, I’ve just sort of put it to the back of my mind,” Till said of his lingering knee injury”. “I wrestle, I do everything with it, I stretch it, put it behind my head, I’m a flexible guy,” Till said. “It’s swelled up a little bit. This is what I always do, I’ll ice it and when it feels good I’ll just, ‘Okay, f*ck that,’ I’m probably gonna leave it, to be honest with you.</p>
      <p>“Most fighters feeling this right now would probably get surgery, but this is not a telltale for fighters to kick me because I can take low kicks, trust me. Ex-Muay Thai fighter, but we’ll see. It’s not that bad.”</p>
      <p>UFC 244 marked Till’s middleweight debut and, after earning a solid a win over the No. 4-ranked Gastelum, expect the British fan favorite to soon crack the UFC’s top-five.</p>
