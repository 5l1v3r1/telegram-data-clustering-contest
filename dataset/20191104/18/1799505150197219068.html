      <p>BROOKLYN, N.Y. (CN) – U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has unblocked a former New York politician on Twitter and apologized to him, just before she was to take the stand in his First Amendment lawsuit against her. </p>
      <p>A former Democratic assemblyman, Dov Hikind had <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ocasio-cortez-sued-for-blocking-users-on-twitter/">filed the suit</a> in July after 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez blocked him on the social media platform. Monday morning, he held a joyful press conference that he <a href="https://twitter.com/HikindDov/status/1191395529676050434?s=20">live-streamed</a> on Twitter. </p>
      <p>“You want to be in elected office, don’t be afraid of what people have to say to you,” said Hikind, 69, the founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>Ocasio-Cortez was called to testify in the Brooklyn federal court case Tuesday but will no longer attend, Hikind’s lawyer Jacob Weinstein confirmed. </p>
      <p>The controversy came after Ocasio-Cortez commented that migration centers on the U.S.-Mexico border were “concentration camps.” </p>
      <p>As someone whose mother was held at Auschwitz, Hikind said Monday, he took offense to the comparison. </p>
      <p>“It was an incredibly egregious, insensitive, uneducated, disrespectful comment to the memory of the 6 million who were murdered by the Nazis,” he said, adding that he sued almost immediately after she blocked him. The suit also came hours after a federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump cannot block critics on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit did not specify what specifically precipitated the blocking, but Hikind admits he has been critical of the freshman congresswoman on several occasions. </p>
      <p>“I could not be part of the conversation, I could not share my thoughts, my mouth was closed shut,” he said Monday. </p>
      <p>The New York Post broke the news of Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter reversal Monday and quoted her apology. </p>
      <p>“I have reconsidered my decision to block Dov Hikind from my Twitter account,” the statement begins. “Mr. Hikind has a First Amendment right to express his views and should not be blocked for them … In retrospect, it was wrong and improper and does not reflect the values I cherish. I sincerely apologize for blocking Mr. Hikind … Now and in the future, however, I reserve the right to block users who engage in actual harassment or exploit my personal/campaign account, @AOC, for commercial or other improper purposes.”</p>
      <p>In his press conference, Hikind invited Ocasio-Cortez to his community in Brooklyn to meet Holocaust survivors and let them share with her “what a concentration camp means to a survivor of the Holocaust,” he said. The congresswoman represents parts of the Bronx and Queens.</p>
      <p>Hikind’s lawyer Jacob Zev Weinstein said the parties will still meet in court Tuesday at 11 a.m. to discuss the settlement and the congresswoman’s statement. </p>
      <p>Lawyers for Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to phone calls or an email for confirmation or comment Monday morning. </p>
      <p>The lawsuit also asked for Ocasio-Cortez to cover Hikind’s attorney fees, though Weinstein would not comment Monday on whether that was a condition of the settlement.</p>
