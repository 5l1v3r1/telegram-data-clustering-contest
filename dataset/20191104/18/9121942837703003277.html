      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal jury has awarded $93.6 million to the former operator of the Port of Portland’s container terminal, finding the dock workers union sabotaged shipping traffic through years of labor slowdowns and stoppages.</p>
      <p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the Philippine-owned ICTSI Oregon, which signed a 25-year lease in 2010 to operate Terminal 6, left the port in 2017.</p>
      <p>The company says the terminal was idled by labor strife it says the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and its Local 8 chapter encouraged.</p>
      <p>That marked the effective end to Oregon’s only container terminal assessible by large ocean-crossing cargo vessels.</p>
      <p>The verdict followed a civil trial before U.S. District Judge Michael H. Simon in Portland and years of disputes in court and before the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
      <p>The union’s lawyers said declines in productivity at Terminal 6 resulted from a range of factors: market forces, geographic limitations of the port situated so far inland with a shallow river depth for big vessels and dismissive management that caused a demoralized workforce.</p>
