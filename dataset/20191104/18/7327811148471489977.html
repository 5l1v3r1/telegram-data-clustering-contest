      <p>BELMONT, Bronx (WABC) -- The victim of a <a href="https://abc7ny.com/exclusive-victim-of-violent-bronx-elevator-attack-speaks-out/5669830/">violent attack inside a Bronx elevator</a> is sharing his story first on Eyewitness News.</p>
      <p>The assault was caught on camera, but the man responsible remains on the run.</p>
      <p>When 67-year-old Ray Diaz returned to his building lobby in the area of Southern Boulevard in Belmont on Friday night, someone followed him from behind.</p>
      <p>"I went downstairs to get a cigarette because I ran out of cigarettes - it was around 11-11:30," he said, "I saw somebody hold the door but I didn't think nothing of it. And I just walked in the elevator."</p>
      <p>That man, with a hoodie over his head, asked the victim what floor he was on - and then out of nowhere came the hard blow.</p>
      <p>"Somebody knocked me down, I couldn't get up from the floor," Diaz said. "He wouldn't let me get up from the floor. He kept kicking me and kicking me in my face. Only in my face."</p>
      <p>The attack was so brutal it left him with severe bruises and cuts to the face and arm.</p>
      <p>There is security in the building's lobby, and Diaz said it just so happened that the guard had stepped outside during the moments before the attack.</p>
      <p>"Strange people come inside the building, and the security guard is not there to be aware," he said.</p>
      <p>The assault only lasted seconds - the suspect even wiped the elevator clean, likely for evidence, before taking off with nothing.</p>
      <p>"If somebody is in there that don't look right, that I don't know, I'm not going in there with him," the victim's mother, Angie Fernandez, said.</p>
      <p>Diaz, a military veteran, is now recovering at home.</p>
      <p>The attacker was last seen leaving in a minivan. He was wearing a black du-rag, gray hoodie, blue jeans, and black fur-lined boots.</p>
