      <p>The head of the Iranian Space Agency (ISA) Morteza Barari has announced that Iran plans to launch three satellites in the near future.</p>
      <blockquote>"Following the implementation of the country's second decade-long space development program, three satellites are being developed to be ultimately put into orbit," Barari, who is also Iran's Deputy Minister of Communication and Information Technology, said on Sunday.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the senior official, the newly emerging space technology field has grown by 139 percent in 10 years, leading to  "major" developments in the country's economy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Barari noted that the development of space technology field can help increase efficiency in managing Iran's environmental and agricultural sectors.</p>
      <p>Iran has been working on <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910211077108316-iran-to-discuss-possibility-of-sending-its-astronaut-to-iss-with-russia----space-agency/">the development of space rockets and satellites</a> for over a decade, launching its first home-grown satellite into orbit in 2009, and successfully launching a biological payload into orbit in 2011.</p>
      <p>In late 2013, Iran launched a monkey into orbit, retrieving it after a 15-minute flight. Another satellite was launched in 2015. Iran’s Space Agency has made these advances despite having an extremely modest budget, which reportedly amounted to the equivalent of just $4.6 million during the 2017 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year,<a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910011076932337-iran-to-launch-three-satellites-this-year---state-tv/"> Iran attempted to send three satellites into orbit</a> but all the launches failed. </p>
