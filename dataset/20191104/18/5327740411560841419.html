      <p>“BCIT has always been addressed as a trades training school, and I want to make sure [everyone] [is] aware BCIT consists of much more than just trades… we have accredited degree programs, in engineering, we have technology programs, business programs, nursing programs – a lot more than just the trades,” Vcic explained.</p>
      <p>The school has five major campuses throughout the Fraser Valley including in Burnaby, North Vancouver, Richmond, Annacis Island and in downtown Vancouver. BCIT also offers training in specific programs at their satellite campuses in communities such as Maple Ridge and Langley, according to their website.</p>
      <p>“We encourage everyone to come and see what is out there for them… they may not know they want a career change,” said Vcic.</p>
      <p>The school offers full-time and part-time courses as well as the flexibility to take courses in the evenings and weekends.</p>
      <p>“We would teach them just about anything they would want to know,” said Vcic.</p>
      <p>The fair is free to attend, and people are reminded to bring their resume.</p>
      <p>“They just need to come with the willingness to learn,” said Vicic.</p>
