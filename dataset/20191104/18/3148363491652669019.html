      <h2>The headline might be that Terminator: Dark Fate is on track to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/box-office/terminator-dark-fate-box-office-flop-1203391309/">lose $100 million</a>, but here’s the real news…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:55:56+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">John Nolte</a></address>
      <p><i>Variety</i> reports that — and this is mind-blowing — “<i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> will end its box office run with an uninspiring $180 million to $200 million globally.”</p>
      <p>This sucker is gunna top out at $200 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>They brought back Linda Hamilton, they brought back James Cameron, and it’s going to bottom out at $200 million globally.</p>
      <p>How big of a fail is that…?</p>
      <p>In 1984, when there was no global market to speak of, and without indexing for inflation, the original <i>Terminator</i> grossed almost $80 million globally, which is closer to $220 million when you figure in inflation. And don’t forget, <i>Terminator</i> was not considered a big hit in theaters. Most of us found it on VHS.</p>
      <p>It gets worse…</p>
      <p><i>Terminator: Rise of the Machines</i> (2003), which everyone believes under-performed, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0181852/?ref_=bo_se_r_5">grossed</a> $433 million worldwide.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator Salvation</i> (2009), which is also seen as a disappointment, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0438488/?ref_=bo_se_r_6">grossed</a> $371 million worldwide.</p>
      <p><i>Terminator Genisys</i> (2015), which was seen as a flop, <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1340138/?ref_=bo_se_r_4">grossed</a> $440 million worldwide.</p>
      <p><i>Dark Fate’s</i> gunna top out at around half of its “disappointing” predecessors?</p>
      <p>How is it even possible to do worse than clunkers like <i>Salvation</i> and <i>Genisys</i> when you reunite Arnold, Cameron, and  Hamilton?</p>
      <p>What a fail.</p>
      <p>But for all the flaws in the previous three sequels, those were at least not sold to the public as social justice lectures about how the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-01/terminator-dark-fate-linda-hamilton-mackenzie-davis-natalia-reyes">future is female</a>, about how we should open our borders to anyone who wants to come here, about how  the idea of fate is no longer about a mother protecting the future, but a GRRRRL-empowered Hispanic illegal alien Who *Is* The Protector of the Future — because in 2019 America, the toxic theme of all-about-me narcissism is what Hollywood’s selling.</p>
      <p>Did no one learn anything from the <i>Lady Ghostbusters</i> debacle?</p>
      <p>Going back some 50 years, going back to Pam Grier, Sigourney Weaver in <i>Aliens,</i> Linda Hamilton in <i>Terminator 2</i>, Milla Jovovich in six — count ’em, six! — <i>Resident Evil</i> movies, America has accepted female action heroes without blinking an eye. But Hollywood was more sophisticated and mature back then. Instead of jamming it down our throats as a lecture, instead of attacking and marginalizing men with this “future is female” crap, we were served great movies with believable characters and universal themes.</p>
      <p><i>Hunger Games, Salt, Long Kiss Goodnight, Tomb Raider, Kill Bill, Charlie’s Angels, Wonder Woman, Mad Max: Fury Road, Silence of the Lambs, Lucy, Underworld</i>…. A half-century of this stuff.</p>
      <p>This is a country more than willing to accept female action heroes, if they are presented to us as fellow human beings, as opposed to these obnoxious, anti-male political statements that pretend American women live in some sort of repressed patriarchy.<br/>Things are going so week in America, so good, that Hollywood left is inventing problems and causes, and hoping to gaslight us into going along with the delusion.</p>
      <p>But this is what happens when you live in an elite, pure-blue bubble and on Twitter — you become a Woketard.</p>
