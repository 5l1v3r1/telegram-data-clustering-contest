      <h1>Selena Gomez Freaked Out Over 'Lose You to Love Me' Becoming Her First #1 Song on the Hot 100</h1>

      <p>Selena Gomez hit a major milestone today: For the first time ever in her career, Gomez has the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542511/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-number-one-hot-100">#1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 chart</a>. Gomez's intimate breakup ballad,<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29553902/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-meaning-justin-bieber/"> "Lose You to Love Me,"</a> got the honor last week, during its first full week of streaming. It is also #1 on<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/charts/songs/"> the Rolling Stone 100</a>. Gomez commented on a fan's post in disbelief of the double-chart news. "Wait is that real?! Lol," she wrote. Yes, it's real.</p>

      <p>Gomez posted four Instagram Stories marking the Hot 100 achievement and showcasing her sheer shock. "WHAT?! Omg!! Thank you so much @billboardcharts for a first for me. I'm so grateful!" she wrote on her first Instagram Story, a repost of the article screenshot song co-writer Julia Michaels shared.</p>

      <p>Gomez also shared a grid post where she wrote her extended thoughts about the honor. "My first number 1!! This song is so dear to my heart," she captioned a shot celebrating the single's achievement. "I’ve been working so hard to make this album as honest and fun as possible while remaining vulnerable enough to share where I am in life. I love you deeply and thank you so much for listening. I want to thank each and every person that was apart of this moment that I’ll never forget!"</p>
