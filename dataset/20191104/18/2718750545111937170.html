      <h1>Harry Styles and His Hips Announce New Album, Launching Fans Straight Into Space</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T18:03:13+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>Prepare for liftoff because <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/its-time-to-take-harry-styles-seriously.html">Harry Styles</a> has finally announced the name, release date, and cover for his <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/harry-styles-new-album-rolling-stone-interview.html">sophomore solo album</a>, launching fans straight into orbit. According to his very succinct tweet, <i>Fine Line</i> will be released on December 13, hopefully with more photos like the cover art, in which Styles is flirty in fish-eye. Based on the trajectory of his hips in the photo, we’ll be floating past the moon for decades to come. Space is our home now. <i>Fine Line</i> arrives two years after Styles’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/harry-styles-made-the-most-intriguing-pop-album-of-the-year.html">self-titled</a> debut solo album. The first single, “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/harry-styles-lights-up-song-review.html">Lights Up,</a>” and its music video are already here for your planet-orbiting pleasure.</p>

      <p>Other questions regarding the upcoming album: Whose hand is in that black glove? We don’t remember participating in the shoot! Will he debut another single while pulling double duty on <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/snl-harry-styles-to-host-november.html"><i>Saturday Night Live</i> on November 16</a>? And when will the website <a href="https://doyouknowwhoyouare.com/">DoYouKnowWhoYouAre.com</a> come into play? Styles has been cryptically tweeting a link to it before announcements. When you arrive on the site, it generates a note using your name. As of the album announcement, the note reads, “You are a fine line. TPWK. Love, H.” TPWK is Styles’s longtime motto, “Treat people with kindness.” The rest? A riddle we’ll have to wait until December 13 to solve.</p>
