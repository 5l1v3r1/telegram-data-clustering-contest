      <h2>The latest steps are to reduce conflict of interest situations at Credit rating agencies</h2>

      <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Monday tightened the governance and accountability norms for credit <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rating-agencies">rating agencies </a>(CRAs).</p>
      <p>Under the new norms, the managing director and chief executive officer (MD &amp; CEO) of a CRA will be barred from being a member of the rating committee. Further, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>has said the rating committees of a CRA will report to the chief ratings officer (CRO) and not the MD &amp; CEO.</p>
      <p>The latest steps are to reduce conflict of interest situations at CRAs. Experts said the new norms will help create a Chinese wall between individuals who are responsible to generate business and the members of rating committees who are tasked with finalising the rating.</p>
      <p>The issue assumes significance after the IL&amp;FS crisis, which had put a question mark on the practices followed by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rating-agencies">rating agencies.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>has said independent directors will comprise a third of the board of a CRA if the board is chaired by a non-executive director. In case the board of the CRA is chaired by an executive director, independent directors will comprise half the board.</p>
      <p>The regulator has also directed CRAs to set up ratings sub-committees and also nomination and remuneration committees. The CRO will directly report to the ratings sub-committee of the board of the CRA.</p>
      <p>During the rating process, CRAs have been directed to record minutes of the meeting with issuer management and incorporate it into the rating committee note.</p>
