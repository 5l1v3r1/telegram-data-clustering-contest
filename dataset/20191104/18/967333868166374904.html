      <p>Chinese <a href="http://sputniknews.com/viral/20190908/1076752829.html">smartphone</a> manufacturer Xiaomi is the leading single-brand retail network in the offline Indian market, according to a study conducted by Channelplay, a retail and channel solution provider, on Monday.</p>
      <p>The retail network of the manufacturer includes all the single brand retail outlets of Xiaomi - Mi Home, Mi Studio and Mi Stores. Samsung emerged as the second dominant player followed by Café Coffee Day, a café brand; <a href="http://sputniknews.com/europe/20190806/1076483015.html">Dominos</a> India; and Bata, a footwear brand.</p>
      <p>The study found that Xiaomi was 44 percent bigger than Samsung.</p>
      <blockquote>“The growth in offline <a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20190930/1076919942.html">retail</a> is largely motivated by the increasing need for experiential buying in Indian consumers. Many prefer a physical product experience before buying, and another significant proportion is reluctant to make online financial transaction, especially for high-value products. This has largely established the need for brand experience stores,” said Channelplay CEO Sundeep Holani.</blockquote>
      <p>“Channelplay’s research on Xiaomi’s retail presence provided a store count of 2500+ Mi Stores, 75+ Mi Home and 20+ Mi Studios, making Xiaomi the largest exclusive-brand retail network in the Indian market,” Holani added.</p>
      <p>Industries retailing a physical product were audited across apparel, footwear, jewellery, watches, electronics, pharmacy, furniture, furnishings and more.</p>
      <p>The other brands that were evaluated during the study included Lenovo, Kohler, McDonalds, Subway, Puma, Ferns and Petals. </p>
