      <p>An ex-government adviser accused of groping four female colleagues on a Christmas night out has been issued with a warning.</p>
      <p>Professor Alistair Leanord was with fellow workers from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde when the incidents took place in December 2017.</p>
      <p>The women complained to Queen ­Elizabeth ­University Hospital that Leanord, 56, had groped them at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow nightclub</a>.</p>
      <p>An anonymous complaint was also made to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nhs-scotland">General Medical Council</a>.</p>
      <p>The GMC investigated the ­allegations against Leanord, who was a medical adviser to the ­Scottish Government until the end of last year.</p>
      <p>Leanord, who is now a director of the Scottish Microbiology Reference Laboratories at Glasgow’s Royal Infirmary, claimed he couldn’t remember what happened that night.</p>
      <p>But he accepted the women had “perceived his ­behaviour” to be ­inappropriate or ­unacceptable.</p>
      <p>The GMC issued him with a warning.</p>
      <p>It said his conduct had brought the profession into disrepute but that he faced no further action.</p>
