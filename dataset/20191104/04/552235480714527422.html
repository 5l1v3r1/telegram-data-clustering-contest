      <h1>Hooded Night Raider sets up Scots 'superhero' group to help victims of crime</h1>
      <h2>The incognito volunteer dresses in ­a costume with the aim of helping victims of ­unreported crime after the scheme proved a success in America.</h2>

      <p>Night Raider is ­determined to “give victims of ­unreported crime a voice” and help them “speak up” about past trauma.</p>
      <p>The incognito volunteer, hidden in a hooded cloak, mask and goggles, is launching Scotland’s first branch of The Astrals – a group founded in Savannah, Georgia, in the US.</p>
      <p>Night Raider, whose identity cannot be revealed, said: “The Astrals is a group of volunteers dressed in ­original ­superhero costumes, who aim to help victims of ­unreported crime.</p>
      <p>“They can ­accompany those reporting a crime, stand by them during <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police ­investigations</a> or pass information on if they’re are too scared to do it themselves.</p>
      <p>“Every day, crime goes unreported and people are left in the dark. It’s important to put this to a stop.”</p>

      <p>Night Raider, ­originally from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a>, came across The Astrals online.</p>
      <p>He added: “Now Savannah recognises the group and projects its logo on to buildings to raise ­awareness.</p>
      <p>The costumes are a bit different but, in America, people have responded to it. It keeps The Astrals anonymous, makes the brand and it’s superhero imagery people respond too.”</p>
      <p>With a fellow ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>-based ­volunteer, Night Raider is now urging Scots in need to come forward.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve been in contact with Victim Support and the police. This is an extra way for people nervous about speaking out to report crime.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for The Astrals in Savannah said: “We were excited about the possibility of having a branch of our team in a whole other country.”</p>
