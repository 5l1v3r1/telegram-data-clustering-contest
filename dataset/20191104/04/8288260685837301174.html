      <h3>Villa sent Morelos message</h3>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has told Alfredo Morelos’ admirers the striker will ‘100 per cent’ be a Rangers player beyond the January transfer window.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are among the clubs to have been linked with the Colombia international, who continued a prolific run of form with a brace against Hearts on Sunday to secure Rangers’ spot in the Betfred Cup final.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has now scored 20 goals already this season for Gerrard’s side, who are level on points with Celtic in the race for the Scottish Premiership title.</p>
      <p>This week, he sparked concerns that an Ibrox exit could be on the cards in the near future when he spoke about January on a Colombian radio station.</p>
      <p>But Gerrard has said in no uncertain terms that his star forward will be going nowhere once the window re-opens.</p>

      <h3>Smith doing an 'unbelievable' job</h3>
      <p>Dean Smith has done an “unbelievable” job at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> and his work is going under the radar due to the success of other Premier League managers.</p>
      <p>That is the opinion of former Villa striker Darren Bent, who also highlighted the excellent starts made by Chris Wilder at Sheffield United and Graham Potter at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>But Bent, who spent four years at Villa Park in the top flight, believes <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a> is doing just as well.</p>
      <p>Wilder has guided the newly-promoted Blades to sixth in the table after 11 games, while Potter has Brighton in eighth in his first season in the Premier League.</p>

      <h3>Hat-trick hero</h3>
      <p>Rushian Hepburn-Murphy grabbed his Tranmere Rovers opportunity with open arms – with the striker netting a superb hat-trick against MK Dons.</p>
      <p>Before Saturday, the 21-year-old was yet to open his account for Rovers since joining the League One side on loan from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> in August.</p>
      <p>Hepburn-Murphy has been made to be patient this season with his start against the Dons only his third of the campaign so far.</p>
      <p>But he struck once in the first-half and twice in the second period to net his first career hat-trick at senior level and hand his side a vital three points to guide them away from the drop zone.</p>

      <h3>Liverpool fans loving McGinn</h3>
      <p>Liverpool fans want to see John McGinn at Anfield after Saturday’s 2-1 victory against Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Reds took all three points so extend their lead at the top of the Premier League, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">coming from behind after Trezeguet had fired Villa into a first-half lead.</a></p>
      <p>Late goals from Andy Robertson and Sadio Mane turned the game on its head and Jurgen Klopp’s side now have a six-point advantage over Manchester City.</p>
      <p>But it was <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> midfielder McGinn who caught the eye of plenty of Liverpool supporters.</p>

      <h3>VAR criticised</h3>
      <p>Martin Atkinson changed his mind when reviewing Roberto Firmino’s goal for Liverpool against Aston Villa, according to Andy Gray.</p>
      <p>With the Reds trailing 1-0, Firmino saw his header ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>The decision was initially given on the field before being checked, and upheld, by Atkinson, who was the VAR for the game.</p>
      <p>Footage showing Atkinson checking the decision by drawing a lane leading up to Firmino’s armpit and another up to the knee of Tyrone Mings, who was the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> player furthest back.</p>
      <p>And Gray has claimed Atkinson changed his mind by swapping the lines.</p>
