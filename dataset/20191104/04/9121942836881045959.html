      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) — A Maryland pediatrician has been convicted of sexually abusing an 18-year-old patient he had been treating since she was a baby.</p>
      <p>News outlets report Dr. Ernesto Torres was convicted Friday of second-degree assault and fourth-degree sexual offense of a patient. He was found not guilty of second-degree rape.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Charles Smith says the judge ruled the pediatrician didn’t use force during the assault, so found him not guilty of the rape charge. Sentencing is set for next month.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Torres’ initial indictment over the April assault led 11 more victims to come forward. He’s since been indicted on 65 other charges, including 43 counts of third-degree sex offenses and nine counts of child sex abuse. WBAL-TV reports the allegations span Torres entire medical career, starting in 1979.</p>
