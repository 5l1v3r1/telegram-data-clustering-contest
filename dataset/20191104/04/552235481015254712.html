      <p>A miracle tot with “half a smile” is catching the attention of model scouts from top clothing brands.</p>
      <p>Logan Stewart has defied medics since he was diagnosed with charge syndrome, a rare genetic condition, as a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/babies">newborn baby</a>.</p>
      <p>Three open-heart surgeries haven’t stopped the 16-month-old.</p>
      <p>Kids with charge syndrome can suffer with varying symptoms.</p>
      <p>His mum Chelsea, 27, said: “Logan is deaf, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/eyesight">visually impaired</a> and has a heart condition.</p>
      <p>He has facial palsy on one side of his face – it’s as if he has half a smile.”</p>

      <p>But Logan doesn’t let things get him down and has been asked to become a brand ambassador for children’s clothing store, Henry’s Wardrobe UK.</p>
      <p>Chelsea said: “The fact that the brand want him is amazing. Logan is gorgeous and no different from any other wee boy.”</p>
      <p>Logan’s dad, Danny, 29, said: “For a wee boy who’s been through so much, nobody would know. Logan’s so happy, brave and full of fun.</p>
      <p>“He’s such a fighter, he comes out of hospital treatment with his arms in the air and a smile on his face. We’re so proud.”</p>
      <p>Danny and Chelsea, who also have two-month-old daughter Isla, created a community of charge syndrome families after using Instagram to tell of Logan’s fight with the life-threatening condition.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Chelsea said: “Charge syndrome is so rare that doctors don’t know much about it. We don’t know what’s coming. It’s been horrific.</p>
      <p>“In Scotland, we know of one other child in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> with charge, so it’s great having the support from all over.</p>
      <p>Dr Paul Hart, of disability charity Sense Scotland, said: “It’s great the Stewarts’ Instagram account has touched so many lives and Logan is set to become a star.”</p>
