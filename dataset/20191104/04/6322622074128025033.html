      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): Malaysia's exports registered a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) decrease to RM77.7 billion in September 2019, while imports increased by 2.4%.</p>
      <p>Total trade, which was valued at RM147.1 billion, decreased RM4 billion or 2.7% as compared to September 2018.</p>
      <p>The Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) attributed the decline to the fall in exports of electrical &amp; electronic products (-RM4.1 billion), crude petroleum (-RM1.2 billion), refined petroleum products (-RM805.1 million), palm oil and palm oil-based products (-RM366.9 million), liquefied natural gas (-RM61.5 million) and natural rubber (-RM14.7 million).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there were RM101.5 million worth more of exports of timber and timber-based products during the period tracked.</p>
      <p>"Re-exports was valued at RM12.7 billion registering a decline of 17.6% y-o-y and accounted for 16.3% of total exports. Domestic exports also declined 2.9% (-RM2 billion) to RM65 billion," said the department's chief statistician Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir Mahidin in a statement today.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, imports registered an increase of 2.4% y-o-y to RM69.4 billion during the month.</p>
      <p>The increases in imports by end use was mainly attributed to intermediate goods (RM4 billion) followed by consumption goods (RM777 million) and capital goods (RM531.7 million), he added.</p>
      <p>This brings Malaysia's exports in the third quarter of 2019 to RM247 billion, down 1.9% y-o-y. Re-exports was valued at RM44 billion, down 9.2% y-o-y and accounting for 17.8% of total exports.</p>
      <p>Domestic exports decreased marginally by 0.2% to RM203 billion from a year ago, while imports also registered a decrease of 5.8% y-o-y to RM213.5 billion, said DOSM.</p>
