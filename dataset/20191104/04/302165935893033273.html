      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 4 — An elderly <i>kuih</i> seller has been inspiring Malaysians online with his positive and hardworking attitude towards life.</p>
      <p>Known as Pak Mail, the 73-year-old makes up to 2,000 pieces of <i>jemput-jemput</i> a day and sells them at 10 sen per piece at his roadside stall in Kluang, Johor every evening.</p>
      <p>He’s even doled out food for free during Ramadan for the past five years as a way of giving back to his community.</p>
      <p>When met by YouTube content creators FS Channel, Pak Mail said that he was thankful for his good health which enables him to continue working.</p>
      <p>“Alhamdulillah, I don’t have high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems.</p>
      <p>“My children don’t want me to continue doing this as I’m getting on with age, but selling <i>kuih</i> is my hobby,” he said in a video.</p>
      <p>As he fried up the delicious morsels, Pak Mail shared how he was widowed 23 years ago and that he was left to raise his 12 kids by himself.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to remarry but I had a lot of responsibilities, so I chose not to.”</p>

      <p>Pak Mail’s <i>jemput-jemput</i> comes in a variety of mouth-watering flavours, including dragonfruit and pineapple as well as a savoury option made up of rice, prawns, fish, and veggies.</p>
      <p>As a kind gesture, the guys behind FS Channel decided to buy out the stall for the day and told Pak Mail to give his food for free to his customers.</p>
      <p>The viral video has warmed the hearts of Malaysians, many of whom were reminded of their own fathers and grandfathers when watching Pak Mail.</p>
      <p>Social media users also commended him for continuing to work hard despite being a senior citizen.</p>
      <p>“Uncle’s face is just like that of my late grandfather, especially his smile,” said Shafiqah Shamsuri on YouTube.</p>
      <p>“No wonder this uncle is so healthy and is living a long life. He is a generous person,” said Facebook user Nur Annisa Ramadhani.</p>
