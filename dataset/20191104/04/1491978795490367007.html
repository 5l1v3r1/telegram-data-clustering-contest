      <p>The New England Patriots’ unbeaten season came to an end under the weight of their own mistakes and an inability to contain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> quarterback Lamar Jackson, who ripped apart the NFL’s stingiest defense with his arm and legs in a 37-20 victory Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Baltimore (6-2) zipped to an early 17-0 lead and let the Patriots (8-1) creep within striking distance before quelling the comeback with a 70-yard fumble return by Marlon Humphrey and a five-yard touchdown pass from Jackson to Nick Boyle early in the fourth quarter. That made it 30-20, and not even six-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady could drag New England out of the hole. Brady, who went 30 for 46 for 285 yards, threw an interception with 12:47 left. Jackson then led a methodical drive that lasted nearly 10 minutes and ended with his thrust into the end zone from the one-yard line.</p>
      <p>Jackson ran for 61 yards and two touchdowns and went 17 for 23 for 163 yards and a score. Mark Ingram ran for 115 yards, and the NFL’s leading rushing attack amassed 210 yards on the ground.</p>
      <p>And so ended New England’s 12-game winning streak, dating to last season and including the playoffs.</p>
