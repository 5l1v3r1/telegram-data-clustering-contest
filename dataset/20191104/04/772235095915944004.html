      <p><b>Infiniti</b> will give its most important 2020 models a new dual-screen infotainment system, complete with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, in the critical North American market.</p>
      <p>Although it already has a dual-screen infotainment system in its stable, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/">Nissan's</a> luxury arm has treated it to a number of updates, including an updated navigation system with Google imagery, and the ability to update maps with over-the-air updates.</p>
      <p>If you're not a fan of the inbuilt maps, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/infiniti/">Infiniti</a> has finally given its line-up Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Although it isn't a wireless system, the likes of which is offered by <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/bmw/">BMW</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a>, the move brings Infiniti's cars into line with what's on offer in the latest Nissan models.</p>
      <p>Infiniti says the hardware in the background has been given a boost, too. There's a new microphone for clearer audio on phone calls, and an updated Bluetooth receiver for faster connection.</p>
      <p>The new 'InTouch' system will come with a Wi-Fi hotspot capable of supporting seven devices, too, so the whole family can be online in the QX80.</p>

      <h3>Australia</h3>
      <p>The new system won't make its way to Australia, with an Infiniti spokesperson telling <i>CarAdvice </i>"there are no changes being made to the existing Infiniti product line up in Australia".</p>
      <p>Given the brand is <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/788699/infiniti-to-exit-australia/">withdrawing from Australia late in 2020</a>, or earlier if it manages to sell its stock, that comes as no surprise.</p>
