      <p>Simon Cowell has announced he is launching another version of the X Factor, which will provide direct competition to a rival talent show from Little Mix.</p>
      <p>Cowell told The Sun he had axed the proposed X Factor All Stars series, which had been set to premiere next month and feature previous winners including Leona Lewis and Alexandra Burke.</p>
      <p>Instead, the 60-year-old music mogul will premiere X Factor The Band, to find new all-male and all-female groups.</p>

      <p>It will be a direct rival to The Search, the talent show set to be launched by Little Mix on BBC1 next year.</p>
      <p>Cowell, who helped launch Little Mix’s career on the X Factor and had them on his record label before a split last year, said he was relishing the competition.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: “This is what really happened. I was approached to co-produce that show last year by Little Mix’s management.</p>
      <p>“I told them the problem was we have a conflict of interest because we are launching X Factor The Band in 2020. We were told their show was going to launch in 2021.</p>

      <p>“Then we had the fallout and find out Little Mix were bringing their show forward. Was that intentional because we are doing our show? I have no idea.</p>
      <p>“But regardless, it was too much fun not to do this year. I would rather it was us doing it first.</p>
      <p>“It 100% makes it more exciting there being a battle.”</p>
      <p>The Search will see Little Mix – consisting of Perrie Edwards, Jesy Nelson, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall  – going back to their talent show roots to mentor new talent.</p>
      <p>They won the 2011 series of The X Factor as a group, having been formed on the show after originally auditioning as solo singers.</p>
      <p>The winner of The Search will have the opportunity to join Little Mix on their summer tour in 2020.</p>
