      <h1>Ross says licenses for US companies to sell to Huawei coming ‘shortly’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:38:56+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said licenses for US companies to sell components to China’s Huawei will come “very shortly,” in an interview with Bloomberg published on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Ross said the licenses “will be forthcoming very shortly” and that the US government had received 206 requests.</p>
      <p>“That’s a lot of applications – it’s frankly more than we would’ve thought,” Ross added.</p>

      <p>Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>In May, Huawei, the world’s largest telecoms equipment provider, was put under a US blacklist citing national security concerns, effectively banning it from buying American-made parts without a special license, while US companies were banned from selling to Huawei without carrying a special license.</p>

      <p>US President Donald Trump promised in June to provide some relief to firms that did business with Huawei.</p>
      <p>On US-China trade developments, Ross said there was no reason the deal could not be on track to be signed this month.</p>
      <p>“We are in good shape, we are making good progress, and there is no natural reason why it could not be,” Bloomberg quoted Ross as saying.</p>
