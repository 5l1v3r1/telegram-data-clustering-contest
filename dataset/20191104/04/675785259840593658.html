      <h1>Joaquin Phoenix opens up about the chances of a sequel to hit film Joker</h1>
      <h2>Director Todd Phillips says he will "do anything Joaquin wants to do" - so will we see part two any time soon?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:01:04+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joaquin-phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a> has teased the idea of a Joker sequel in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>Fans will be very interested to read his comments - but he says he won't do one just for the sake of it.</p>
      <p>The star has earned rave reviews for his performance which followed the dark journey of failed comedian Arthur Fleck</p>
      <p>It saw him turn into a dangerous killer in a bleak view of Gotham City in the 1980s - and fans couldn't get enough.</p>
      <p>Now another movie isn't being ruled out.</p>
      <p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-01/joker-sequel-joaquin-phoenix-fan-theories">LA Times</a>, he appears to not be ruling anything out and joked that he told director Todd Phillips they should get going on the next one before the last film finished.</p>

      <p>“Long before the release or before we had any idea if it would be successful, we talked about sequels,” the actor said.</p>
      <p>“In the second or third week of shooting, I was like, ‘Todd, can you start working on a sequel? There’s way too much to explore.’ It was kind of in jest - but not really.</p>
      <p>“I basically said, ‘You could take this character and put him in any movie’."</p>
      <p>Phillips says that he and Phoenix would only do one if there was a "compelling creative reason".</p>

      <p>“We haven’t talked about it a ton,” the director said. “We’ve only talked about the fact that if we ever did one - and I’m not saying we are because right now we’re not - it couldn’t just be this wild and crazy movie about the ‘Clown Prince of Crime.’</p>
      <p>"That just doesn’t interest us. It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that this does.</p>
      <p>“Because I think that’s ultimately why the movie connected. I think the reason why it’s resonating is what’s going on underneath the movie.</p>

      <p>"So many movies are about the spark, and this movie is about the powder. If you could capture that again in a real way, that would be interesting.</p>
      <p>"The quote was, 'I will do anything Joaquin wants to do.' And I would.</p>
      <p>"But the movie's not set up to have a sequel. We always pitched it as one movie, and that's it."</p>
