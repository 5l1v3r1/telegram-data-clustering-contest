      <p>Strictly celebrity Alex Scott was seen telling off host Claudia Winkleman for letting slip that she was being cheered on by a member of One Direction.</p>
      <p>During an on-screen chat between Alex and Claudia, the former footballer was left blushing after Claudia revealed that one of the 1D boys was rooting for her to win the show.</p>
      <p>Claudia said: "We had to find this out for ourselves because you haven't made a fuss about it.</p>
      <p>"You have some major celebrity fans."</p>

      <p>While Alex replied that she still had some football supporters, Claudia used the moment to cheekily add: "And one of One Direction..."</p>
      <p>Visibly shocked, former Arsenal ladies star Alex gave Claudia a sharp nudge and replied: "That was meant to be between us."</p>
      <p>The athlete nervously giggled as Claudia apologised, adding: "I didn't say which one. There's millions of them."</p>

      <p>However, this was enough to get the rumour mill churning as fans flooded <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> with their own speculations.</p>
      <p>One posted: “I wanna know who from one direction is a fan of Alex … I have a feeling it's Niall #Strictly."</p>
      <p>Another begged: “Alex has a One direction fan?? I need to know who it is @ClaudiaWinkle tell us please! @AlexScott spill the beans! #Strictly."</p>
      <p>While a third pondered: “Wonder which member of one direction is a of Alex? #Strictly."</p>
      <p>Alex is partnered with Strictly pro Neil Jones, but has been performing with last year’s winner Kevin Clifton for the last two weeks as Neil sits out with injuries.</p>
