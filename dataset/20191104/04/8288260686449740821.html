      <h2>Latest Wolves transfer news | WWFC are being linked with two Championship players ahead of January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T04:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are monitoring Karlan Grant and Ben Davies ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield Town striker Grant and Preston North End defender Ben Davies have both been stand-out performers for their respective sides in the Championship this season.</p>
      <p>Grant, 22, has netted nine goals in 15 games for the Terriers who dispensed with the services of Jan Siewert in August before appointing Danny Cowley as manager.</p>
      <p>According to the Sun, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> are keeping close tabs on his performances ahead of a potential approach when the window re-opens.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>26-year-old Davies has been an ever-present in defence for Preston, who have stormed to the top of the table under Alex Neil.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1199333/Wolves-transfer-news-Preston-North-End-Ben-Davies-January-Nuno-Espirito-Santo">The Express</a> report that Wolves are preparing a £10m bid for him in January having scouted him on several occasions recently.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> will be without Willy Boly for an extended period after the centre-back <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/willy-boly-injury-update-wolves-17174673">had surgery for a fractured fibula.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Wolves chairman Jeff Shi <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/wolves-chairman-jeff-shi-reveals-17178293">spoke about the upcoming window in a recent interview.</a> Asked whether Fosun are willing to dig deep, he told wolves.co.uk: “Of course. We are always ready to invest. Don’t worry about it. If we need to strengthen the squad of course we have the capacity to do that in January.</p>
      <p>“The philosophy of the club is to do the right deal. We don’t want to do something wrong and spend some money on a player who never plays well. You can see some examples at other clubs so I hope we can avoid that.”</p>
