      <h1>Ousted McDonald’s chief is allowed to keep $37m in stock awards</h1>

      <p>Fired McDonald’s chief executive Stephen Easterbrook will get to keep stock awards worth over $37m (£28.7m), in addition to $675,000 severance and health insurance benefits.</p>
      <p>The ousted boss will be allowed to keep $23.5m in stock options and may benefit from grants of restricted shares related to McDonald’s performance worth around $13.8m, according to calculations by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook will also be eligible for a bonus for his work completed in this fiscal year if the company hits its performance goals, in addition to six months of severance pay as part of his termination agreement.</p>
      <p>“In consideration for benefits, Mr. Easterbrook has agreed to a release of claims in favor of the company,” McDonald’s announced in a regulatory filing. </p>
      <p>Easterbrook will receive roughly $650,000 in severance pay after six months, based on his 2018 salary of $1.35m. He will also be entitled to a year and a half of health benefits.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s announced today that the firm’s global chief people officer David Fairhurst will also leave the company, but did not provide any further details.</p>
      <p>Chris Kempczinski, head of US operations at McDonald’s, has been announced as new chief executive of the fast food company.</p>
      <p>Kempczinski, who joined the company in 2015 as an executive vice president, will receive an annual base salary of $1.25m, McDonald’s said today.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Kempczinski thanked his predecessor for his contributions and said he was a “patient and helpful mentor.” </p>
      <p>British-born Easterbrook was fired from McDonald’s on Sunday after it was revealed he was having a relationship with an employee, which, though consensual, violated company policy.</p>
      <p>In an email to staff, Easterbrook — who is divorced — acknowledged that the relationship was a mistake. “Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Chicago-based company’s shares fell over three per cent in morning trading.</p>
