      <h1>Fox News anchor accuses liberal contributor of 'covering up' Biden corruption</h1>

      <p>Fox News anchor Steve Hilton accused liberal network contributor Marie Harf of engaging in a cover-up to protect former Vice President Joe Biden from corruption in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>On Monday's edition of <i>Outnumbered, </i>which aired moments after House committees released <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-committees-release-first-transcripts-from-closed-door-impeachment-hearings">transcripts of two witness testimonies</a>, Hilton alleged that the "deep state" is actually "protecting Joe Biden."</p>
      <p>“These people inside the bureaucracy, the other thing they are doing is protecting Joe Biden, because the only real corruption allegation here is against Joe Biden,” Hilton declared. "He was in charge of Ukraine policy. He supervised billions of dollars of aid that went from the U.S. taxpayer to Ukraine. Much of that went to Burisma, a gas company that was paying his son. How much money did Joe Biden channel to his son’s business? That's the corruption allegation.”</p>
      <p>He went on to accuse <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/john-kerrys-son-cut-business-ties-with-hunter-biden-over-ukrainian-oil-deal">former Secretary of State John Kerry</a> of corruption.</p>

      <p>“There’s no evidence that anything you just ... I worked at the State Department then,” Harf exclaimed.</p>
      <p>“So you’re covering up the corruption, too if you defend it,” Hilton fired back, leading Harf to reply, “Are you kidding me?!”</p>
      <p>“I am on this couch with you talking the news,” she added. “Please don’t accuse me of covering something up.”</p>
      <p>He insisted, "You are because you are saying there's no evidence I've just given you the evidence."</p>
