      <h1>Naim Audio brings AirPlay 2 support to its high-end network streamers with software update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:28:04+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Hi-fi company Naim Audio has <a href="https://naimaudionewsroom.com/2019/11/04/apple-airplay-2-and-siri-support-coming-to-naims-high-end-network-streamers/">announced</a> that it is rolling out AirPlay 2 support to a lineup of its network streamers. This is a continuation of Naim’s AirPlay 2 rollout, with the latest additions including its most high-end network player.</p>
      <p>Naim first started rolling out AirPlay 2 and Siri <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/11/13/naim/">support last November</a>, adding it to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2reDvyL">Mu-so and Uniti lineups</a> through software updates. Starting today, Naim is expanding AirPlay 2 support to the ND 555, NDX 2, and ND5 XS 2.</p>
      <p>The company says:</p>
      <blockquote>Naim Audio, the British hi-fi specialist with 46 years of audio expertise, today announced that Apple AirPlay® 2 will be added to its ND 555, NDX 2 and ND5 XS 2 network streamers via a free over-the-air update. Apple AirPlay 2 enables advanced multi-room functionality and Siri voice control and will now be available across the company’s entire family of music-streaming products, including its £20k flagship reference network player.</blockquote>
      <p>The updates can be installed via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/naim/id381694252">Naim application on iOS</a>.</p>
      <p>The Naim Audio ND 555 retails for $24,698 and is marketed as the company’s “reference network streamer.” The NDX 2 goes for $5,999, and is described as “versatile, feature-packed, and sonically brilliant.” Last but not least, the ND5 XS 2 is the “entry-level” option at $2,799.</p>
      <p>If it’s not clear from those price points, Naim Audio is an ultra-premium hi-fi audio company. For the audiophiles who can appreciate Naim’s sound quality and other features, the addition of AirPlay via a free software update will certainly be useful.</p>
