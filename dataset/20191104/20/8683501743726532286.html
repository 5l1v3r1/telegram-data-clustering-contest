      <p>It’s now been a month since <i>Joker</i> came out, and the movie has made a lot of waves in that time, from its <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483689/joker-is-about-to-hit-another-huge-box-office-milestone">incredible commercial performance</a> to the iconic steps that Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck dances down <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482891/see-how-crowded-jokers-stairs-are-now-that-theyre-a-tourist-trap">becoming a popular tourist destination</a>. Director and co-writer Todd Phillips has now shared some unseen behind-the-scenes looks at the making of <i>Joker</i>, and one of the photos shows a a reference to longtime Batman Family character Catwoman.</p>

      <p>Although <i>Joker</i> largely steered clear of the Batman mythology, there was a few examples of the Caped Crusader’s source material being adapted, like the story being set in Gotham City and the Wayne family, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481687/joker-actor-explains-that-thomas-wayne-twist">specifically Thomas Wayne</a>, being involved in what happens to Arthur Fleck. As seen in the above photo, one of the more subtler nods towards the environment people know The Joker best from was a page in Arthur’s notebook showing a scantily-clad woman whose top half has been replaced with a cartoon cat, as well as another woman on top of a different illustrated cat.</p>
      <p>This is obviously far more obscure than if Todd Phillips and the <i>Joker</i> team had done something like mention how <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483615/jokers-todd-phillips-is-playing-cagey-about-what-was-real-or-in-arthurs-mind">Arthur Fleck</a> knew a woman named Selina Kyle, but this is nonetheless an interesting <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482164/any-joker-easter-eggs-are-mistakes-or-the-art-department-trolling-todd-phillips">Easter egg</a>. And who knows, now that Arthur has paved the way for insanity to thrive in Gotham City, maybe in the <i>Joker</i> world, eventually a cat burglar that models herself after an actual feline will emerge. But in this instance, these Cat-women are just among the weirder entries in Arthur’s notebook.</p>
      <p>What makes this Catwoman reference more special is the fact that she and The Joker have existed for exactly the same amount of time. Both debuted in 1940’s <i>Batman</i> #1, and while Joker has remained Batman’s great adversary after all these decades, Catwoman has evolved from being a straightforward villain to an anti-hero and frequent ally to Batman, not to mention his most well-known love interest.</p>
      <p>The is just one of the many behind-the-scenes <i>Joker</i> photos that Todd Phillips <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4bFnC5pZFy/?utm_source=ig_embed">shared on Instagram</a>. Others include Joaquin Phoenix going through the clown makeup process, Phillips sitting with Robert De Niro on the set of Murray Franklin’s talk show and a close-up shot of the card Arthur Fleck carries around informing people of his pathological laughing condition. Don’t be surprised if Phillips shares more photos as we get closer to <i>Joker</i> wrapping up its time on the big screen.</p>
      <p>For now, <i>Joker</i> is intended to be a standalone tale, although there have been talks about potentially <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483698/joaquin-phoenix-made-a-wonderfully-creative-argument-for-a-joker-sequel">continuing Arthur Fleck’s narrative in a sequel</a>. As for Catwoman, one shouldn’t hold out hope of her being present in a hypothetical <i>Joker</i> follow-up, but she is returning to the big screen relatively soon.</p>
      <p>It was announced last month that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482258/the-batman-has-cast-its-catwoman">Zoë Kravitz will play Catwoman in 2021’s <i>The Batman</i></a>, which also stars Robert Pattinson as the eponymous protagonist, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483219/riddle-us-this-5-roles-that-show-why-paul-dano-is-perfect-for-the-riddler">Paul Dano as The Riddler</a>. This will be Kravitz’s second time getting to bring Catwoman to life, having previously voiced the character in 2017’s <i>The LEGO Batman Movie</i>.</p>
