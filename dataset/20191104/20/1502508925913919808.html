      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/railway-board">Railway Board </a>on Monday gave clearance to establish Bengaluru suburban rail, said Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi.</p>
      <p>"In order to fast track the Bengaluru Suburban Rail, the extended <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/railway-board">railway board </a>met today and gave its clearance," tweeted Angadi.</p>
      <p>Assuring Bengaluru residents, Angadi said he will make all efforts with Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to ensure the implementation of Bengaluru suburban rail at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Thanking Angadi, Bengluru South MP Tejasvi Surya tweeted, "Karnataka is lucky to have him (Angadi) handling the railway ministry."</p>
      <p>Surya expressed hope that Bengaluru suburban rail will be completed during Angadi's tenure and help the city dwellers achieve ease of living.</p>
      <p>The 148 km Bengaluru suburban rail proposal with four corridors has been a much delayed project, languishing for decades.</p>
      <p>The four proposed corridors include KSR Bengaluru city to Devanahalli, Chikkabanavara to Yeshwantpur to Byappanahalli, Heelalige to Yelahanka to Rajanukunte and Kengeri to KSR Bengaluru to Whitefield.</p>
