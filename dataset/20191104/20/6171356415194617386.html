      <h1>The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 is just $450, its lowest price ever ($200 off MSRP)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:07:52+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p>Among Android tablet manufacturers, few make premium tablets as nice as the Galaxy Tab S series from Samsung. If you had decided to skip out on the Galaxy Tab S4 earlier due to its high price, then you may want to take a look again. Several stores — <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/galaxy-tab-s4-10-5-s-pen-included-64gb-black-wi-fi-sm-t830nzkaxar/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/aa297474">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FNZHWH2?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s4-10-5-64gb-black/6267302.p?skuId=6267302">Best Buy</a> — are selling the WiFi 64GB Galaxy Tab S4 at its lowest price ever of $450, 31% off its MSRP.</p>
      <p>When the Galaxy Tab S4 came out last year, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/08/galaxy-tab-s4-review-overpriced-tablet-alsot-horrible-laptop/">we liked it</a> for its gorgeous 10.5" AMOLED screen, massive 7,300 mAh battery, and its low weight. As a media consumption device, the Galaxy Tab S4 excels with its 2560 x 1600 high-contrast HDR screen, Dolby Atmos speakers, and its 16:10 aspect ratio. Plus, it officially supports microSD cards up to 400GB for further expansion of your picture and video libraries, something you can't do with iPads.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy Tab S4 also offers some nice features for those focused on productivity — the S pen for note-taking and drawing, and an optional keyboard cover and Samsung DeX to transform your tablet into a laptop-like device. Ultimately, we didn't end up recommending it last year due to its $650 asking price and lack of Android app optimizations in general. At $450, however, the equation changes a bit.</p>
      <p>In addition to that base deal, Best Buy also offers shoppers the option to purchase the Tab S4 in differently priced open-box configurations.</p>
