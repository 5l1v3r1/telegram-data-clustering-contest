      <p>This weekend, the Irishman was full of praise after one of his acts Kevin McHale gave a strong performance on Saturday night's live show.</p>
      <p>Louis decided that Kevin deserved his coveted safe seat pass to send him through to the next live show.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But some viewers noticed that before Louis pressed the buzzer, the autocue behind him read "Congrats through to next week."</p>
      <p>This left some people convinced that the moment was pre-planned.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“'Congrats. Through to next week' on the autocue. No so spontaneous eh Louis Walsh? #xfactor #isitafix #celebrityxfactor." tweeted one viewer.</p>
      <p>Another commented: "Is this that #DanceMonkey song that #kevinmchale is doing?</p>
      <p>"Great performance. BUT did anyone notice the autocue was ready to prompt Dermot to say he was through to next week before Louis had even pressed the button?"</p>
