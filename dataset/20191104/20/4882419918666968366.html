      <p>Galatasaray will not be able to call on star forward Radamel Falcao to play Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, because the player has not recovered from a tendon injury.</p>
      <p>Falcao got injured at PSG on October 4 and is taking treatment in Spain at the moment. Falcao might, as a former Atletico Madrid player, have liked to take on Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>The Colombian legend will stay in Spain getting treatment until Nov. 11, as revealed by Galatasaray medic Yener Ince on their social media accounts.</p>
