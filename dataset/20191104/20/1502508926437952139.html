      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:13:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sundar Sethuraman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bajaj-finance">Bajaj Finance </a>on Monday launched its Rs 8,500-crore qualified institutional placement (QIP). The shares will be offered in the range between Rs 3,860 and Rs 3,900 apiece. The share sale will help <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bajaj-finance">Bajaj Finance </a>expand its lending at a time when non-banking finance <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>(NBFCs) sector is plagued by a liquidity crisis.</p>
      <p>The shares of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bajaj-finance">Bajaj Finance </a>ended Monday's session at Rs 4,116. The offer price is at a discount of 5.2 to 6.2 per cent to the closing price on Monday.</p>
      <p>The share price of Bajaj Finance rose 55 per cent since the beginning of 2019, while the benchmark Sensex rose 11.8 per cent during the same period. In 2019, eight <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>have raised Rs 22,312 crore through QIPs, against 25 that had raised Rs 16,587 crore in the previous year.</p>
      <p>JM Financial, Axis Capital, Kotak Mahindra Capital, Morgan Stanley, and Nomura are advising the company on the share sale. The QIP would make valuation reasonable with the rise in book value.</p>
