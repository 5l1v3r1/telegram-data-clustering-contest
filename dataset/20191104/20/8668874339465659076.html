      <p>England coach Eddie Jones arrived back in London on Monday giving little away about his future as the Rugby Football Union prepared to start its World Cup debrief.</p>
      <p>The 31-strong <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> squad made a low-key return from their World Cup campaign in Japan, two days after their sobering 32-12 defeat by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in the final in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>There was no media access at Heathrow Airport and, although a few cheers rang out from waiting fans, there was no reaction from the players as they made their way into the arrivals hall in terminal 5.</p>
      <p>Jones, whose long-term future is up in the air, also gave little away as he walked expressionless through the barriers.</p>
      <p>He is contracted for another two years but RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney wants the 59-year-old Australian to commit for the next tournament in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> in 2023.</p>
      <p>“One of the first priorities …will be to sit down and have a chat. We will do it as a matter of urgency,” Sweeney said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Eddie is committed to his contract through to the end of August 2021 and he is fulfilling that.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of emotions flying around after a game so let the dust settle a little bit and then see where his head’s at, see how he feels about it.</p>
      <p>“But the first step is to honour that contract through to 2021 and then we’ll discuss what goes on beyond that.”</p>
      <p>England’s low-key return was a far cry from 2003, when Clive Woodward’s triumphant England team brought London to a standstill as they paraded the Webb Ellis trophy on two open-top buses past an estimated 750,000 crowd in the centre of the capital.</p>

      <p>Plans for a similar victory parade were scrapped when Jones’ men lost to the Springboks in Saturday’s final.</p>
      <p>Jones admits a number of the 31-man squad are to be jettisoned for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> as he begins rebuilding for the next assault on the global stage.</p>
      <p>“I tell you what happens to teams – they evolve,” said Jones in the wake of England’s Yokohama defeat.</p>
      <p>“Some guys will lose desire, some guys will lose fitness, some guys will get injuries, and there’ll be young guys come through. So this team is finished now.</p>
      <p>“There will be a new team made – we’ll make a new team for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> and that new team for the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> will be the basis of going to the next World Cup.</p>
      <p>“And I’ll have them for the first two years.”</p>
