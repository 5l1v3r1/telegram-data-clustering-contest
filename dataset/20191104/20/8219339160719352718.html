      <h1>Apple pushes developers to update Push Notification Service API before November 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:13:53+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Apple has also shared a developer update about changes to age ratings in the App Store in Brazil. Find the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11042019b&amp;1572906872">details here</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple has shared a warning today to developers who use its Push Notification Service about upcoming changes and requirements.</p>
      <p>Apple detailed the reminder on its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11042019a&amp;1572897862">developer site</a> to change to the HTTP/2-based APNs provider API which comes with new features and benefits.</p>
      <blockquote>If you send push notifications with the legacy binary protocol, we recommend updating to the HTTP/2-based APNs provider API as soon as possible. You’ll be able to take advantage of great modern features, such as authentication with a JSON Web Token, improved error messaging, and per-notification feedback.<br/><br/>The Apple Push Notification service (APNs) will no longer support the legacy binary protocol as of November 2020.</blockquote>
