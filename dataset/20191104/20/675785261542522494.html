      <h1>British teenager banned by Fortnite for cheating in video streamed live on YouTube</h1>
      <h2>Jarvis Kaye - known as FaZe Jarvis - has had to issue a grovelling apology to his two million fans on YouTube</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:54:44+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A British teenager has been banned from playing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fortnite">Fortnite</a> after he was caught cheating in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/video-games">video</a> broadcast live to his two million YouTube fans.</p>
      <p>Jarvis Kaye - known as FaZe Jarvis - uploaded videos showing him using "aimbots", which allow competitors to shoot others without taking careful aim.</p>
      <p>But in a tearful apology video, the teenager claims he was unaware this was forbidden.</p>
      <p>Epic Games, which makers Fortnite, gave him a permanent ban anyway.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to take accountability for my actions and I understand completely why this has happened, I just wish I had known how severe the consequences were at the time and I would have never thought about doing it," Jarvis tweeted.</p>
      <p>"I love all of you who still support me, this is not the end."</p>

      <p>Jarvis, who is also a member of the eSports team FaZe Clan, also has 600,000 followers on Twitch, another live-streaming platform.</p>
      <p>In the grovelling apology clip, Jarvis says: "All I was thinking about whilst I was making those videos was just how entertaining and interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch.</p>
      <p>"It didn't even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life from Fortnite from those videos. I just want to be clear that this is the first time that I have ever done anything like this and of course I have never done this in a competitive game mode at all.</p>

      <p>"Epic Games you know I know how big of a mistake I've made and I'm truly like so sorry. Epic, I know I have to take accountability for my actions and I'm going to do my best to accept any punishment that comes my way."</p>
      <p>Fortnite is a battle royale-style survival shooter in which players create a superhero avatar and compete against each other on a dystopian island to be the last one standing.</p>
      <p>It boasts hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide.</p>
      <p>But it has been panned by critics and charities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/fortnite-gamer-17-attempted-suicide-13005538">A boy attempted suicide after his obsession</a> with it spiralled out of control last year.</p>
      <p>Carl Thompson, 17, spiralled into debt and drug addiction as he spent almost all of his time playing it – including 12-hour stints.</p>
      <p>He hardly ate or slept and says he was “miserable and unable to function”.</p>
      <p>Only a few months after first playing the game, he decided there was only one way to escape.</p>
      <p>He tried to jump to his death from his third-floor bedroom window. By chance, Carl’s dad saw him as he was about to leap and pulled him to safety.</p>
