      <h1>'Ehrrrrm, pass': Monica Lewinsky has no comment about age gaps in dating</h1>

      <p>Monica Lewinsky pointedly declined to weigh-in on an online discussion about the acceptable maximum age difference for two people in a relationship.</p>
      <p>Lewinsky became nationally known in the 1990s for having an affair with then-President Bill Clinton while she was a 22-year-old intern in the White House. Clinton was 49 years old at the time.</p>
      <p>"Please reply with your age difference limit for relationships. Include the number of years older and the number of years younger you're willing to go," freelance journalist Yashar Ali wrote on Twitter on Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>"Ehrrrrm, pass," Lewinsky responded the next day, triggering a slew of responses praising her wit and self-effacing humor.</p>

      <p>The House impeached Clinton in 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice for hiding his relationship with Lewinsky and pushing Lewinsky to do the same. The Senate acquitted Clinton after a 21-day trial.</p>
