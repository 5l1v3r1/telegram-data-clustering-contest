      <h1>Today only: pick up an Ecobee thermostat at Best Buy and get a free Switch+ ($80 value)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:58:08+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/cody-english/" target="_blank">Cody English</a></address>
      <p>Ecobee thermostats come highly recommended here at Android Police, with the Ecobee4 earning the top thermostat ranking in our <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/12/best-smart-home-devices-2019/#Thermostats">list of the best smart home devices</a>. Things only got better with the introduction of the company's <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/06/04/ecobees-new-smartthermostat-features-modest-redesign-and-improved-voice-recognition-for-250/">SmartThermostat</a>, which improved on the Ecobee4 by updating the processor, improving sound quality, and the addition of 5GHz Wifi compatibility. In an exciting smart home-focused deal that is available from <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/save-ecobee-thermostats">Best Buy</a> for one day only, buyers will receive a free Ecobee Switch+ with the purchase of either the SmartThermostat or Ecobee3 Lite.</p>
      <p>Both thermostats support voice commands through the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/11/14/ecobee-smart-thermostat-gets-assistant-integration/">Google Assistant</a> or Alexa, but the SmartThermostat is the only model with a built-in microphone capable of accepting commands directly. The inclusion of the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/26/ecobee-switch-smart-light-switch-built-alexa-action-finally-sale/">Switch+</a> in this deal could make that limitation more tolerable as it is designed to replace your standard light switch while also offering built-in Alexa capabilities of its own.</p>
