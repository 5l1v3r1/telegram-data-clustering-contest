      <h1>Selena Gomez Earns Her First Billboard No. 1 With ‘Lose You to Love Me’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:18:59+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:18</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-cries-about-taylor-swift-and-friendship.html">Selena Gomez</a> is putting her nation of Instagram followers (160 million and counting) to work. After a decade of consistently appearing on the Billboard Hot 100 list, Gomez has finally earned the top spot with her new song “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-new-single-video.html">Lose You to Love Me</a>,” according to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542511/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-number-one-hot-100">Billboard’s chart data</a>. Gomez previously peaked at No. 5 with both “Good for You” featuring A$AP Rocky in 2015 and 2016’s “Same Old Love.” Seemingly inspired by her relationship (and break up) <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-new-song-justin-bieber.html">with Justin Bieber</a>, fans skyrocketed “Lose You to Love Me” to No. 1 in a quick amount of time. Plus, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-new-song-justin-bieber.html">a little drama between</a> the Selenators and Justin Bieber’s new wife, Hailey Bieber, couldn’t have hurt.</p>
      <p>“This song is so dear to my heart. I’ve been working so hard to make this album as honest and fun as possible while remaining vulnerable enough to share where I am in life,” Gomez wrote in a social media post celebrating the No. 1. “I love you deeply and thank you so much for listening.” </p>

      <p>Gomez’s album doesn’t have a confirmed release date so far, but it does have a second single, “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-music-video-look-at-her-now-bieber-watch.html">Look at Her Now</a>,” which currently sits at No. 27 on the Hot 100. After taking a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/selena-gomez-says-new-album-is-finally-done.html">four year break</a> from music, Selena Gomez is back and better than ever. At least that’s what the charts are saying.</p>
