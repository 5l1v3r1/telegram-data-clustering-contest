      <p>There’s no time to rest for Kaizer Chiefs after their Soweto Derby victory, and the quick turnaround time may prove to be too short for arguably their biggest player…</p>

      <p>Khama Billiat has not quite hit his scintillating best for the Glamour Boys yet in 2019/20, and at this point has only bagged one goals for the club in the Absa Premiership in his seven games.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwean will be eager to add to his tally as Ernst Middendorp’s side seek to maintain their place on top of the log, but he may well face the price of what was a physical encounter with Orlando Pirates last weekend.</p>

      <p>Billiat played the full 120 minutes for the Amakhosi, even stepping up to slot home his penalty in the shootout after the game had finished 2-2, but he could be seen on his social media this week undergoing some treatment on the leg that was stood on by Thembinkosi Lorch.</p>
      <p>There were claims that Lorch should have been sent off for his part in the coming together of the two players, with the Bucs star looking to have stood on the back of Billiat’s leg following the initial foul.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen whether Billiat will be deemed fit enough to face Chippa United on Wednesday night when Chiefs return to action, but it may also be a consideration for Middendorp to rest the Glamour Boys’ number 11 as they prepare to do battle with their bitter rivals, Pirates, once more this coming weekend.</p>
