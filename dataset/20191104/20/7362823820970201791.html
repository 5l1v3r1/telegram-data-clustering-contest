      <h1>'Shark Tank' judge Lori Greiner confronts 'chauvinistic' contestant</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:49:11+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Day</a></address>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">Shark Tank</a>" judges are known for their brutal honesty. Take, for instance, judge <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/lori-greiner-on-how-entrepreneurs-can-avoid-alienating-loved-ones">Lori Greiner</a>, who recently confronted a contestant for "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk9_hhpb464&amp;feature=youtu.be">chauvinistic behavior</a>."</p>
      <p>When Sarath Malepati visited the show to pitch an immune-system pack filled with vitamins, Greiner stated that despite her constructive feedback, she wasn't receiving the same attention that the male judges were getting.</p>
      <p>Greiner, 49, told Malepati that she preferred natural products like his and that she picked up on odd behavior from Malepati.</p>

      <p>"You are kind of looking at me funny," she said. "Do you agree with what I am saying or no?”</p>
      <p>She told the contestant that she takes zinc when she feels a cold coming on, and he quickly replied, "Well the product has zinc, so let's talk about zinc," while appearing to not look at her.</p>
      <p>"Wait a minute, why are you ignoring what I'm saying?" Greiner asked. "That's odd to me. I'm talking to you and you're looking over at Mark (Cuban, a fellow judge) and I'm telling you that I'm into all of this."</p>
      <p>"You know what, I'm just going to finish," she continued after being interrupted by one of her fellow judges. "I was the customer, I've been taking zinc for years, I'm a believer in this ... but the fact that when I'm talking to you, you don't even look at me, I'm out."</p>

      <p>"I'm really sorry, Lori," Malepati said. "I didn't mean to offend you."</p>
      <p>His apology, however, didn't do much for Greiner.</p>
      <p>"I am offended, I feel like you don't respect me as a female sitting here."</p>
      <p>Greiner then discussed how important she believes it is for women to speak up for themselves, saying she has never reacted this way to a contestant.</p>

      <p>"I do know that when you came out here, you were looking at everybody else, not really me," Greiner explained. "I just sense some chauvinism here."</p>
      <p>Cuban then told Greiner that maybe Malepati was just nervous. “I’m not a chauvinist,” Malepati said.</p>
      <p>At the end of the episode, Malepati also stated again that he is not a chauvinist and that Greiner's accusation surprised him.</p>
      <p>“When Lori accused me of being a chauvinist, I was very surprised," he said. "That’s not who I am as a human being and I’m sorry that she felt that way."</p>
      <p>For Greiner's part, she later tweeted about the moment, describing her feelings to her followers.</p>

      <p>"First, he didn't look at me and then he ignored me... twice," one tweet read. "That's why I said something."</p>
      <p>Greiner's most recent tweet thanked fans for the support she's received since the encounter.</p>
