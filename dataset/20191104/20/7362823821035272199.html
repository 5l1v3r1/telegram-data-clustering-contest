      <h1>New Hampshire couple found dead in Texas: 2 persons of interest sought</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:42:32+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:42</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Gearty</a></address>
      <p>Investigators said Monday they want to question two people in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-police-officer-killed-welfare-fraud-birthday-party">murders</a> of a New Hampshire couple whose bodies turned up in a shallow grave on a Texas beach -- days after their stolen truck and RV were seen crossing the border into <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/mexico-city-police-reportedly-find-skulls">Mexico</a>.</p>
      <p>The man and the woman being sought have not been identified and were described as persons of interest in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/homelessness-los-angeles-california-crisis-death-rate-report">deaths</a> of James and Michelle Butler, whose bodies were unearthed last week on Padre Island, near Corpus Christi.</p>
      <p>“They're just people that we want to identify and talk to for background in the investigation,” Kleberg County District Attorney John Hubert told a news conference. He said they appeared to be people who lived in the Corpus Christi area.</p>

      <p>The Butlers had left their home in Rumney, N.H., in early 2018 to go on a trip around the country.</p>
      <p>They were keeping a travel diary on Facebook that showed the places where they had stopped in New York, Virginia, Tennessee, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas.</p>
