      <h1>Livid student trying to sue university for £200,000 over his grade</h1>
      <h2>Umer Riaz wants compensation after he received a pass grade for his Bachelor of Science chemistry degree in 2016</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T20:45:02+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Anna Lewis, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A university student has spent thousands on an unsuccessful legal bid against the University of South Wales.</p>
      <p>The undergraduate has now vowed to take his legal challenge to the highest court in the land as he seeks £200,000 in damages.</p>
      <p>Umer Riaz wants compensation after he received a pass grade for his Bachelor of Science chemistry degree in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, according to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/student-paid-thousands-pounds-trying-17188188">our sister title</a> Wales Online, moved to Cardiff from Islamabad, Pakistan, to study.</p>
      <p>But he the claimed he was not given the opportunity to continue his studies to complete an honours degree, instead of receiving the pass.</p>
      <p>His claim was struck out of Cardiff County Court last week after being described by the university as having "no prospect of success."</p>
      <p>He told Wales Online he would "continue to fight this, even if I have to take it higher, even to the UN." Mr Riaz argued it has affected his career prospects.</p>

      <p>The University of South Wales said all processes were followed "fairly and accurately".</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz started his degree at the university in 2011, but had to repeat his first year after he failed to obtain the credits needed to continue.</p>
      <p>In 2014, after suffering a period of ill health, he said he "suffered a fall" on site, which meant his second year modules were deferred until 2015.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As a consequence, he did not have enough credits for an honours degree and had reached the "maximum registration period" for his course.</p>
      <p>His unsuccessful claim argued that the decision not to allow him to take the outstanding modules was "unreasonable".</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz, who represented himself during court proceedings, said: "I was quite good at my studies and I passed my English courses back home.</p>
      <p>"I was the youngest and my family wanted to give me the opportunity for higher study. My parents were illiterate, they didn't go to school."</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to continue to do a doctorate in organic chemistry.</p>

      <p>He lodged an internal complaint with the university, which was unsuccessful, and took it to the Office Of Independent Adjudicator - where it was dismissed in 2018.</p>
      <p>Now, he said he is going to take it to the High Court in London.</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz described the legal battle as "very stressful".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the University of South Wales said: "We take all complaints seriously and we are keen to uphold our rigorous standards.</p>
      <p>"All of our processes have been followed fairly and accurately, and this has been reflected by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education.</p>
      <p>"As there may be further legal action, it is not possible to comment further."</p>
