      <p>Hugh Hefner's son has married an actress best known for her role in the Harry Potter series.</p>
      <p>Cooper Hefner, who is an heir to his dad's Playboy fortune, tied the knot with Scarlett Byrne this week in a very low-key ceremony.</p>
      <p>The happy couple, who have been engaged for four years, had their wedding at the Ventura County courthouse in the coastal city of Oxnard, California.</p>
      <p>Scarlett, who played Pansy Parkinson in the film series, posted a picture from their wedding day on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>She dressed in a white corset-style peplum top with a matching mid-length skirt, while leaving her hair sleek and loose around her shoulders.</p>

      <p>Cooper, 28, looked smart in a navy blue suit and white shirt, which he wore without a tie.</p>
      <p>Scarlett, 29, captioned the photo: "Cooper and I are excited to share that we legally married.</p>
      <p>"We are looking forward to planning our wedding in the coming months where we will celebrate further with our friends and family."</p>
      <p>Scarlett then wrote directly to her husband, saying: "I love you Cooper. I am proud to stand by your side, as your partner, your friend, and your wife.</p>

      <p>"Cheers to a life full of love, happiness, adventure, and great purpose, Mrs. Hefner.</p>
