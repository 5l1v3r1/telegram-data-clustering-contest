      <p>Alberta Fish and Wildlife is investigating the shooting of two bald eagles in separate areas of the province.</p>
      <p>The provincial agency says a juvenile eagle was killed in the Fort McMurray area sometime between Oct. 26 and Oct. 29, then left to waste.</p>
      <p>The second raptor involved a mature eagle found dead Oct. 20 and possibly killed the same day in a pheasant release site in the Wetaskiwin region.</p>
      <p>The agency says there is no indication the killings are connected and itâ€™s looking for tips from the public to help find whoever was responsible.</p>
      <p>The bald eagle is a protected species in Alberta and there is no hunting season for it.</p>
