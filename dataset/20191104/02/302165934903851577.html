      <p>MIAMI, Nov 4 — The Miami Heat scored a franchise-record 46 first-quarter points and routed the Houston Rockets 129-100 last night in Miami.</p>
      <p>The Heat led by as many as 41 points in the first half. Miami’s 5-1 start is its best since it last won an NBA title in the 2012-2013 season.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Butler, Miami’s biggest offseason acquisition, had one of the game’s best stat lines with 18 points, nine assists, seven rebounds and four steals.</p>
      <p>The Heat, who never trailed in the game, also got a team-high 23 points from Duncan Robinson and 21 points from Meyers Leonard.</p>
      <p>Robinson hit a career-high seven 3-pointers. He made 8 of 12 shots from the floor and went 7-for-11 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>It was also the best performance of the season for Leonard, who was acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in July. He made 9 of 11 shots from the floor, including 1-for-2 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>Miami shot 69.6 per cent from the floor in the first quarter while holding Houston to 23.8-per cent accuracy, building an incredible 32-point lead in just 12 minutes.</p>
      <p>Forward James Johnson, who missed Miami’s first six games due to what the organization said was a lack of conditioning, made his season debut, scoring 17 points in 22 minutes.</p>
      <p>Rockets shooting guard James Harden, who led the NBA in scoring in each of the past two years, had a game-high 29 points in just 26 minutes. He made 6 of 14 shots, including 3 of 9 from long range.</p>
      <p>Houston point guard Russell Westbrook, an eight-time All-Star and the NBA’s MVP in 2017, was held to 10 points on 3-for-11 shooting. Westbrook played 26 minutes and made just 1-for-6 3-point shots. In fact, his only successful 3-pointer was a half-court shot just before the third-quarter buzzer.</p>
      <p>Miami got off to its aforementioned hot start by outscoring Houston 18-4 in the paint in the first quarter and also 14-0 on fast-break points, leading to a 46-14 advantage on the scoreboard.</p>
      <p>Harden scored 16 second-quarter points as Houston cut its deficit to 71-46 at halftime. But Miami built its lead back up to 99-71 after three quarters and coasted from there. — Reuters</p>
