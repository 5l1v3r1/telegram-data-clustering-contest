      <p>As per weekly option data, handful of Put writing on strikes ranging from 11,700 and 11,900 which shows Nifty likely to take support in this zone.

Traders should remain positive as market saw put OI at 11,800 which will act as major support levels for the month, but 12,000 will act as stiff resistance as maximum OI for the calls stands here.
