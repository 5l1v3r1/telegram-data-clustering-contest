      <p>LONDON , Nov 4 — British MPs will today select the new speaker of the House of Commons, once an unremarkable event but one now charged with significance following the previous occupant's role in Brexit.</p>
      <p>Eight MPs are running to replace John Bercow, who placed himself front and centre of the Brexit saga by choosing amendments and introducing procedures that Leave-supporting MPs claimed were designed to frustrate Britain's departure from the European Union.</p>
      <p>Bercow also faced accusations that he fostered a culture of bullying within parliament. But his colourful personality and eccentric performances in parliament gave him an international profile and raised the status of the office.</p>
      <p>Lindsay Hoyle, Bercow's deputy since 2010, is the odds-on favourite to fill his shoes but other political heavyweights are also vying for the job.</p>
      <p>Hoyle has been a Labour MP for 22 years and was Bercow's deputy from 2010, since when his distinctive Lancashire accent has rung out from the speaker's chair.</p>
      <p>In a sign that he may follow a different path from Bercow, he recently rejected amendments that would have made it more difficult for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to force a general election, now due on December 12.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old is as unimpressed as his predecessor by rowdy MPs, once chastising Scottish Nationalists for humming the EU anthem <i>Ode to Joy</i> in the chamber.</p>
      <p>Hoyle pledged in an interview published in the Sunday Times to repair what he claims has become a “toxic parliament.”</p>
      <p>“I don't want the abuse of each other and I think we have got to close that down quickly and make sure it is a calmer place to be,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Irreplaceable'</b>
      </p>
      <p>His closest rival appears to be veteran Labour MP Harriet Harman, parliament's longest-serving female MP.</p>
      <p>She entered the Commons in 1982 and served as the Labour Party's deputy leader from 2007-2015, leading the party twice, in 2010 and 2015, between leaders.</p>
      <p>The former justice minister is known for her ardent feminism and has been a long-time crusader on social justice issues.</p>
      <p>Another woman in the running is Eleanor Laing, Bercow's number two deputy since 2013.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old Conservative entered parliament in 1997 and previously served as the party's spokeswoman on Scotland.</p>
      <p>One of the more colourful characters in contention is former Church of England vicar, and now Labour MP Chris Bryant.</p>
      <p>The openly gay 57-year-old's civil partnership ceremony in 2010 was the first held in the Houses of Parliament.</p>
      <p>Bercow stepped down on Thursday after 10 years as speaker.</p>
      <p>The man in the middle of more than three years of fiery parliamentary debates has proved a controversial figure, loathed by pro-Brexit supporters and hailed by its foes.</p>
      <p>A social media mash-up by German television of Bercow trying to calm down rowdy MPs has been seen more than a million times. A Belgian newspaper called him “irreplaceable.”</p>
      <p>Johnson paid guarded tribute to the outgoing speaker, likening Bercow's glare to a “trademark Tony Montana scowl,” after Al Pacino's character in the 1983 film <i>Scarface</i>.</p>
      <p>Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn added: “You've done so much to reform this House of Commons and our democracy is the stronger for the way you have done it.”</p>
      <p>Bercow will not stand in next month's general election. — AFP</p>
