      <h1>Adam Lallana hails special power Liverpool have for scoring last-gasp goals</h1>
      <h2>Sadio Mane scored a stoppage-time header as Liverpool snatched a 2-1 win at Aston Villa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T02:25:51+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Adam Lallana believes Liverpool have developed a feeling “like a sixth sense” that fuels their ability to secure last-gasp victories.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane was the hero on Saturday as the Reds' late show at Aston Villa maintained their title charge.</p>
      <p>The forward's stoppage-time header earned a thrilling 2-1 win just as Jurgen Klopp's side looked like losing their unbeaten Premier League record.</p>
      <p>Andrew Robertson had equalised with just three minutes left to cancel out Trezeguet's first-half opener for the hosts.</p>

      <p>That result came after another last-gasp goal ultimately helped them secure a Carabao Cup victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> - and Lallana has hailed their never-say-die attitude.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> star said: "We keep getting late goals. Another two today and one in midweek.</p>
      <p>"Then there was my goal at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> a couple of weeks ago. The resilience and character is there in abundance.</p>
      <p>"It’s almost like a sixth sense. We knew at half-time that if we could get one goal it could lead to another.</p>

      <p>"We got it late but we still had time and, with the deliveries and set-pieces we’ve got in our team, we use it to our advantage. It’s such a weapon.</p>
      <p>"Teams worry when it’s late. Even though we weren’t at our best in the first half we were saved by that never-say-die ­approach.</p>
      <p>"Two goals in the last five minutes. We’ve just got that momentum. We’re just on that path at the minute."</p>
      <p>The victory maintained Liverpool's unbeaten start to the season and kept them six points clear of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> at the top.</p>
