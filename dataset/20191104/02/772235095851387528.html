      <p>The <b>Ford Ranger</b> four-wheel drive ute has outsold the <b>Toyota HiLux</b> four-wheel drive for the seventh month in a row – the longest winning streak to date for the Blue Oval brand.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/hilux/">Toyota HiLux</a> remains on track to become the best-selling vehicle outright for the fourth year in a row when all variants are included – when counted by nameplate according to standard industry practice – as it now has an unassailable lead.</p>

      <p>Preliminary figures for November show new-car sales slowed for the 19th month in a row – the longest downturn since the Global Financial Crisis a decade ago – as consumer confidence wanes and tighter credit requirements mean more deals are falling over after customers have already signed on the dotted line.</p>
      <p>Eight of the Top 10 brands posted sales declines – including market leader <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/">Holden</a> backed up its worst monthly result since 1948 with its second weakest tally of all time, though it managed to scrape inside the Top 10.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> ranked second outright behind <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a> and ahead of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/">Mazda</a>. However, the big performer was Hyundai’s sister brand <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/kia/">Kia</a>, which rocketed to fourth place outright for the first time ever in November, although year-to-date it ranks sixth outright.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/subaru/">Subaru</a> had a tough month but it was impacted by further interruptions to supply, this time by a typhoon in Japan.</p>
      <p>Other brands to post big sales declines included <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mitusbishi/">Mitsubishi</a> and Mazda, both of whom had abnormally huge months this time last year due to special promotions.</p>
      <p>One car dealership insider said “the level of enquiry coming in the front door is the weakest in memory, people just aren’t looking at new cars”.</p>
      <p>“They’re either holding onto what they’ve got for a little bit longer or there’s less incentive to update because they are already on a low finance rate,” said the industry veteran who asked to remain anonymous because dealer staff are requested by car manufacturers to not talk to the media.</p>
      <p>“Then you’ve got a lot of deals falling over on finance, so it’s a bit of a disaster really.”</p>
      <p>The good news for buyers is that dealers are more desperate to win business. However, prices on most “price leader” models are already at historical lows.</p>
      <p>In other upsets: the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4 SUV</a> outsold the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/corolla/">Toyota Corolla</a> for what is believed to be the first time ever.</p>
      <p>And former market leader the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/3/">Mazda 3</a> has slipped outside the Top 10 for the first time in memory (it ranked 11th) as buyers continue to shift from small cars to SUVs.</p>

      <h3>Fast facts</h3>
      <p>The Mazda 3 (above) ended the Holden Commodore’s 15-year winning streak in 2011, and backed it up with another market win in 2012.</p>
      <p>The Toyota Corolla led the Australian new-car market for three years in a row, from 2013 to 2015.</p>
      <p>The Toyota HiLux became the first ute to ever lead the annual sales tally in Australia, in 2016. It would eventually notch up three annual wins in a row and is now on track to win a fourth sales title.</p>
      <p>While some brands like to split variants to claim a victory (such as distinguishing 4x4 or 4x2 utes) all vehicles are calculated by nameplate and have been for decades.</p>
      <p>Utes have been the top two-selling vehicles outright in Australia for the past two years in a row (Toyota HiLux and Ford Ranger) and are on track for a third.</p>
      <p>Holden’s <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/797541/holden-lowest-monthly-sales-since-1948/">worst monthly result since 1948</a> was in September 2019, and the first time it had dipped below 3000 (2863). Holden’s October result of 3086 sales was the second-lowest on record. Other previous lows include 3266 (July 2019), 3483 (April 2019) and 3825 (February 2019).</p>
