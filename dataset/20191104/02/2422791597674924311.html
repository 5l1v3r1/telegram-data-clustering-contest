      <p>A new recall has been issued in Canada for a variety of fresh-cut vegetables sold by brands such as Mann’s and Western Family due to possible Listeria contamination.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency posted the new information on Sunday as an update to an earlier Listeria recall.</p>
      <p>The recall includes a number of Mann’s products, including veggie trays, broccoli coleslaw and various types of cauliflower and kale. It also includes products that involve vegetables sold under the labels “Mann’s Crave a Bowl,” “Mann’s Family Favourites,” “Mann’s Nourish Bowls,” “Mann’s Organic” and “Mann’s Snacking Favourites.”</p>
      <p>Two Western Family products -- broccoli slaw and a sweet kale salad kit -- were included in the recall, as well as a veggie power blend by Sysco Imperial.</p>
      <p>The products in the recall usually contained broccoli or cauliflower, but some of the affected products contained kale, brussels sprouts, corn, carrots, green beans and various vegetable trays and blends.</p>
      <p>The affected products were sold nationally and all had best before dates up to and including Nov. 16. A full list of the products in the recall is available on the <a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/about-the-cfia/newsroom/food-recall-warnings/complete-listing/2019-11-03/eng/1572825937797/1572825944046">CFIA's website.</a></p>
