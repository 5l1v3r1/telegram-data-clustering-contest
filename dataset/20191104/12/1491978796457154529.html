        <i>Work and pensions secretary says electing Francesca O’Brien a ‘matter for people of Gower’</i>
      </p>
      <p>The work and pensions secretary has come under fire for backing a Tory candidate in a marginal seat who wrote on social media that people on the reality TV programme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/benefits">Benefits</a> Street needed “putting down”.</p>
      <p>The Conservative party has refused calls to drop Francesca O’Brien, who is standing in a key target seat in Gower, south Wales, despite anger after her Facebook comments were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/03/tory-candidate-francesca-obrien-wrote-people-benefits-street-should-be-put-down">exposed by the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>Thérèse Coffey, the minister in charge of the country’s benefits system, said it was a “matter for the people of Gower” on whether O’Brien should be the constituency’s next MP.</p>
      <p>In posts unearthed by the Guardian that have since been deleted, O’Brien, 32, wrote in January 2014: “Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!”</p>
      <p>In response to a friend’s comment, she wrote: “My blood is boiling, these people need putting down.” In further comments under her post, O’Brien apparently endorsed a friend’s suggestion for “twat a tramp Tuesday” to “take your batts [sic] to the streets”.</p>
      <p>Asked whether O’Brien should be a candidate given her comments, Coffey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What she said is clearly wrong, clearly wrong. I’m led to believe it was early in 2014. I don’t know Francesca at all.</p>
      <p>“She has apologised I’ve been told, that is important. And I recognise that these comments are not ones with which I would associate myself in any way.”</p>
      <p>Pressed again on whether she should be standing, Coffey added: “I think that will be a decision for the people of Gower to make the choice on who they want to be their next member of parliament.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> confirmed the party was standing by O’Brien despite her comments prompting widespread outrage.</p>
      <p>The Labour party’s chair, Ian Lavery, said: “Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>“The cuts to benefits and universal credit programme that Thérèse Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty.</p>
      <p>“It is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O’Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives’ contempt for the less well-off.”</p>
      <p>Benefits Street, which highlighted the lives of benefits claimants on a road in Birmingham, prompted controversy when it aired in 2014. The programme attracted 4 million viewers but also more than 100 complaints to regulator Ofcom of unfair, misleading and offensive portrayals of benefits claimants, alleged criminal activity and excessive bad language.</p>
      <p>After being approached by the Guardian, O’Brien – who was selected last month in an open primary – apologised for the comments which she said were “off the cuff”. She added: “These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago. However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused.”</p>
      <p>Gower was won by Labour by little more than 3,000 votes at the 2017 general election and is a key marginal that the Conservatives will be targeting. It was won by the Tories in 2015 by just 27 votes.</p>
