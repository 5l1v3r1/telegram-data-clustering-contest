      <p>A vicar who has been compared to the ‘hot priest’ from <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/fleabag"><i>Fleabag</i></a> has admitted he is tired of getting unsolicited “nudes” from fans.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Chris Lee, who is a vicar at St Saviour’s Church in west London, has 100,000 followers on his Instagram account, which features snapshots of his home life as well as religious musings.</p>
      <p>However, Lee’s increased social media presence has brought some unwanted attention, with the vicar telling <a href="https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/instagram-vicar-influencer-earns-comparisons-with-fleabags-hot-priest-38651427.html"><i>Press Association</i></a>: “I’ve had some dodgy stuff sent to me – like some women sending me nudes or whatever. My wife is like, ‘right, block!’”</p>

      </ul>
      <p>He added: “I was asked for a selfie at a funeral I was doing, and that was fine but weird.”</p>
      <p>Addressing the comparisons with Andrew Scott’s priest character in season 2 of <i>Fleabag</i>, Lee said: “I’m a young priest who is engaged with culture, so that in itself is going to raise eyebrows because priests traditionally are a little bit heavy, a little bit old and a little bit distant, and I am, I think, none of those things.”</p>
      <p>While he found the character “fun and affable and engaging”, the vicar also expressed disappointment that Scott’s character engaged in a sexual relationship with Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s titular character.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t recognise it as priestly at all,” he added.</p>
      <p>Fleabag creator Waller-Bridge recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/phoebe-waller-bridge-reveals-regrets-about-ending-fleabag-maybe-i-shouldnt-have-waved-goodbye-2550890">expressed regret about bringing the show to an end</a> after two seasons, saying: “Even though it’s so nice to hear that so many people loved it, it’s like: ‘Oh dammit, maybe I shouldn’t have waved goodbye’. But it does feel right to go out on a high.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t get higher than this. It feels like the perfect way to say goodbye.”</p>
