      <h2>The controversial clip, recorded at Hefei Wildlife Park, sparked controversy in China</h2>

      <p>A chimpanzee was filmed smoking a cigarette at a Chinese zoo after a visitor allegedly threw it into the animal's enclosure.</p>
      <p>The clip, posted on Chinese social media, was recorded at Hefei Wildlife Park in eastern China's Anhui Province.</p>
      <p>Footage of the 15-year-old primate picking the cigarette up and puffing away created controversy online.</p>
      <p>The primate can be seen holding the cigarette before taking a puff after tourists reportedly threw it into the enclosure.</p>
      <p>A zoo worker told Chinese news outlet The Paper that "uncivilised tourists" tossed the cigarette at the animal.</p>
      <p>The unnamed employee also said the animal's health would not be affected by one cigarette: "It had one cigarette.</p>
      <p>"Nothing bad will come of that. Humans smoke for tens of years."</p>

      <p>The worker added it was difficult for the zoo to keep an eye on its large number of visitors</p>
      <p>Thousands of tourists visit the park every day, but there are only about 100 workers.</p>
      <p>Mr Zhan, a director of the zoo, told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7646747/Female-chimpanzee-15-caught-smoking-like-pro-Chinese-zoo.html">Daily Mail</a> the smoking primate was a 15-year-old female chimpanzee named Wan Xing.</p>

      <p>He said the video was not filmed recently.</p>
      <p>The director said the primate was born at the zoo in 2004 and now lives there with her father and her partner.</p>
      <p>In July, Wan Xing's partner Yang Yang created chaos at the zoo after escaping from his enclosure using a bamboo tree.</p>

      <p>The animal was subdued after being shot with a tranquiliser by police and now lives happily at the zoo, according to Mr Zhan.</p>
      <p>Hefei Wildlife Zoo is home to about 2,000 animals and birds, including giant pandas, Indian elephants and leopards, according to <a href="https://anhui.chinadaily.com.cn/travel/2010-06/09/content_9776793.htm">China Daily</a> .</p>
      <p>Visitors at Hefei Park can stroll to watch free-roaming animals and feed them, as well as enjoy shows and performances.</p>
