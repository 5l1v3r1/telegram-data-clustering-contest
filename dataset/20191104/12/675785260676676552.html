      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer issues Man City plea to Paul Pogba</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United face a crunch clash against local rivals Manchester City on December 7 - and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants his star man back on the pitch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:10:11+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Harris</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> back in time for for next month’s derby against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Pogba has missed the last seven games due to an ankle problem he sustained in September.</p>
      <p>His foot is currently in plaster after a recent operation, stalling his rehabilitation process.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> travel to the Etihad Stadium on December 7 to face the Pep Guardiola’s Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>And, according to the <i><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-pogba-injury-news-latest-20807471">Daily Star</a> </i>, Solskjaer has told with Pogba to focus all of his efforts on returning from injury for the match.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer has publicly written off the 26-year-old until next month.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think we’ll see him before December. He’ll be out for a while,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He needs time to fully recover so I don’t think he will be back before maybe Sheffield United after the international break but probably December before you can see him.</p>
      <p>“I’m not a doctor but there is an injury there that needs healing. There’s no use talking about who’s not going to be here for a long time because he’s not going to come on the pitch and help us."</p>

      <p>Despite the team’s problems on the pitch, Pogba is determined not to rush his return from injury.</p>
      <p>"I will still be under plaster for ten days," he said. "After, I still have two weeks of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>"It's not easy to see my teammates go to training or on the field, but I have to take the time to come back."</p>
      <p>Pogba is likely to miss another eight matches, starting with Thursday's Europa League home clash against Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>United’s mini-revival came crashing to an end on Saturday as ex-Red Devils forward Josh King hit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> ’s winner at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side are currently 10th in the Premier League table, with 13 points from 11 games.</p>
