      <h1>Bitcoin Price Analyst: ‘Second Phase’ of Bull Market Triggers at $14K</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T12:35:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) was trending higher on Nov. 4 as sideways behavior gave way to more purposeful <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-first-monthly-gain-since-june-spells-bullish-for-q4-2019">upward momentum</a> across markets.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin seeks to break out of trading range</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 reveals BTC/USD tackling $9,300 on Monday, rising to a 24-hour high of $9,310 on exchanges after dipping as low as $9,080.</p>
      <p>The latest action continues the weekly trend for Bitcoin, which has seen the largest cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-falls-below-9-200-after-rejection-by-9-500-resistance">range</a> between just under $9,000 and just over $9,500. Those levels effectively formed support and resistance, respectively. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Now, analysts are turning their attention to the required conditions for a more purposeful breakout — either up or down. </p>
      <h3>Willy Woo: CME gap likely to be filled</h3>
      <p>According to statistician Willy Woo, the coming few months for Bitcoin will first see a dip to $8,600, filling in a gap in futures markets.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, bullish action should begin to surface. Bitcoin needs a monthly close above $14,000 in order to then secure a longer-term bull market.</p>
      <p>“Once we get a monthly close above $14k, we'll be in the second phase of the bull market; a steady, lowish volatility, run in price. Should happen by the start of 2020, that's the best time to deploy capital,” he summarized in a <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1191298814365224960">series of tweets</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-dips-below-9k-support-as-traders-weigh-correction-odds">reported</a>, Woo is not alone in forecasting a short-term slide for BTC/USD. Last week, regular contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> also eyed the potential for the pair to revisit the $8,000 bracket.</p>
      <p>In an update on his dedicated Telegram trading channel on Sunday, he continued the narrative:</p>
      <blockquote>“Suspect there are a lot of over leveraged people in the 9300s with stops below 9k. Whales probably tempted to dump it and get a lower entry.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Altcoin markets see green</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile took the chance to deliver moderate gains in line with Bitcoin’s slight uptick. </p>
      <p>Out of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, many rose by up to 4% on the day, with only Bitcoin SV (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-sv">BSV</a>) seeing losses of 1.6%.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, saw gains of 1.7% to trade $184. Both NEO (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/neo">NEO</a>) and Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>) performed strongly, with 4.5% advances.</p>
