      <p>A terrifying depiction of a dragon in the stands stole the show at the Casablanca derby this weekend.</p>
      <p>In the Arab Club Champions Cup game between Moroccan top tier sides Raja Club Athletic Casablanca and Wydad Casablanca, the dragon display emerged with the scores level.</p>
      <p>The mythical beast was paraded around the Stade Mohammed V stadium – which both clubs use as their home ground – against a backdrop of flares and smoke.</p>

      <p>The dragon – depicted breathing fire and holding a trophy – had no goals to celebrate after that however, the first leg of the second round game finishing 1-1.</p>
      <p>Both teams will return for the second leg later in the month – will the dragon return? If not, we’ll always have the first leg.</p>
