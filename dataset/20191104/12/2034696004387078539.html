      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a> has teased that her new album sees her heading in a “nostalgic” direction.</p>
      <p>The singer, who released <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838">new single ‘Don’t Start Now’</a> last week, said that the track is reflective of her upcoming second record – which sees her heading in a disco-led direction.</p>
      <p>“It’s very disco-orientated. I guess I got a lot of inspiration from ‘Electricity’ and ‘One Kiss’; it felt like the natural progression,” she told <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-au/video/lifestyle/dua-lipas-new-sound-is-really-nostalgic/vp-AAJOvtp">Bang Showbiz.</a></p>
      <p>“The album is really nostalgic with new sounds.”</p>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-dua-lipa-give-dont-start-now-live-debut-mtv-emas-2564129">previously working with Nile Rodgers on new music</a>, she admitted that her work with the Chic legend won’t feature on the next album.</p>

      <p>“We did some stuff together but it’s not going to end up on the project, but hopefully we’ll get to work on something else. I’m going to keep everything a secret for now.”</p>
      <p>Last night, she <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-dua-lipa-give-dont-start-now-live-debut-mtv-emas-2564129">also gave ‘Don’t Matter Now’ a live airing</a> at MTV’s European Music Awards in Seville.</p>
      <p>It comes after the ‘New Rules’ pop star <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dua-lipa-review">signalled her “new era” at the beginning of the month</a> by posting an image of herself sporting a new blonde look.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for your patience. See you soon,” she told fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the follow-up to <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dua-lipa-review">her 2017 self-titled debut</a>.</p>
      <p>Lipa described the new song ‘Don’t Start Now’ as a “pure adrenalin fuelled, feel good dance floor anthem of positivity and self-empowerment.”</p>
