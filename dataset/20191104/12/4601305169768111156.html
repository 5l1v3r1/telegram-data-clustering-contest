      <h1>Nothing wrong with quid pro quo? "Perhaps so", says Trump.</h1>

      <p>As <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/3/20946416/whistleblower-impeachment-inquiry-trump-written-testimony-house-republicans">evidence</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/01/white-house-vindman-ukraine-call-063892">mounts</a> that President Trump tied Ukraine aid to that country announcing a sham investigation into Trump's political rivals, some Republicans are backing off their claim there was no "quid pro quo". Instead, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/growing-number-of-gop-senators-consider-acknowledgingtrumps-quid-pro-quo-on-ukraine/2019/11/01/72084a3e-fcc4-11e9-9534-e0dbcc9f5683_story.html">there was a quid pro quo, but there's nothing wrong with quid pro quos</a>. Trump, of course, <a href="http://archive.is/Nzo5z">agrees with them</a>.</p>

      <p>Perhaps so.</p>
      <p>The context is particularly damning testimony from a highly-placed national security official and GOP aides caught trying to out the original whistleblower's name.</p>
      <p>A good example of the goalposts being loudly hauled comes courtesy of Ben Shapiro, the cool kids' philosopher:</p>

      <p>The next version of the question is "whether it was a criminal quid pro quo" or simply "whether it is an impeachable quid pro quo" to which the only answer is "no."</p>
