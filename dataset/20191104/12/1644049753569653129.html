      <p>Several Southeast Asian leaders snubbed a meeting with US officials on Monday after President Donald Trump decided not to attend a regional summit in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>Just three leaders from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) showed up to the session, along with a host of foreign ministers.</p>
      <p>Trump has been accused of turning his back on Asian allies for pulling out of a major trade pact, as fellow superpower China pursues its own deals and investment projects in the region.</p>
      <p>Washington did not send top officials to the weekend ASEAN summit, instead dispatching commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and national security advisor Robert O’Brien.</p>
      <p>Monday’s address from O’Brien stood in contrast to earlier ASEAN meetings, which had all been attended by most heads of state.</p>
      <p>“It’s not appropriate for ASEAN to send leaders when the US representation is not on parity,” one diplomat in Bangkok told AFP.</p>
      <p>Another diplomat said: “It’s not a boycott, it’s just that other leaders have other meetings to attend to.”</p>
      <p>In lieu of Trump’s physical presence, O’Brien read a letter from the president inviting “the leaders of ASEAN to join me in the United States for a special summit” in the first three months of next year.</p>
      <p>In attendance was the prime minister of Thailand, which is hosting the summit, along with the leaders of Laos and Vietnam, next year’s ASEAN chair.</p>
      <p>The summit, which closes Monday, has been peppered with statements from leaders rallying against protectionism amid fears of dragging global growth made worse by the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Trump, who attended the 2017 ASEAN meeting in Singapore — Vice President Mike Pence went to the one in Manila last year — could not come this year because he was busy with campaign events back home, a senior White House official said.</p>
      <p>China’s premier and the leaders of India, South Korea and Japan all made an appearance at meetings Monday, although none of them was expected at the US-ASEAN summit.</p>
      <h3>Chinese dominance</h3>
      <p>One of Trump’s first moves after assuming office was to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive free-trade pact that was billed to be the world’s biggest before Washington pulled the plug.</p>
      <p>The US withdrawal “was a very strong symbolic act and the trend is continuing”, said analyst Alex Holmes from Capital Economics.</p>
      <p>“It’s allowing China to advance its influence in the region,” he told AFP.</p>
      <p>The TPP has since been reborn as a watered-down version without the US, eclipsed by a China-backed agreement that is slated to be the world’s biggest when finalised.</p>
      <p>The 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) covers 30 percent of global GDP and loops in half of the world’s population.</p>
      <p>It includes all 10 ASEAN states plus China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand — notably excluding the US.</p>
      <p>But the deal faced 11th-hour stumbling blocks Monday as India failed to agree to the draft text agreed by the rest of the member.</p>
      <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing fears back home from local industries that its market could be flooded by cheap Made-in-China goods.</p>
      <p>“It is the 15 participating countries that have decided to move forward first,” China’s deputy foreign minister Le Yucheng told reporters, adding that the deal could be signed next year — with India if it wants to join.</p>
      <p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier told reporters: “It is important to have India in, and that is certainly our preference”.</p>
      <p>RCEP has gained new momentum as the US-China trade war rumbles on, with the IMF warning that global growth could slow to its lowest rate in 10 years thanks to the tit-for-tat-trade spat between the world’s two biggest economies.</p>
      <p>As negotiations were being finalised Monday, the ASEAN bloc and its allies espoused open trade in the region.</p>
      <p>“We are once again faced with the high winds of trade protectionism,” said South Korean leader Moon Jae-in.</p>
      <p>“We need to protect the free-trade order… and bring the global economy back on track.”</p>
      <p>In a brief departure from global trade woes, Moon met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday for their first talks in a year amid tensions over a dispute related to Japan’s use of forced labour during World War II.</p>
      <p>Ongoing troubles in the South China Sea also dominated the ASEAN summit, with Vietnam hoping for tough language against Beijing over its aggression in the resource-rich waterway.</p>
      <p>China is accused of building up military installations in the sea, which it claims most of, and in recent weeks sent a survey to Hanoi-claimed waters.</p>
