      <p>Former Bayern Munich and Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann criticised Philippe Coutinho after Bayern's 5-1 beating by Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga this weekend.</p>
      <p>Hamann previously said: "He's on loan for a year, played some games with Bayern and for me you can't seen an improvement in his performance."</p>
      <p>This time, of Coutinho who was replaced after 57 minutes for Kingsley Coman, with Bayern 4-1 down, Hamann said Coutinho was "invisible".</p>
      <p>Hamann also didn't like his attitude. "What annoys me is when you see this player is not prudent. If he loses a ball he can be frightened and anxious during the 90 minutes."</p>
      <p>Coutinho is on loan at Bayern, who have a 120m euro option to buy. Coach Niko Kovac was sacked this week.</p>
