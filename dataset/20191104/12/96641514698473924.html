      <p>If you're in the market for a mechanical keyboard, you might want to cast your eye in the direction of the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/23/k95-rgb-platinum-keyboard-hands-on/#/"> Corsair K95 RGB Platinum</a>. The peripheral can retail for $200, but it's on sale on Amazon now for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IISXY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=785ec0ee856b1039b287f1e27bb5b08d&amp;language=en_US">$130</a>.</p>
      <p>The K95 has much in common with Corsair's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/10/rapidfire-k70-keyboard-review/">K70</a> MK.2 mechanical keyboard, which is selling for <a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B07D5S54C6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkId=ddc484f5ee9f09aeeceb79c87f9398d2&amp;language=en_US">$120</a>. For an extra $10, the K95 adds six dedicated macro keys. It also boasts Cherry MX Speed key switches with 1.2-millimeter actuation, 8MB of profile storage for three distinct profiles, an aluminum frame and a lighting bar.</p>
      <p>While many gaming-focused mechanical keyboards can be gaudy, the K95 Platinum can be a somewhat tasteful addition to your desk. It's currently the cheapest Amazon has sold the keyboard for, after offering it for the same price for a spell last November, according to <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B01N5IISXY">price tracking site Camelcamelcamel.</a></p>
