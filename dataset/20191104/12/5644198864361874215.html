      <p>SHANGHAI: Yaya Toure's red card after 10 seconds and a last-minute winner completed a great escape from relegation for the only English coach in Chinese football.</p>
      <p>Gary White's managerial career has taken in the British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, Guam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and now mainland China for a second time.</p>

      <p>But he told AFP that masterminding Nantong Zhiyun to safety on Saturday in their final game of the season in China's second tier ranks among his greatest achievements.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old took over at Nantong, near Shanghai, in August and had eight games to save them from the drop.</p>
      <p>They lost the first two matches but then went unbeaten in the next five and approached the daunting trip to Toure's top-of-the-table Qingdao Huanghai knowing that victory would preserve their China League One status.</p>
      <p>Nantong and White's survival bid got off to the best possible start when the former Manchester City and Barcelona midfielder was sent off virtually at the start.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old Toure protested his innocence but White said: "It was a definite red card, he wildly kicked our central midfielder at the top of the box."</p>
      <p>However, 10-man Qingdao, who were already promoted and chasing the league title, took the lead just before the hour and Nantong faced going into a relegation play-off.</p>
      <p>White called it "quite hectic" as he willed on his men while keeping an eye on results elsewhere with two other teams also fighting to survive.</p>
      <p>"I was in every kick and header that was going on and trying to push the players forward. It was the complete opposite to calm and collected," he admitted.</p>
      <p>Needing to score, Nantong equalised two minutes after falling behind and made absolutely sure of another season in League One with a 90th-minute winner.</p>
      <p>White, whose previous job was at Tokyo Verdy in Japan, was inundated with bunches of flowers as he and his team landed at Nantong airport on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chanting fans serenaded them with banners and flares as the team bus made a triumphant return along the city streets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CAPTURING HEARTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>White, a former youth winger with Southampton who also played in Australia, took over a Nantong team who had not won for two months and were in freefall.</p>
      <p>"When we came into the club it really wasn't in a good place, the players were not fit enough and there were many things lacking," he said.</p>
      <p>"Many people would have looked at it and said it was a suicide run.</p>
      <p>"I was never really worried that I couldn't do it, it was just there was no time to make any mistakes."</p>
      <p>Making the players believe in themselves again was a major reason for White's success.</p>
      <p>"I always say that if you can capture their hearts and minds, their legs will follow," he said.</p>
      <p>White pulled off a similar trick in 2016, dragging Shanghai Shenxin out of the relegation places, although on that occasion he had 19 games to do it.</p>
      <p>White will sit down with the management of Nantong, who pull in home crowds of about 12,000, in the coming days to discuss his future.</p>
      <p>Long term, he would like to manage in his native England.</p>
      <p>But White, whose wife and four-year-old son have accompanied him on his managerial odyssey, said: "The problem is trying to find an owner with the courage to take a chance on someone like myself who hasn't played for England a bunch of times."</p>
      <p>Until then, he is enjoying making a name for himself in Asia.</p>
      <p>"I've found a niche market here, I am the only Englishman (coaching) in China and was the only Englishman in Japan," White said.</p>
      <p>"I've carved out a little area for myself."</p>
