      <p>If you're fluent in two languages, there's a good chance you want to read <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/11/google-to-roll-out-redesigned-news-tab/">news stories</a> in both -- say, to keep up with both your country of origin and the one you now call home. And if that's the case, Google now has your back. Google has <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/news/news-multiple-languages/">updated</a> News for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.magazines&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/google-news/id459182288">iOS</a> with support for displaying stories in two languages with just a single feed. You could keep up with both American and Korean news, or even use the same language to keep tabs on news in different countries.</p>
      <p>The approach is now available in Google News' language settings for 141 countries and 41 language variants. This won't be a complete help if you're a full-fledged polyglot who speaks three or more languages, but it beats having to use multiple apps or the web to get a more complete picture of the news that matters.</p>
