      <p>Two Indonesian journalists mediating a land dispute between a palm oil company and residents have been found dead with multiple stab wounds near a plantation in Sumatra, police said.</p>
      <p>The body of Maraden Sianipar was found Wednesday in a ditch near a palm plantation in Labuhan Batu district, an eight-hour drive from the capital of North Sumatra province.</p>
      <p>Police found the remains of Maratua Siregar in the same area a day later.</p>
      <p>Both bodies were covered in stab wounds.</p>
      <p>Six people have been questioned but no suspect named, local police chief Agus Darojat told AFP.</p>
      <p>The pair worked together for a local news portal before going freelance in 2017, and a friend of Siregar said the victims had recently become known for their activism in land dispute issues.</p>
      <p>Local police chief Budiarto told the Jakarta Post that investigators had found indications that the reporters’ deaths were related to their activism.</p>
      <p>Maratua “often advocated for the people”, he told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Prior to their deaths, Siregar and Sianipar were working on a campaign to convince the government to allow locals to work on disputed land.</p>
      <p>Indonesian journalist associations condemned the deaths and demanded authorities investigate thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Many cases of violence against journalists in Indonesia go unsolved, according to the Independent Journalists Alliance, which has reported at least two dozen cases this year alone.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is ranked 124th out of 180 countries on the 2019 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.</p>
