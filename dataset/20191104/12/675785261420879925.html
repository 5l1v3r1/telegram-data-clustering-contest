      <p>Jennifer Aniston swore on today's This Morning after watching Alison Hammond's surprise clips.</p>
      <p>The much-loved presenter caught up with the Friends star and Reese Witherspoon to discuss their new series - The Morning Show.</p>
      <p>Alison, who knows a lot about daytime TV, gave the Hollywood actresses some pointers and asked whether they had done any research into her role.</p>
      <p>Jennifer said: "You especially. This is how good I am. You didn’t notice the following I did of you. That's how much of a shadow I am."</p>
      <p>The actresses then watched some classic This Morning clips and had to decide whether they were fake or not, which led to Jen's shock outburst.</p>

      <p>They refused to believe that This Morning would air a knife thrower's assistant being hit in the head during a stunt.</p>
      <p>So the pair were horrified when they saw the shocking clip - with Jennifer turning the air blue.</p>
      <p>Alison explained: "That actually happened. She was OK. Nobody was hurt."</p>

      <p>Jennifer and Reese were then left open-mouthed when they saw footage of Gino D'Acampo cooking naked in the studio.</p>
      <p>Reese, who asked what angle Alison watched it from, confessed: "I’m starting to think this is the craziest show in the world."</p>
      <p>This Morning actually features in the background of the actresses' new Apple+ series - The Morning Show.</p>

      <p>This Morning viewers pointed out that presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby were on the TV in a scene.</p>
      <p>Dr Chris Steele is also seen in the clip when Jennifer's character goes on a rant in the newsroom, but Jennifer's head blocks a bit of the screen.</p>
      <p>As they watched the moment, Phillip said: "Thee you do. Duck, Jen. Duck, woman."</p>
