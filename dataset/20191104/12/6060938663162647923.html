      <p>NEW DELHI: India on Monday decided not to join the China-backed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Regional-Comprehensive-Economic-Partnership">Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership</a> (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/RCEP">RCEP</a>) <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/trade-deal">trade deal</a>, saying that its key concerns over the agreement have not been addressed, sources said.</p>
      <p>"There will be no compromise on core interests. RCEP agreement does not reflect its original intent," top government sources said.</p>
      <p>Sources added that India's stand is a mixture of pragmatism, the urge to safeguard interests of the poor and the effort to give an advantage to India's service sector.</p>
      <p>"Our farmers, traders, professionals and industries have stakes in such decisions. Equally important are the workers and consumers, who make India a huge market and the third biggest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. When I measure the RCEP agreement with respect to the interests of all Indians, I do not get a positive answer. Therefore, neither the Talisman of Gandhiji nor my own conscience permit me to join RCEP," PM Modi said.</p>
      <p>The Modi government had taken a tough stand over the mega <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian">Asian</a> trade pact, pointing out several concerns — ranging from the base year for tariff reduction to protection against Chinese imports and opening up services sector by the other 15 countries.</p>
      <p>Indian officials had made it clear that the Modi administration is unwilling to accept any deadline and wanted the country’s interests to be fully protected.</p>
      <p>There was no credible assurance for India on market access and non-tariff barriers. India also had very valid concerns on keeping 2014 as the base year for tariff reductions, sources said.</p>
      <p>Asserting that India will no longer give in to pressure from global powers on trade issues, the sources said that India is playing on the front foot this time.</p>
