      <p>The well-known leaker @UniverseIce has confirmed rumors that have been circulating on the Web for a long time. According to him, the upcoming Samsung smartphone flagship, the Galaxy S11 has a high probability of using a new 108MP camera sensor.</p>
      <p>We do not know whether it will be based on the same Isocell Bright HMX sensor that Xiaomi uses in the Mi CC9 Pro (Mi Note 10) and Mi Mix Alpha, or the Koreans will stock up on something special for their flagship.</p>
      <p>Recall that the last time <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> changed the resolution of the main camera of its flagship phone was in 2016 when it decreased from 16MP to 12MP. In subsequent years, the company took the path of adding additional lenses. And improving optics but practically did not improved the resolution of the sensors in its smartphones. Next year, it seems, the situation will finally change.</p>

      <p>In a blog post describing the new sensor, Xiaomi states that the huge number of pixels will allow users to capture images with the size of a billboard. “Those who love taking pictures can not only take more detailed pictures. But also make better use of their imagination and creativity with this sensor”. Says the company in the post.</p>
