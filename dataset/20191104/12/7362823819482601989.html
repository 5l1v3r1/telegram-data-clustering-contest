      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/louisiana">Louisiana</a> pastor praised <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>'s last-minute "Sunday Service," where "over 1,000" people raised their hands to commit their lives to Christ on Friday, calling it a "new wave of revival."</p>
      <p>West opened up his "Sunday Service," which is not always held on Sunday, to the public a few months ago, traveling across the country to hold gospel services and perform songs from his new album, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-album-1-billboard">"Jesus is King."</a></p>

      <p>Curvine Brewington, a pastor at Crossroads Church in Lafayette, attended Friday's service with his wife. The outdoor service was held at a field provided by Bethany Church in Baton Rouge, La but was not affiliated with the church.</p>

      <p>"Tonight, worship was lifted, the name of Christ was exalted, the Word of God was preached, a multitude prayed together, the Gospel was clearly proclaimed, and an opportunity to respond was given," Brewington wrote on Friday. "In a crowd of 6,000, people from all walks of life, all ages, and all races, I witnessed over 1,000 people respond to The Gospel by raising their hands to accept Jesus as their Lord &amp; Savior!"</p>

      <p>Quoting a portion of Isaiah 43:19 and 1 Corinthians 1:27, the pastor also added: "Say what you want, &amp; think what you want.... But trust me when I tell you - The Spirit of the Living God was indeed present. I danced, wept, stood in awe of God’s redemptive work, &amp; can honestly say that tonight I witnessed a new wave of REVIVAL first hand."</p>
