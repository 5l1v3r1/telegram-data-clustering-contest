        <b>Activision has stated that controller support for Call of Duty Mobile is “still being worked on” after its removal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>While the feature was included in the title’s beta release, Activision silently removed controller support upon release. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/call-of-duty-mobile-can-be-played-on-pc-with-traditional-controls-with-this-workaround/">While the title is currently available to play with both keyboard and mouse and controller on PC</a>, it’s currently impossible on mobile devices.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDutyMobile/comments/dqcnql/call_of_duty_mobile_november_1st_community_update/">In a post on Reddit</a>, Activision addressed the fan feedback regarding the removal of the controller support feature.</p>
      <p>“Over the last two community updates we’ve addressed several pieces of feedback that the community had been inquiring about and there are still a few continuously coming up: controller support and login options,” Activision said.</p>
      <p>“We’d just like to reiterate that both are still being worked on. We hear you and we also care a great deal about both topics, which is why we are taking the time to make sure they are both fully fleshed out, balanced, and ready to go before announcing anything.”</p>
      <p>Hopefully, CoD Mobile will get controller support sometime soon. With the title becoming popular, more and more players are clamouring for this feature.</p>
