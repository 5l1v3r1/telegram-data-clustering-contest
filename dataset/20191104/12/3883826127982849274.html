        <b>During a pretty remarkable 12 months on the international stage for UK-based athletes - even if not quite everyone ended up with a winners' trophy - the achievements of Cross Counter should not be forgotten.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victory in the AU $8m (£4.3m) <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/46106503">Melbourne Cup in 2018</a> for the four-year-old, part of Sheikh Mohammed's Newmarket-based Godolphin operation, was a significant first.</p>
      <p>Though Irish, French and German challengers had won the iconic Australian sporting event that famously 'stops a nation' on the first Tuesday of November, no horse prepared in Britain had previously been successful.</p>
      <p>And now trainer Charlie Appleby has brought Cross Counter back to Flemington for the 158th staging of the Melbourne Cup, looking to become only the sixth dual winner - of which, just one, the legendary Makybe Diva (2003-2005), went on to add a third.</p>

      <p>Godolphin jockey William Buick takes the ride on the runner that has been allotted 57.5kg [9st 1lb], the most weight in the handicap. A draw at number five in the stalls is favourable.</p>
      <p>The betting puts Cross Counter just behind the favourites, but hopes are high of a repeat.</p>
      <p>"He's travelled down beautifully," Appleby's assistant Chris Connett told the Godolphin website. "He's really bright, really keen.</p>
      <p>"His work [training] has been really solid… all the signs are that he's just about primed for the day.</p>
      <p>"There's slightly more pressure on him being the defending champ, but in another way there's less pressure because he's not had a week standing his box like last year after he had a little mishap [cut a leg]."</p>
      <h3>Welfare concerns in build-up</h3>

      <p>While the Melbourne Cup retains its legendary status in Aussie sport, the race could still do with what might be described as a 'good' result.</p>
      <p>The fact overseas challengers have dominated the latest results - since 2010, five winners have been from Europe - is minor compared to the pressures under which the sport in Australia increasingly finds itself.</p>
      <p>Protests over welfare following the deaths of six horses as a result of injuries sustained in recent Melbourne Cups have intensified since the airing of a TV documentary detailing the brutal ending of the lives of racehorses in a Queensland abattoir.</p>
      <p>On top of all that, a number of trainers have become embroiled in a doping scandal, and there have been other allegations of wrongdoing.</p>

      <p>It is believed pressure from animal rights campaigners influenced American singer Taylor Swift's decision to pull out of being the headline act at Flemington on the big day - officially it was because of 'a recent change to her Asian promotional tour'.</p>
      <p>In 2019, European runners are due to make up nearly half of the field though it would have been more had the Hughie Morrison-trained Marmelo, runner-up to Cross Counter in 2018, and Godolphin's Ispolini not been controversially ruled out by stewards on the advice of their vets.</p>
      <h3>The life of O'Briens</h3>
      <p>Fresh from becoming, at 26, the youngest trainer to saddle a winner at the Breeders' Cup fixture in America, Ireland's Joseph O'Brien has four hopefuls as he chases - already - a second Cup success, following <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/41884841">Rekindling in 2017.</a></p>
      <p>The quartet includes Master Of Reality, with jockey Frankie Dettori, 48, looking for his first triumph in the big race.</p>

        <figcaption>Joseph O'Brien is only the second person, after Freddy Head, to ride and train winners at the Breeders' Cup</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Famously, the prize also remains a gap in the CV of O'Brien's champion trainer-father Aidan, one of whose runners, Johannes Vermeer, was runner-up behind Rekindling.</p>
      <p>O'Brien senior has three in the line-up, a trio perhaps headed by Il Paradiso and Wayne Lordan, the jockey who partnered Joseph's Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf winner Iridessa.</p>
      <p>The Charlie Fellowes-trained Prince Of Arran - caught late on and third in 2018 - has again travelled down under from the UK, and won October's Geelong Cup.</p>
      <p>Completing the European contingent is Raymond Tusk, trained by Richard Hannon in Wiltshire, and fourth in York's Ebor Handicap behind Mustajeer, which is now Aussie-owned and trained and also in the field.</p>
      <p>The leading contenders are Constantinople, formerly with Aidan O'Brien; 2018's fourth-placed horse Finche, ridden by three-time winning jockey Kerrin McEvoy; and the Japanese raider Mer De Glace, looking to continue a good run for Japan in major Aussie horse racing prizes.</p>
