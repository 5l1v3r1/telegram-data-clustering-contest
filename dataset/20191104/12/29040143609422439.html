      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has said that U.S. companies will "very shortly" receive licenses that will allow them to sell components to Huawei.</li>
        <li>Ross also revealed that the U.S. government received a total of 206 license applications.</li>
        <li>A "phase one" trade deal between the U.S. and China is expected to be announced this month.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Last month, <i>The New York Times</i> had <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/trump-administration-allow-us-firms-supply-non-sensitive-goods-huawei">reported</a> that the Trump administration would soon issue licenses to U.S. companies to sell 'non-sensitive' goods to Huawei. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/ross-optimistic-on-china-trade-deal-says-huawei-licenses-coming"><i>Bloomberg</i></a>, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has now confirmed that the licenses will indeed be issued "very shortly."</p>
      <p>He added that the U.S. government received a total of 206 license requests. While no timeline was confirmed by Ross, there is a good chance that the companies that had sent applications will be granted licenses to sell to Huawei before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The U.S. and China are expected to sign a "phase one" trade deal this month. Ross told <i>Bloomberg</i> that he is very optimistic that the deal could be reached this month and that there was "no natural reason" that could cause the deal to fall apart.</p>
      <p>If everything goes as planned, Huawei should be able to roll out an update to add Google services to the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-mate-30-pro-review">Mate 30</a> series phones. It would also mean that the company's 2020 smartphone lineup will ship with Google services right out of the box. Despite the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/huawei-losing-access-android-updates-google-support-after-trump-trade-ban">U.S. blacklist</a>, Huawei <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/global-smartphone-sales-grow-first-time-two-years">shipped</a> 66.8 million smartphones in the second quarter of 2019, grabbing a 19% share of the worldwide market.</p>
