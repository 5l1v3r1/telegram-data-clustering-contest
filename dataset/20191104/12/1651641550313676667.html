        <b>For those who remembered that an FPS Terminator game is coming out this month, well, Terminator: Resistance has been delayed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, a little bit of hyperbole there: the upcoming FPS title will only be delayed in North America. Instead of the original November 15th release, which is still the case for European gamers, <a href="https://youtu.be/MxK70Q2RQSk">you’ll have to wait until December 10th</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>Terminator: Resistance introduces a new hero, Jacob Rivers, a soldier in the Resistance Pacific Division. Despite the fact that Jacob is just a private, he’ll soon discover that he’s been targeted by the latest threat from SKYNET and marked for termination!<br/>SKYNET may be destined to lose this war, but at what cost to Jacob? Experience the events leading up to the decisive final battle, smash SKYNET’s Defence Grid and help decide the fate of mankind in the war against the machines!</blockquote>
      <p>Based on the universe of the original two Terminator movies and set 30 years after judgement day, Resistance aims to expand upon the grim-dark future we glimpse in those movies. Whether it’ll account for a <i>huge</i> event in the recent Dark Fate movie is unknown.</p>
