Based in San Francisco, Scout RFP's platform is designed to help businesses manage the entire procurement process, from project intake through sourcing pipeline, to contract and supplier management.</p>
      <p>Workday was a strategic investor in Scout RFP, which had raised over $60 million as of its Series C round.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details.html?id=1940642">The acquisition</a> is meant to help Workday expand its portfolio of procure-to-pay services and accelerate its ability to deliver a comprehensive source-to-pay solution, the company said.<br/><br/>"Scout RFP is an industry leader that is loved by procurement teams who are undergoing a significant shift to better optimize spend," said Workday CEO and co-founder Aneel Bhusri. "Together, we will deliver a modern source-to-pay solution that accelerates our momentum in the spend management market and expands how customers can plan, execute, analyze, and extend in one system." <br/><br/>Going forward, Scout RFP will continue to build its core sourcing technology and support customers. The company's more than 160 employees across North America and Europe will also join Workday. </p>
