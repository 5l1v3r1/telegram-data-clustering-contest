      <h2>Coronation Street favourite Ali Neeson could be in grave danger after crossing Gary Windass, with fans predicting a shock death</h2>

      <p>Coronation Street viewers believe villain Gary Windass will murder doctor Ali Neeson in a new twist.</p>
      <p>Gary started a romance with Ali's ex Maria in recent episodes, leading to the two men falling out - with Gary eager to wind the doctor up and get what he wanted.</p>
      <p>But there was awkward scenes on Monday night, as Maria kissed Ali when he confessed he regretted dumping her.</p>
      <p>Gary learned of the moment and was left pretty furious, hoping to get Maria all to himself and steal her off Ali.</p>
      <p>In fact he made it his mission to get one over on the doctor, before making it clear he had plans for his rival.</p>

      <p>As the episode ended, a smug Gary was pretty pleased with himself but still wanted revenge on Ali.</p>
      <p>In scenes to come he will hire a private detective to get some dirt on the doctor, following him being reported for negligence over Emma Brooker's hospital dash.</p>
      <p>A distracted Ali told her she probably had food poisoning when it was in fact a ruptured appendix.</p>

      <p>Now, he wants to take Ali down and find out something that he can use against him.</p>
      <p>But viewers feared for Michelle Connor's son, predicting the moment with Maria was enough to send killer Gary over the edge.</p>
      <p>Having already killed loan shark Rick Neelan as well as causing the death of Rana Habeeb in the factory roof collapse, fans now think Ali is his next victim.</p>

      <p>One fan said: "Ali is going to regret crossing the killing machine Windass."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "Gary didn't look happy to see Ali &amp; Maria kiss. Ali better watch his back."</p>
      <p>A third begged: "Poor Ali please don't hurt him Gary," while a fourth said: "Gary watching on Ali's a dead man."</p>
      <p>There's set to be huge scenes on the cards as the storyline develops, with Adam Barlow also caught up in the drama.</p>
