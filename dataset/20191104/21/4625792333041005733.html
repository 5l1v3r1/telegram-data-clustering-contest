      <p>Piers Morgan called John Legend hypocritical after the songwriter announced plans to release a Christmas album that has a version of the song <i>Baby It's Cold Outside</i> with politically correct lyrics.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old Morgan <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-7647755/PIERS-MORGAN-John-Legends-worried-filthy-lyrics-rewrite-rapper-pals-songs.html">wrote</a> a column Monday for the <i>Daily Mail </i>defending the original lyrics, saying, "There's nothing sleazy about it, or nasty, or even remotely 'problematic' to quote the ghastly buzzword of modern day political correctness."</p>
      <p>"It's fun, sexy, playful, and both the man and woman are completely in control of their own actions during the mutually enjoyable and totally consensual experience," the former CNN host said.</p>
      <p>Legends version of the song, which he performs with Kelly Clarkson, censors <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/10/29/baby-its-cold-outside-goes-consensual-with-an-update-from-john-legend-and-kelly-clarkson/#5b3fb0ed5eba">lyrics</a> such as, <i>"Say, what's in this drink?” </i>and <i>“No cabs to be had out there,” </i>with <i>"If I have one more drink?" </i>and <i>"It's your body, and your choice."</i></p>
      <p>Morgan called the new lyrics "a load of nauseating PC-crazed tripe." He also pointed out that Legend is friends with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Pharrell Williams, all of whom have all written worse lyrics.</p>
      <p>"Legend's targeted 'Baby It's Cold Outside' because it's an easy win for him — something guaranteed to get him lots of publicity and make women go 'awwwww, isn't he lovely?'" he said. "Yet when it comes to the often disturbingly hateful women-shaming lyrics of so many of his contemporaries, gutless Legend remains silent."</p>
      <p>Legend, 40, and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, are on the cover of the December <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/john-legend-and-chrissy-teigen-cover-story">edition</a> of <i>Vanity Fair,</i> where some of the lyrics from his new album were published. The songwriter announced in the issue that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-back-warren-for-president">he and Teigen are supporting</a> Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president and were confused why other people were not backing a woman president.</p>
