      </p>
      <p>When Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note10, it also introduced a new game streaming platform called PlayGalaxy Link albeit with very little by way of concrete information. We <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/08/14/samsungs-playgalaxy-link-game-streaming-service-will-launch-in-september/">learned soon after</a> that it would be launching in September, and so it's come to pass. The <a href="https://playgalaxy.com/">Playgalaxay.com</a> site is now live and the Android app is available for download.</p>
      <p>According <a href="https://playgalaxy.com/features">to the site</a>, Play Galaxy Link allows you to connect to your PC over WiFi or mobile data and stream your library of games on Samsung your phone or tablet. As you'd expect, the service supports third-party Bluetooth controllers, mice, and keyboard, and the site once again points you to the recommended <a href="http://glap.co.kr/en/index.php">Glap controller peripheral</a> that your Galaxy phone can fit inside. On-screen controls are also supported, but let's be honest, they're entirely inferior.</p>

      <p>When you register a Windows 10 PC with the app and are using a LAN connection, you'll even be able to wake it via Play Galaxy Link. It's completely free of charge, and assuming you have the games on your PC already, the app will discover them and auto-populate with a list. You can do this manually too, in case it misses some out.</p>

          <b>Samsung adds PlayGalaxy Link support for the S10 series</b>
        </p>
        <p>The latest version of the PlayGalaxy Link app has a small pile of fixes and tweaks, like improved right-click support and a <a href="https://playgalaxy.com/support">dedicated site for error codes</a>. But the most substantial change in the new v1.0.5 update is device support: PlayGalaxy Link now works with the Galaxy S10 series, including the S10, S10 Plus, S10e, and S10 5G.</p>
        <p>Interested S10 owners can download this latest update via Samsung's Galaxy Store app on supported devices, or over at <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/samsung-electronics-co-ltd/playgalaxy-link/playgalaxy-link-1-0-5-1030a9d2-release/playgalaxy-link-1-0-5-1030a9d2-android-apk-download/">APK Mirror</a>.</p>
        <p>End of Update</p>
