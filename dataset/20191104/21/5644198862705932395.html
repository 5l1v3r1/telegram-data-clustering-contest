      <p>Police stopped the truck on a highway near the northern Greek city of Xanthi for a regular check. They arrested the driver and took him and the migrants to a nearby police station for identification.</p>
      <p>Greece is currently struggling with the biggest resurgence in refugee arrivals since 2015, when more than a million people crossed into Europe from Turkey via Greece.</p>
      <p>About 34,000 asylum seekers and refugees are being held in camps on the Aegean islands close to Turkey.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 migrants, all believed to be Vietnamese, were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London.</p>
