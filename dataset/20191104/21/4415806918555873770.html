      <p>A dozen bottles of fine French wine have arrived at the International Space Station – but they are not for the astronauts.</p>
      <p>The red wine will age for a year up there before returning to Earth, and researchers will study how weightlessness and space radiation affect the ageing process.</p>
      <p>The goal is to develop new flavors and properties for the food industry.</p>
      <p>The bottles were flown up aboard a Northrop Grumman capsule that launched from Virginia on Saturday and arrived at the ISS on Monday. Each bottle was packed in a metal canister to prevent breakage.</p>

      <p>Universities in Bordeaux, France, and Bavaria, Germany, are taking part in the experiment by Space Cargo Unlimited, a Luxembourg start-up.</p>
      <p>Winemaking uses yeast and bacteria, and involves chemical processes, making wine ideal for space study, said University of Erlangen-Nuremberg’s Michael Lebert, the experiment’s scientific director.</p>
      <p>This is the first of six space missions planned by the company over the next three years touching on the future of agriculture.</p>
      <p>“This is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure,” said Nicolas Gaume, chief executive and co-founder of Space Cargo Unlimited.</p>
      <p>Nasa is opening the space station to more business opportunities like this and eventually even private astronaut missions.</p>

      <p>The Cygnus capsule that pulled up to the space station on Monday contained multiple commercial ventures.</p>
      <p>Also on board were an oven for baking chocolate chip cookies and samples of carbon fibre used by Lamborghini in its sports cars.</p>
      <p>Budweiser has already sent barley seeds to the station, with an eye to becoming the beverage of choice on Mars.</p>
      <p>In 2015, a Japanese company known for its whiskey and other alcoholic drinks sent up samples. Scotch also made a visit to space in another experiment.</p>
      <p>As for high-flying wine cellars, this is not the first. A French astronaut took a bottle of wine aboard the Discovery shuttle in 1985. The bottle remained corked in orbit.</p>
      <p>The space station’s current crew includes three Americans, two Russians and an Italian, who might have preferred a good Chianti on board.</p>
