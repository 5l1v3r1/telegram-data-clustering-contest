      <h1>'Star Wars' Star Mark Hamill 'Frightened Beyond Words' By Build the Wall Game at WH Halloween Party</h1>
      <h2>Actor Mark Hamill was dismayed by a “Build The Wall” game that took place at a recent White House Halloween party, which allowed attendees to help secure the United States border by adding their own personalized paper bricks to the “wall.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:14:40+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author">Alana Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>Mark Hamill suggested that President Donald Trump had been teaching children “racism and hatred” at a Halloween party on October 25, as it featured a “Build The Wall” game promoting the security of the southern border of the United States.</p>
      <p>The game — which allowed costumed children of executive branch staffers and other VIPs to help “Build the Wall” by writing their names on paper bricks and taping them to a wall — was put together by staff at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), where the Halloween party was held.</p>
      <p>The EEOB offices had been instructed to put together interactive and inspiring games for child attendees, which all addressed the party’s theme: “When I grow up I want to be…”</p>
      <p>When the <i>Star Wars</i> star caught wind of the child’s game, the actor took to Twitter to express his fear and disquietude over the lighthearted activity.</p>

      <p>“Children are born innocent. They can only be taught racism &amp; hatred,” <a href="https://twitter.com/HamillHimself/status/1191100001704763392">tweeted</a> Hamill. “What they learned at this #WH event is frightening beyond words. Remember when a #POTUS was a role-model for kids? We’re better than this. #HalloweenHorrorStory”</p>
      <p>This was not the first time Hamill had taken offense to the First Family’s Halloween activities.</p>
      <p>In September, the actor <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/30/mark-hamill-attacks-ivanka-trump-and-her-child-over-star-wars-costume/">attacked</a> Ivanka Trump and her family in reaction to her tweeting a photo of her 3-year-old son Theodore wearing a Stormtrooper costume, alongside the caption, “The Force is strong in my family.”</p>
      <p>“You misspelled “Fraud.”#GoForceYourself” reacted the 68-year-old, seemingly outraged over the president’s daughter enjoying the October holiday with her family.</p>
      <p>Hamill is an avid and outspoken critic of President Trump. Last year, the actor <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/12/28/mark-hamill-donald-trump-worse-than-darth-vader/">insisted</a> that the president was worse than Darth Vader, because the <i>Star Wars</i> character eventually “saw the errors of his ways.”</p>
