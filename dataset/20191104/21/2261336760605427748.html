      <p>Kevin Lee is back.</p>
      <p>‘The Motown Phenom’ made a serious statement at UFC 244 this past Saturday, crumpling Gregor Gillespie with a highlight reel head kick knockout to kick off the main card at Madison Square Garden.</p>

      <p>It was a much needed win for Lee who, prior to UFC 244, suffered back-to-back defeats at the hands of Rafael dos Anjos and Al Iaquinta.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at a post-fight media scrum, the 27-year-old said his KO win over Gillespie was ‘the cleanest knockout’ of his career and credited his move to Tristar for the result.</p>
      <p>“It feels great to get back into the win column,” Lee said, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/After-Cleanest-KO-of-Career-Kevin-Lee-Credits-Move-to-Tristar-Gym-for-Improvement-164967">per Tristen Critchfield of Sherdog MMA</a>. “Coming off two losses, it eats at you some days, so it’s been a lot,” Lee said. “It’s been a lot to get to this point, years and years just to get to that kick. It feels f—-ng good. I think that’s the cleanest knockout of my career. I think it’s something that he wasn’t expecting and that a lot of guys down at 155 weren’t expecting.</p>
      <p>“I’m coming with a whole different type of power that these guys ain’t seen me throw before. I haven’t even shown half of my game yet. I’ve got a lot of fights in the UFC, but I seriously feel like I’m just starting.”</p>
      <p>“I was saying even before this fight, regardless of how it went, I feel that going up to Tristar made me a better fighter,” he added. “It made me more focused,” he said. “I’ve always had the talent and the skills, but it’s been hard for me to put everything together, and now I feel like I’ve found the perfect place and the perfect guide to do that.</p>
      <p>“[Lightweight] is the place for me from here on out. I got a title to get. I started my career here, and this is where I’m going to shine.”</p>
      <p>At just 27-years-old, Lee has time to further hone his craft at Tristar where head coach Firas Zahabi could mold the NCAA Division II wrestler into a potential champion.</p>
      <p>As of today, Lee is ranked #10 in the official UFC lightweight rankings.</p>
