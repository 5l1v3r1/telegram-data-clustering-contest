      <p>The letter reads as follows: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Hello everyone. This is Hi!</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Today’s letter is about my 7th anniversary! Time flies. It doesn’t feel real to me right now. I can’t believe that it’s been seven years already hahaha. First of all, I thank my fans who have traveled this journey with me. I can’t express the emotions I am feeling. There were many days in between that first day till now. That’s why we remember them as precious memories now, right?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>I will become a Hi that can repay you for staying by my side and trusting, waiting, and cheering me on. I just thought of it but three years from now it’ll be the 10th anniversary! If I can fill that time well, I hope that I can celebrate a special anniversary with fans on that day. I'm looking forward to it so please stay with me until then!"</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>P.S. You haven’t forgotten our 100-year promise, right? </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>From a loving and clingy Hi."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Congratulations to Lee Hi!</p>
