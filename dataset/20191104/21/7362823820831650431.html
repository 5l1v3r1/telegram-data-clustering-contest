      <p>A Russian startup is selling autonomous robots, which buyers can choose to make look like any person on Earth.</p>
      <p>"Everyone will now be able to order a robot with any appearance — for professional or personal use. Thus, we open a huge market in service, education and entertainment. Imagine a replica of Michael Jordan selling basketball uniforms and William Shakespeare reading his own texts in a museum?" said Aleksei Iuzhakov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Promobot, in a <a href="https://promo-bot.ai/blog/promobot-launched-mass-production-of-life-like-robots-that-look-like-humans/">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The company's <a href="https://promo-bot.ai/production/robo-c/">Robo-C</a> has a neck and torso that each have three degrees of freedom of movement, but it cannot walk.</p>

      <p>The robot's face has 18 moving parts, allowing it to make 600 "micro-expressions," and its artificial intelligence contains 100,000 speech modules.</p>
      <p>"Promobot believes that a robot like this is capable of removing the barrier in human-machine interaction and replacing a number of employees in crowded places– post offices, banks, and municipal institutions," the company states in a press release.</p>
      <p>However, the android -- which Promobot calls a "completely anthropomorphic machine," only has 8 hours of battery life.</p>
