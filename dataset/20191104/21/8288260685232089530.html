      <p>The Chase presenter Bradley Walsh was left with a red-face this weekend - after a "rude" question surfaced.</p>
      <p>Bradley, a former Coronation Street star himself, welcomed current Corrie badboy Mikey North onto the ITV1 show.</p>
      <p>The celebrity instalment of the popular ITV1 daytime favourite aired on Saturday evening (November 2).</p>
      <p>The show saw Mikey, who plays Gary Windass, go up against the Chaser in a bid to land a life-changing sum of money for a charity of his choice.</p>

      <p>Mikey appeared on the programme with The Saturdays singer Una Healy, This Morning presenter Alison Hammond and boxer Carl Froch.</p>
      <p>The question read: "In what form of gambling might you be tempted to hold your plums?"</p>
      <p>Bradley couldn’t even finish reading it out before creasing over with laughter, along with the audience and contestants.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The answers available to Mikey were ‘slot machine’, ‘backgammon’ and ‘spread betting’ - the latter Bradley had another giggle over.</p>
      <p>Mikey went for ‘slot machine’, joking: "When your plums come up in front of you Bradley, you've got to hold them."</p>
      <p>The cobbles villain had only just arrived at the board with Anne ‘The Governess’ Hegerty eagerly waiting when Bradders had a fit of the giggles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Chase airs weekdays at 5pm on ITV.</b>
