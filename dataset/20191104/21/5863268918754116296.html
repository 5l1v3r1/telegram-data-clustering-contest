      <h1>Pakistan rejects baseless Indian media reports about Kartarpur Corridor</h1>

      <p>ISLAMABAD (APP) - Pakistan on Monday completely rejected the baseless reports in a section of the Indian media, attributed to the “intelligence sources”, insinuating the presence of alleged “training camps” in Narowal near the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib.</p>
      <p>According to the Foreign Office spokesman, Pakistan’s Kartarpur spirit was aimed at facilitating Nanak Naamlevas, especially Sikhs, to visit one of their most revered places of worship and promoting inter-faith harmony.</p>
      <p>The content of the media reports in question was part of a malicious propaganda campaign in India that could not be condemned enough, he added.</p>
      <p>He said the unfounded allegations about Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib being used for any purpose other than worship were a deliberate attempt to misrepresent Pakistan’s goodwill gesture, undermine the Corridor initiative, and hurt the religious sentiments of the Sikhs all over the world.</p>
      <p>“We have no doubt that such mischievous attempts will be rejected with the contempt that they deserve,” he remarked. </p>
