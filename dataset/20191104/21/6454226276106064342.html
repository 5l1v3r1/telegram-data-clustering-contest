      <h1>Buy a Rotorua apartment and the seller will throw in an office in downtown Auckland too</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:40:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Greg Ninness</a></address>
      <p>"Buy one, get one free" deals are nothing new, but it's an unusual way of selling real estate.</p>
      <p>But that's the deal that's being offered in the sale of a Rotorua apartment (see photo above).</p>
      <p>The one bedroom apartment with a car park is being auctioned by Ray White City Apartments on November 21.</p>
      <p>Nothing unusual in that, but according to the <b><a href="https://rwcityapartments.co.nz/properties/residential-for-sale/rotorua-district/rotorua-3010/apartment/2207718">property's listing page</a></b> on the Ray White website,  "When you buy this apartment, our seller is giving away a free 30 square metre office space in the heart of New Zealand's other favourite tourist destination, Auckland's famous waterfront precinct."</p>
      <p>It's a deal that's obviously designed to appeal to investors, or perhaps those looking for a different take on the traditional home and income.</p>
      <p>The apartment has a floor area of 38 square metres, so it's compact, although there are many that are a lot smaller in Auckland.</p>
      <p>And it's rented out at $330 a week and has provided its owner with a high level of occupancy.</p>
      <p>So what's the catch?</p>
      <p>The office space is in the Scene One apartment complex on Beach Road in Auckland's CBD, just around the corner from Britomart.</p>
      <p>It's a great location, but Scene One is a leasehold complex.</p>
      <p>The ground rent for the complex is reviewed every seven years and was last up for review in 2018, although the revised rent is yet to be finalised.</p>
      <p>Currently the ground rent on the unit is $7368 a year, with rates and operating costs (the equivalent of body corporate fees) taking total outgoings on the unit to $10,391 a year.</p>
      <p>But until the new ground rent is set, there's uncertainty over how much those outgoings will be over the next six years.</p>
      <p>And the complex faces remediation issues, with costs yet to be finalised, creating more financial uncertainty.</p>
      <p>And it's currently vacant, although its potential rent has been estimated at $380 to $400 a week.</p>
      <p>So there's a bit to think about.</p>
      <p>Dominic Worthington, the Ray White agent handling the sale, said he wanted to try a marketing approach that hadn't really been done before in this country.</p>
      <p>But isn't it just another way of presenting a sale of two properties that are offered as a single lot?</p>
      <p>Worthington says no, because the apartment has a declared reserve of $199,000 compared to its 2017 Rating Valuation of $209,000.</p>
      <p>"So the office hasn't been capitalised into the reserve price at all," he said.</p>
      <p>If the apartment sold for its Rating Valuation of $209,000 and continued to be rented at $330 a week, it would provide a gross rental yield of 8.2%.</p>
      <p>The key to making a success of the deal will be in securing a tenant for the office as quickly as possible, because as long as it's vacant the owner is responsible for all of its outgoings with no income coming in from it.</p>
