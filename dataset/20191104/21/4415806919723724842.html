      <p>The US has told the United Nations it has begun the process of pulling out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p>
      <p>Secretary of state Mike Pompeo said he submitted a formal notice to the UN, starting a withdrawal process that does not become official for a year.</p>
      <p>Mr Pompeo’s statement touted America’s carbon pollution cuts and called the Paris deal an “unfair economic burden” to the US economy.</p>
      <p>Nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change.</p>
      <p>The US is the first nation to pull out of the deal.</p>
      <p>Agreement rules prevented a country from pulling out in the first three years after ratification on November 4 2016.</p>
