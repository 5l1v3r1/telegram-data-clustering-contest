        <b>BERLIN (Sputnik) - Berlin authorities have banned actors posing as US soldiers from the site of the iconic Checkpoint Charlie that was a border crossing between the East and West occupation zones, media said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The checkpoint was used by the Allied military to cross into East Berlin up until <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911041077223488-alexanderplatz-illuminated-to-mark-30-years-since-fall-of-berlin-wall---video/">the Berlin Wall fell</a> in 1989. The white hut was closed and moved to a museum in 1990 and a replica was erected in the 2000s.</p>
      <p>For almost two decades, reenactors from a German theatre company have posed with tourists, handed out fake border stamps and sold souvenir visas, according to the Bild newspaper.</p>
      <p>But city authorities have found that actors were not always happy with the voluntary donations they were given and demanded more tips. They reportedly earned up to $5,500 on a good day.</p>
