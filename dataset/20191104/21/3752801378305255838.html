      <p>Forty-one migrants were found alive in a refrigerated truck in northern Greece on Monday, said police, who arrested the driver.</p>
      <p>The migrants, of apparent Afghan origin, were mostly in good condition but seven received first aid in hospital, the police said.</p>
      <p>"The truck contained men and boys. Identifying their nationality will require a couple of days," a police source told AFP.</p>
      <p>The truck was stopped by police on the Egnatia motorway between the towns of Xanthi and Komotini.</p>
      <p>The driver, a man from Georgia, was arrested.</p>
      <p>Local media reported that police were also seeking a second man from Turkey in connection with the incident.</p>
      <p>The discovery came after 39 people, all believed to be Vietnamese nationals, were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain last month, highlighting the risks of illegal migrant routes to Europe, even for those avoiding perilous travel by sea.</p>
      <p>Greece is experiencing its highest asylum-seeker arrival figures since 2016, when a controversial deal between the EU and Turkey stemmed previous flows of nearly a million people.</p>
      <p>Scores arrive daily, overwhelming camps on Greek islands facing Turkey where over 34,000 people are staying, most of them in deplorable living conditions.</p>
      <p>A two-year-old girl from Iraq died Monday when she was hit by a car on the island of Chios, state agency ANA said.</p>
