      <p>Made In Chelsea's Rosie Fortescue has posted a swearing rant on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories after discovering thieves stole from her jewellery stand overnight.</p>
      <p>The luxury jewellery brand owner, 29, who is displaying her offering at Spirits of Christmas fair at Olympia London in West Kensington from 4-10 November, visited the venue on Sunday night to lay out her designs in hopes of drumming up business prior to the exhibition space opening on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Overnight the stacks of rings, bangles and earrings, that were only covered by a white sheet atop of a table were stolen, according to the businesswoman.</p>
      <p>In response, she penned an expletive rant on her Instagram stories.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "Whoever stole from my @rosiefortescuejewellery stand at @spiritfairs. F*** you.</p>
      <p>"I hope you get f***ed by karma you c***."</p>
      <p>Later in the day, Rosie appeared to have cooled down after being victim to the horrible crime as she share a snap of her kitted out stall, decorated by a rainbow balloon arch onto social media.</p>

        <figcaption>In response, she penned an expletive rant on her Instagram stories (Image: INSTAGRAM)</figcaption>

      <p>She captioned the image "Despite the negative start I’m happy to be here at @spiritfairs stand A50 all week with @rosiefortescuejewellery You’ll see my stand from far away thanks to my insane balloon arch by @bubblegumballoons come and say hi and buy jewels."</p>
      <p>Rosie' elegant and dainty designs feature fun and playful statement pieces included gem encrusted rings, bracelets and earrings.</p>
      <p>The South West London native rose to fame on E4's posh reality show in 2011 which she left in 2017.</p>
      <p>The star famously hooked-up with Hugo Taylor behind her best pal Millie Mackintosh's back.</p>

      <p>In one of the show's most iconic moment Millie confronted her now-husband and her later-bridesmaid Rosie for their dalliance as she took to the stage at a Twenties party.</p>
      <p>In front of the crowd, Millie spoke in the microphone and said: "This second... a second toast to my best friend Rosie Fortescue, for hooking up with Hugo Taylor while we were together and lying about it. Here's to friendship... You're disgusting".</p>
      <p>However, it all seems water under the bridge with Rosie being bridesmaid to Millie when she tied the knot with Hugo following her split from UK rapper Professor Green.</p>
