      <p>As a friend, I should tell you that you should think twice before spending big bucks on tech only a few weeks before Black Friday. But I also want to tell you that the 11-inch iPad Pro (64GB, Wi-Fi), which currently costs $799 through Apple, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K344J3N/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;linkId=3b7a488ffbff896e53fadedc95b61eb7&amp;language=en_US">is $649.99 at Amazon</a>, which matches the best price that we’ve seen yet.</p>
      <p>Price drops on Apple’s flagship tablet have slowed in recent months, likely due to other new iPad models — like the iPad Air, iPad mini, and the seventh-generation iPad — stealing a bit of the spotlight. Whatever the actual reason, this is as good of a deal as we’ve seen. According to data from CamelCamelCamel, it’s the first time since early August that this model was listed for this price.</p>
      <p>Typically at this time of the year, we’d have expected to have already heard about new iPad hardware revisions. Since Apple missed its usual window for announcing a new tablet, the iPad Pro (2018) may continue being its high-end option for the rest of the year, at least.</p>
