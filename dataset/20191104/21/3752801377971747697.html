      <h1>KZN health MEC demands answers after nurse raped in hospital's consulting rooms</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T21:58:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sesona Ngqakamba</a></address>
      <p>KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu has demanded answers from Nkonjeni Hospital's management in Mahlabathini and a contracted security company after a nurse was raped in the hospital's consulting rooms on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that an unknown suspect walked onto the hospital's premises at around 17:00 pretending to seek medical assistance. He then proceeded to the internal clinic's consulting room and overpowered the nurse, before raping her, Simelane-Zulu said.</p>
      <p>By the time the police had arrived, the suspect had already fled.</p>
      <p>Now, Simelane-Zulu is demanding answers as to how the suspect had made his way into the hospital and how he managed to flee without being detected.</p>
      <p>"I am extremely outraged and completely shocked and concerned that a nurse who left her home to provide care and hope to the sick could end up being sexually violated in the workplace in such a horrendous way. The act itself is grossly disgraceful and inhumane."</p>
      <p>She added that security management at the hospital was now a concern.</p>
      <p>Simelane-Zulu has requested a report from the hospital, security management and district detailing how the incident could occur under their watch.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I want [to] know what is going to be done to prevent a recurrence of such an incident, so that our staff can rest assured that they are safe."</p>
      <p>She has directed that the nurse be given all the clinical and psychological support she needs, saying: "It really is the least we [the department] can do."</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said a case of rape is being investigated, with the suspect still at large.</p>
