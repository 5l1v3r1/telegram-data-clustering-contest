      <p>You’ve eaten. You’ve prayed. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2010/08/edelstein_on_eat_pray_love.html">You’ve loved</a>. Now you can see <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/elizabeth-gilberts-new-novel-city-of-girls-review.html"><i>City of Girls</i></a><i> </i>as a movie. The novel by author <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/elizabeth-gilbert-city-of-girls.html">Elizabeth Gilbert</a> has been optioned by producer Sue Kroll, and Emmy winner Michelle Ashford will adapt the script. The plot is a classic woman-becomes-herself setup, but make it old-timey in New York. “Set in 1940’s NYC, in the sparkling world of dazzling artistes, glamorous showgirls, and oversized theater personalities, <i>City of Girls</i> is an exploration of a young woman’s journey to discovering herself.” In addition to self-discovery there will be “love, sex,” and also “friendship.” Sounds like the essentials are covered!</p>
