      <h1>WhatsApp set to get two new Dark Modes that make the app much easier on the eyes</h1>
      <h2>The beta version of the WhatsApp app for iPhone includes a dark theme with two configurations, that make the app much easier to use in dark settings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:25:56+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>With its distinctive lime green and white design, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/whatsapp">WhatsApp </a>isn’t exactly easy on the eyes.</p>
      <p>But the popular messaging app is set to turn to the dark side, with a new report suggesting that it could soon launch two new Dark Modes.</p>
      <p>The report, by <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-develop-2-types-of-dark-theme-for-ios/">WABetaInfo</a>, points to evidence in the latest iPhone beta release, which contains a dark theme with two possible configurations.</p>
      <p>The first configuration features very dark colours with a black background, while the second features slightly lighter shades of grey.</p>
      <p>Both versions also show the text bubbles in dark hues.</p>

      <p>WABetaInfo explained: “It’s not clear yet if WhatsApp will allow us to choose the configuration that we prefer to use.</p>
      <p>“Actually it seems that WhatsApp will automatically choose the configuration, based on the device accessibility settings, but it’s still too soon to say seen that the feature is under development.”</p>
      <p>Sadly, it remains unclear when WhatsApp plans to roll out the new dark modes.</p>
      <p>However, the fact that they’re featured in the beta version of the app indicates that there’s not long to wait before it’s available for all users!</p>
      <p>WhatsApp is one of the few apps yet to include a Dark Mode option for users.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> finally launched its dark mode last month, which changes the background colour of the app window to black.</p>
      <p>Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, announced the update on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “Starting today, you can use Instagram in dark mode on iOS 13 or Android 10. Turn dark mode on your phone to try it out.”</p>
