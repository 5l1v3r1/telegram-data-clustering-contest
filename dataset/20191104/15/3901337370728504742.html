      <p>Orlando Pirates have received a new nickname from fans on social media, following the comments of their enigmatic coach, Rulani Mokwena.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs were famously dubbed ‘7de Laan’ by fans following their time spent lingering in 7<sup>th</sup> position on the Absa Premiership log.</p>
      <p>It is now the turn of the archrivals Orlando Pirates, following Rulani Mokwena’s post-match comments in Saturday’s Telkom Knockout quarter-final Soweto Derby.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, the 34-year-old described his side’s playing style in the most unique way.</p>
      <p>"There was a certain moments I was sitting on the bench and I looked at the pitch I thought I was Picasso looking at the Mona Lisa painting. I could just smile with admiration for these players," he said.</p>
      <p>Following his comments, fans quickly flooded Twitter, calling the Soweto giants, Mona Lisa FC.</p>
