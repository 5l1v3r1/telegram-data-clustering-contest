      <p>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Two collectors said you're the one that I want to Olivia Newton-John's iconic "Grease" leather jacket and skintight pants at an auction Saturday in Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>Julien's Auctions says the combined ensemble, which Newton-John's character Sandy wears in the closing number of the 1978 film, fetched US$405,700 total. The leather jacket sold for US$243,200 and the pants, which Newton-John famously had to be sewn into, went for US$162,500.</p>
      <p>Other "Grease" memorabilia included a Pink Ladies jacket that went for US$50,000 and a poster signed by Newton-John, John Travolta, director Randal Kleiser and producer and songwriter John Farrar, which sold for US$64,000.</p>
      <p>The proceeds from the jacket and pants, as well as a portion of the other items sold, will go the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre in Australia.</p>
