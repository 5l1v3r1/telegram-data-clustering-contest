      <p>The BISSELL EV675 robot vacuum is <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> today, as part of Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day, down to just $164.99. That's down from its regular price of $299. Making this a really great time to pick up a robot vacuum.</p>
      <p>BISSELL EV675 robot vacuum is a really great robot vacuum to pick up, especially if you don't want to sink in a ton of money into a robot vacuum. As it will do its job – cleaning up – without a whole lot of other bells and whistles. This one also comes from a company that has a lot of experience in making vacuums, so you know this one is going to be good with cleaning up.</p>
      <p>It has a triple-action system that is good for cleaning up messes and cleaning up pet hair, both of which are really nice features to have. It has multi-surface cleaning included, allowing you to use it on carpet, laminate and tile, without having to adjust the settings. The BISSELL EV675 robot vacuum is also a pretty slim robot vacuum, making it easier to go under furniture and chairs in your home. That is something that doesn't seem like a big deal, but it really is.</p>

      <p>Now, the BISSELL EV675 robot vacuum does not have an app for controlling it. Instead, you'll be using a physical remote. Which, while sounding like something from the 2000s, is not a bad thing. As you're paying a lot less for this one. Just make sure you don't lose the remote control. Additionally, the BISSELL EV675 robot vacuum is going to run for around 100 minutes on a charge, before it heads back to the dock to recharge.</p>
