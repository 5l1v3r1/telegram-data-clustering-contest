      <p>“I don’t know, to the best of my knowledge, a man named Michael Esposito,” Trump said about the lobbyist, admitting false or exaggerated lobbyist claims were part of being the president of the United States.</p>
      <p>“Many people say they know me, claiming to be ‘best friends’ and really close etc., when I don’t know these people at all,” Trump said. “This happens, I suppose, to all who become President.”</p>
      <p>Esposito landed millions in deals from Ukraine and Chinese tech giant Huawei, <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/k-streets-newest-star-built-business-on-dubious-claims-of-trump-ties/2019/11/01/f67de928-f5d9-11e9-829d-87b12c2f85dd_story.html%3foutputType=amp">according to the <i>Post</i></a>, claiming he had “an open line of communication to the President of the United States” and was close to Kushner and Eric Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump’s son Eric Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner also denied knowledge of Michael Esposito.</p>
      <p>“I have no recollection of a Michael Esposito,” Eric Trump told the <i>Washington Post.</i> “Sounds like someone trying to trade off our name.”</p>
      <p>“Jared Kushner does not know who Michael Esposito is,” a Trump administration official said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Other documents showed Esposito claimed to be a Democrat lobbyist and offered to help failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. He also <a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/48255">e-mailed</a> Clinton’s campaign chief John Podesta to offer assistance in Iowa, which was later posted on Wikileaks.</p>
      <p>Trump decimated Esposito’s lobbying boom with a pair of tweets.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like him using my name to build his consulting company, or whatever,” he wrote. “Please advise his clients and Administration officials accordingly.”</p>
