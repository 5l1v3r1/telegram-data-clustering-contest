      <h1>Taylor Swift Fans Had a Lot to Say About Kim Kardashian Listening to 'Lover'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Kim Kardashian posted an Instagram Story this weekend where Taylor Swift's "Lover" can be heard in the background. Taylor Swift fans noticed...and weren't exactly impressed with the song selection, given Kardashian's history with Swift and their public feud.</p>

      <p>They weren't buying it as any peace declaration. "Taste but we're not idiots," one fan wrote. "And they say Taylor is obsessed with Kanye," another mused. "We're not gonna fall for it," a third wrote, adding a clown emoji.</p>

      <p>Kardashian has claimed she has long been over the two's drama. She was done after she posted <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a37857/kim-kardashian-snapchat-taylor-swift-famous-kanye-west/">those July 2016 Snapchats </a>of Swift meant to hurt the singer's public image.</p>
      <p>They showed Swift and West discussing his song "Famous." They did not show Swift approving all the controversial lyrics about her, a point her rep made in a statement after the Snapchats were released. “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account,” Swift’s rep said in July 2016. “She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.’”</p>
      <p>In September 2016, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a39613/kim-kardashian-tired-of-talking-about-taylor-swift/">Kardashian publicly said</a> she was over the Swift drama. "Ugh, do we really have to talk about Taylor Swift? I'm so over it," she told <i>Billboard</i>. "It wasn't even about a look or anything, or to have this feud—it was like, 'Okay, here's the truth.' Done. Let's all move on. I feel like I don't want to talk about her anymore."</p>
      <p>In January 2019, Kardashian <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25901452/kim-khloe-kourtney-kardashian-taylor-swift-caitlyn-jenner-feud-status/">reiterated that point</a> to Andy Cohen when asked about the status of their feud. "Over it. No [I haven’t had any communication with Taylor], I feel like we’ve all moved on." She <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25949466/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-snapchat-feud-end/">posted a Snapchat of herself</a> listening to Swift's <i>Reputation </i>song "Delicate" days later.</p>
      <p>Swift made it pretty clear she's not exactly over the damage or ready to publicly declare peace with Kardashian.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28644379/taylor-swift-kim-kardashian-snapchat-effect-cancel-culture-interview/">She told </a><i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28644379/taylor-swift-kim-kardashian-snapchat-effect-cancel-culture-interview/">Vogue</a> </i>in August that being canceled changed her. “A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote <i>canceled</i>, is a very isolating experience,” she started. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly. When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, <i>Kill yourself.</i>”</p>
      <p>She added that while she grew from the experience, she will never thank Kimye for it. “It’s so strange trying to be self-aware when you’ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy ‘America’s sweetheart’ thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it’s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that’s extremely limiting," she mused. "We’re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we’re going to find positive aspects to it. We’re never going to write a thank-you note.”</p>
      <p>Swift later <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29102567/taylor-swift-kanye-west-phone-call-interview/">opened up to </a><i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29102567/taylor-swift-kanye-west-phone-call-interview/">Rolling Stone</a> </i>in September about that Kanye West phone call and their tenuous former friendship, sharing her side of the story.</p>
      <p>"When he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song [the line was 'me and Taylor might still have sex']," Swift said. "And I was like, 'okay, good. We’re back on good terms.' And then when I heard the song [with its 'I made that bitch famous' line], I was like, 'I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.'"</p>
