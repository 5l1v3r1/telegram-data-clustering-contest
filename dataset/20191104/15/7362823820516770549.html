      <h1>Houston Rockets fan accused of punching New Orleans Pelicans coach banned from NBA events: report</h1>

      <p>An NBA fan accused of punching a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> coach in the face late last month reportedly has been banned from all NBA, WNBA and G-League games, as well as 2K League events.</p>
      <p>Manuel Garcia, 38, was arrested last week after he allegedly punched Pelicans assistant coach Joe Boylan in the face after the Pelicans wrapped up a win against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a>. Garcia, a Rockets fan, appeared to strike Boylan from the sideline.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/1191143201006145536">The Athletic</a> reported Sunday that Garcia has been banned from all NBA-related events.</p>
      <p>Garcia was charged with misdemeanor assault and was out on bail working to secure a lawyer, according to <a href="https://abc13.com/sports/video-shows-rockets-fans-sucker-punch-of-pelicans-coach/5656649/">ABC13 Houston</a>. Even before the leaguewide ban, he was forbidden from attending Rockets games.</p>

      <p>Garcia's motive for allegedly punching Boylan was not immediately clear.</p>

      <p>“The Rockets won the game. Then one of the assistant coaches for the New Orleans Pelicans was gathering his things and was essentially cold-cocked or blindsided and struck in the face, brutally in my view,” Harris County District Attorney’s Office prosecutor Nathan Beedle said.</p>
      <p>Garcia was on probation for an unrelated crime at the time of the punch, Beedle said.</p>

      <p>“Clearly, we are going to take this extremely seriously,” Beedle said. “He is a convicted felon on probation right now charged with a Class A assault of a defenseless person in the case.”</p>
