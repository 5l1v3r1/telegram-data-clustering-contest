      <p>The Asian Development Bank on Monday said it will provide a $451 million (about Rs 3,200 crore) loan to strengthen power connectivity between the southern and northern parts of the Chennai-Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC) in Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>The total cost of the project is $653.5 million, of which the government will provide $202.5 million, the Manila-headquartered multilateral agency said in a release.</p>
      <p>The estimated completion date is the end of 2024.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adb">ADB </a>project will allow more power, including renewable energy, to be transferred from new generation facilities in the south CKIC to the north, where it is most in demand," said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adb">ADB </a>Principal Energy Specialist for South Asia Pradeep Perera.</p>
      <p>The project will help promote economic development by delivering a more reliable and competitive power supply for industry and services in the state, which will in turn spur jobs and improve livelihoods, it added.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/adb">ADB </a>has been assisting in developing CKIC, which covers 23 of the state's 32 districts and 70 per cent of the state population.</p>
      <p>According to the release, the project will establish an extra-high voltage 765-kilovolt (kV) transmission link to transfer the 9,000 MW of extra capacity from Virudhunagar in the southern CKIC northwards to Coimbatore, a major industrial center, and Chennai.</p>
      <p>The project includes construction of a 400-kV network to pool power generated at renewable and thermal power plants in Thoothukudi district to Virudhunagar.</p>
