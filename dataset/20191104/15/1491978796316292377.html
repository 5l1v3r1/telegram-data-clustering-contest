      <ul>
        <li>Safety threatened member of team’s radio network</li>
        <li>Incident followed another disappointing loss for Cleveland</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cleveland-browns">Cleveland Browns</a> have released safety Jermaine Whitehead after he directed a threatening, expletive-laced post at an analyst on the team’s radio network.</p>
      <p>Dustin Fox, a former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl">NFL</a> player who now works for Browns radio, called Whitehead’s tackling during the team’s loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday a “joke”. Whitehead was also the subject of criticism from fans on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Whitehead used a racial slur in response to Fox’s comments on Twitter. “I’m out there with a broke hand.. don’t get smoked fuck ass cracker,” he wrote. He also threatened another user on Twitter, writing: “Imma kill you bitch”. Whitehead’s account was suspended shortly afterwards but he continued to vent his anger on Instagram, threatening another user.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28005022/cleveland-browns-waive-jermaine-whitehead-threatening-posts">a Browns spokesperson told ESPN</a> that Whitehead’s comments were “totally unacceptable and highly inappropriate”. On Monday morning they waived him.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old was in his second season with the Browns. He previously played for the Green Bay Packers, who released him after he was ejected for slapping an opponent.</p>
      <p>The incident was another bump in a disappointing season for the Browns. They were widely tipped to contend in the AFC North after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cleveland_Browns_seasons">missing the playoffs for the previous 16 seasons</a>. Instead, the loss to the Broncos left the team with a 2-6 record and little hope of reaching the postseason.</p>
