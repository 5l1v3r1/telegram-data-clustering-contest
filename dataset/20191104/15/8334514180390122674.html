      <p>BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania’s centrist government of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban won parliament’s vote of confidence on Monday, unlocking the country’s European commissioner nominating process and ending a gridlock that risked to extend the bloc’s policymaking vacuum.</p>
      <p>“It passed with 240 votes of confidence,” an MP told reporters. Orban’s government, replacing the outgoing Socialist cabinet of Viorica Dancila, needed at least 233 votes to win the vote.</p>
      <p>The new European Commission team had been due to take over on Nov. 1, but a political tug-of-war in Bucharest prevented it from nominating a viable commissioner, that was seen pushing that missed deadline beyond the start of December.</p>
