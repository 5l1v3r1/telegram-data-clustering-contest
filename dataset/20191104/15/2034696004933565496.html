      <p>“I am looking forward to having the opportunity to meeting so many Only Fools fans,” Jason said. “It’s going to be cushty.”</p>
      <p>The actor last played Del Boy in 2014 for a <i>Sports Relief</i> special, with the original series running between 1981 and 1991. The show also returned for a number of Christmas specials up until 2003.</p>
      <p>The series also paved the way for a number of spin-offs, including <i>Rock &amp; Chips </i>and<i> The Green Green Grass</i>.</p>

      <p>While late creator John Sullivan’s son <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/fools-horses-make-comeback-2125017">teased a potential return for some of the show’s characters</a> in “different mediums” a few years ago, star Nicholas Lyndhurst ruled out a revival earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“We can’t,” he told the <a href="https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2019/0219/1031608-no-more-only-fools-and-horses-says-nicholas-lyndhurst/"><i>Press Association</i></a>. “John is no longer with us. John was the driving force of the show and we have also lost quite a few cast members now.</p>
      <p>“At the risk of depressing everyone, I think the last two times I’ve seen David [Jason] has been at funerals.”</p>
