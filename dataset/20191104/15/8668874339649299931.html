      <h1>Gallery: World Cup runners-up England make low-key return in London</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:09:23+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">By Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>England players made a low-key return from their World Cup campaign in Japan.</p>
      <p>The 31-strong squad arrived at Heathrow 18 minutes ahead of schedule on flight BA008 from Tokyo, two days after their 32-12 defeat by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in the final in Yokohama.</p>
      <p>There was no media access at the terminal and, although a few cheers rang out from waiting fans, there was no reaction from the players as they made their way into the arrivals hall.</p>

      <p>Coach Eddie Jones, whose future is up in the air, gave little away as he walked expressionless through the barriers.</p>

      <p>It was a far cry from 2003, when Clive Woodward’s triumphant <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> team brought London to a standstill as they paraded the Webb Ellis trophy on two open-top buses past an estimated 750,000 crowd in the centre of the capital.</p>
      <p>Plans for a similar victory parade were scrapped when Jones’ men lost to the Springboks in Saturday’s final.</p>
