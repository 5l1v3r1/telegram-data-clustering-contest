      <p><b>BRIDGEPORT, Conn.Â (AP)</b> - Environmental officials are announcing $2.6 million in grants for Long Island Sound conservation efforts.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that 20 grants totaling $1.4 million will benefit Connecticut while $250,000 will go to efforts in Massachusetts and Vermont and the remaining funds will be spent in New York.</p>
      <p>The money benefits local projects meant to improve water quality and restore habitat around the Long Island Sound watershed.</p>
      <p>In Connecticut, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal says the matching funds will help communities install trash skimmers, restore salt marshes, spur growth of fish and bird populations and support environmental education efforts.</p>
      <p>The EPA says the projects will treat 8.2 million gallons of stormwater, collect 46,000 pounds of floating trash and prevent 17,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the vital estuary.</p>
