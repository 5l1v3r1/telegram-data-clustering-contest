      <p>Milwaukee police report an arrest in an <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/milwaukee-police-looking-for-suspect-in-alleged-acid-attack-1/1138407315">acid attack</a> that sent a 42-year-old man to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Police say they arrested a 61-year-old man Saturday in connection with an "aggravated battery" near the same south side location where the victim says he was attacked Friday.</p>
      <p>The victim, Mahud Villalaz, says a man at a bus stop began berating him and then threw acid onto his face from a metal bottle. Villalaz suffered second-degree burns to his face and was treated at a hospital.</p>
      <p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports Villalaz's family released a statement thanking police for an arrest in the case.</p>
      <p>Police say charges will be brought to the Milwaukee County district attorney's office in the next couple of days.</p>
