      <p>Betty A. Nowakowski, 85, of Fort Atkinson, passed away Saturday, November 2, 2019 at home surrounded by her family.</p>

      <p>Betty loved staying busy with friends and family.  Her house was located in the center of town where family members would always be dropping in to visit, enjoy a snack, play a game, or help with her on-going puzzles.  Every fall she would host a large family weekend in the Wisconsin Dells.  She loved going to casinos and playing card games with close friends.  She especially loved baking special treats for her family, then making her rounds delivering them to their homes.</p>

      <p>She was also preceded in death by her siblings, Ida, Robert, Tom, Mary Jane, Raymond, Oscar, Joe, Norbert and Clara.</p>
      <p>The family would like to thank Rainbow Hospice Care for making her comfortable during her last several days of life.</p>
