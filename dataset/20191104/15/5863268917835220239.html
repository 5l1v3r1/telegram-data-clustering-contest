      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Prime Minister Imran Khan and Dr Babar Awan deliberated on country’s political situation including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal’s Azadi March and other legal and constitutional affairs in a meeting, Dunya News reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan affirmed that state comes before politics and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led federal government will not let the state become weak as law will be implemented over all. The premier vowed to strengthen the institutions for Pakistan’s stability.</p>
      <p>Expressing views on Kartarpur Corridor, the PM stressed that the opening of this passage will be the best depiction of inter-faith harmony and Pakistan is ready to welcome Sikh community from around the globe.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan maintained that the government’s efforts to stabilize economy are bearing fruits as the current account deficit has reduced by 32 percent.</p>
      <p>Babar Awan said JUI-F Chief Fazal-ur-Rehman’s sit-in is against the judicial decisions because the court had only allowed to carry out a march, not to stage sit-in. Fazal-ur-Rehman’s Azadi March has pushed the Kashmir cause behind, he added.</p>
      <p>The PTI leader congratulated PM Imran Khan on timely completion of Kartarpur Corridor. Record increase in remittances is due to the trust of overseas Pakistanis in this government, he concluded. </p>
