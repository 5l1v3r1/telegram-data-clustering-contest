      <p>Netizens are speculating whether <b>Big Bang </b>will make a comeback as a group.<br/><br/>YG Entertainment released a statement on the 4th confirming that Big Bang members <b>Taeyang </b>and <b>Daesung </b>will be discharged from the military on the 10th following <b>G Dragon</b>'s discharge on October 26th. GD recently began promotions with a brand pictorial after his release and had previously stated at his discharge ceremony that <i>"he will be going back to his main job as a singer."</i><br/><br/>The group has been under controversy this year due to '<b>Burning Sun Gate</b>' that led to member <b>Seungri </b>not only leaving the group but also ending his contract with <b>YG Entertainment</b>. Seungri and <b>Yang Hyun Suk</b> have also been under controversy for illegal gambling activities abroad and alleged prostitution that led to Yang Hyun Suk stepping down as the executive producer. <b>T.O.P</b> who also recently completed his military duties, was indicted for smoking marijuana in June 2017 and had to delay his military enlistment.<br/><br/>Many are curious whether the members will comeback with solo promotions as well as a group comeback as "four" following Seungri's departure.</p>
