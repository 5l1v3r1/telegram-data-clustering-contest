      <h1>Milwaukee man arrested for allegedly throwing acid at 'illegal' US citizen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:15:08+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/international" target="_blank">Amanda Holpuch in New York</a></address>
      <p>Milwaukee police have arrested a suspect who allegedly threw acid at a US citizen after telling him to “go back to [his] country”.</p>
      <p>Mahud Villalaz suffered second-degree burns to his face after a man threw acid from a container in front of a restaurant on Friday night, in a predominantly Latino part of Milwaukee.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-suspect-allegedly-throws-battery-acid-on-man-in-racial-attack/29673827">Surveillance video</a> showed a hooded man pointing at Villalaz, who was raised in Peru, before throwing the liquid. Villalaz stumbled away from the man, who police said is white.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside the hospital where he was treated, Villalaz <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/milwaukee-suspect-allegedly-throws-battery-acid-on-man-in-racial-attack/29673827">told local news channel WISN 12</a> the incident began as a parking dispute and escalated when the other man accused him of being “illegal” and asked him why he had “invaded” the US. The man then tossed the acid.</p>
      <p>“The feeling was burning, and I was trying to defend myself but I couldn’t because I couldn’t open my eyes,” Villalaz said.</p>
      <p>The president of local advocacy group Forward Latino, Darryl Morin, <a href="http://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/articles/heinous-acid-attack-against-milwaukee-man-being-investigated-as-racially-motivated-hate-crime/">told the Milwaukee Independent</a> police were investigating the attack as a hate crime.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see how it could be anything else, as this is sadly and tragically a textbook case of hate,” Morin said. “I dare say it was premeditated, because no one walks around with a bottle of acid and hangs out in a predominantly Latino neighborhood for no reason.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-my-brother-mahud-victim-of-another-hate-crime?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_lico+share-sheet">More than $16,000 had been raised</a> to help support Villalaz and his family as of Monday morning. In a post on the crowdfunding site GoFundMe, his sister said Villalaz would be unable to do his job as a welder until his burns healed and that he will need follow-up care for damage to his eyesight.</p>
      <p>“We see acts of hate like this happening everywhere,” his sister, Priscilla Villalaz, wrote. “The only thing we can ask ourselves is why do they hate us so much?”</p>
      <p>In late 2018, the FBI released data which showed hate crimes in the US rose by 17% in 2017, the third straight annual increase. Many incidents go unreported and not all regions supply hate crime data to the federal agency.</p>
      <p>Some experts have said there is <a href="https://apnews.com/7d0949974b1648a2bb592cab1f85aa16">a link between political rhetoric and hate crimes</a>. The comments Villalaz said his attacker made paralleled rhetoric from Donald Trump, who regularly disparages immigrants and downplays <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-shooting-white-nationalist-supremacy-violence-christchurch">the destructive impact of white nationalism</a>.</p>
      <p>In July, the president was widely condemned after telling a group of four congresswomen, all US citizens, to “go back” to the countries they came from. Three were born in the US.</p>
      <p>Since May 2018, Trump’s re-election campaign has run 2,200 ads which mention the word “invasion” while referring to immigrants at the southern border, <a href="https://apnews.com/7d0949974b1648a2bb592cab1f85aa16">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee alderman Jose Perez also said the incident was being investigated as a hate crime, and urged people in the city and the US to be more respectful to each other.</p>
      <p>“We need those elected officials who are spreading racial hatred to knock off the rhetoric that is designed to divide us,” Perez said in a statement. “Instead, we need to work to heal the wounds that have been gashed open in the last few years. We as a country are better than this.”</p>
