      <p>British audio company Naim Audio <a href="https://naimaudionewsroom.com/2019/11/04/apple-airplay-2-and-siri-support-coming-to-naims-high-end-network-streamers/">today announced plans</a> to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airplay/">AirPlay</a> 2 support to its high-end network streamers through a free update that will be coming in the future. <br/><br/>The update will bring ‌AirPlay‌ 2 to the ND 555 ($24,698), NDX 2 ($5,999), and the ND5 XS 2 ($2,700). Naim has previously updated its Mu-so and Uniti ranges with ‌AirPlay‌ 2 support, so with the upcoming software, Naim's entire family of music streaming products will support ‌AirPlay‌ 2.</p>

      <p>‌AirPlay‌ 2 is designed to allow iPhones, iPads, Macs, and more to stream audio to multiple ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled speakers throughout the home at one time for a whole home audio experience. <br/><br/>There's no word on when Naim plans to provide the new firmware, but once it is available, the Naim app will prompt customers to perform an over-the-air update to get the ‌AirPlay‌ 2 functionality. <br/><br/>There are a number of ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled speakers on the market now, including those from Bose, Libratone, Sonos, and more, along with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>. Apple maintains a list of all third-party ‌AirPlay‌ 2 speakers <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/home/accessories/#section-speaker">on its website</a>.</p>
