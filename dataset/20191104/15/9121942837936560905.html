      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The New York attorney general has filed a lawsuit to stop the Trump administration from scrapping a rule to make light bulbs more energy efficient.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Letitia James called the rollback a “not-so-bright idea” that “would unlawfully delay the adoption of energy efficiency goals, undermine state and local energy policy, and increase consumer and environmental costs.”</p>
      <p>The Energy Department’s move, announced in September, reversed a yearslong push to switch Americans to bulbs that use less electricity.</p>
      <p>White House officials called the upgrades too costly for consumers and President Donald Trump told reporters the expected saving from the more efficient bulbs was “not worth it.”</p>
      <p>James and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra filed the lawsuit Monday. Joining them were 16 attorneys general and New York City.</p>
