        <b>I've tested a lot of power banks, but none come close to the power, performance, and all-round robustness of the Zendure SuperTank.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As we take more and more devices with us, the need for a power bank that can keep them charged up and ready to go all day long is more important than ever. What you need is a SuperTank!<br/><br/><b>Must read</b>: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/four-must-have-travel-essentials/">Four must-have travel essentials</a><br/><br/>The <a href="https://zendure.com/collections/portable-chargers/products/supertank-black">Zendure SuperTank</a> is an absolute beast. It measures 4.7- by 2.9- by 1.6-inches and weighs in at a hefty 17.6 ounces. This is not a power bank that you're going to be able to slip into a pocket, but since this thing is perfectly capable of powering a 15-inch MacBook Pro, you don't expect ultra-portability. If that's what you want, there are plenty of power banks out there that fit the bill (such as the <a href="https://zendure.com/products/supermini">Zendure SuperMini</a>).</p>
      <p>But if you want sheer power and versatility, the SuperTank offers it.<br/><br/>The SuperTank has a rated capacity of 27,000mAh, or 99.9Wh, which means that it's the biggest that you can take onto an airplane. It features a single button switch, an LCD display, two USB ports, and two USB-C ports.</p>
      <h3>Zendure SuperTank Tech Specs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Capacity</b>: 27,000mAh/99.9Wh</li>
        <li><b>Size</b>: 4.7" x 2.9" x 1.6" (119mm x 73mm x 42mm)</li>
        <li><b>Weight</b>: 17.6oz (500g)</li>
        <li><b>Input</b>: USB-C 5-20V, up to 5A, 100W</li>
        <li><b>Output</b>:<br/>- USB-C(1) - 5-20V, up to 5A, 100W<br/>- USB-C(2) - 5-20V, up to 3A, 60W<br/>- USB-1 - 5V/3A, 9V/2A, 12V/1.5A, 18W (ZEN+2.0)<br/>- USB-2 - 5V/3A, 15W (ZEN+)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As I've already said, the SuperTank is a beast. And the more I use it, the more I'm impressed.<br/><br/>It can fully charge a MacBook Pro in 90 minutes, and can double your battery life. If you have a smartphone such as the iPhone XS, then you can recharge that from the SuperTank a whopping seven times.</p>
      <p>Another handy feature of the SuperTank is its ability to recharge low-power devices that draw so little power that many power banks will ignore the load and switch off.<br/><br/>Another sweet feature of the SuperTank is the bidirectional USB-C port. This allows you to connect it to a laptop that's charging so the SuperTank can itself be charged up, but a long press of the power button will put the Zendure into service charging up the laptop. This makes recharging the SuperBank easy and expedient.<br/><br/>The SuperTank is also exceptionally robust. The stout durable composite shell (polycarbonate + ABS) gives it the ability to take whatever life -- or I -- can throw at it, and the high-gloss piano finish retains its good looks for a long time.<br/><br/>Another nice touch is that the ports are clearly labelled, which is a simple feature that can be sorely lacking on some power banks.<br/><br/>The SuperTank comes with a 1-meter USB-C-to-USB-C cable, some instructions, and a few fun stickers. No case, which is no hardship for me since these usually end up not being used (at least not for the intended purpose).<br/><br/>The Zendure SuperTank isn't cheap, priced at $191 from Zendure (although you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zendure-SuperTank-Portable-Charger-MacBook/dp/B07P7P2L75/?tag=zdnet-deals-20">pick it up at a better price from Amazon</a>), but it's the best power bank that I have yet tested. The capacity is exactly as stated, the build quality is superb, and it does exactly what it says it will do. The dual-USB-C ports on it make is useful as a charging hub for multiple devices, so it can do away with the need for multiple chargers.<br/><br/><b>See also:</b></p>
