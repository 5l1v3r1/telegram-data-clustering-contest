      <h1>Buttigieg Targets Warren Amid Polling Surge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T15:19:42+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/" target="_blank">Zachary Evans</a></address>
      <p>South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg targeted Senator Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) on Monday as he surges in polls of Democratic primary voters.</p>
      <p>“I’m really concerned about what we’re hearing from Senator Warren and some of the others saying that you’re either for her way or you’re for business as usual,” Buttigieg <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnBerman/status/1191348007725391873">said</a> on CNN. “What I’m putting forward on healthcare…gets the job done for a lot less money, and respects the wishes of the American people who want to have a choice” of healthcare providers, the mayor continued. Warren released her universal medicare plan on Friday with a price tag of $21 trillion in additional spending.</p>
      <p>A <i>Washington Post</i>-ABC News poll <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-warren-and-buttigieg-rise-the-democratic-presidential-race-is-competitive-and-fluid-a-washington-post-abc-news-poll-finds/2019/11/02/4b7aca3c-fccd-11e9-8906-ab6b60de9124_story.html">released</a> on Sunday put Buttigieg in fourth place among Democratic primary voters nationally. A poll <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/biden-falls-to-fourth-place-in-latest-iowa-poll/">released</a> Friday recorded Buttigieg in third place among prospective Iowa caucus voters, ahead of national front-runner Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>In an interview that aired Friday Buttigieg framed Warren as the candidate to defeat in the Democratic presidential race.</p>
      <p>“I think this is getting to be a two-way” race, Buttigieg said on Showtime’s <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4yTBqsSQhs">The Circus</a>.</i></p>
      <p>“You see that coming into focus…you and Warren?” interviewer John Heilemann asks.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, and certainly a world where we’re getting somewhere is that world,” Buttigieg responded.</p>
      <p>However, Buttigieg attempted to walk back those comments on Saturday, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/468812-buttigieg-says-he-didnt-mean-to-predict-a-two-way-race-with-warren">telling</a> reporters in Iowa that “the bottom line is this is a really strong competition among really strong campaigns.”</p>
      <p>When asked to comment on his predictions of a two-way race between himself and Warren during the CNN interview Monday, the Indiana mayor refused to discuss the other Democratic presidential campaigns.</p>
