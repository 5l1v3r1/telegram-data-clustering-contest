      <p>Paul Heckingbottom has been sacked by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> after a dismal run of form which has seen them win just one Premiership game this season.</p>
      <p>The former Barnsley and Leeds United boss as appointed as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's successor earlier this year, and initially had a run of good results.</p>
      <p>Things have turned sour this season though, with just one Premiership win all season which came on the opening day against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> .</p>
      <p>Since then there has been a 6-1 defeat to Rangers, a loss in the Edinburgh derby to Hearts and, finally, a 5-2 thrashing by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in the Betfred Cup semi-final.</p>
