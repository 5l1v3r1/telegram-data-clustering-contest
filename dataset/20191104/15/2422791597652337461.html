      <p>ATHENS, Greece -- Greece's Culture Ministry says three shipwrecks from ancient and mediaeval times and large sections of their cargoes have been discovered off the small Aegean island of Kasos.</p>
      <p>A statement Monday said an underwater survey that ended last month also located cannons and other scattered finds -- possibly from other foundered vessels that have not yet been pinpointed.</p>
      <p>The oldest of the wrecks found was a 2,300-year-old trader. Its surviving cargo included amphorae -- large jars used to transport wine, oil or foodstuffs -- and fine tableware. Archaeologists also located five stone anchors in the wreck.</p>
      <p>The two other ships dated to the 1st century B.C. and the 8th-10th century A.D.</p>
      <p>Kasos lies between Crete and Rhodes on what remains a key trade route linking the Aegean with the Middle East.</p>
