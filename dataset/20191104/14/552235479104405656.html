      <p>All drugs for personal use should be decriminalised in Scotland, a major new report has recommended.</p>
      <p>The proposals come after a record number of drug deaths in Scotland last year – including 50 in Renfrewshire.</p>

      <p>A cross-party committee of MPs today released the Problem Drug Use in Scotland paper, which suggests a new approach to drug policy, including decriminalisation and the introduction of safe consumption spaces.</p>
      <p>Renfrewshire was rocked in 2018 by its highest number of drug-related deaths in more than a decade last year, with 50 people losing their lives.</p>

      <p>Scotland reached an all-time high of 1,187 deaths last year, prompting a major review by the Scottish Affairs Committee of the country’s approach to tackling the problem.</p>
      <p>The death of 50 people in Renfrewshire – a rise from 38 in 2017 – was described as a “waste of life” and a “tragedy” by councillors.</p>

      <p>The number of drug-related deaths in the local authority was as low as 13 in 2013.</p>
      <p>However, the total rose to 30 in 2014 and, while it dropped to 19 in 2015, the figure spiked again to 42 in 2016.</p>
      <p>In 2018, 36 drug deaths in Renfrewshire were men and 14 were women.</p>
      <p>Drugs commonly found in the systems of those who had died included heroin, other opioids and etizolam.</p>
      <p>The chair of the committee, Pete Wishart MP, said “Throughout our inquiry, we heard tragic accounts of the pain and suffering that problem drug use is causing in Scotland.</p>

      <p>“If this number of people were being killed by any other illness, the government would declare it as a public health issue and act accordingly.</p>

      <p>“The evidence is clear – the criminal justice approach does not work.</p>
      <p>“Decriminalisation is a pragmatic solution to problem drug use; reducing stigma around drug use and addiction, and encouraging people to seek treatment.</p>
      <p>“We’re not the only ones calling for this change.</p>

      <p>“The Health and Social Care have also said the government should consider decriminalisation.</p>
      <p>“It reflects the weight of evidence in support of this approach, and I hope the next government takes this recommendation seriously.”</p>
      <p>The report also criticised the Scottish Government’s decision to cut funding for Alcohol and Drug Partnerships in 2016/17 and called for a public health approach to drug policy going forward.</p>
