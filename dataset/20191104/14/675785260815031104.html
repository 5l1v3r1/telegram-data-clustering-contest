      <h1>Ex-Liverpool star slams Philippe Coutinho for being "invisible" and "not improving"</h1>
      <h2>Philippe Coutinho's stock has fallen at an alarming rate since he left Liverpool for Barcelona</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:15:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Philippe Coutinho was "invisible" in Bayern Munich's 5-1 defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt and hasn't improved since signing on loan for the Germans.</p>
      <p>That's according to former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Bayern Munich midfielder Dietmar Hamann, who even accused Coutinho of being "frightened" when he loses the ball.</p>
      <p>Coutinho left Liverpool for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in a Â£142million deal in January 2018, but failed to cement a place in the first team and rapidly fell down the pecking order at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>He was shipped out on loan to Bayern Munich in the summer and it was hoped he would turn things around in Germany.</p>

      <p>But a number of Coutinho's performances have been slammed in recent weeks, with Hamann the latest to hit out at the Brazilian, labelling him "invisible".</p>
      <p>Hamann added, as reported by <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/bundesliga/hamann-says-coutinho-was-invisible-during-bayern-defeat-7713543">AS:</a> "He's on loan for a year, played some games with Bayern and for me you can't seen an improvement in his performance.</p>
      <p>"What annoys me is when you see this player is not prudent. If he loses a ball he can be frightened and anxious during the 90 minutes."</p>

      <p>Bayern's 5-1 defeat on the weekend cost Niko Kovac his job.</p>
      <p>The German giants are now looking at Ajax manager Erik ten Hag as a possible replacement, while Jose Mourinho is also in the mix.</p>
