      <p>A student has been ordered to pay "thousands" of pounds in legal fees after trying to sue his university over his degree grade.</p>
      <p>Umer Riza,33,  says he will take his legal battle to the highest court in the UK after receiving a 'pass' grade in his degree three years ago.</p>
      <p>He has tried to seek £200,000 in damages from the University of South Wales over his 2016 grade.</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz, who received the equivalent of a third class degree, said: "I'm going to fight this even if I have to take it higher, even to the UN, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/education/student-paid-thousands-pounds-trying-17188188">Wales Online</a>. </p>
      <p>The student, who came to Cardiff to study from Islamabad, Pakistan, claims he was not given the opportunity to continue his studies to complete an honours degree instead of a pass grade.</p>

      <p>But his claim was struck out of county court in Cardiff on Thursday after being described by the university as having "no prospect of success".</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz added: "I'm very, very keen that I take it as high as I can."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the University of South Wales said all processes were followed "fairly and accurately".</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz started his BSc hons chemistry degree in 2011 but re-sat his first year after failing to get the credits needed.</p>
      <p>In 2014, after suffering from poor health, the student said he "suffered a fall" on site, causing his second year modules to be deferred until the next year.</p>
      <p>As a result, Mr Riaz did not cover enough credits for an honours degree, and reached the maximum registration period for his course.</p>

      <p>In a claim brought against the university, the international student described its decision not to allow him to take outstanding modules as "unreasonable".</p>
      <p>But the university said Mr Riaz's claim failed to particularise "any cause of action" and that arguments of "unreasonableness" did not fall under the court's jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz, who represented himself, said: "I was quite good at my studies and I passed my English courses back home.</p>
      <p>"I was the youngest and my family wanted to give me the opportunity for higher study. My parents are illiterate, they didn't go to school."</p>
      <p>He added: "A pass doesn't mean anything to me. Having a pass degree is not going to help me to get anything.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to do a PhD in organic chemistry. I was in my final year starting to apply for jobs in Europe, in the Middle East and do further studies.</p>
      <p>"I had a couple of emails from Italy and Germany. They said were were impressed by my approach but unfortunately I do not have enough credits.</p>

      <p>"If I had an honours degree I would have been smashing it. I would have been working in decent places like my other colleagues."</p>
      <p>After launching an unsuccessful internal complaint to the university, Mr Riaz took his fight to the Office of Independent Adjudicator (OIA) - an independent review body.</p>
      <p>In 2018, he was told his complaint was dismissed.</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz also sought a judicial review of the OIA's decision, which was unsuccessful, and has now launched an appeal with the Court of Appeals.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have wasted 10 months to get to this stage. Everyone knew what I was claiming. They should have said in the first place [there was no jurisdiction]."</p>
      <p>"I'm going to take it to the High Court now."</p>
      <p>As an international student, Mr Riaz said each year of university cost him about £10,000.</p>
      <p>But he said his grade has also stopped him from getting a job in his chosen field since his graduation.</p>
      <p>Mr Riaz, who must pay thousands in legal fees after his court claim failed, said: "It's been very stressful. I went through trauma, I went through illness.</p>
      <p>"My mum cries a lot, she cries too much. Back home when you go to court you have police around you so she is worried about me. I talk to her every day and tell her I'm fine.</p>
      <p>"My brother is supporting me with accommodation and food."</p>
      <p>He added: "Before I didn't know what the word 'sue' meant. I'm on medication, I'm stressed.</p>
      <p>"I went step by step with every internal process and every external process with the High Court and Court of Appeals.</p>
      <p>"Step by step I've come to this point.</p>
      <p>"This happens for a reason so you better build yourself up and put your chin up for the next event.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to have any regrets a couple of years down the line."</p>
      <p>Ahead of Thursday's hearing, a skeleton argument by Ben Mitchell, for the University of South Wales, said: "The claimant has not particularised any cause of action.</p>
      <p>"The [Particulars of Claim (PoC)] consists of a long narrative, followed by an extract of passages from the claimant's unsuccessful application for judicial review against the Office of the Independent Adjudicator.</p>
      <p>"At no point in the PoC does the claimant identify a cause of action. His claim should be struck out as a result."</p>
      <p>It added: "As an administrative law ground, the court has no jurisdiction over the allegation of unreasonableness.</p>
      <p>"This is simply an attempt by the claimant to re-litigate his previously unsuccessful judicial review claim against the OIA."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the University of South Wales said: "We take all complaints seriously and are keen to uphold our rigorous standards.</p>
      <p>"All of our processes have been followed fairly and accurately, and this has been reflected by the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education.</p>
      <p>"As there may be further legal action, it is not possible to comment further."</p>
