      <p>The managing director and chief executive officers of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/credit-rating-agencies">credit rating agencies </a>shall not be members of their rating committee, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>on Monday said while putting in place norms for enhanced governance and accountability of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/credit-rating-agencies">credit rating agencies.</a></p>
      <p>Rating committees of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/credit-rating-agencies">credit rating agencies </a>(CRA) shall report to a chief ratings officer, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>said in a circular.</p>
      <p>Regarding composition of board of directors of a CRA, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>said one-third of the board shall comprise independent directors if it is chaired by a non-executive director.</p>
      <p>In case the board is chaired by an executive director, half of the board shall comprise independent directors.</p>

      <p>The chief ratings officer has been asked to directly report to the ratings sub-committee of the board of the CRA.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Sebi has asked the CRAs to meet the audit committee of the rated entity at least once in a year to discuss issues including related-party transactions, internal financial control and other material disclosures made by the management which have a bearing on rating of the listed non-convertible debentures.</p>
