      <p>ONTARIO, CANADA -- A boat that has been stuck on some rocks atop Niagara Falls for more than 100 years has finally shifted.</p>
      <p>Heavy wind and rain from a strong storm on Halloween shifted the boat, according to Niagara Parks Commission senior manager of heritage Jim Hill.</p>
      <p>The boat was flipped on its side, spun around and moved more than 150 feet down the river.</p>
      <p>Experts said they aren't sure at this time if the flow of the river will continue to move the boat closer to, and eventually over, the falls.</p>
      <p>"It could be stuck there for days or it could be stuck there for years," Hill said. "It's anyone's guess."</p>
      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/severe-weather-shifts-boat-stuck-niagara-falls-rocks/story?id=66723018">According to ABC News</a>, the boat is an Iron Scow--a flat-bottomed ship used to carry cargo in shallow water during the 19th and 20th centuries. The scow got stuck August 1918 when it broke loose from a towing tug.</p>
