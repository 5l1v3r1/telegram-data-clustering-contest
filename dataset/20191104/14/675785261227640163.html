      <h1>'Prison cell' flat for rent at £1,100 a month in London knife crime hotspot</h1>
      <h2>Viewers of the property in Hackney, east London, have joked that the property looks more like a prison cell than a home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:26:55+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author">John Glover, Lorraine King</a></address>
      <p>A studio flat in a knife crime hotspot in east London which is up for rent at £1,100 a month has been compared to prison cell.</p>
      <p>The grim-looking main room includes a small double bed, miniature cooker hobs on the floor - and you get a scratched wooden table thrown in.</p>
      <p>Some viewers of the property in Hackney have joked it looks more like a place where you would do time rather than have a good time, an impression reinforced by a picture showing bars on the windows.</p>
      <p>Sellers Prime Estate Agents insist the "nice studio" is a good location near to an Underground station.</p>
      <p>But Hackney has the sixth-worst record of knife crime in the capital with 21,900 knife-related incidents last year.</p>

      <p>After the property was featured on Reddit, Roco637 responded: "Here in America, we call that a prison cell. No rent involved, just a 20-30 year lease."</p>
      <p>FlusteredPigeon wrote: "'For £1,100 you too can simulate living in a prison cell'."</p>
      <p>GuidingKnightThe2nd said: "Ah yes. I'd love to buy my own prison cell."</p>
      <p>Comox, referring to the cooker hob on the floor, joked: "Fisher-Price My First Hotplate."</p>

      <p>The studio is described as suitable for professional, couples or single people and is available for rent from mid-November at £1,096.</p>
      <p>For the same money you could rent a two-bedroom flat in Birmingham city centre with a private balcony, allocated secure parking, 24-hour concierge and a communal gym. </p>
      <p>A three-bedroom semi-detached house with a private front and park garden plus a garage is on offer for £1,100 in Horsforth, Leeds.</p>
      <p>Prime Estate Agents describe the property in Hackney saying: "A nice studio. Property benefits from a large double room with a kitchenette, nice shower and toilet. Fantastic location, just minutes away from local station.</p>
      <p>"The property is in great proximity to many fantastic bars and restaurants due to its location, many supermarkets, hospitals, schools etc make this a great place to live."</p>
