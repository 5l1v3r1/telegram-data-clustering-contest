      <p>NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. -- Parks officials are monitoring a century-old grounded barge that briefly broke loose during a storm last week in the river just above Niagara Falls.</p>
      <p>WGRZ says the <a href="https://www.niagaraparks.com/events/event/centenary-of-the-iron-scow-rescue/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=2019-heritage&amp;utm_content=novemmber-1-video">rusty iron scow had been stuck since 1918</a> on rocks in the upper rapids above the Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side.</p>
      <p>High winds and rain last Thursday dislodged it before it got stuck again.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post says it was originally about a third of a mile (0.5 km) from the brink of Horseshoe Falls. Then it moved about 164 feet (50 metres) downstream and became lodged again.</p>
      <p>A Niagara Parks official said it could be stuck in its new location for days or years.</p>
