      <p>A consortium led by a boutique life sciences investment bank is in talks to acquire £500m of healthcare assets bought by former star fund manager Neil Woodford.</p>
      <p>A WG partners-led consortium is the frontrunner to buy the stakes in roughly 15 companies held by Woodford Investment Management, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>The potential deal follows Woodford’s announcement that he was shutting his firm.</p>

      <p>Other bidders for the stakes in listed and privately held healthcare firms include hedge fund Omega and venture fund Rosetta Capital, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The portfolio is valued in the region of £500m.</p>
      <p>It includes DNA sequencing specialist Oxford Nanopore, biotherapeutics specialist 4D Pharma, rare diseases specialist Mereo BioPharma Group and proton beam therapy business Proton Partners.</p>
      <p>The sizes of stakes vary and the deal could take several weeks, Sky reported.</p>

      <p>Investment bank PJT Park Hill Partners is overseeing the sale which also includes stakes in Immunocore, Kymab, Verseon and Arix Bioscience.</p>
      <p>Woodford Investment Management was shuttered last month after Woodford was fired from his flagship Equity Income Fund, which had been suspended since June, and quit as manager of two others.</p>
      <p>WG declined to comment.</p>
