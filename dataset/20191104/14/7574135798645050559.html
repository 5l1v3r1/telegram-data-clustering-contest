      <p><b>Kacey Musgraves</b> is joining the likes of Dolly Parton, John Denver, Loretta Lynn and Johnny Cash, in the country music tradition of having her own Christmas special. <i>The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</i> will debut on Amazon Prime on November 29 (the day after Thanksgiving) and it features a very Kacey Musgraves group of guests: <b>Lana Del Rey, Dan Levy</b> (<i>Schitt’s Creek</i>, who also directs the special), <b>Kendall Jenner</b>, <b>Zooey Deschanel, Fred Armisen, Leon Bridges, Troye Sivan, James Corden, Camila Cabello</b>, and the Radio City Rockettes. Says Kacey:</p>
      <blockquote>What started as the small seed of an idea one night over a year ago has turned into something I’m so proud of. Some truly brilliant comedic and musical guests are featured in the show — as well as my own Grandma. My vision was to bring my old Christmas album to life visually and create a modern and fashionable, fresh take on a classic format. It’s a nostalgic, Wes Anderson-inspired reimagining of the holidays. It’s heartfelt, funny, and most of all, real. I can’t wait to finally share.</blockquote>
      <p>You can watch the campy, fun trailer for the special below. There will be an official soundtrack released for<i> The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</i> on 11/29 as well.</p>
