      <p>Every good thing starts with a desire or eagerness to do something. The same goes for your success stories. The more you keep pushing yourself to be knowledgeable, the clearer the way to success becomes.</p>
      <p>Curiosity not only helps you in excelling at the professional front, but a study found that curiosity also improves memory and learning.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/854928/eager-to-learn#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The study revealed that curiosity releases a chemical linked with motivation, dopamine. Dopamine could motivate you more than any words ever could!</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, without a genuine interest or curiosity to learn, you cannot expect yourself to be naturally inclined to learn new things. Eagerness to learn is where your success starts. Let’s not forget that Newton discovered gravity when he was curious as to why the apple fell on the ground rather than going upwards. Similarly, Alexander Fleming discovered Penicillin as he was curious to have a better germs killer. And the list is endless.</p>
      <p>So, how to be more eager to learn and grow into a more successful person?</p>

You can also continue taking informational interviews and job shadows to keep your curiosity burning. Keep asking more questions and show that you are enthusiastic to learn.</p>
      <p>Also, reflect your curiosity towards learning by attending seminars, getting certifications, and enrolling yourself in online courses.</p>
      <h3>2. Stay Updated</h3>
      <p>Be it technical or general news, try to be updated on the current scenarios. Stay on top of the news as it can be fodder for all your conversations and could play a vital role in widening your network.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye on the latest trends in your field of work. You never know when something new pops up and becomes the next big thing.</p>
      <h3>3. Don’t Stop Developing Your Skills</h3>
      <p>Make it your goal to update your resume with new skills now and then. If there is anything that can never be taken away from you, it’s your acquired skills and knowledge. With job requirements changing every day, don’t let yourself fall behind and keep learning to keep giving your best.</p>
      <h3>4. Look for Challenges</h3>
      <p>The best way to learn something new is to start doing something new. Don’t put off your personal or professional projects when you can do them now.</p>

        <li>Someone younger but is on the same road as you are.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having the above three kinds of people in your circle is not to compare yourself but to have open-minded individuals who can share their knowledge and experiences you need to keep pursuing your goals.</p>
