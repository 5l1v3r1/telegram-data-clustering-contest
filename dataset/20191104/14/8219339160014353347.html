      <h1>iPhone Twitter users frustrated by buggy auto-refresh behavior in latest app update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:12:08+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>Thousands of Twitter users aired their frustration over the weekend thanks to a new update to the official Twitter for iPhone app… and specifically its new tendency to auto-refresh the timeline randomly.</p>
      <p>Whilst auto-refresh would be a good feature in theory, the current implementation causes the refresh to happen at inconvenient times, like right in the middle of reading a tweet. The timeline zooms back up to the top and the user loses track of what they were reading…</p>
      <p>Naturally, the buggy auto-refresh is causing a lot of frustration as it gets in the way of people’s reading experience on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The update also appears to have caused other <a href="https://twitter.com/flyosity/status/1191132607414755334">instability issues</a> with extremely slow performance for some users, crashes when composing tweets, among other problems, even when run on the latest iPhone 11 phones.</p>
      <p>Presumably, the auto-refresh is meant to happen seamlessly — inserting tweets at the top of the timeline silently. Instead, it appears to happen at random, interrupting users who just want to catch up on the tweets in their timeline.</p>
      <p>You can see the auto-refresh issue in action in the video below.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, the general Twitter zeitgeist is not too happy with many people airing their frustrations <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=twitter%20auto%20refresh&amp;src=typed_query">on the service</a>.</p>

      <p>Twitter has yet to comment on the refresh ‘feature’ but in all likelihood, it will release an update to address the bugs, if not disable the auto-refresh behavior entirely.</p>
      <p>Some Twitter users have suggested that disabling reduce motion in Twitter settings disables auto-refresh as a temporary workaround but we could not reproduce this in our testing.</p>
      <p>Twitter recently ported its <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/29/twitter-for-mac-receives-first-update-since-ipad-version-adapted-for-macos/">iOS app to the Mac</a> using Apple’s new Catalyst framework for macOS Catalina.</p>
