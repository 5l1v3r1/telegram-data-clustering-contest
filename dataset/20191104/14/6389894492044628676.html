      <p>Independent member of parliament John Woodcock has revealed he will step down as an MP in December’s election.</p>
      <p>Woodcock said he plans to quit politics after his wife, Spectator assistant editor Isabel Hardman, became pregnant.</p>
      <p>The MP , who was a member of the Labour party until he quit in the summer of 2018 with an outspoken attack on leader Jeremy Corbyn, said it was “some sad news prompted by some wonderful news”.</p>
      <p>“With great sadness, I will not be putting myself forward as a candidate in the forthcoming general election and amtherefore stepping down as your MP,” he told constituents.</p>
      <p>“I was looking forward to contesting the next election as an independent candidate committed to putting the interests of our community first, free from the abhorrent antisemitism and extremism that has corrupted my former party under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership.</p>
      <p>“But life often does not work out quite as anticipated. I am suddenly changing my life plans because mt partner and I have been blessed with an unexpected but wonderful piece of news – Isabel is expecting a baby!”</p>
