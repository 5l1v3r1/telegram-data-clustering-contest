      <p>Paris -Â French cyclist <b>Jacques Dupont</b>, who won a gold medal at the 1948 Olympic Games in London, has died at the age of 91, his family announced on Monday.</p>
      <p>Dupont, who was born and died in the village of Lezat sur Leze in the south-west of France, achieved his gold medal at the Herne Hill Velodrome on August 11, 1948.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Dupont eclipsed the field in the 1,000 metre track time trial, beating Belgian Pierre Nihant by one second. The Briton Tommy Godwin took the bronze.</p>
      <p>Two days later Dupont was back in the saddle for the road race which doubled as an individual and team event.</p>
      <p>Dupont could only manage 17th in the individual but helped the French take bronze in the team event alongside Jose Beyaert and Alain Moineau.</p>
      <p>The Belgians took gold without realising it and only received their medals in 2010 - 62 years later.</p>
      <p>Dupont turned professional, winning the French championship in 1954 and the prestigious Paris-Tours in 1951 and 1955.</p>
      <p>After retiring from cycling in 1959, Dupont became a butcher and local businessman - he was even a 'soigneur' for the Stade Cadurcien rugby team in Cahors.</p>
