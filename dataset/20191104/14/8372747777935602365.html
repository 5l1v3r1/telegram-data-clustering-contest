      <p>HENDRY COUNTY, Fla. -- We are learning about two new Florida panther deaths in Southwest Florida last week.</p>
      <p>Florida Fish and Wildlife say on Thursday they found the remains of a 3.5 year old male panther on State Road 29 near Felda. They say he died after being hit by a car.</p>
      <p>And a 4-5 month old female panther was also found dead in Hendry County on Friday in an orange grove off Wainwright Road. Researchers are working to figure out how she died.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a Florida panther was found dead in Martin County on Saturday, killed by a vehicle collision. It was found along Beeline Highway, two miles south of Indiantown.</p>
      <p>That bring the total panther deaths in 2019 so far to 23. All but five of those were vehicle-related.</p>
