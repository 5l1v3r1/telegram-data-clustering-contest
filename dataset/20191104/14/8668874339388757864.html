      <p>Racing 92 have ordered <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92/players/ben-tameifuna/">Ben Tameifuna</a> to lose weight with the club unhappy with the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/tonga">Tonga</a> international’s condition following his return from the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>According to reports in France, Tameifuna tipped the scales at 160kg when he reported back to the Top14 club.</p>

      <p>Midi Olympique claim that Racing have now told the player that he will not be considered for selection until he trims down to 140kg, the weight he was at pre-tournament, leaving Tameifuna facing a weight cut of 20kg.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time Racing have been unhappy with the 28-year-old’s weight.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Tameifuna returned for pre-season weighting 166kg.</p>
