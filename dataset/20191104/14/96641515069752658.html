      <h1>MIT and Ford help delivery robots navigate to your doorstep</h1>
      <h2>Their technique doesn't require mapping areas in advance.</h2>

      <p>In order for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/starship-delivery-robots-at-purdue-university/">delivery robots</a> to drop your takeout, package or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/22/university-michigan-meal-kits-food-waste-emissions/">meal-kit</a> at the door, they'll need to be able to find the door. In most cases, that requires mapping a location in advance so that the robot knows where to go. But to do that on a large scale is challenging and raises security and privacy concerns. Now, a team of engineers from MIT and Ford Motor Company think they might have an answer. They've created a technique that allows robots to navigate via clues, rather than maps.</p>
      <p>The clues can be described in general terms, like "front door" or "garage." As <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/technique-helps-robots-find-front-door-1104">MIT explains</a>, the robot might be trained to know that a driveway often leads to a sidewalk which likely leads to the front door.</p>
      <p>"Even if a robot is delivering a package to an environment it's never been to, there might be clues that will be the same as other places it's seen," said Michael Everett, a graduate student in MIT's Department of Mechanical Engineering. "So the world may be laid out a little differently, but there's probably some things in common."</p>

      <p>The technique uses pre-existing algorithms that looks at visual data and labels the scene with semantic clues, like "sidewalk." The researchers used those algorithms to build a map as their robot moved around. What's new about their approach is that they allowed the robot to make decisions and determine the most efficient path to a destination. The team will present their findings at the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems <a href="https://www.iros2019.org/">this week</a>.</p>
