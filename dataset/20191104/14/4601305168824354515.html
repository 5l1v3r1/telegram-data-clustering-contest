      <h1>Conservative politician apologizes for saying people on welfare "needed putting down".</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:04:37+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/rob_beschizza" target="_blank">Rob Beschizza</a></address>
      <p>Francesca O'Brien, the Conservative candidate for the Gower constituency in the forthcoming UK elections, said that people appearing on the TV show "Benefits Steet" <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-50283520">needed "putting down"</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>In the posts following the broadcast of the first episode of Benefits Street five years ago, Ms O'Brien said: "Benefit Street..anyone else watching this?? Wow, these people are unreal!!!"<br/><br/>Responding to another user's comment, she said: "My blood is boiling, these people need putting down."<br/><br/>In a statement released on Sunday, Ms O'Brien said: "These comments were made off the cuff, a number of years ago.<br/><br/>"However, I accept that my use of language was unacceptable and I would like to apologise for any upset I have caused."</blockquote>
      <p>Benefits Street was a Channel 4 documentary about people on welfare, broadcast in 2014, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-28086213">criticized at the time</a> for "vilifying and misrepresenting benefits claimaints" in tabloid fashion. O'Brien neglected to delete her social media history before launching her bid for office.</p>
