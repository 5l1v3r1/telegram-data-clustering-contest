      <h1>Android 10 is rolling out to the ASUS Zenfone 6</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:00:13+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>The ASUS Zenfone 6 has been <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/30/asus-zenfone-6-review/">the surprise midrange flagship of the year</a>, and with the company's switch to a lighter, significantly more Pixel-like UI, the device is a no-brainer for people looking for an affordable, all-round good phone. ASUS is even making good on its promise for timely Android updates and has just started rolling out Android 10 to the Zenfone 6.</p>
      <p>The new software comes just two months after Google released the stable version of Android 10 and adds <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/12/every-new-android-10-feature-detailed-changelog/">all the goodies</a> we've found in it, such as fully gestural navigation, improved location permission dialogs, and Google's system-wide dark mode. The security patch level is raised to the one from October 2019, which is the most recent one available (until <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/01/pixel-3-internal-dogfood-november-ota/">November's patches hit Google's Pixel phones</a>, that is).</p>

      <p>The OTA is currently rolling out, so if you'd like to receive it seamlessly without tinkering, you'll just have to wait a bit until it reaches you. Alternatively, you can also <a href="https://www.asus.com/Phone/ZenFone-6-ZS630KL/HelpDesk_BIOS/">download the new firmware from ASUS</a> right now, but you'll have to flash it yourself and may lose all your data, so only choose this path if you know what you're doing.</p>
