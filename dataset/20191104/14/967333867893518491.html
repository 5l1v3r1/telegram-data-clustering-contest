      <p>One person was killed and 18 people injured in a<a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910301077177875-terrorists-execute-at-least-5-laborers-in-south-kashmir-one-more-person-injured--reports/"> grenade attack</a> on security forces in a market place in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir on Monday. The deceased is reported to be a vendor from the area.</p>
      <p>This was the second grenade attack in the past fortnight in the same area of the city.  </p>
      <p>Monday’s attack came when markets were open and traffic returned to normal in several parts of Srinagar, after three months of lockdown.</p>

      <p>​Earlier, six security personnel on patrol duty were injured when they were targeted in Srinagar.</p>
      <p>New Delhi abrogated <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201908061076483483-indias-kashmir-legislation-sails-through-parliamentary-scrutiny/">Article 370 and 35A</a> of the Constitution and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910311077186560-indian-state-of-jammu-and-kashmir-divided-into-two-territories/">divided the state into two</a> federally administered regions in early August in order to divest the state of its special status. The move also saw several political leaders taken into custody.  </p>
      <p>On 31 October, the Indian order to divide the state came into force and the state of Jammu and Kashmir officially "ceased to exist," as two new federally administered territories created.</p>
      <p>Pakistan termed the move as “illegal” and scaled down its diplomatic and trade relations with New Delhi.</p>
      <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi justified India's move, claiming it helped eliminate the root cause of "terrorism and separatism."</p>
      <p>"When a decision is right, its echo is heard across the globe. And I can hear it in Thailand as well," said Modi while addressing a gathering of the Indian community in Bangkok on Sunday.</p>
