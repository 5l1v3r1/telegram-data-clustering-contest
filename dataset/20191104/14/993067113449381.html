      <p>An arson attack on a property in west Belfast using fireworks could have ended in tragedy, police have warned.</p>
      <p>Fireworks were used to ignite a bin bag full of waste at a property in the Rossnareen Road area in the early hours of Monday.</p>
      <p>A PSNI spokesman said officers received a report at 2.40am of a blaze in the stairwell of the property.</p>
      <p>Firefighters attended and extinguished the flames.</p>
      <p>Inspector James Murphy said it was lucky no-one had been killed or injured in the incident.</p>
      <p>"This type of behaviour is totally unacceptable," he said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone should be able to feel safe in their homes and not feel afraid by the reckless behaviour of others.</p>
      <p>"Throwing fireworks at anything or anyone is irresponsible and it is important to remember they are made from explosive material and, if misused, can cause serious and life-changing injuries.</p>
      <p>"This reckless action could have resulted in something more serious and we are lucky not to be dealing with a tragic incident.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are continuing and we are appealing to anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in the area to contact police on 101, quoting reference number 106 of 04/11/19."</p>
