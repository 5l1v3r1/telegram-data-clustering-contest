      <h2>A Roughriders regular season that began in disastrous fashion has surprisingly culminated with a rare first-place finish.</h2>

      <p>What was the prognosis three offensive plays into the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ 2019 season? Ohhhh, bleak.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-zach-collaros-deal-creates-an-unsettling-feeling">Zach Collaros</a>, the opening-day starting quarterback, had just suffered another concussion. His understudy, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qb-cody-fajardo-tops-riders-depth-chart">Cody Fajardo</a>, was suddenly elevated to a front-line role — with unspectacular results, as it turned out, during the Roughriders’ 23-17 CFL loss to the host Hamilton Tiger-Cats on June 13.</p>
      <p>The Green and White was even upstaged at its own stadium, where <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/basketball/reginans-rejoice-over-toronto-raptors-historic-win">a basketball-crazed crowd focused on the giant MaxTron as the Toronto Raptors captured their first NBA title.</a></p>
      <p>A considerable portion of the Roughriders’ game was shown on a significantly smaller screen at Mosaic Stadium. Nobody seemed at all bothered by the relegation of the beloved football team.</p>
      <p>In previous years, the loss of a starting quarterback to injury in Game 1 had spelled disaster.</p>
      <p>The 1991 Roughriders never recovered from the absence of Kent Austin, who missed five full games with a partially separated shoulder. Comparably, the 2015 edition was sunk after <a href="https://leaderpost.com/gallery/darian-durant-through-the-years">Darian Durant</a> suffered a season-ending Achilles-tendon injury.</p>
      <p>An all-too-familiar script appeared to be unfolding once again, as the Roughriders of 2019 lost three of their first four games.</p>
      <p>The third defeat was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-thumped-37-10-by-calgary-stampeders">a 37-10 evisceration at the hands of the visiting Calgary Stampeders</a>, who demonstrated on July 6 why they were the perennial first-place finisher in the CFL’s West Division.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-still-need-stamp-of-excellence">Saskatchewan never did solve the Stampeders during the 2019 regular season. Calgary won both meetings, throwing only nine incompletions over two games.</a>
      </p>
      <p>It mattered not.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders finished first. Oh, yes they did.</p>

      <p>They clinched top spot Saturday by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-clinch-first-place-in-cfl-west-division">defeating the Edmonton Eskimos 23-13 before a surprisingly small, but nonetheless engaged, crowd of 29,156 at Mosaic Stadium.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qb-cody-fajardo-tops-riders-depth-chart">Despite the absence of Fajardo due to an oblique injury</a>, the Roughriders overcame a succession of errors and squandered opportunities. They eventually polished off the Eskimos to secure hosting privileges for the Nov. 17 West Division final.</p>
      <p>Who could have envisioned such an outcome, or anything close, after Calgary schooled the Roughriders in the first week of July?</p>
      <p>“I think we went into that first bye (week at) 1-and-3,” <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-scores-points-with-his-honesty">Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson</a> recalled Saturday. “I told the players, ‘We’re going to be the same way whether we win or lose.’ I think that really struck a chord with them.</p>
      <p>“We gave them the entire week off. We didn’t punish them for losing games. We try not to get too high, and then too low when we’re losing. I think that resonated in the locker room and I think they appreciate that.</p>
      <p>“I think that was a big moment for us. The guys realized, ‘When they say they’re going to do something, they’re going to do it the way they say it,’ and they started to trust us after that.”</p>
      <p>The trust had to be earned on several fronts.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>On the Roughriders’ football-operations side, the “first-year” label applies to the head coach (Dickenson), two starting quarterbacks (Fajardo and, most recently, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-backup-qb-isaac-harker-is-ready-to-go-if-needed">Isaac Harker</a>), general manager/vice-president of football operations (<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/qa-jeremy-oday-looks-ahead-to-riders-2019-season">Jeremy O’Day</a>) and defensive co-ordinator (<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/jason-shivers-follows-in-chris-jones-footsteps-as-saskatchewan-roughriders-defensive-co-ordinator">Jason Shivers</a>).</p>
      <p>The Roughriders do have a veteran offensive co-ordinator (<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-ride-improved-offence-into-cfl-post-season">Stephen McAdoo</a>), but he was widely criticized after the team scored a league-worst 25 rushing or passing touchdowns in 2018.</p>
      <p>His return, and that of Collaros, didn’t exactly engender confidence that Saskatchewan’s offence would emerge from hibernation.</p>
      <p>McAdoo was initially put in place by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-chris-jones-era-was-one-big-incompletion">Chris Jones</a>, who in January signed a contract extension as the Roughriders’ head coach, defensive co-ordinator, general manager and VP of football operations.</p>
      <p>A week after the new deal was announced, Jones was gone — snapped up by the NFL’s Cleveland Browns, for whom he is now a senior defensive assistant.</p>
      <p>The departure of one man created multiple job openings and all sorts of uncertainty, considering that he was merely the face of the franchise.</p>
      <p>That informal distinction now belongs to Fajardo, who was an afterthought when he signed with the Roughriders as a free agent in February.</p>
      <p>He became such a sensation, so quickly, that people clamoured for the Roughriders to sign him to a long-term deal.</p>
      <p>A new pact, carrying through the 2021 CFL season, became a reality on Oct. 21.</p>
      <p>Within a fortnight, the contract-extension jinx struck yet again.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, not long after being named the Roughriders’ most outstanding player, Fajardo was injured in practice. The pain was so acute that Fajardo felt like he had been stabbed.</p>
      <p>Was this season, a storybook in so many ways, destined for the shredder?</p>
      <p>There was that fear, at least in some circles, as the Roughriders prepared for one of the most important regular-season games in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Among the players who dressed for Saskatchewan on Saturday, the only one who had thrown a touchdown pass in a professional football game was the punter. Jon Ryan, as a member of the Seattle Seahawks, produced an aerial major on a trick play in the 2015 NFC championship game.</p>
      <p>Harker, fresh out of the Colorado School of Mines, was the No. 1 signal-caller on Saturday. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-backup-quarterback-bryan-bennett-making-a-name-for-himself-on-special-teams">Bryan Bennett</a>, primarily a short-yardage specialist and special-teams terror, was next in line.</p>
      <p>Edmonton, which sat out starting pivot Trevor Harris on Saturday, used Logan Kilgore and Troy Williams behind centre.</p>
      <p>A few thousand empty seats — and seemingly as many mistakes by both teams — led to an often-dreary display that, in many respects, was reminiscent of the pre-season.</p>
      <p>But the stakes were uncommonly high, at least for the home side.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>After doing everything possible to keep the Eskimos in the game, the resourceful, resilient Roughriders finally looked like a first-place team in the waning minutes of the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>Harker drove the Roughriders 75 yards in eight plays to set up a tie-breaking, 11-yard field goal by <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/friendship-remains-on-sideline-for-kickers-brett-lauther-justin-medlock">Brett Lauther</a>, who had atypically missed four of his previous five attempts on Saturday.</p>
      <p>When the Eskimos regained possession, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/linebacker-cameron-judge-returns-to-saskatchewan-roughriders-active-roster">Cameron Judge</a> promptly intercepted Williams and sprinted 29 yards for a touchdown that effectively secured top spot for Saskatchewan for the first time since 2009.</p>
      <p>Before that, Saskatchewan had not finished first since 1976.</p>
      <p>Appropriately, Saskatchewan won on Saturday by the same score that was entered into the statistical annals on Nov. 20, 1976, when the Roughriders downed Edmonton in the Western Conference final at Taylor Field.</p>
      <p>That season, the Roughriders had clinched first place by registering a 33-31 victory over the host Stampeders on the final day of regular-season play.</p>
      <p>Saskatchewan trailed 24-0 and 27-8 before <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ron-lancasters-legendary-last-game-robs-green-time-machine">Ron Lancaster</a> rallied the Roughriders. On the final offensive play, The Little General threw a three-yard, game-winning touchdown pass to Rhett Dawson.</p>
      <p>That major increased Dawson’s 1976 conference-leading receiving-yardage total to 996 — which on Saturday became the final 2019 figure for current Roughriders pass-catcher <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-receiving-duo-evokes-memories-of-legends">Kyran Moore</a>. Those are the two closest flirtations with a 1,000-yard season since the franchise’s inception.</p>
      <p>Ancient history? Perhaps.</p>
      <p>But the striking coincidences are worth noting while reflecting on a Roughriders season that seemed to be history so soon after the opening kickoff.</p>
