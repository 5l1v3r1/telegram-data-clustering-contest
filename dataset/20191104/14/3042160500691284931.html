      <h1>‘He’s All Over the Place’: Jason Mitchell’s Attempt to Address Misconduct Allegations Derails When Fans Say He’s ‘Lying’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T14:15:58+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/dnelson/" target="_blank">Daryl Nelson</a></address>
      <p>The actor <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/jason-mitchell/"><b>Jason Mitchell</b></a> has broken his silence about <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/06/11/i-thank-you-the-chi-actress-tiffany-boone-finally-speaks-out-amid-jason-mitchells-firing-for-misconduct/">getting fired</a> from the Showtime series “The Chi” and the Netflix film “Desperados” earlier this year. He was dropped by his manager, agent, and lawyer as well.</p>
      <p>He spoke about it during an interview on <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/the-breakfast-club/"><b>“The Breakfast Club”</b></a> Monday, but a lot of people don’t seem to be buying his story.</p>

      <p>Mitchell was let go from “The Chi” after his former co-star <b><a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/tiffany-boone/">Tiffany Boone</a></b>, who played his girlfriend, complained of misconduct on his part.</p>
      <p>And misconduct allegations were behind Mitchell’s termination from “Desperados” as well, which he talked about first.</p>
      <p>“To be honest I’m not 100 percent sure what the allegations are,” he said. “I went out with a coworker of mine and she got drunk. I made sure she got home and the next day it all kind of slapped me in my face. I’m not sure if her and her significant other had a situation.”</p>
      <p>“I actually had a girlfriend at the time too as well, and I felt like I was doing the right thing,” added Mitchell. “The next day they canceled the rehearsal. I told them my side of the story, and I don’t know if there was something that I missed.”</p>
      <p>Mitchell then apologized to anyone who he’s ever made feel uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>“For anybody who’s ever been around me they know I’m the most loving, sweet person in the world, but if I ever did do something, say anything, make anybody uncomfortable, in any kind of way, you have my deepest apologies,” he stated. “That was never my intention. I’ve definitely never put my hands on anybody. I think that Netflix made an executive decision.”</p>
      <p>Mitchell was asked about Boone next, and he said there was “no situation” with her at all.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old also brought up the second season showrunner for “The Chi,” Ayanna Floyd, who complained about him to human resources after having a verbal altercation.</p>
      <p>Plus, he denied sexually harassing anyone on the set, as some reports have suggested.</p>
      <p>“In this situation, Ayanna tried to use it [the #MeToo movement] as a really, really ugly weapon,” Mitchell claimed. “Tiffany Boone left the show because she got a better job, basically. She put in two seasons with us, and she got a better job.”</p>
      <p>“Anybody who knows Tiffany Boone knows she is the epitome of a black woman,” he continued. “If you try her she will get you together right then and there.”</p>
      <p>“Because had me and Tiffany had a situation where she might’ve felt sexually harassed, I can bet my bottom dollar that she would’ve told me about myself in that moment,” said Mitchell.</p>
      <p>In YouTube’s comments section, a lot of folks said they were baffled by the actor’s explanation and thought he was being untruthful.</p>
      <p>“He’s all over the place why even do an interview?” one person asked.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t coming off like a man taking accountability. There’s a lot of holes in his stories,” wrote someone else.</p>
      <p>“This was embarrassing to watch 🤦🏾‍♀️ he doesn’t sound believable at all,” another person followed.</p>
      <p>“He’s being ambiguous and elusive. This guy is lying,” said another.</p>
      <p>Neither Boone, Davis or “The Chi” show creator Lena Waithe have responded to Mitchell’s interview yet.</p>
