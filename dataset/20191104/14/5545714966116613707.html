      <h1>BioWare's revealing Dragon Age 4 in one month (or this is all a stupid, cruel trick)</h1>

      <p>BioWare is akin to a man caught in a torrential downpour without an umbrella, but with a big goofy smile plastered to his face because sunny days <i>might</i> be ahead. By the most lenient estimate, the rainstorm has lasted nearly three years; by harsher standards, it's more like eight years.</p>
      <p>Through the decade, BioWare has suffered: Enormous blowback to the end of Shepard's arc in <i>Mass Effect 3</i>; a divisive reception to <i>Dragon Age: Inquisition</i>; the cancellation of <i>Shadow Realms</i>; a new <i>Mass Effect</i> that was so universally hated that it forced EA to put the series on indefinite hiatus; and an attempt at a <i>Destiny</i>-like games-as-a-service product in <i>Anthem</i>, which saw its player base plummet to depressingly low numbers mere months after launch. All the while, BioWare has been outwardly optimistic about the future of everything -- <i>Mass Effect</i>, <i>Anthem</i>, all of it -- despite not giving us any real reason to be optimistic about any of it.</p>
      <p>It seems as though the next opportunity for BioWare to correct course will be revealed in a month. Earlier today, BioWare tweeted this:</p>

      <p>It's not an outright confirmation, no, but it's also as subtle as a baseball bat to the kneecap -- which, ironically, is exactly what it'll feel like if <i>Dragon Age 4</i> isn't announced. Transposing the A with a 4 would be the cruelest joke if there were no upcoming reveal. That's especially true because BioWare has been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../bioware-made-an-obligatory-dragon-age-4-teaser-534127.phtml">teasing a new <i>Dragon Age</i></a> for a year now.</p>
      <p>But, there probably will be. We're probably going to get first confirmation of <i>Dragon Age 4</i> on December 4, and it'll probably be followed by a proper trailer a week later during The Game Awards. Whatever happens, don't expect a release anytime in the near future. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/30/ea-expects-new-star-wars-game-before-april-2022-new-dragon-age-likely-not-until-after-march-2022">EA recently told investors</a> that a new <i>Dragon Age</i> game won't launch until 2022 at the earliest.</p>
