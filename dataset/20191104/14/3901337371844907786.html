      <p>The 38-year-old scored 31 goals in Major League Soccer this season, but his contract with LA Galaxy expires in December.</p>
      <p>He has been linked with many clubs as a result, including a return to United, but Bologna sporting director Walter Sabatini has now insisted Ibrahimovic is keen to join his Serie A team, citing an emotional connection with his former teammate Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is Bologna's current head coach and was diagnosed with leukaemia at the beginning of the season.</p>

      <p>"Ibrahimovic wants to come to us because of the relationship he has with Sinisa," Sabatini said, as quoted by the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>"It is not impossible, it can be done, and if it should happen, it would be a matter of affection between them.</p>
      <p>"Ibra would like to help Mihajlovic. I can say that we will do everything to make this madness happen."</p>
