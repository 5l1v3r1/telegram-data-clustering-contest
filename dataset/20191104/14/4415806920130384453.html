      <p>The famous chimes of Big Ben will sound for the first time since the New Year as part of technical tests ahead of Remembrance Sunday in the UK.</p>
      <p>Clock mechanics will test the bell on Monday evening and Thursday morning before it strikes 11 times to mark the start of the two-minute silence at 11am on November 10.</p>
      <p>Big Ben’s bongs were temporarily silenced in 2017 for the safety of workers involved in a four-year restoration scheme of the Elizabeth Tower.</p>
      <p>It is only being reactivated for special occasions until the work programme is completed.</p>
      <p>The bell will be struck intermittently to test the mechanism between 6pm and 10pm on Monday evening, ahead of a dress rehearsal on Thursday at 11am for the Remembrance Day Ceremony.</p>
      <p>Big Ben will be struck 11 times at 11am on Remembrance Sunday, with the mechanism programmed to strike the bell at the usual strike rate of the Great Clock.</p>
