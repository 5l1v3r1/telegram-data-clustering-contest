      <p>The report claims ‘a proposal of €15million (£13m) will be sent’, but Atalanta are said to want closer to €25million (£21.6m) for the midfielder.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski’s agent, Stefano Sem, recently discussed the interest in the Sweden under-21 international.</p>
      <p>“For elegance I don’t name names, I only say that they were both Italian and foreign teams," he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s a Swedish international, he’s a player who has a more international market than other guys even for a basic mentality and culture discourse.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"It’s clear that he’s a player that even at the national team, when he plays, it’s easier to follow than his other teammates who play for the Italian national team.</p>
      <p>“The Italians have the ambition to play for Azzurri and maybe get in a big Italian club, a foreigner wants the top: if the top is in Italy good, if it’s abroad he goes abroad.”</p>
