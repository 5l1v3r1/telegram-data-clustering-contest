      <p>At Ignite, Microsoft today announced Project Cortex, a brand-new commercial service since Teams. Project Cortex in Microsoft 365 will help organizations in identifying, organizing, and delivering knowledge among the employees. It does three main things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Cortex will use AI to make sense of organization’s data and automatically organize it into shared topics like projects and customers.</li>
        <li>Project Cortex will give relevant knowledge to people across the organization through topic cards and topic pages.</li>
        <li>Project Cortex will also turn your content into an interactive knowledge repository—with innovations in smart content ingestion—to analyze documents and create sophisticated content models; machine teaching, to allow subject matter experts to teach the system how to understand semi-structured content; and knowledge retrieval, to make it easy for people to access the valuable knowledge that’s so often locked away in locked away in documents, conversations, meetings, and videos.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to SharePoint content, Project Cortex can also connect with Microsoft 365 and external systems for additional content.</p>
      <p>Project Cortex’s interactive experiences will be available across Microsoft 365, such as in the Office apps, Outlook, and Microsoft Teams. Project Cortex is currently in private preview and will be generally available in the first half of 2020.</p>
