      <p>We're just days away from the launch of <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield"><b>Pokémon Sword and Shield</b></a> on Nintendo Switch, and all sorts of leaks are appearing all over the internet. We're talking starter evolutions, new Gigantamax forms, and pretty much the full Pokédex - if you want to know something, you can probably find it.</p>
      <p>Innocently scrolling through your social media platform of choice can be a nightmare for those looking to avoid new content, so we'd recommend muting certain phrases if you're particularly concerned. Facebook and Instagram are tricky, but Twitter allows you to essentially <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options">block any words of your choosing</a> - such as 'Sword and Shield' or 'Pokemon leaks', for example.</p>
      <p>From here on out, <b>Nintendo Life will remain a spoiler-free zone throughout the entire pre-release period</b>, so if you're wanting to keep on top of your gaming news without having the new Pokémon titles ruined, feel free to remain glued to our <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/">homepage</a>. We will, of course, still share anything officially released by The Pokémon Company and will have a full review of the games for you in due time.</p>
      <p>If you've landed on this page in the hope of finding leaks, we're sorry to disappoint, but you can easily find everything with a little bit of searching online.</p>
      <p>We do have <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/pokemon_sword_and_shields_glitched_pokemon_is_sirfetchrd_a_version-exclusive"><i>leeks</i></a>, though.</p>
