        <i>Actor has chance to add to her record tally after returning to stage following 12-year absence</i>
      </p>
      <p>Dame Maggie Smith’s return to the stage after a 12-year absence has put her in contention for her fifth best actress win in the UK’s longest-running theatre awards.</p>
      <p>Smith already has more best actress Evening Standard theatre awards than anyone else, with the first won in 1962 for a double bill of Peter Shaffer plays, The Private Ear and The Public Eye, in which she co-starred with Kenneth Williams.</p>
      <p>Fifty-seven years later, Smith has been shortlisted for her portrayal of Joseph Goebbels’ personal secretary Brunhilde Pomsel in A German Life, written by Christopher Hampton and based on an <a href="http://www.blackboxfilm.at/blackbox/project/german-life/">Austrian documentary</a> made when Pomsel was 102.</p>
      <p>The five-week run at the Bridge theatre in London was Smith’s first stage appearance since 2007, when she starred in Edward Albee’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/21/theatre2">The Lady from Dubuque</a>.</p>
      <p>The Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/12/a-german-life-review-maggie-smith-shines-as-goebbels-secretary">Michael Billington said</a> Smith’s return was a “triumph”, playing the role with “just the right verbal hesitancy and moral evasiveness”.</p>
      <p>Smith, 84, has received nine Evening Standard theatre awards in total, with the other best actress prizes won for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/30/theatre.samanthaellis">Hedda Gabler</a> in 1970, The Way of the World in 1984 and Three Tall Women in 1994.</p>
      <p>She will compete for this year’s prize – named in honour of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/mar/19/natasha-richardson-canada">Natasha Richardson</a> – with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/03/rosmersholm-review-haylet-atwell-tom-burke-ibsen">Hayley Atwell</a> for Rosmersholm; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/12/a-dolls-house-review-lyric-hammersmith-london">Anjana Vasan</a> for A Doll’s House; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/21/the-doctor-review-robert-icke-juliet-stevenson-almeida">Juliet Stevenson</a> for The Doctor; and Cecilia Noble for two new plays at the National Theatre, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/18/faith-hope-and-charity-review-dorfman-london-alexander-zeldin">Faith, Hope and Charity</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/21/downstate-review-steppenwolf-national-theatre-child-abusers-punishment">Downstate</a>.</p>
      <p>Downstate, set in a home where four men convicted of sexual crimes against minors live, was a play by Bruce Norris that raised uncomfortable questions around how we live with child abusers.</p>
