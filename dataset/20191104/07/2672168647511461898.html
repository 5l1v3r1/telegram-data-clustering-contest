      <p>Group chief executive officer Datuk Heng Huck Lee told StarBiz that although the global shipment of smartphones is projected to grow at a more moderate pace, new releases planned for next year will feature the next generation of high-tech sensors.</p>
      <p>Globetronics, he said, would be investing in high-precision tools and equipment to support this development.</p>
      <p>“These are leading-edge precision technologies that also allow us to integrate multiple components and sensor functions into a single sensor system-in-package (SIP).</p>
      <p>“While the total quantity may remain flat, this SIP module would enhance the value of each new sensor, ” he said.</p>
      <p>As it is, the company is in the early stages of prototyping two new smartphone modules.</p>
      <p>“These new modules are for smart devices scheduled for release in late-2020, ” he said.</p>
      <p>The new sensors are expected to be shipped starting from the second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>“From our customer preliminary projection, we are expecting a stronger number that is expected to surpass that of the same period of 2019, ” Heng said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the current product order momentum remained “strong, ” he said, and the trend is expected to continue into the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>“Generally, our non-sensor customers are also quite optimistic about their 2020 projections, ” he added.</p>
      <p>But with new product development, there are bound to be some production hiccups.</p>
      <p>Heng said this was mainly to cater to design changes and supply chain issues.</p>
      <p>“We expect the problems to be resolved before the end of the year, ” he said.</p>
      <p>This includes getting a sensor producer to move its operations from China to Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“We are planning to lease a third of the production space at the Kuala Lumpur plant to a company to produce sensors, ” Heng said.“The revenue generated from these activities would show up in the 2020 financial year, ” he added.</p>
      <p>For the nine-month period ended Sept 30, Globetronics posted a net profit of RM30.1mil on the back of RM157.3mil in turnover.</p>
      <p>As at Sept 30, the group had cash and cash equivalents of RM126mil.</p>
      <p>Globetronics is one of the many companies across Asia that makes components used in smartphones produced by Apple Inc.</p>
      <p>A Nikkei Asian Review report last Friday quoted sources as saying that Apple planned to ship 80 million 5G phones next year.</p>
      <p>Samsung Electronics, Huawei Technologies and makers of Oppo and Xiaomi smartphones have already launched 5G phones this year.</p>
