      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T07:51:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wollaston, https://www.facebook.com/stevewollastonjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>The latest news in the world of Wolves transfers and elsewhere in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The club are rumoured to be monitoring Karlan Grant and Ben Davies ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports. </p>
      <p>Huddersfield Town striker Grant and Preston North End defender Ben Davies have both been stand-out performers for their respective sides in the Championship this season.</p>
      <p>  Grant, 22, has netted nine goals in 15 games for the Terriers who dispensed with the services of Jan Siewert in August before appointing Danny Cowley as manager. </p>
      <p>According to the Sun, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> are keeping close tabs on his performances ahead of a potential approach when the window re-opens. </p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>26-year-old Davies has been an ever-present in defence for Preston, who have stormed to the top of the table under Alex Neil. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1199333/Wolves-transfer-news-Preston-North-End-Ben-Davies-January-Nuno-Espirito-Santo">The Express</a> report that Wolves are preparing a £10m bid for him in January having scouted him on several occasions recently. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> will be without Willy Boly for an extended period after the centre-back <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/willy-boly-injury-update-wolves-17174673">had surgery for a fractured fibula.</a> </p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>Wolves chairman Jeff Shi <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/wolves-chairman-jeff-shi-reveals-17178293">spoke about the upcoming window in a recent interview.</a> Asked whether Fosun are willing to dig deep, he told wolves.co.uk: “Of course. We are always ready to invest. Don’t worry about it. If we need to strengthen the squad of course we have the capacity to do that in January. </p>
      <p>“The philosophy of the club is to do the right deal. We don’t want to do something wrong and spend some money on a player who never plays well. You can see some examples at other clubs so I hope we can avoid that.”</p>
      <h3>Elsewhere in the Premier League </h3>
      <p>Manchester United are ready to hijack Liverpool’s bid to bring German striker Timo Werner to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>United, who drew a blank in defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> , are ready to make a move for 23-year-old RB Leipzig hit-man in the January transfer window in an effort to beat their Anfield rivals to one of Europe’s most highly-rated finishers.</p>
      <p>Werner signed a new four-year contract with Leipzig in the summer when his dream move to Bayern Munich failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>But the agreement included a buy-out clause of just £27million.</p>
      <p>And after failing to replace Romelu Lukaku after allowing Belgian – who had topped the Old Trafford goal charts in each of the previous two seasons to move to Inter Milan – Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has a weakness in his squad that needs addressing.</p>
      <h4>Big move?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are reportedly weighing up a move for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/inter-milan">Inter Milan</a> striker Lautaro Martinez.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been in good form for the Nerrazurri so far this season, netting seven times in 13 appearances, while also banging in a hat-trick for Argentina.</p>
      <p>United are short of options up front, having sold Romelu Lukaku to the Serie A club in the summer, as well as loaning them Alexis Sanchez.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/01/football-transfer-rumours-lautaro-martinez-to-manchester-united">The Guardian</a> report that United are considering making use of their recent business relations by moving for Martinez.</p>
      <p>However they add that United will have to fork out up to £100 million to prise him from the San Siro.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-100m-lautaro-20787543">Full story</a>
      </p>
      <p>RB Salzburg are yet to receive an offer from Manchester United, or any other club, for highly rated striker Erling Braut Haaland - according to the club's sporting director.</p>
      <p>Teenager Haaland has earned the attention of United, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and a whole host of other of Europe's biggest sides following an eye-catching start to the season.</p>
      <p>Haaland, the son of former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> ace Alf-Inge, has netted six goals in three matches in the Champions League to go alongside 12 strikes, and six assists, in 11 league appearances.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has therefore been heavily mentioned on the rumour mill, with reports Juve are set to offer £35million or other claims that United are heading the queue for a swoop.</p>
      <h4>Wrong decision</h4>
      <p>William Saliba is set to link up with Arsenal in the summer - but Saint-Etienne manager Claude Puel has questioned club bosses for their decision to sell the young defender.</p>
      <p>Saliba put pen to paper with the Gunners in July in a £27million deal which saw him immediately head back to France on loan for the season.</p>
      <p>Whilst injuries have limited the centre-back to just six appearances this season, he has made a major impact and shown his class.</p>
      <p>It has led to ex-Leicester boss Puel labelling him their best player despite being just 18-years-old.</p>
      <p>And he branded their decision to sell him to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> before his arrival as "short-term" and "reactionary".</p>
      <p>Using the Saliba transfer as an example to question their business model, Puel told L'Equipe: |It’s done, adopted and I’ve got nothing to say because it helped perform.</p>
      <p>"Saint-Etienne have held their rank these past few years. Finishing fourth is a great result. Work was done in the short-term.</p>
      <p>"Is this model viable? I don’t think it can make the club a success. Rather than buying a ready-made player, I’d rather we buy him to develop him and help him grow.</p>
      <p>"It’s hard to accept that we sell our best player, a young kid, to help fill the coffers.</p>
      <p>"When you have to sell your gems to round up the budget and then do short term deals to fill in the gaps, you’re being reactionary."</p>
