      <p>The close friendship between <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/victon">VICTON</a>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/byungchan">Byungchan </a>and <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/up10tion">UP10TION</a>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/lee-jin-hyuk">Lee Jin Hyuk</a> is going strong!</p>
      <p>At the VICTON comeback press showcase on November 4 KST, Byungchan was asked about his thoughts regarding the group making a comeback on the same day of Jin Hyuk's solo debut. The friendship of the two idols began when they were both contestants on <b>Mnet</b>'s '<b>Produce X 101</b>.'</p>
      <p><i>"I contacted him this morning," </i>he revealed.<i> "He has a showcase today too, so he's really nervous."</i></p>
      <p>He then recalled joking around with him, pretending it was his very first debut and saying, <i>"Our Jin Hyuk hyung, today is your debut, so you are a singer as of today. Come visit our waiting room."</i></p>
      <p>In response, Jin Hyuk reacted with a laugh as technically he was the more senior artist, saying, <i>"Wow, Byungchannie has really grown up."</i><br/><br/>When asked to say a couple words to Jin Hyuk, Byungchan responded, teasingly assuming the tone of a senior idol to a debuting one:<i> "Jin Hyuk hyung, today is your debut, so when I go visit your waiting room, greet me firmly and always show me how hard-working you are." </i><br/><br/>Meanwhile, on November 4 at 4 PM KST, Lee Jin Hyuk will release his first solo album '<b>S.O.L</b>,' while VICTON will be releasing their fifth mini album '<b>nostalgia</b>' at 6 PM on the same day.</p>
