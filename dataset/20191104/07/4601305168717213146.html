      <h1>Man accidentally buys 1,000 chickens</h1>

      <p>Steve Morrow saw an "urgent sale" ad on the New Zealand auction site Trade Me from a free-range chicken farmer who was shutting down and selling off his 1,000 chickens; Morrow thought he was bidding on one chicken, but ended up buying all 1,000 of them for NZD1.50.</p>
      <p>He has since given away 700 of his accidental flock via social media ads. Morrow says the ad was confusing, but the seller, Matthew Blomfield, insists that it was all clear: "It's pretty bloody hard to get that wrong."</p>
      <p>The two are collaborating with Animal Sanctuary to screen potential bird adopters. Morrow is planning on keeping 20 birds for himself.</p>
      <blockquote>Morrow said he wasn't going to let the 1000 birds down and let them be killed. <br/><br/>"I wasn't going to let that happen. I was going to save 1000 lives, even if I had to drive up to Auckland and feed them myself while looking for homes for them."</blockquote>
