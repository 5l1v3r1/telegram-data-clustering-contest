      <h1>Alan Mannus caught up in Irish anthem row as former St Johnstone keeper wins FAI Cup</h1>
      <h2>The 37-year-old is in his second spell with Shamrock Rovers and angered Irish fans before the FAI Cup Final.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T07:39:11+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> goalkeeper Alan Mannus has been caught up in a row over the Irish national anthem.</p>
      <p>Mannus was lining out for Shamrock Rovers in the FAI Cup Final against Dundalk and helped his side end their long wait to lift the trophy.</p>
      <p>It was the first time in 32 years they won Ireland's biggest cup competition but it was something that happened prior to it that has caused a row.</p>
      <p>As the Irish national anthem played, players turned to face the Irish tricolor flying from the stadium as is custom in the country.</p>
      <p>Of the 22 players lined up, 21 turned to face the flag but Mannus refused to do so and stood facing forward as the anthem played.</p>

      <p>The decision not to face the flag angered many supporters who felt he was disrespecting the anthem while others insisted he had a right to do as he pleased.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted to say: "Alan Mannus not respecting our anthem. Doesn't have to sing but respect costs nothing."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Alan Mannus turning away from the flag. He really doesn't help himself."</p>
      <p>But others compared his decision to that of James McClean who often receives abuse for not wearing a poppy while playing football in England for the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland,</a> Wigan and Stoke.</p>
      <p>One said: "The same people slaughtering Alan Mannus are the same people who do be up in arms when James McClean gets hate for standing up for his beliefs."</p>
      <p>Mannus is in his second spell at Shamrock Rovers having spent seven years at St Johnstone in between.</p>
      <p>He started his career at Linfield before his move to Dublin and has earned nine caps for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was part of the St Johnstone team that won the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/william-hill-scottish-cup">Scottish Cup</a> in 2014 after beating <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a> in the final.</p>
