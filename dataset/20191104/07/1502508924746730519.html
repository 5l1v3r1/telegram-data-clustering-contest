      <p>There seems to be no end to the woes of people residing in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi">Delhi </a>and other parts of north India. On Monday morning, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi">Delhi </a><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>was in 'severe-plus emergency' category.</p>
      <p>SAFAR, the government-run <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>monitoring and weather forecasting agency, said Delhiâ€™s <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>index (AQI) was 708 at 6:30 am, which is 14 times the safe level of 0-50.. Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad also saw their air quality in the severe-plus emergency overall category.<br/><br/>NASA satellite imagery showed vast swathes of the northern plains, covering Punjab, Haryana, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi">Delhi </a>and Uttar Pradesh, blanketed under a smoky haze. Weather experts said any significant improvement in the situation is highly unlikely unless there is rainfall, which may occur on November 7 and 8</p>
      <p>To tackle this, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>kick started today, with only even-numbered non-transport vehicles allowed on Delhi roads on the first day of the exercise. The impact of the scheme remains to be seen. The third edition of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>will run till November 15.</p>
