      <p>Los Angeles - <b>Brendon Todd</b> fired a nine-under-par final round of 62 to win the PGA Tour's inaugural Bermuda Championship on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The journeyman US professional surged to victory by four shots at the Port Royal Golf Club course in Southampton after a spectacular birdie blitz on the front nine.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, whose only other PGA Tour win came at the Byron Nelson in 2014, reeled off seven consecutive birdies during a remarkable display to reach the turn at seven under.</p>
      <p>Three more birdies on the back nine took him to 10 under before he dropped a shot on the final hole, leaving him with a 24-under-par score of 260.</p>
      <p>"I'm overcome with emotion right now, so excited. I haven't even thought about the tournaments I'll get in," said Todd, who earns a two-year exemption on the back of the victory.</p>
      <p>"I've really enjoyed this tournament. The golf course was in great shape and it fit my eye really well."</p>
      <p>Todd's final day fireworks were too much for overnight leader Harry Higgs, who had started the day two shots clear of the field.</p>
      <p>Higgs closed with a three-under-par 68 to finish on 20 under, four shots back from Todd.</p>
      <p>Four players finished tied for third, with Hank Lebioda the biggest final day mover after closing with an eight-under-par 63.</p>
      <p>Lebioda played flawlessly with eight birdies and 10 pars to grab a share of third on 18 under after 72 holes.</p>
      <p>Aaron Wise, Brian Gay and Scottie Scheffler also finished on 18 under.</p>
