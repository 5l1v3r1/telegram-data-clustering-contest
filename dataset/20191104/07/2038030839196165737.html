      <p>Seville - Billie Eilish won best newcomer and best song for <i>Bad Guy</i> at the MTV Europe Music Awards on Sunday, while Ariana Grande failed to bag any of her seven nominations.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift won best video for <i>ME!</i> and Canadian singer Shawn Mendes took home best artist at the star-studded evening in Seville, Spain that also gave a special "Rock Icon" award to Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and saw Korean boy band sensation BTS take home three gongs.</p>
      <p>"Hi MTV EMA, I want to say thank you so much for winning the best song, I love you," 17-year old Eilish said in a pre-recorded video.</p>
      <p>The American singer became the first artist born in the 2000s to top the Billboard 200 in the US last August with her breakout album <i>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</i>.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the glitzy bash, football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo paraded on the red carpet in a red suit and white trainers with his girlfriend, model Georgina Rodriguez.</p>
