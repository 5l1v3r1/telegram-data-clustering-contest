      <p>Marston’s has offloaded 137 pubs to Admiral Taverns in a deal worth almost £45m.</p>
      <p>As part of a plan to slash its debt by £200m over the next four years, the British brewery giant has sold a portfolio of pubs that contributed operating profit of £3.7m in the last 12 months.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The pubs, which are expected to be handed over later this month, have a book value of £62.7m.</p>
      <p>Last month Marston’s said it expected full-year profits before tax to be lower, as weaker food sales and rising costs dented its balance sheet.</p>
      <p>Marston’s boss Ralph Findlay said in a statement this morning: “We are encouraged by the level of market interest that this portfolio of pubs has attracted.”</p>
      <p>He added: “This further underpins our confidence in achieving the accelerated £70m disposal proceeds target that we have set ourselves for the current year.”</p>
