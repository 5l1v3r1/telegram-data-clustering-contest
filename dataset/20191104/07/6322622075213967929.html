      <p>SEOUL (Nov 4): South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in on Monday suggested high-level talks to resolve a deepening political and trade row with Japan during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Moon’s spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The two leaders held an 11-minute discussion on the sidelines of a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok, the spokeswoman, Ko Min-jung, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Both leaders reaffirmed the principle that bilateral issues should be resolved through dialogue,” Ko said, referring to ongoing working-level talks between the two countries’ foreign ministries.</p>
      <p>“President Moon offered higher-level talks if necessary, and Prime Minister Abe suggested seeking a resolution through all available means.”</p>
      <p>The meeting comes as bilateral ties have plunged to their lowest in decades after South Korea’s top court last year ordered Japanese firms to compensate some wartime forced laborers.</p>
      <p>As the feud spilled over into trade and security issues, Moon and Abe have not held a summit for more than a year, though they shook hands at a Group of 20 leaders’ meeting in Japan in June.</p>
      <p>Moon sent Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon to Tokyo last month for Emperor Naruhito’s enthronement ceremony with a personal letter calling for efforts to mend ties.</p>
      <p>But there has been little sign of progress, as Abe said the issue of wartime forced labor was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized relations following Japan’s 1910-45 colonial rule.</p>
