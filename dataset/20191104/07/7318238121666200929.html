      <h1>Hungary central bank head says euro a 'strategic error'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T07:48:46+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author">Euronews </a></address>
      <p>European Union member states, both in and outside the euro zone, should admit that the euro has been a "strategic error", the Governor of the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) has said in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times.</p>
      <p>Hungary, which has followed a go-it-alone mix of economic policies since Prime Minister Viktor Orban rose to power in 2010, is not member of the euro zone and does not have a target date for euro adoption.</p>
      <p>The government and the central bank have said Hungary should not join the euro before its economy is sufficiently strong.</p>
      <p>Now NBH Governor Gyorgy Matolcsy said time has come for Europe to "seek a way out of the euro trap".</p>
      <p>"There is a harmful dogma that the euro was the 'normal' next step towards unifying Western Europe.</p>
      <p>But the common European currency was not normal at all, because almost none of the preconditions were met," he said in the opinion piece published on Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Two decades after the euro's launch, most of the necessary pillars of a successful global currency — a common state, a budget covering at least 15-20 percent of the euro zone's total gross domestic product, a euro zone finance minister and a ministry to go with the post — are still missing," he added.</p>
      <p>Matolcsy, who was appointed for a second six-year term as head of the central bank earlier this year, said members should be allowed to leave the euro zone in the coming decades and those remaining should build a "more sustainable global currency".</p>
      <p>He also said the 1992 Maastricht treaty, which sets out the conditions for joining the euro, one of which is keeping the budget deficit below 3% of economic output, should be rewritten.</p>
      <p>Hungary has been running a budget deficit below the EU's 3% ceiling.</p>
      <p>Orban's right-wing nationalist government has also gradually shifted Hungary's debt programme to forint-denominated paper, aiming to reduce its reliance on foreign currency debt.</p>
