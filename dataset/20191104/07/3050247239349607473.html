      <h1>Tron Network Total Accounts Pass 4 Million After Samsung Partnership</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T07:48:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>The total number of accounts generated on blockchain network <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tron">Tron</a> has exceeded 4 million, its CEO has said. </p>
      <h3>4 million active users?</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1191238564052291584">tweet</a> on Nov. 4, monitoring resource TRONSCAN announced that the network’s total account tally was now 4.015 million, a figure which Justin Sun subsequently broadcast.</p>
      <p>The numbers do not distinguish whether an account is in use or dormant, and in the case of the latter, whether the inactivity is likely permanent.</p>
      <p>For Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), different resources measuring active accounts produce varying results. According to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-unique-addresses">Blockchain</a>, there were just over 463,000 daily active Bitcoin addresses as of Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>As such, in Tron’s case, the number of daily active accounts is likely to be smaller than the total created since the network’s inception. Nevertheless, Tron has seen <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nearly-12-of-all-tether-is-now-on-tron-after-100m-chain-swap">millions of Tethers</a> swapped to its blockchain from Ethereum in recent weeks. </p>
      <h3>Samsung price boost</h3>
      <p>Sun has devoted considerable effort to expanding the profile of both Tron and its native token, TRX. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/embattled-tron-creator-sun-apologizes-to-china-in-deleted-social-media-post">reported</a>, those efforts gained him unwanted attention this year after a run-in with Chinese authorities. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, progress continues, with South Korean tech giant <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/samsung">Samsung</a> adding Tron support to its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/samsung-integrates-tron-and-mobile-compatible-dapp-building-tools">decentralized app store</a> at the end of last month. Sun had previously hinted about the move, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/justin-sun-tron-will-partner-with-100b-mega-corporation-next-week">describing</a> it as a deal with a “$100 billion megacorporation.” </p>
      <p><a href="https://coin360.com/coin/tron-trx">TRX</a> is currently the eleventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, trading for just under 2 cents per token. The Samsung deal boosted TRX/USD by over 30%.</p>
      <p>Rumors previously claimed Sun was in line to acquire cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/poloniex">Poloniex</a>, something he subsequently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/im-not-buying-anything-says-tron-ceo-amid-reports-of-poloniex-acquisition">denied</a>.</p>
