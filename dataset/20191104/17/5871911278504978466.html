        <b>Penguins @ Bruins</b>

      <p>
        <b>TD Garden | Boston, MA</b>

      <p>The Penguins ship up to Boston to take on the Atlantic-Division-leading Bruins as part of a 2-game road swing down the East Coast.</p>
      <p>The Penguins will look to right the ship after having lost a tight 2-1 contest to the Oilers in overtime on Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>The Penguins got Evgeni Malkin back as the team continues to get back key players after a rash of tough luck in the injury department. They look to be without Brian Dumoulin tonight, but not due to an ailment, unless you count the <a href="https://twitter.com/PensInsideScoop/status/1191039104718385152?s=20">birth of his family’s first child</a> as an ailment.</p>

      <p>Boston has had an excellent start to the season from all angles, having dropped just 1 game in regulation and collecting 22 of a possible 26 points thus far.</p>
      <p>The play of David Pastrnak (13G+14A=27P, best in the league) has been inspiring yet again for the B’s, who lead the Atlantic Division, and are 3 points back of Washington with 3 games in hand.</p>
      <p>Their +19 goal differential is tied for best in the league (with Vancouver). Their 3.54 G/GP is 6th best in the league, while their 2.00 GA/GP is tops.</p>
      <p>Pastrnak’s 30+% shooting percentage and Boston’s Power Play’s 32.6% conversion rate don’t seem sustainable, but let’s not test that one out.</p>
      <p>Good offense + good defense = good team with good record. Can confirm.</p>
