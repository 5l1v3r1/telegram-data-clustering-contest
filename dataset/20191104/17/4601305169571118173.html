      <p>Archaeologists have found the remnants of a 4,000-year-old "book" in a burial shaft in Dayr al-Barsha, Egypt. The oldest known copy of The Book of Two Ways, the story is related to Osiris, the Egyptian lord of the underworld. From <a href="https://www.brusselstimes.com/all-news/art-culture/76705/rare-document-uncovered-by-egyptologists-at-leuven-university/">The Brussels Times</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>(Katholieke Universiteit Leuven archaeologist) Harco Willems describes the document as a collection of sparse incantations and legendary drawings...<br/><br/>Two curved sinuous lines run through the book. They are interpreted by some researchers as a representation of the two roads that lead the deceased to safety through the dangers of the underworld to a happy life in the afterlife. <br/><br/>Archaeologists found the fragments in a sarcophagus attributed to Ankh, a woman of the family of a governor named Ahanakht.</blockquote>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.dailygrail.com/">The Daily Grail</a> half-joked, "Don’t. Read. The. Incantations. Aloud!"</p>
