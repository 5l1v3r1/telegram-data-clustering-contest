      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:12:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">IANS</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/microsoft">Microsoft </a>on Monday unveiled a new Office app for iOS and Android that combines three most popular apps -- Word, Excel and PowerPoint -- into a single go-to app for mobile productivity.</p>
      <p>The users no longer need to download each app separately, the tech giant announced at its flagship "Ignite" conference.</p>
      <p>"With the new Actions pane, you can intuitively complete a variety of common on-the-go tasks, such as creating and signing PDFs and sharing files between devices," said Jared Spataro, Corporate Vice President for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/microsoft">Microsoft </a>365.</p>
      <p>Launched as a public preview, the Office app is available to Android users through Google Play Store and to iOS users through Apple's TestFlight programme.</p>
      <p>The new Office app uses the unique advantages of mobile devices to make content creation easier. For instance, you can snap the picture of a document and turn it into an editable word file, or transform tables from a printed page to Excel.</p>
      <p>The company also announced the general availability of the all-new Chromium-based <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/microsoft">Microsoft </a>Edge browser set for January 15 release. The all-new Microsoft Edge offers the enterprise new tab page, where users will have direct access to Microsoft 365 files.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Edge is now available across devices, including Windows 10, Windows 8x, Windows 7, macOS, iOS and Android, said the company.</p>
