      <p>Barca wonderkid Riqui Puig has suggested that he is running out of patience at his lack of senior game time this season, and will consider leaving the club if he is not afforded more minutes on the pitch.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old made three appearances for the first team during the 2018/19 campaign, but is yet to feature this time around, instead playing exclusively for the club's reserve side in Spain's third division.</p>
      <p>Puig now wants the situation to be rectified, and hinted that he would consider his options if his demands are not met.</p>

      <p>"No (I won't leave in January), in theory no, but we will see," Puig said, as reported by <i>Mundo Deportivo.</i></p>
      <p>"I haven't closed the door, but it is true that I would like to have more minutes.</p>
      <p>"There are a lot of players (in midfield at Barca), and it is hard for me to have those minutes, and if I don't have them, then I will have a decision to make."</p>
