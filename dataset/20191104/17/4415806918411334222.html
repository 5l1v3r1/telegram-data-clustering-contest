      <h1>Kerry SFC final misses out on TV coverage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:57:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/stephen-barry/" target="_blank">By Stephen Barry</a></address>
      <p>The Kerry SFC final between Dr Crokes and East Kerry won't be televised on Sunday as TG4 prioritise provincial action this weekend.</p>
      <p>Fellow All-Ireland finalists Dublin, Tipperary, and Kilkenny had their finals carried on TG4 in the past fortnight but Kerry's showpiece misses out as their championship comes to a later than usual November finish.</p>
      <p>That means fans wishing to witness David Clifford's side's attempt to prevent Crokes completing a four-in-a-row will have to be present at Austin Stack Park (3pm throw-in) as the live and deferred coverage comes from elsewhere in the country.</p>
      <p>The Munster Club SHC semi-final between reigning champions Ballygunner and Limerick winners Patrickswell gets top billing, with live coverage from Walsh Park starting at 1.15pm.</p>
      <p>Ballygunner hammered Sixmilebridge by 12 points in yesterday's quarter-final, having eased to a sixth consecutive Waterford title last month. Patrickswell, meanwhile, led by 2018 Hurler of the Year Cian Lynch, upset the odds to defeat Na Piarsaigh in the Limerick decider.</p>
      <p>The deferred TV game comes from Tuam Stadium, where All-Ireland champions Corofin will have their three-in-a-row credentials tested by Mayo kingpins Ballintubber.</p>
      <p>For the second consecutive year, Corofin needed a replay to retain their Galway crown (a seventh in a row), beating Tuam Stars by three points. Ballintubber have no shortage of stars, though, with Cillian and Diarmuid O'Connor leading the attack.</p>
      <p>It's a rematch of last year's Connacht final, which ended 2-10 to 1-9 in Corofin's favour.</p>
