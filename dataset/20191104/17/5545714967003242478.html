      <p><i>2K NBA Playgrounds</i>, a modern-day reimagining of <i>NBA Jam</i> but with current players, is being ported to mobile as a free-to-play game. It's currently in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nba.twok.playgrounds.mobile">open beta on Android</a> in select markets.</p>
      <p>It is going to be a microtransaction wasteland. Here's the lineage of <i>2K NBA Playgrounds</i> on mobile: It's an arcadey take on the <i>NBA 2K</i> series, the most prominent and best-selling basketball franchise that has come under intense scrutiny for flagrantly pushing microtransactions; the most recent game in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-nba-2k-playgrounds-2-528847.phtml"><i>2K NBA Playgrounds</i> was slammed</a> for slowing progress unlocking new players to a halt without the assistance of real-life money; and, it's a free-to-play mobile game which are almost always littered with in-app purchases.</p>
      <p>But hey, if you're cool with grinding out card packs (or forking over some cash for them), <i>2K NBA Playgrounds</i> might be your thing. The beta will presumably come to more regions soon enough, followed by a proper release on both iOS and Android somewhere down the road.</p>
