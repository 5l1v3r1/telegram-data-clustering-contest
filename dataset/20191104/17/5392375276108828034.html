      <p>Xu Wenwei said that Huawei maintains its innovative vitality and competitiveness through long-term and sustained R&amp;D investment. In 2018, Huawei’s R&amp;D invested exceeded $15 billion.

      <p>The Huawei executive has also mentioned that as early as 1996, it was explicitly required that the cost of pre-research must account for more than 10% of R&amp;D expenses. Now, it is required to increase to more than 20%. This means that it is worth 2 to 3 billion US dollars per year. Moreover, it is invested in cutting-edge and basic technology research.</p>
      <p>When talking about cooperation with Europe to build a smart future, Xu Wenwei introduced that Huawei is joining forces with European operators to deploy ultra-high-speed, low-latency 5G networks, and to link the European continent through advanced technologies such as 5G to enable the digital transformation of European industries.</p>
      <p>Huawei respects and supports the EU’s digital sovereignty strategy. Also, it strives to implement open AI, intelligent computing systems, and deep learning systems in Europe. With this, the China-based company is trying to provide European companies with innovative platforms and resources.</p>
