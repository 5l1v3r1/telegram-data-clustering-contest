      <p>LONDON: Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino hinted the club may appeal against Son Heung-min's red card following the horrific injury suffered by Everton's Andre Gomes in the 1-1 draw on Sunday (Nov 3).</p>
      <p>Pochettino - whose side were denied a first away win in the league since January with a late stoppage time equaliser from Cenk Tosun - blamed VAR for the red card as Son had been initially just booked.</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old Portuguese international's injury - a fracture dislocation to his right ankle which he will have surgery on Monday - occurred as his momentum from Son's trip saw him crash into Spurs defender Serge Aurier.</p>
      <p>Pochettino - whose side remain in the bottom half in 11th place with 13 points from their first 11 games - expressed his sorrow for Gomes but said a visibly distressed Son had not intended to provoke such an injury.</p>
      <p>"It was clear it was never the intention of Son to create the problem that happened afterwards," said Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"It is unbelievable to see a red card. In that situation we need to help because the decision of the referee was a yellow card but the VAR changed the decision.</p>
      <p>"It is the latest example of it being not clear. VAR needs to check if it was a bad tackle from Son and judge the action, not what happened after.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what will happen now (in terms of an appeal). The club will see if it is possible but what we cannot change is what happened after (the incident)."</p>
      <p>The Premier League issued a statement after the game to clarify why the card had been upgraded, in which it said: "The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge."</p>
      <p>Pochettino expressed his gratitude in the way the Everton players handled the incident and especially the behaviour of the captain Seamus Coleman, who suffered a similar injury in March 2017.</p>
      <p>"The players from Everton were fantastic," said Pochettino. "The captain came to the dressing room to console Son.</p>
      <p>"I want to say thank you to the players and Coleman, who came in on behalf of the squad of Everton."</p>
      <p>Tosun said he and his team-mates could not understand what Gomes was saying.</p>
      <p>"Everybody is sad inside. Some players, they nearly cried," said the Turkey international.</p>
      <p>"He was in shock, his eyes were open so big. He was like crying, shouting and screaming.</p>
      <p>"I just tried to hold him and speak to him. I tried to tell him to stay calm. We couldn't understand him."</p>
      <p>Gomes has received plenty of messages of support, ranging from players in the Portugal national team to his former team-mates at Barcelona. Among Premier League players, Dele Alli, who scored Tottenham's goal in the match.</p>
