      <p>Nigel Farage has unveiled 600 Brexit Party candidates for Britain's general election and warned the governing Conservatives that the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> will never leave the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> without his party's backing.</p>
      <p>All seats in the 650-seat House of Commons are up for grabs in the December 12 election. Farage says his party will run in every constituency in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/england.html">England</a>, Scotland and Wales unless Conservative Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/boris-johnson.html">Boris Johnson</a> scraps his EU divorce deal.</p>
      <p>Farage's party, which was founded earlier this year, rejects Johnson's <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a> deal, preferring to leave the bloc with no agreement on future relations in what it calls a "clean-break" Brexit.</p>
      <p>Farage said Monday that Johnson's deal "is not Brexit. It is a sell-out."</p>
      <p>Farage says the Conservatives are arrogant for not joining him in a "leave alliance".Â </p>
