      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:58:18+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Tom Hitchenor, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A talented <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/teenagers">teenage</a> rugby player nearly died after her flu-like symptoms turned out to be signs of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">sepsis</a> .</p>
      <p>Jemima Moss, 17, said goodbye to her best friend after suffering multiple organ failure in hospital.</p>
      <p>She was dashed there after collapsing at home when her heart rate became dangerously high.</p>
      <p>Jemima, who plays for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/worcester-warriors">Worcester Warriors</a> Women, spent a week in intensive care on life support after doctors found the symptoms were those of sepsis.</p>
      <p>Sepsis is a vile disease, which kills 52,000 people in the UK each year alone.</p>
      <p>But Jemima, a back-row forward, managed to pull through and incredibly was back playing rugby six months later.</p>
      <p>"I remember this sad moment with my best friend, Evie, when one time I was weaned off life support but slipped back under (consciousness)," Jemima said.</p>

      <p>“My family and Evie and her mum, Rachel, were there and as they were walking out I remember saying goodbye to Evie.</p>
      <p>“I was holding her hand and not wanting to let her go and my sister was there as well and everyone was really upset.</p>
      <p>“They told me that I asked them if I would wake up again, which was the saddest bit for them.”</p>
      <p>The teenager was taken off life support on GCSE Results Day on August 23 last year after doctors feared she'd die.</p>

      <p>It was first suggested the sepsis may have been caused by a bacterial infection she picked up while in South Africa on holiday earlier that summer but tests haven't proven this.</p>
      <p>Now Jemima, Worcester Warriors and UK Sepsis Trust want to raise awareness of the disease.</p>
      <p>The young athlete said she first thought her symptoms were as a result of "overdoing it" in training.</p>
      <p>She said: “I had rugby few training a couple of days before I fell ill.</p>
      <p>"I thought I'd overdone it because it was my first time training was with Worcester Warriors so felt a bit tired.</p>
      <p>“I was due to meet my friends, but felt sick so I had a bath and put myself to bed. That's where it really started.</p>
      <p>“Over the next few days, I just got progressively worse. I couldn't move. If I go out of bed, I would just collapse.</p>
      <p>“I couldn't make it to the toilet or to the bathroom so I was just in the bed feeling awful.</p>
      <p>“One night, it worsened. I was lying in my bed awake all night. I had a fan and water spray to cool me down.</p>
      <h3>Sepsis: The facts</h3>
      <p>■ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">Sepsis</a> affects 250,000 people in the UK and kills 44,000 per year. That’s more than bowel, breast and prostate cancer and road accidents combined.</p>
      <p>■ Sepsis is the body’s often deadly response to an infection.</p>
      <p>■ Initially, it can look like flu or a chest infection, but it can swiftly get serious.</p>
      <p>■ Seek medical help urgently if you develop any one of the following…</p>
      <p>– are lethargic or difficult to wake</p>
      <p>– feel abnormally cold to touch</p>
      <p>– the skin looks mottled, bluish or pale</p>
      <p>– are breathing very fast</p>
      <p>– have a rash that does not fade when you press it</p>
      <p>– have a fit or convulsion</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I tried to get to mum's room but I collapsed and my parents said they heard a big thump. My mum came like running into my room wondering what was wrong."</p>
      <p>Worcester Warriors are holding a special fixture for Sepsis Awareness Day on December 1 at Sixways Stadium in the city.</p>
      <p>Jemima's dad Andy, an international sports event manager, said: “One of the keys to being aware of sepsis is that it started like a cold.</p>
      <p>“Her mum just felt it was a cold and she was in bed and then it sort of got worse to be like the flu.</p>
      <p>“It went from just having a cold, fever and being a bit weak. It escalated really quickly. Being aware of those first symptoms really important.”</p>
