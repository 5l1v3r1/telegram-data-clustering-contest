      <h2>Mediaeval home is located in Lavenham, England </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:25:15+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Chelsea Ritschel</a></address>
      <p>If you used to fantasise about living among wizardkind and one day receiving your Hogwarts acceptance letter, you can now live out your dream in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a>’s childhood home. </p>
      <p>While it doesn’t promise a run-in with He Who Must Not Be Named, Muggles can now <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rent">rent</a> the cottage where Lily and James Potter lived with their son before they were murdered.  </p>
      <p>The home, which is available to rent on <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/35058633?adults=1&amp;check_in=2019-11-22&amp;check_out=2019-11-24&amp;children=0&amp;infants=0&amp;source_impression_id=p3_1572878539_8T1%2FT5Oy5diaZE42">Airbnb</a>, is not actually located in Godric’s Hollow, but rather the village of Lavenham in the English county of Suffolk.</p>
      <p>And although it is not really where the Potters lost their lives protecting their only son, the De Vere <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/house">House</a> is famous in its own right - as it used to be a former Five Star and Gold Award bed and breakfast. </p>
      <p>The listing itself is for just two guests, who will stay in a private one-bedroom room with a shared bathroom, a private sitting room and a courtyard garden for £110 ($142) per night. </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/airbnb">Airbnb</a> listing, Lavenham is “reputedly Britain’s finest mediaeval village” and features more than 300 protected heritage properties. </p>
      <p>However, the town also boasts all the amenities one could want, including an art gallery, restaurants, a mediaeval church, craft and antique shops, museums, and tennis courts. </p>
      <p>Despite not being the birthplace of both Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore, the house has received five-star reviews from its previous guests. </p>
      <p>It is also in high-demand, according to Airbnb, which states that 825 users have checked out the listing over the last week. </p>
      <p>But, if Hagrid’s Hut is more your taste, you can also spend the night in a holiday home <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/harry-potter-hagrid-hut-cottage-holiday-rent-stay-a8887871.html">inspired</a> by the Hogwarts gamekeeper’s house. </p>
