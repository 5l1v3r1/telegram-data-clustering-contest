      <p>PORTAGE, Wis. - An Indiana truck driver found guilty of <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/crews-respond-to-report-of-crash-on-i-3990-in-columbia-county/745338901">slamming into a school bus loaded with students</a> last May will be sentenced Monday afternoon. </p>
      <p>Wayne Murphy, 43, was found guilty of 30 of the 46 counts he was charged with, including five felony counts for injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle and an additional five felony counts of second-degree reckless injury. </p>
      <p>Dozens of students were injured, five seriously, when Murphy hit the school bus that was parked on the shoulder of the interstate.</p>
      <p>The Milwaukee-area middle school students were heading to the Wisconsin Dells for a field trip. </p>
      <p>Authorities said they found prescription drugs in Murphy's system at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>A Wisconsin State trooper testified that Murphy admitted to taking more medication than he was prescribed and another truck driver called to <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/trial-underway-for-indiana-truck-driver-accused-of-crashing-into-packed-school-bus/1108569528">report Murphy's erratic driving</a> before the crash. </p>
      <p>A truck investigator said there was <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/day-3-of-murphy-trial-inspector-testifies-no-malfunction-of-semi/1109408670">nothing wrong with the truck</a> that would've caused Murphy to lose control. </p>
      <p>The four-day trial ended in August, with a presentence investigation report expected within 60 days </p>
      <p>The prosecuting attorney has requested the victims be allowed to appear at the sentencing hearing via video from the Milwaukee County Courthouse. </p>
