      <h1>McDonald's chief people officer David Fairhurst leaves</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T17:25:04+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author">Leslie Patton and Lisa Wolfson</a></address>
      <p>McDonald’s Corp. announced another senior executive departure on Monday: Global Chief People Officer David Fairhurst.</p>
      <p>No reason was given for the exit, according to an internal memo sent Monday by new Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski. Fairhurst had been with the restaurant chain for 15 years.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s is losing one of its top people managers amid a high-profile battle with labour groups, who say the company has tolerated workplace harassment and ignored safety issues.</p>
      <p>Ex-CEO Steve Easterbrook had promoted Fairhurst to the top human resources job shortly after he took the reins of the company in 2015.</p>
