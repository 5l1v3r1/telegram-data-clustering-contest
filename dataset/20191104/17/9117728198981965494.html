        <b>Guenther Steiner was left frustrated by Haas' pace on Sunday at the United States Grand Prix as Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen got nowhere near the points, finishing 15 and 18th respectively. Steiner has suffered a tough year with Haas struggling all season and he says that the team need to stay positive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Haas look destined to finish the season in ninth in the constructors' standings, their worst performance since joining F1 in 2016. The team are just seven points adrift of Alfa Romeo, but having scored just two points in eight races, it looks unlikely that Haas will change their position.</p>
      <p>Steiner said after the weekend: <i>"Obviously, it's a disappointing result, but it didn't come unexpected. We know where we are at the moment, and it's not where we want to be.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We start the race then we just begin to go backwards, we just haven't got enough performance in the car. Kevin (Magnussen) retired with two laps to go, we think it was something with the brake system. We need to investigate but we haven't had the car back yet.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"There are two more races to go and we just need to keep our heads up. We'll hopefully try and get a little bit out of it."    </i>                                                                           </p>
