        <b>Pierre Gasly was unfortunate to miss out on the points during Sunday's United States Grand Prix after making late contact with Sergio Perez and breaking his suspension, having run in the points for most of the race.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly has performed admirably since his return to Toro Rosso, scoring points in four of the seven races since his drop from Aston Martin Red Bull Racing.</p>

      <p>The Frenchman was running in the lower points paying positions for most of the race before contact with the Racing Point ended his afternoon.</p>
      <p>He said after the race:Â <i>"It was a really good race as we were running in the top 10 for most of it and keeping pace with the McLarens. In the end I started to fight with Sergio and we made contact in Turn 13 which broke the front right suspension, so we had to retire the car.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"We were fighting, he went down the inside of Turn 13 then we touched with my front right tyre which bent the suspension. I don't think it was anything big, but it was enough to put me out of the points and end our race. It's disappointing to end this way after a strong weekend."</i>
