      <p>In a bid to reduce air pollution, the Bihar Government has taken a decision to prohibit plying of 15-year-old vehicles in the state.</p>
      <p>Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar said that the decision will be applicable to the government and commercial vehicles. The decision will come into force from Tuesday.</p>
      <p>However, 15-year-old private vehicles have been exempted but Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nitish-kumar">Nitish Kumar </a>said that they will have to undergo fitness test again.</p>
      <p>Emphasising on reducing pollution from stubble burning, Kumar said that those farmers who will burn straw will not get the agricultural subsidy.</p>
      <p>He also asked officials to investigate if the brick kiln is using the latest technique to control pollution.</p>
      <p>Several parts of North India including cities in Bihar are reeling under the effect of deteriorating air quality after Diwali.</p>
