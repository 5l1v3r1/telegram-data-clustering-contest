      <p>Schubert's Lullaby and love - this is the perfect way to put your baby to bed, even if your baby is a small white duck. The duckling from the video can't resist sleeping after the owner started scratching its neck and head. We can see the little bird nuzzling against the hooman's arm, smiling and slowly closing its eyes toÂ enter the dream world.</p>
