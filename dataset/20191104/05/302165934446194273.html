      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 4 — The Penang state government will remain firm in its stand to support vernacular schools, Deputy Chief Minister II P. Ramasamy (DAP — Perai) said today.</p>
      <p>He said the state will not change its stance even if the federal government was to decide to abolish vernacular schools.</p>
      <p>“We do not agree that vernacular schools are the cause of disunity as the issues about unity is more complicated than the existence of vernacular schools,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that it was not new that some parties are raising this issue of abolishing vernacular schools due to their respective political agenda.</p>
      <p>“In reality, Chinese and Tamil schools are not a threat to unity as these schools consist of various races,” he said in reply to an oral question by Satees Muniandy (DAP — Bagan Dalam) at the state legislative assembly.</p>
      <p>He said there were a total of 3,552 students of all races, other than ethnic Chinese and Indians, studying in vernacular schools in Penang.</p>
      <p>“This showed that the vernacular schools are a platform to develop the spirit of unity among people of all races,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said recently, he visited a Chinese school with 600 students and 100 of the students are Malay students.</p>
      <p>“Nationally, we can see an increase of between 15 and 20 per cent of non-Chinese students in Chinese vernacular schools,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said there were also ethnic Indians attending Chinese vernacular schools.</p>
      <p>“This goes to show that all these calls to abolish vernacular schools are due to politics,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the issue of unity and efforts to unite the people should be looked at from another angle instead of blaming it on vernacular schools.</p>
      <p>“It is a larger issue than vernacular schools, we are talking about the people’s thinking,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the state government has continued to provide cash aid to all schools in Penang including the vernacular schools.</p>
      <p>“This year, the state channeled RM8.4 million to mission schools, Chinese schools and private schools while another RM2 million to Tamil schools,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the state government also channeled funds to Islamic schools by allocating RM2.5 million to Sekolah Agama Rakyat that included Maahad Tahfiz, Muslim kindergartens and pondok schools.</p>
      <p>“Starting from this year, 170 national primary and secondary schools also received allocation of RM3 million to conduct repair and renovation works on school infrastructure,” he said.</p>
