      <h1>Rudy Boesch, <i>Survivor</i> Star and Oldest Contestant, Dead at 91</h1>

      <p>According to <i>People</i>, Rudy Boesch, star of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/survivor/"><i>Survivor</i></a>’s premiere season and the series’ eldest contest to date, <a href="https://people.com/tv/survivor-contestant-rudy-boesch-dies/">has died</a> at the age of 91 following a battle with Alzheimer’s disease. Prior to his late-in-life turn in the limelight, Boesch was a United States Navy SEAL, becoming one of the first members of the special-ops team in 1962, and eventually becoming the longest-serving SEAL team member on active duty. In 1990, Boesch retired after 45 years in the Navy. Ten years later, he joined host <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/jeff-probst/">Jeff Probst</a> and his 15 fellow contestants in CBS’s <i>Survivor: Bornea</i>. Boesch came in third to winner/infamous reality-show villain Richard Hatch. In 2004, Boesch bested himself to set a new age standard for <i>Survivor</i> contestants, competing in <i>Survivor: All-Stars</i> on Panama’s Pearl Islands at the age of 75.</p>
