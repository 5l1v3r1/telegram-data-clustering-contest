      <p>Lille (France) (AFP) - Yvette Lundy, a Resistance hero who helped Jews escape occupied France, survived the horrors of Nazi concentration camps and went on to teach reconciliation, has died aged 103, authorities said Sunday.</p>
      <p>The youngest of seven children from a farming family in the champagne-growing region around Epernay, Lundy was a schoolteacher during the occupation and also worked at the town hall, a key job that allowed her to join a resistance network known as the Possum Escape Line.</p>
      <p>From 1940, she supplied fake papers to Jews, men fleeing the Nazis' forced labour programme -- the STO -- in Germany, and escaped prisoners of war, who were hidden by her brother Georges at his farm.</p>
      <p>But the Gestapo caught up with her in June 1944, arresting Lundy, then 28, at her school.</p>
      <p>She would be interned at Ravensbrueck some 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Berlin, the only camp reserved for women and children.</p>
      <p>Lundy would never forget the dehumanisation she experienced there from the very beginning, when she was forced to undress in front of SS officers.</p>
      <p>"The body is naked and the brain is suddenly in tatters. You're like a hole, a hole full of emptiness, and if you look around it's more emptiness," Lundy said.</p>
      <p>The ordeal would last nearly a year until Lundy was assigned to a Kommando slave labour unit near Weimar -- liberated by the Russian army in April 1945.</p>
      <p>"Still today, I think of the camp at one point each day... often at night before I fall asleep," Lundy told AFP in 2017.</p>
      <p>On the occasion of her 100th birthday that year, she was elevated to the Legion of Honour's second-highest level, that of Grand Officer.</p>
      <p>Mayor of Epernay Franck Leroy said on Facebook that Lundy had "represented the honour of France during the darkest hours of our history".</p>
      <p>It was nearly 15 years before she began to speak out about her experiences, giving talks to French as well as German students.</p>
      <p>Leroy praised her "incredible commitment to the duty of remembrance".</p>
      <p>She "also had a viewpoint on war and notably on Franco-German reconciliation which she saw as extremely important", he told AFP.</p>
