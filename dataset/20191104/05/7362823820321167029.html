      <h1>Trump wants Republicans to release their own accounts from impeachment probe</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whistleblower-gop-questions-lawyer-nunes-schiff">President Trump</a> on Sunday urged Republicans privy to last week's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-intelligence-committee-report-on-fisa-abuses">House Intelligence Committee </a>hearings to come forward with their own transcripts from the closed-door meetings that Democrats claim bolstered their claim for impeachment.</p>
      <p>Trump also appeared to suggest that he has information that a recent witness, Lt. Col.  Alexander Vindman, is a “Never-Trumper.” He was asked about any evidence he may have about Vindman and he responded,  “We’ll be showing that to you real soon.”</p>

      <p>The president is under an impeachment investigation over allegedly withholding millions in defense funding from Ukraine in order for Kiev to investigate the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-responds-to-bidens-60-minutes-interview-takes-swipe-at-hunter">Bidens’ business relationships in the country.</a></p>
      <p>"If Shifty Adam Schiff, who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the “call,” is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers &amp; others that are &amp; were interviewed, he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes: Republicans should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiff’s manipulated propaganda," he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Trump's tweet alluded to the July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky that the whistleblower referred to as “frightening.” Trump also attacked Schiff over his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6tqdkDsFt4">inaccurate, exaggerated version</a> of a transcript of the call. Trump has said in the past that Schiff may have had a "mental breakdown" and may have committed a crime. Schiff himself later apologetically acknowledged it was a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mccarthy-signs-on-to-resolution-to-censure-schiff-for-parody-reading-of-ukraine-call">"parody.</a>"</p>
      <p>Trump has suggested that the impeachment investigation is simply another attempt by Democrats to damage his presidency after the Mueller report fell short.</p>
      <p>Democrats point to recent closed-door testimony as evidence of unscrupulous dealings between the Trump administration and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Vindman, in prepared remarks, wrote: “I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government’s support of Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>He added, “Following the call, I... reported my concerns to NSC’s lead counsel,” a reference to top NSC lawyer John A. Eisenberg.</p>
      <p>Both Trump and Zelensky deny any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Vindman testified in a closed-door hearing about his concerns about the president’s phone call and a prior meeting with Ambassador Gordon Sondland about investigating Joe Biden and his son.</p>
      <p>Gen. Joe Dunford, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave a full-throated endorsement of Vindman citing his honesty, patriotism and integrity. “He’s just a guy doing his job,” Dunford told Fox News.</p>

      <p>He went on to say that Vindman was “professional, competent, patriotic and a loyal officer. He’s made an extraordinary contribution in peacetime and in combat.”</p>
