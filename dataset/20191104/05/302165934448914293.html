      <p>Chua decided to put a smile on the old folks’ faces by inviting them to his birthday party at a coffeeshop-bistro named 73 Hillcrest.</p>
      <p>The news was shared on Singaporean non-profit foundation Happy People Helping People’s Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HappyPeopleHelpingPeople/posts/1679477398856007">page</a>.</p>
      <p>Chua also gave each senior citizen an angpow, red packets containing money are usually handed out during auspicious occasions such as weddings, birthdays and Chinese New Year.</p>
      <p>The non-profit foundation thanked the restaurant’s staff and volunteers for helping with the event and spending time with the 36 elderly guests to make them feel special.</p>

      <p>According to Happy People Helping People, a cardboard collector known as Ms Koh who hails from Bedok was moved to tears by Chua’s generous gesture.</p>
      <p>Koh told the non-profit foundation that the angpow packet she received from him would help ease some living expenses.</p>
      <p>“She told me she can use the money to buy pampers for herself and her foster mother who is already very old and sickly,” the Facebook post said.</p>
      <p>The post, which was shared on Friday, was met with positive reactions from social media users who praised Mr Chua for his kindness and generosity.</p>
