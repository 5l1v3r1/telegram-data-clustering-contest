      <p>The goals were his 13th, 14th and 15th of the league season, making him the Serie A's top goalscorer behind team mate Gabriel Barbosa.</p>
      <p>Mateus Vital scored with a header to pull one back for Corinthians seven minutes into the second half but substitute Vitinho restored Flamengo's three-goal cushion midway through the second period with a fierce shot from outside the box.</p>
      <p>The win extended Flamengo's unbeaten run under Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus to 21 games and kept them eight points clear of second-placed Palmeiras at the top of the Serie A.</p>
