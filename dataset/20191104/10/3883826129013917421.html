        <b>Sir Andy Murray's wife Kim has given birth to their third child, a boy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The baby, described by his grandmother Judy Murray as a "lovely, happy, healthy baby boy", was born last week in London, where the family live.</p>
      <p>Sir Andy and Kim, both aged 32, married in the tennis star's hometown of Dunblane in 2015.</p>
      <p>They already have two daughters, Sophia, who was born in 2016, and Edie, born in 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Scotland's Mornings with Kaye Adams programme, Sir Andy's mother Judy said: "It's lovely news, lovely to have a little boy to go with the two little girls."</p>
      <p>She said baby was born "a few days ago" and added: "I'll leave it to Andy and Kim to fill in all the details."</p>

      <p>The three-time Grand Slam champion <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/50117953">Murray won his first singles title</a> since career-saving hip surgery by beating Stan Wawrinka at the European Open in October.</p>
      <p>He had surgery in January and was playing in just his seventh tournament since returning to singles.</p>
      <p>After the tournament he joked: "I'll have three kids under four years old. When I've been off the tour my family has got bigger so I need to get back on the road so we don't get out of control!</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for the third kid. My wife's been a huge support for getting me back on the court and making me fight to keep playing."</p>
      <p>Sir Andy is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/50125113">representing Great Britain in the Davis Cup</a>, which starts on 18 November.</p>
