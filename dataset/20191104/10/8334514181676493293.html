      <p>DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/RYA.I">RYA.I</a>) is to ask competition authorities to force British Airways owner IAG (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ICAG.L">ICAG.L</a>) to make divestments as part of its purchase of Air Europa, chief executive Michael O’Leary said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I think it is a good deal for IAG, for Willie Walsh. I think it is a bad deal from a competition point of view,” O’Leary said on a conference call with analysts.</p>
      <p>“It is a merger to monopoly in Madrid and I think we would certainly be looking for the competition authorities to require some competition divestments, particularly in the Air Europa short-haul,” he said.</p>
