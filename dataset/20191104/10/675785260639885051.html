      <p>A 12-year-old girl called police in tears after her mum overdosed on heroin while driving the family car.</p>
      <p>Tiffany Smith, 28, of Deltona, Florida, was pulled over while driving on a major road with three kids in her vehicle last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Her sobbing daughter called 911 begging for help as she tried to make sure the vehicle was parked properly on a grass verge.</p>
      <p>“My mom won’t wake up and we’re on I-4 in the car!" she said.</p>
      <p>“I put it in “N” because I don’t know how to put it in ‘Park,’" the girl added, according to Volusia County Sheriff's Office.</p>
      <p>The 12-year-old was with her two brothers, aged seven and one, and two dogs, when her mother overdosed in the vehicle.</p>

      <p>Emergency services arrived at the scene at around 7pm and found the woman unconscious, according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10272527/mum-overdose-heroin-car-florida-girl-911/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>Smith got a shot of Narcan, a spray used to treat overdoses, and later recovered consciousness in an ambulance, the force said as it released bodycam footage of the incident.</p>
      <p>“I honestly took heroin because my back was hurting,” Smith told an officer while on a stretcher in the back of the ambulance, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/florida-mom-ods-on-heroin-in-car-with-3-kids-on-highway/?fbclid=IwAR0wyAQ8b8I3n4VMhtmrtToXTrlSsRAj8Uv4uGmuWlHRhD1QxaQ2559W5nE">The New York Post</a> reports.</p>
      <p>“Heroin? Is that something you should be taking for your back?” an officer asked her.</p>
      <p>“It’s not,” Smith mumbled, adding: “But I had no painkiller and my back was hurting and I was making a five-hour trip.”</p>

      <p>The woman was charged with child neglect but was not immediately jailed as she was treated at a hospital in Orange City.</p>
      <p>She was said to be in a stable condition, according to a statement.</p>
      <p>The three children were not injured and were placed in the custody of their grandmother, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>Volusia County Animal Control officers took the two dogs, investigators added.</p>
