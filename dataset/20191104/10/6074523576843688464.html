      <h1>FATF Releases Guidance on Global Digital IDs as Use Cases Grow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:00:05+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Pan</a></address>
      <p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) wants financial institutions to prepare for the global expansion of digital identification systems.</p>
      <p>FATF published its <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfrecommendations/documents/consultation-digital-id-guidance.html">draft guidance</a> on digital identity Thursday, for governments, regulated entities and other stakeholders to enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing terrorism (CFT) regulations.</p>
      <p>The intergovernmental organization aims to address emerging security and transparency issues as the process of financial transactions become more digital, according to the guidance.</p>
      <p>On its website, FATF listed a number of questions acting as “areas of focus,” requesting private stakeholders to provide feedback via email by Nov. 29, 2019.</p>
      <p>The areas include the specific risks digital ID might pose to AML/CFT enforcement; how it might support financial inclusion; how a system might aid in transaction monitoring; and the potential impact on implementing FATF’s record-keeping requirements.</p>
      <p>Notably, the guidance specifically lists distributed ledger technology (DLT) as a tool that can aid in the growth of digital ID networks. A number of blockchain companies have already set their eyes on this particular area, such as Civic.</p>
      <p>In its guidance, FATF called on authorities to “develop clear guidelines or regulations allowing the appropriate, risk-based use of reliable, independent digital ID systems by entities regulated for AML/CFT purposes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, FATF suggests regulated institutions, such as cryptocurrency exchanges (referred to as virtual asset service providers, or VASPs), “take an informed risk-based approach to relying on digital ID systems for Customer Due Diligence.”</p>
      <p>The 77-page draft guidance details many issues related to digital ID systems, including their reliability and independence, and how they might be used in performing customer due diligence.</p>
      <p>The draft guidance is also part of FATF’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-joins-bis-in-calling-stablecoins-global-risk-citing-money-laundering-concerns">effort</a> to the money laundering and terrorist financing risks due to the rise of stablecoins across international financial systems.</p>
      <p>The organization stressed the importance of digital identity in payment systems, which could be used to identify stakeholders in stablecoin-related transactions.</p>
      <p>FATF has been increasingly <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/its-fatfs-way-or-the-highway-for-crypto-exchanges-thats-a-big-mistake">active</a> in the blockchain space this year. In June, the organization published its guidance for crypto exchanges and other VASPs, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fatf-crypto-travel-rule">urging</a> countries to implement strict KYC protocols around the transfer of digital assets.</p>
