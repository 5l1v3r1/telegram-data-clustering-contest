      <p>(Reuters) - Takeaway.com (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TKWY.AS">TKWY.AS</a>) has changed its line of attack in the battle to buy food delivery ordering service Just Eat (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JE.L">JE.L</a>), effectively lowering the threshold for approval of its offer as it seeks to fend off rival suitor Prosus PRX.AS.</p>

      <p>Just Eat had previously agreed on the terms of a 4.7 billion pound ($6.1 billion) all-share deal that prompted internet giant Prosus to weigh in with an unsolicited cash offer of $6.3 billion, or 710 pence per share, setting an increasingly fractious contest in motion.</p>
      <p>A merger of Takeaway and Just Eat would create one of the biggest food delivery groups outside China, rivaling Uber Eats (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/UBER.N">UBER.N</a>), with market leadership in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada.</p>
      <p>The value of Takeaway’s offer has declined since it was announced Aug. 5, dented by a drop in its share price and a strengthening of the pound against the euro.</p>
      <p>At its current share price of 72.45 euros, Takeaway’s offer is valued at 607 pence per share, equating to about $5.3 billion.</p>
      <p>Takeaway announced on Monday that it had changed the structure of its takeover attempt from a scheme of arrangement that needed 75% approval by both sets of shareholders to a formal offer that requires 75% of Just Eat shareholders to give the nod.</p>
      <p>If the Takeover panel agrees, that could drop as low as 50% plus one share.</p>
      <p>“With this switch, we provide additional deal certainty to the Just Eat shareholders,” said Takeaway CEO Jitse Groen.</p>
      <p>Just Eat’s board unanimously recommended its shareholders accept the Takeaway offer.</p>
      <p>Takeaway spokesman Joris Wilton said the new structure gives the company “increased flexibility” in the fight, including the possibility that the deal could be allowed to go through with a bare majority of 50%.</p>
      <p>Shares in Just Eat rose 0.5% to 740 pence, significantly above the Prosus offer, suggesting that investors expect a higher bid from one side or the other.</p>
      <p>Takeaway spokesman Wilton said the change to the structure would not affect the company’s ability to raise its bid or add a cash component but declined to comment on whether it planned to do either.</p>
      <p>Prosus representatives declined comment.</p>
      <p>Just Eat said it continues to recommend its shareholders back the Takeaway deal, adding that Monday’s change means shareholders have a “clear choice” between two binding options.</p>
      <p>The change also means that a planned Dec. 4 shareholder vote on the original agreement has been put on hold. Takeaway will instead launch a tender offer in the next two weeks with expiry likely to be before the end of the year, Wilton said.</p>
      <p>“All eyes will be on whether Prosus increases its offer,” Credit Suisse analysts said.</p>
      <p>The takeover battle heated up last month after Cat Rock accused German rival Delivery Hero (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/DHER.DE">DHER.DE</a>), which is 22% owned by Prosus, of selling down its 13% stake in Takeaway to suppress the value of the shares and lower the attractiveness of Takeaway’s offer.</p>
      <p>Delivery Hero has denied the accusation and on Monday reiterated that its stake disposal had been planned before it had any knowledge of Takeaway’s offer for Just Eat.</p>
