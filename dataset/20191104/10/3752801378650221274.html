      <p>Bolivia's government accused its rivals on Sunday of plotting deadly violence against it after an opposition figure vowed to oust leftist President Evo Morales and called for the military's support.</p>
      <p>Deadly unrest has gripped the South American country since Morales was named winner of the October 20 election for a fourth term.</p>

          <b>Dozens wounded in clashes as Bolivia election protests enters second week</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>His opponents have branded the result a fraud, and Carlos Mesa, who ran against Morales in the recent polls, has called for a new vote to be held.</p>
      <p>"We believe... that the best solution to this crisis in the current circumstances is a new election, administered by an impartial new (electoral body) and with rigorous observation of the international community," Mesa said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Late on Saturday, a conservative opposition leader in the eastern Santa Cruz region threatened to drive Morales out.</p>
      <p>"He has 48 hours to step down, because at 19:00 (23:00 GMT) on Monday, we are going to take decisive action right here and we are going to make sure that he goes," Luis Fernando Camacho told a gathering of supporters.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bloodshed</b>
      </p>
      <p>He called on the military to "be on the side of the people".</p>
      <p>Morales responded by accusing his opponents of seeking bloodshed.</p>
      <p>"They want people to be killed by the police and the military," he said in a televised interview.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Carlos Romero alleged a "coup strategy" was under way.</p>
      <p>He told reporters the government had intelligence "indicating that a violent confrontation is being prepared" for Monday night near the presidential palace in La Paz.</p>
      <p>"Whoever asks for military intervention is asking for blood and is asking for death," Romero said.</p>
      <p>Camacho did not specify what kind of action he had in mind. His supporters have previously taken over public buildings.</p>
      <p>The military has so far stayed neutral in the electoral dispute but calling on it to intervene is a delicate move in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>The country saw numerous military uprisings and dictatorships before civilian rule was established in 1982.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fourth term</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morales is looking to remain in power until 2025 with a fourth term.</p>
      <p>His election win was ratified by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal - but only after an abrupt and unexplained shift in the vote count in his favour.</p>
      <p>The Organization of American States is carrying out an audit of the vote. The opposition has rejected that as a distraction to help Morales hold on to power.</p>
      <p>Bolivia's constitution limits a president to two successive terms. But the constitutional court authorised Morales to stand for a fourth mandate.</p>
      <p>The court, like the election tribunal, is made up of members appointed by Morales's Movement for Socialism.</p>
      <p>The interior minister last week said two demonstrators were killed in clashes. State authorities say 140 people have been hurt in the unrest.</p>
      <p>Unrest has also erupted in recent weeks in other Latin American countries, including neighbouring Chile and Ecuador where protesters are angry at economic hardship.</p>
