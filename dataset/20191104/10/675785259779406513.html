      <h1>Jose Mourinho aimed dig at Arsenal fans - and it could cost him getting Unai Emery's job</h1>
      <h2>Previous comments Jose Mourinho made about Arsenal could go against him and rule him out of the running</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T10:01:33+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been linked with the Arsenal job as pressure continues to build on current manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>But previous comments Mourinho made about the north London club could go against the Portuguese, and rule him out of the running.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> board has given Emery reassurances that he is not in immediate danger of being sacked despite the club's poor form in the league.</p>
      <p>But a handful of names have been linked to the top job at the Emirates in recent weeks, including Mourinho, Mikel Arteta and Massimiliano Allegri.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, it seems, is at the front of the queue, but he hasn't always seen eye to eye with Gunners supporters - and this may prove problematic.</p>

      <p>Back in 2017 Mourinho's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> were beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>After the match an irritated Mourinho took a pop at the Gunners fans.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese said: "I'm happy for them. It's the first time I leave and they're happy. I leave Highbury, they were crying.</p>
      <p>"I leave the Emirates and they were crying, walking the streets with heads low. Today they leave with their scarves."</p>

      <p>He also added: "It's a big club. You think I enjoy a big club like Arsenal not winning trophies? I don't enjoy it. But today I tried to win."</p>
      <p>While his comments were made two years ago, they are still remembered by the Arsenal fanbase and may result in the board overlooking Mourinho in favour of someone else.</p>
