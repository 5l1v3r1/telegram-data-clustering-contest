      <p>Dame <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JulieAndrews">Julie Andrews</a> has joked that fictional nanny <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a> would have been able to sort out <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>. </p>
      <p>The actor mentioned the US president during a talk at London’s Southbank Centre, where she was asked whether she believed Trump would have turned out different had he had the beloved Disney character for a nanny. </p>
      <p>“Oh, Mary Poppins would have shaped him up,” Andrews responded. “God knows, if only we had the chance to try.”</p>
      <p>Andrews has previously criticised Trump for making huge funding cuts to the arts, which she described as “mind-boggling”.</p>
      <p>She also said she was “deeply disturbed” by Trump pulling America out of the Paris Climate Agreement. </p>
      <p>She starred as Mary Poppins in the classic 1964 film alongside Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns.</p>
      <p>Her recent roles include a voice part in the DC blockbuster <i>Aquaman.</i></p>
