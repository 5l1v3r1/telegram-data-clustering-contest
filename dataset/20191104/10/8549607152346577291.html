      <h3>BTC/USD</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin formed its third consecutive green candle on the daily chart on Sunday, October 27, and moved up to $9,550 closing the 7-day period with a 16.5 percent of increase.</p>
      <p>The BTC/USD pair opened the new trading period on Monday with a slight correction. It erased 3.4 percent of the total capitalization and dropped to $9,222 even though bulls were able to push the price up to $9,946 during intraday.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, October 29, the coin recovered from the loses registered during the previous session and closed at $9,420. It was already obvious that neither bulls nor bears were able to for a definitive trend and the levels near $9,000 will be crucial for the mid-term.</p>
      <p>The mid-week session on Wednesday was no different as sellers temporarily took over control, bringing the most popular cryptocurrency back down to $9,154. This time, however, they were able to briefly break below the $9,000 support.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin was quite volatile on Thursday and was trading in the $9,444 – $8,958 range. Surprisingly, we saw almost no change in price as it only lost a few dollars to stop at $9,148.</p>
      <p>The coin was 11 percent up in October and successfully formed its first green candle on the monthly chart since June.</p>
      <p>Bulls reminded for themselves on Friday, November 1, and the BTC/USD pair climbed up to $9,246. The move was followed by another winning session on Saturday, November 2 when the most popular digital currency closed at $9,305.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 3, bitcoin made another step-down and closed the day and week at $9,204, with 3.4 percent of loses for the 7-day period.</p>

      <h4>ETH/USD</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> Project token ETH broke above the critical level of $180 on Sunday, October 27, and closed the day and the week at $184 or 5 percent higher compared to the previous 7-day period.</p>
      <p>It peaked at $190 on Monday, October 28, but still ended the session with a small loss to $182 under bear pressure.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday the ETH/USD pair added 4.3 percent to its value and climbed up to $190, successfully defending the $180 support. The next target for bulls was to surpass and hold $190 in order to confirm the mid-term uptrend.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday however, the ether formed a similar red candle on the daily chart completely erasing its gains from the previous session. It closed at $183 while touching the $180 mark during intraday.</p>
      <p>The last day of October found ETH falling down to $177 in the early hours of the day as bears were slowly starting to take over control. The coin eventually closed at $182 and added 2 percent to its value on a monthly basis.</p>
      <p>November started with another high volatility session during which the ether was moving in the $185 – $177 zone. Bulls managed to partially recover and ended the workweek at $183.5.</p>
      <p>The weekend of November 2-3 started with a small drop to $182.6. On Sunday, November 3, the ETH continued its way downwards and stopped at 181.6 losing 1.5 percent on a weekly basis.</p>

      <h4>XRP/USD</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://ripple.com/">Ripple</a> company token XRP regained its positions near the $0.30 level on Sunday, October 27 and closed the previous week at $0.299, with 1.8 percent of increase.</p>
      <p>It opened the new trading period by moving up to $0.305 during intraday, successfully breaking the above-mentioned support zone. Bears, however, were fast to react and pushed the price back down to $0.294, erasing the recent gains.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, October 29, the XRP/USD pair climbed up to $0.302 after touching $0.31 earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>The exact same candle but in the opposite direction was formed on the mid-week session on October 30 as the XRP fell down to $0.294. Bulls and bears were struggling to hold to their gains and were not able to consolidate properly in order to establish a definitive trend.</p>
      <p>We saw the coin trading in the $0.298 – $0.291 zone on Thursday, October 31. It formed another red candle on the daily chart and closed the month at $0.294 or 14.3 percent higher compared to the previous 30-day period.</p>
      <p>The last day of the workweek and first day of November came with a third consecutive losing session for XRP. It dropped to $0.291 after touching $0.285 during intraday.</p>
      <p>The latest move by the coin suggested we could be seeing a return of bears at least in the short-term.</p>
      <p>The weekend of November 2-3 started with a small increase to $0.294, while on Sunday, November 3 we witnessed yet another push by bears, this time to $0.29. The XRP lost 2 percent of its value during the week.</p>

      <h4>Altcoin of the Week</h4>
      <p>Our Altcoin of the week is Ontology (<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ontology">ONT</a>). The decentralized business network environment was 35 percent up for the last seven days and 52 percent for the two week period.</p>
      <p>Ontology is a China-based <a href="https://ont.io/">project</a> created in 2017 by Erik Zhang and Da HongFei, also founders of the <a href="https://neo.org/">NEO</a> blockchain. The ONT coins were never distributed during Initial Coin Offering (ICO) but were airdropped to NEO holders instead.</p>
      <p>The ONT coin peaked at $1,10 on October 28 and now stands at #23 on the CoinGecko Top 100 list with a total market capitalization of approximately $603 million.</p>
      <p>The most probable reason for the recent surge is the pro-blockchain <a href="https://btcmanager.com/china-hub-blockchain-cryptocurrency-development/">rhetoric</a> by Chinese authorities and the reemerged interest in the technology from the Asian country.</p>
      <p>The project leaders also released their monthly <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-monthly-report-october-2019-20-languages-9ed65b660db0">update</a> on October 31 outlining the recent technical progress and the most important development.</p>
      <p>As of the time of writing, the ONT is trading at 0.0000971 against BTC on the Binance daily chart.</p>
