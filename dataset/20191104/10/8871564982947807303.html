      <h1>Troll toll still felt months after purge of propaganda accounts targeting Hong Kong, firm says</h1>

      <p>Mankind’s centuries-long war on trolls ain’t over yet, with anti-protester propaganda continuing to circulate on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube despite an effort this year to purge propaganda accounts linked to the Chinese government, Bloomberg reports.</p>
      <p>Citing research by the firm Astroscreen — which monitors so-called “astroturfing,” or the misleading use of social media to create the impression of grassroots support — the outlet reported that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/trolls-renew-social-media-attacks-on-hong-kong-s-protesters">new troll accounts employing similar tactics have sprouted up</a> in the wake of the social media giants’ purge.</p>
      <p>According to the company’s analysis of 30,000 anti-protester accounts, roughly one in three was created between August and October, after the mass removals. Of those, many exhibit signs of being inauthentic: they have fewer than 10 followers, use generic photos, and post predominantly in English in an apparent attempt to influence global opinion, said Astroscreen’s Donara Barojan.</p>
      <p>The accounts reinforce a communist party line, alleging, for instance, that the protests are a Western- or US-backed plot, in a bid to “discredit the protest movement” and play to existing anti-American sentiment, Bloomberg quoted Barojan as saying.</p>
      <p>“It creates a false consensus, a key tactic of propaganda actors.”</p>
      <p>Cybersecurity firms FireEye and Nisos reported similar findings.</p>
      <p>The hydra-like resurgence of the questionable accounts comes just a few months after <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/twitter-facebook-disclose-massive-china-backed-disinformation-campaign-on-hong-kong/">Twitter identified and suspended a core of nearly 1,000 China-linked accounts</a> that were “deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong,” along with a “larger, spammy network” of some 200,000 other accounts appearing to working in tandem with the core accounts to amplify their messages.</p>
      <p>Facebook and YouTube reportedly similar discoveries at the time.</p>
      <p>However, the Astroscreen researchers cautioned that definitively linking the latest activity back to specific actors, like the Chinese government, is difficult without more information.</p>
