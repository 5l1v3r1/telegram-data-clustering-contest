      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): The FBM KLCI closed up 10.22 points or 0.64% today, after world share markets rose amid US-China trade talks optimism and as investors evaluated news that the US' October job growth slowed less than expected.</p>
      <p>At Bursa Malaysia, the KLCI closed at its intraday high at 1,603.56 at 5pm today, led by top percentage gainers Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.</p>
      <p>Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd head of research Victor Wan said the positive sentiment across US shares traded at Wall Street on Friday, spilled over to Asian equities today.</p>
      <p>“It (KLCI) has a good run up already over the past few sessions. It has gone overboard. The 1,600 level seems to be new resistance for KLCI,” Wan told theedgemarkets.com today.</p>
      <p>Across Bursa today, 2.56 billion shares worth RM1.86 billion were traded. Among KLCI's 30 components, Hartalega closed 17 sen or 3.17% higher at RM5.54 to be the index's top percentage gainer, followed by Top Glove.</p>
      <p>Top Glove shares were up 12 sen or 2.73% at RM4.52.</p>
      <p>In currency markets, the ringgit strengthened to 4.1505 against the US dollar at the time of writing today, ahead of Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM) interest rate decision tomorrow (Nov 5).</p>
      <p>BNM's monetary policy committee (MPC) will hold their final 2019 meeting tomorrow. At the latest meeting on Sept 12, the MPC decided to maintain the overnight policy rate at 3%.</p>
      <p>Today, world share markets took cue from US-China trade talks and the US' jobs data. <i>Reuters</i> reported Asian shares surged on Monday with a broad regional gauge hitting more than 14-week highs, as growing optimism over US-China trade talks and upbeat US job data boosted global investors’ appetite for riskier assets.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the US and China both said on Friday that they had made progress in talks aimed at defusing their protracted trade war, and US officials said a deal could be signed this month.</p>
      <p>"US job growth slowed less than expected in October and hiring in the prior two months was stronger than previously estimated, data from the Labor Department showed on Friday," <i>Reuters </i>reported.</p>
