      <p>The slow-motion video of the Indian star, who got into a bird-like stance for a split-second to catch out West Indies skipper Stafanie Taylor, has taken social media by storm. </p>
      <p>While it looked like the ball that had raced for six from Taylor’s bat would sail over boundary rope, scoring a hundred for the Caribbean skipper, Kaur appeared from nowhere and leapt into the air to catch the ball with her left hand.</p>

      <p>The team stumbled in chase of 226 by finishing with only 224 on the board, getting beaten by just a run.</p>
      <p>The Indian team, however, had a fine start, with Priya Punia scoring the highest for the contingent, with 75 runs and Jemimah Rodrigues smashing 67 runs of 41 balls during the play.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Caribbean Stafaine Taylor's 94 and Natasha McClean's fifty paved way for West Indies win with 225 for 7 wickets of 50 overs. </p>
      <p>Kaur also added a feather to her hat by becoming India’s first cricketer to play 100 shortest format Twenty20 Internationals, even before former Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and skipper Rohit Sharma.</p>
