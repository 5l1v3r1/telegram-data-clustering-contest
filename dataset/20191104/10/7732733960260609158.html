      <h4>In brief: Gigabyte claims to have the world's first liquid-cooled eGPU solution in the shape of the new Aorus Gaming Box, equipped with the OEM's GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 11G graphics card. Powered by a built-in 450W PSU, the Gaming Box also features a network chip to connect over a wired network for minimal transmission interference during gaming.</h4>
      <p>Gigabyte's Aorus RTX 2080 Ti Gaming Box is here to bridge the gap between portability and performance. Like all eGPU products, the Gaming Box is going to add a lot of graphics horsepower to any Thunderbolt 3-equipped ultrabook. Since this peripheral sports a very powerful GPU, Gigabyte has also equipped it with its Waterforce liquid cooling solution, making it the world's first eGPU to do so.</p>
      <p>Apart from all the features and enhancements of the RTX 2080 Ti 11G, the Gaming Box comes packed with plenty of I/O for connectivity. A USB 3.0 is located on the lower front, while the back contains two more USB 3.0 ports, an Ethernet port, and a Thunderbolt 3 type-C port for connecting the Gaming Box to a laptop PC, capable of providing 100W for charging and up to 40 Gbps transfer speeds.</p>
      <p>Video output is handled by three DisplayPorts, a single HDMI and USB-C (VirtualLink) port. A reset button, power inlet and a vent for the cooling fan of the 450W PSU rounds off the rest of the back.</p>
