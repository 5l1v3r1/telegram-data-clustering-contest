      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/big">B.I.G</a> has released their first single in roughly 2 years!</p>
      <p>On November 4 KST, the group unveiled the music video for their song "<b>Illusion</b>." While the music video is for the Korean version of the song, the boys have also recorded the single in Arabic ahead of their upcoming Abu Dhabi concert.</p>
      <p>The lyrics of "Illusion" deal with the feeling of running into someone you had previously broken up with, finding yourself still infatuated with them and comparing them to a mirage in the loveless desert of your heart.</p>
      <p>Check out the music video for "Illusion" above!</p>
