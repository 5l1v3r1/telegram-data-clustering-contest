      <h3>LETRAN and San Sebastian try to keep their season alive as the NCAA men’s basketball step-ladder semifinals opens today at the Cuneta Astrodome.</h3>
      <p>The winner of the 4 p.m. match will face No. 2 Lyceum of the Philippines University in another knockout duel on Friday.</p>
      <p>Four-peat seeking San Beda jumped straight to the championship round after sweeping all of its 18 games in the double-round eliminations.  The best-of-three series starts next Tuesday at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>The Knights and the Stags split their elimination round head-to-head.</p>
      <p>Minus coach Egay Macaraya, who was serving a one-game suspension and its ace guard RK Ilagan fouling out, San Sebastian nipped Letran, 102-101, in overtime last Aug. 20.</p>
      <p>The Knights got their payback exactly a month later with a masterful 99-82 conquest of the Stags.</p>
      <p>Letran is making its second straight Final Four appearance as the third-ranked team, while San Sebastian is back in the semifinals after missing the bus last year.</p>
      <p>Jerrick Balanza, who along with Christian Balagasay were the only remnants of the 2015 Knights champion team that defied all the odds, simply don’t want to end his collegiate career.</p>
      <p>All Balanza wants is to bring back Letran to the Finals and hopefully reclaim its old glory along with fellow senior Bonbon Batiller and big man Larry Muyang.</p>
      <p>The Stags will rely on their top guns Ilagan and Allyn Bulanadi to go deeper in the season.</p>
      <p>Bulanadi exploded for a season-high 44 points as San Sebastian turned back University of Perpetual Help System Dalta, 99-94, in a win that turned out to be the clincher for the remaining semis spot two weeks ago.</p>
