      <p>After a crunch encounter against Orlando Pirates, where he was the subject of some harsh tackles, Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat took some time out to unwind. Check it out.</p>
      <p>It was his challenge on the Zimbabwean that saw Bucs defender Mthokozisi Dube receive his marching orders.</p>
      <p>There was also the infamous stamp on him by Thembinkosi Lorch, which saw ‘Nyoso’ receive a yellow card.</p>
      <p>Despite the on field antics, the 29-year-old Zimbabwean headed to a popular chisa nyama spot, Meat Lounge in Sunninghill on Sunday.</p>
