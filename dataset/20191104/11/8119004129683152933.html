      <p>“Sohel fled from Chattogram on the night of the murder. Subsequently, a team from Khulshi Police Station arrived in Dhaka after failing to catch him in Chattogram. Police arrested him from Malibag road this morning,” OC Pranab Chowdhury told bdnews24.com.</p>

      <p>Mohammad Nahid, 19, was murdered in front of No. 13 Pahartali ward councilor’s office in Chattogram’s Ambagan area on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Three people, including Nahid, went to Ambagan to ‘beat up’ Sohel following a dispute, said police. Sohel inserted a screwdriver into Nahid’s chest during the fight.</p>
      <p>Nahid was rushed to the local Ma O Shishu Hospital where the on-duty doctor declared him dead.</p>
      <p>“Sohel later told the police that he and Nahid were friends,” said OC Pranab.</p>
      <p>No case has been filed yet in connection with the incident. Nahid’s family has informed police that they will start a case after the completion of his burial.</p>
