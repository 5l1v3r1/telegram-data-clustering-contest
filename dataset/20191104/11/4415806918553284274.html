      <p>The 26-year-old recently spoke about getting in shape for the shoot when he appeared on Jessie Ware’s Table Manners podcast.</p>
      <p>He admitted: “I was so scared coming into it, because I didn’t know what to expect. The first day we did like all (the) capsule collection thing and then we did the underwear right at the very end of the day.</p>
      <p>“And it was just like, getting in your underwear in a room full of people, it was all a bit strange. I drank a lot of tequila on set just to get me in the motion of what was going on…”</p>

      <p>He also said he had been following a healthier lifestyle after seeing paparazzi pictures of himself.</p>
      <p>He told the podcast: “You know what, (I) went through a little bit of a stage when I was in the band when I was drinking really heavily and I put a lot of weight on and I didn’t notice, I just didn’t notice … you know when you get those horrible paparazzi shots (of yourself) somewhere.</p>
      <p>“I was on holiday somewhere and I was like ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe I’ve become that guy’, so then I kind of completely switched my life around after that moment because it just scared me that I couldn’t see it, that was what annoyed me more than anything.”</p>
      <p>According to Hugo Boss, Payne will be fronting a series of campaigns over the next two years.</p>
      <p>Of the partnership, he said: “I feel lucky that, as the face of HUGO, I get to front iconic campaigns such as this. It’s been an amazing experience to work with such an incredibly talented group of people.”</p>
      <p>Mert Alas, of photography duo Mert and Marcus, shared a picture of Payne naked with only a curtain covering his modesty from the Hugo Boss set a few weeks ago.</p>
