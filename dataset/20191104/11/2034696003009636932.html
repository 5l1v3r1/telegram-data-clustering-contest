      <p>Ian McKellen thinks he will be “long dead” by the time a Brexit deal happens, and has admitted he has “withdrawn entirely” from the process.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-release-date-plot-cast-2170413"><i>Lord of the Rings</i></a> actor spoke out following the recent news that the UK’s EU exit date had been extended once again to January 31, 2020.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the <i>Press Association</i>, the star said: “I did think the other day, as we battle through Brexit, I thought ‘Oh good God, when I’m long dead they still won’t have the Brexit deal complete, so I think I won’t take a view on it.’</p>
      <p>“I’ve withdrawn entirely, emotionally, from the race and am now watching it as a bit of chess and all I can say is they are wretched players and don’t know a pawn from a queen.”</p>
      <p>McKellen’s critical comments follow <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/jarvis-cocker-politics-is-like-game-of-thrones-2545213">those of Jarvis Cocker</a>, who recently compared the state of politics to <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a>.</p>

      <p>“A strangely common aspect of people that get in power at the moment is that they’re these weird characters – ridiculous people in a way – but people seem to find entertainment in that,” began the <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/pulp">Pulp</a> icon. “And that’s dangerous really. Politics has turned into <i>Game of Thrones</i> and they like all the skulduggery and stabbing people in the back. I can’t see it ending well.</p>
      <p>“The UK has always been divided but we’ve always got on,” he added. “But now, whatever happens, half the people are going to be kind of livid about it.”</p>
      <p>McKellen will soon be appearing in the movie adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/troubling-questions-raised-cats-trailer-2530880">Cats</a> </i>alongside <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a>, Judi Dench, Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Ian McKellen, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/idris-elba">Idris Elba</a>, Rebel Wilson and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/jason-derulo">Jason Derulo</a>.</p>
