      <h1>Dresden declares 'Nazi emergency' over far-right threat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:28:28+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Caroline Mortimer</a></address>
      <p>City councillors in Dresden have passed a motion declaring a “Nazi emergency” in the city due to the rise of the far-right.</p>
      <p>Opposition politicians in the city voted for the resolution to declare a “Nazinotstand” and call on city authorities to do more to tackle extremism.</p>
      <p>The city, which was devastated by Allied firebombing during the Second World War, is the birthplace of the far-right “Pegida” movement which began in 2013.</p>
      <p>Green party councillor Thomas Löser said: “It’s an intensification, that’s for sure.</p>
      <p>“But it has the background that we, as an urban society, clearly say that we support people who oppose, that we expect everyone to stand up against racism and anti-Semitism and to get involved with it and therefore no longer want this Pegida-agitation here in our city.”</p>

      <p>But the Christian Democrat Union, which controls the city council, says the motion is a step too far.</p>
      <p>CDU councillor Hans-Joachim Brauns said: “We certainly have something very undesirable. These are demonstrations that have a right-wing extremist background.</p>
      <p>“But the motion that the city council has now adopted does not make that any better.”</p>
      <p>Saxony, the state that includes Dresden, is regarded as a right-wing stronghold where the Alternative for Germany (Afd) party came second in regional elections in September.</p>

      <p>The motion comes just weeks after a far-right attack on a synagogue which killed two people in Halle around 145km west of Dresden.</p>
      <p>East Germany as a whole has seen the rise of support for anti-immigrant, Islamophobic groups in recent years.</p>
      <p>Following German reunification in 1990, unemployment skyrocketed in the east as the economy collapsed and jobs that were guaranteed under the communist regime disappeared.</p>
      <p>Although the situation is improving, many in the region feel they have been left behind compared to their west German peers.</p>
