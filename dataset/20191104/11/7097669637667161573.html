      <h1>Grenade kills one, wounds 17 in India Kashmir</h1>

      <p>At least one person was killed and 17 wounded Monday in a grenade blast at a crowded market in Indian-administered Kashmir's main city Srinagar, police and doctors said.</p>
      <p>Kashmir has been on a knife-edge since August 5 when the Indian government moved to strip the region of its autonomy, imposed a lockdown, cut telecommunications and detained thousands.</p>
      <p>No one claimed Monday's blast but authorities have in the past accused militants backed by Pakistan of intimidating people into resisting Indian attempts to return life to normal.</p>
      <p>Doctors at the main hospital told AFP that the deceased was a resident of northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>"Two people are critical," a doctor said on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Srinagar police chief Haseeb Mughal told AFP that 18 people were injured out of whom one died at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Kashmir is divided between India and its arch-foe Pakistan, and both claim it in full.</p>
      <p>Militants seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan have waged an armed rebellion against New Delhi since 1989.</p>
      <p>Around half of mobile phones remain cut off, as does the internet, while hundreds of local political leaders are still in detention, mostly without charge.</p>
      <p>Markets, schools and public areas remain closed with government forces still patrolling the streets, with periodic security lockdowns imposed on many parts of the region.</p>
      <p>A dozen non-locals have been killed by suspected militants, including six migrant workers last week, that police said were aimed at driving them away and create fear.</p>
