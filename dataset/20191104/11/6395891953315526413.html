      <p><b>KAMPALA, UgandaÂ (AP)</b> - Ugandan police have fired tear gas to break up a demonstration by journalists protesting alleged abuse by the police.</p>
      <p>The journalists were stopped Monday while trying to walk to the office of the police chief with a petition alleging police brutality.</p>
      <p>Police spokesman Fred Enanga said the march was broken up due to "poor organization."</p>
      <p>Ugandan security forces are frequently accused of restricting live coverage of demonstrations deemed to be against long-time leader Yoweri Museveni, who is being challenged by a musician popular with young people.</p>
      <p>In the past week security forces deployed heavily at Makerere University in the capital, Kampala, to quell a student protest over tuition fees.</p>
      <p>Some journalists were injured or attacked as police respond to protest events there, according to the Uganda Editors' Guild.</p>
