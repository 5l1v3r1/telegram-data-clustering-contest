      <p>PETA has criticised <i>Game of Thrones</i> star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jason-momoa">Jason Momoa</a> for getting a bear to eat an Oreo cookie out of his mouth.</p>
      <p>The actor posted a video on Instagram of the exchange on Saturday, which took place before filming a scene for his new Apple TV+ series, <i>See</i>, in which he fights with a grizzly bear.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the scene to Apple Music’s Beats 1 radio show, Momoa revealed the animal was a Kodiak bear that was nine-feet tall.</p>
      <p>“You have to get it slowly close to you, and be able to interact with it,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“Once the episode comes out, I’ll put it on my Instagram, when I put a cookie in my mouth. And then he eats it up,” Momoa said. </p>
      <p>“You see my face with the little cookie and then this massive head comes into the frame and takes [it] out of my mouth, which is like, ‘Why was Jason Momoa‘s face eaten off? Cause he tried to feed a bear with a cookie.’”</p>
      <p>Momoa captioned the Instagram post: “The things we do for our ART. SEE. Is out. Please watch on Apple TV+. The bear needs to know your scent. So here’s my cookie kisses big guy. Love you tag. Aloha Baba Voss.”</p>

      <p>But animal rights activists were quick to criticise Momoa for his actions, accusing the actor of using his celebrity platform to promote animal exploitation.</p>
      <p>“In a sad stunt, a captive bear ate a cookie out of actor Jason Momoa’s mouth,” tweeted PETA.</p>
      <p>“Bears used for entertainment are often torn from their mothers as infants, beat, and forced to perform.</p>
      <p>“Please, Jason, don’t promote wild animal exploitation in the future.”</p>
      <p>In a subsequent tweet, PETA called the use of a real-life bear in film and TV as “totally outdated”.</p>
      <p>“Momoa knows how lifelike CGI, animatronics, and other cutting-edge technologies are, but subjecting a bear to the bright lights and bustle of a production set is stressful and totally outdated,” it continued.</p>
      <p>“PETA urges the actor to consider compassion and refuse work with wild animals going forward.”</p>
      <p><i>The Independent </i>has contacted Momoa for comment.</p>
