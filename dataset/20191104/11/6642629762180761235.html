      <p>Mothercare has announced plans to place its UK retail business in administration, putting approximately 2,500 jobs at risk.</p>
      <p>The children's retailer, which has 79 stores in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>, said it will file a notice of intent to appoint administrators for the UK business later on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mothercare UK slumped to a 36.9 million pound ($47.7m) loss in the financial year to March, as it has struggled amid a period of turmoil for high street retailers.</p>
      <p>The retailer, which has about 500 full-time staff and 2,000 part-time employees, is set to follow the likes of Bonmarche, Jack Wills and Karen Millen, which have gone bust in recent months.</p>
      <p>The global Mothercare group said it has undertaken a review of the UK business and found that it is "not capable of returning to a level of structural profitability".</p>
      <p>It said the business is, therefore, unable to satisfy the cash needs of the UK arm and is therefore filing the notice as part of the restructuring and refinancing process.</p>
      <p>Mothercare added that the listed group remains profitable despite the problems facing its UK division.</p>
      <p>In the UK, Mothercare had already closed 55 stores over the past year in a desperate bid to keep the business afloat.</p>
      <p>In July, it said that it was making progress through its Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) restructuring plan but saw UK profit margin improve slower than forecast due to the difficult retail backdrop.</p>
      <p>UK sales were decimated by the raft of closures, driving total UK sales down by 23.2 percent for the 15 weeks to July.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Mothercare UK also offloaded its Early Learning Centre business to rival toy business The Entertainer for 13.5 million pounds ($14.4m).</p>
      <p>Richard Lim, chief executive officer at Retail Economics, said: "Years of under-investment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall.</p>
      <p>"As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.</p>
      <p>"Put simply, they have been left behind in today's rapidly evolving market and the board has been unable to restructure the business fast enough to cope with a new retail paradigm that has emerged."</p>
      <p>Shares in the parent company dived by 29.2 percent to eight pence ($0.10) in early trading on Monday</p>
