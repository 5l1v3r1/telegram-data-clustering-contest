      <h1>Strictly's Saffron Barker explains why she wasn't wearing poppy after viewer backlash</h1>
      <h2>Viewers of the BBC One show were left outraged when they spotted the YouTube star wasn't wearing a poppy during her appearance on Saturday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:24:12+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> star Saffron Barker has explained why she wasn't wearing a poppy on this weekend's show after a backlash from viewers.</p>
      <p>Eagle-eyed fans of the BBC One show were left outraged when they spotted the YouTube star didn't have a commemorative pin on her costume during her appearance on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Many tweeted Saffron, 19, to ask why she didn't have a poppy on - and she revealed BBC bosses banned her from wearing one because of the lift in her routine with AJ Pritchard.</p>
      <p>One viewer wrote: "Someone’s going to have to help me... have the BBC allowed saffron and AJ to get away with NOT WEARING POPPIES??!!</p>
      <p>"Not that I’m offended it’s just very out of character for the BBC."</p>
      <p>Saffron then replied: "We weren’t allowed to when we were dancing causeve [sic] our lift."</p>

      <p>The fan then added: "Ah that makes sense!! I did notice that you were wearing one tonight / in rehearsals so was doubtful it was done out of disrespect!!"</p>
      <p>After Saffron and AJ performed without their poppies on Saturday night's show, they were bombarded with messages from outraged viewers.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "How come Saffron and Aj are the only ones not wearing poppies on their outfits? It is because everyone has a choice?"</p>

      <p>Another tweeted: "Why aren't saffron or aj wearing poppies when everyone else is?"</p>
      <p>However, many fans were thrilled that so many of the other Strictly stars were proudly displaying their poppies.</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Not a huge Strictly fan but immensely pleased to see they all have their Poppies on."</p>
