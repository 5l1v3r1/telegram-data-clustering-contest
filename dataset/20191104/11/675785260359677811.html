      <h1>Daily Telegraph forced to correct Boris Johnson column in third inaccuracy this year</h1>
      <h2>The Prime Minister earned £275,000 a year as the paper's star columnist</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:03:31+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>The Daily Telegraph has been forced to correct a column penned by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> - after he falsely claimed the UK is set to “become the largest and most prosperous economy in this hemisphere”.</p>
      <p>It is the third time the paper has been forced to do this year for their star columnist who was paid £275,000-a-year before becoming PM.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister misrepresented data to suggest the British economy was set to outperform the rest of Europe.</p>
      <p>Johnson wrote in the June 3 article that the UK was forecast to become the largest and most prosperous economy in "this hemisphere."</p>
      <p>The correction published on Saturday said the data was based on an OECD forecast of UK and German GDP from 2020-2060 and that it related to Europe and not the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>"This forecast did not predict that the UK's GDP will surpass Germany's to become the largest in Europe," the newspaper also said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"This was the columnist's own extrapolation of this data beyond the time-frame of the forecast."</p>
      <p>The correction was issued following a ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation, the Telegraph said.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson became the prime minister in the month after the article was written.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> Party chair Ian Lavery commented: "Boris Johnson used his £275,000 a year newspaper column to stoke anti-Muslim hatred and mislead the public. You cannot believe a word he says, he is not fit to be Prime Minister."</p>
      <p>The paper was also forced to apologise after Johnson "misrepresented polling information".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ipso.co.uk/rulings-and-resolution-statements/ruling/?id=00154-19">The ruling</a> related to a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/01/06/british-people-wont-scared-backing-woeful-brexit-deal-nobody/">column published on January 7 2019</a>, in which he wrote: "Of all the options suggested by pollsters – staying in the EU, coming out on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> ’ terms, or coming out on World Trade terms – it is the last, the so-called no-deal option, that is gaining in popularity. In spite of – or perhaps because of – everything they have been told, it is this future that is by some margin preferred by the British public.”</p>
      <p>A reader complained, saying no poll available at the time of publication backed up Mr Johnson's claim.</p>
      <p>The newspaper argued the column, written by the favourite to be the next Prime Minister, was "clearly comically polemical, and could not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters."</p>
      <p>But regulator IPSO today upheld the complaint, ruling that the article breached clause 1 of the Editors Code of Practice - Accuracy.</p>
      <p>In July the newspaper was forced to "clarify" “clarifying” on the Conservative MP’s behalf a piece he wrote about a convicted drug dealer.</p>

      <p>He criticised the case of Luke Jewitt, who had been allowed out of prison on day release to visit a spa with his mother.</p>
      <p>In the column, Johnson described it as “yet another example of our cockeyed crook-coddling criminal justice system” and urged readers to “fill yourself with righteous anger” at the sight of a man being allowed out of his cell while halfway through a nine-year jail term.</p>
      <p>The newspaper has since corrected Johnson’s claim that Jewitt “was pushing huge quantities of cocaine and cannabis on to the streets”, following a formal complaint to the press regulator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/ipso">Ipso</a>.</p>
      <p>“Mr Jewitt was in fact cleared of charges relating to cannabis, and was convicted of conspiracy to supply 3kg of cocaine,” said the Telegraph in a correction added to Johnson’s article.</p>
      <p>“We are happy to clarify.”</p>
      <p>As well as forcing the paper to issue corrections, Johnson's column also caused a huge backlash when he compared Muslim women wearing burqas to "letter boxes" and "bank robbers".</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the newspaper's owners the Barclay brothers have begun the process of putting it up for sale shortly after they saw its profits crash in the middle of a plan to make it a digitally-focused news outlet.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Times reported that Donald Trump's former chief of staff Steve Bannon, was interested in buying the paper.</p>
      <p>Although there's no evidence Mr Bannon has the money to complete the deal.</p>
