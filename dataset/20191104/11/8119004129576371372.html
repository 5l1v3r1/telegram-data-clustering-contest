        <b>Cargo import through Benapole land port has remained suspended for a third straight day due to a technical glitch on the server connected to the printer at Petrapole port in India.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The other activities such as immigration and loading and unloading of goods were normal, said the authorities.</p>
      <p>Import suspension has stranded hundreds of trucks loaded with goods on both sides of the port, Mamun Kabir Tarafdar, deputy director of the port, told bdnews24.com.</p>

      <p>The printer connected to the central server in India's Petrapole suffered a technical glitch, causing the problem, said Kartik Chakraborty, the general secretary of Petrapole Port Clearing and Forwarding Staff Welfare Association.</p>
      <p>At present, the automation system is working online.</p>
      <p>“Importers may face huge losses if the problem is not fixed soon enough,” said Aminul Haque, vice-president of Benapole Port Importers-Exporters Association.</p>
      <p>“We heard that the technicians started to work to fix the problem. We hope the trade will resume soon."</p>
