      <h1>Netflix's The Witcher Showrunner has Already Mapped Out Seven Seasons</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:56:36+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>We’re still more than a month away from Netflix’s <i>The Witcher</i> series, but showrunner Lauren Hissrich says she has grand ambitions for Geralt’s future adventures. In an interview with SFX magazine (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/netflix-seven-seasons">PCGamesN</a>), Hissrich says that she already has years of narrative planned out.</p>
      <p>Hissrich told SFX that she’s mapped out stories “for seven seasons.” That’s a pretty long tail, but for the moment, the showrunner says that “Right now it’s just about ‘how do you set up stories that really capture audiences for years at a time?’”</p>
      <p>“The worst thing we could do is put all of our energies just into season one, and not be thinking about where these characters can grow to.” Thankfully, the team behind the upcoming series has plenty of pre-existing stories to draw from - the show’s recent trailer seems to draw primarily from Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski’s collections of short stories, Sword of Destiny and The Last Wish.</p>
      <p>That means that there are five more books in the full saga, and a sixth standalone novel, that have likely helped shape Hissrich’s plans. For now, however, those outlines remain firmly on paper, as Netflix is yet to confirm a second season of the show, let alone a seventh. The <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/01/tub-geralt-takes-centre-stage-in-netflixs-official-witcher-trailer">first series of <i>The Witcher</i> begins on December 20</a>.</p>
