      <p>MONTREAL – Power has been restored to the majority of Quebec homes after last week’s intense cocktail of rain and wind and Hydro-Quebec hopes to have nearly everyone reconnected by Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hydro-Quebec workers were on the ground throughout the weekend, with the help of teams from other provinces and the U.S., to bring electricity back to almost a million customers affected by the storm.</p>
      <p>"We have now about 50,000 people in Quebec without electricity out of 1 million that we had Friday in the morning," said Premier François Legault at the Monday morning news conference.</p>
      <p>As of 4 p.m. Monday, around 43,600 Quebec households were left without power. Most of those homes are in the Eastern Townships and Centre-du-Quebec regions. In Montreal, about 475 homes remain in the dark.</p>
      <p>"We have a lot of work done, but the rest of the work is not easy because instead of plugging in 100 or 200 people at a time, we're plugging in three or four people at a time. So, there's a lot of work to do," said Legault, adding that Hydro-Quebec is confident "most of these people" will regain electricity by Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Some 1,400 people are working to restore electricity to those still in the dark.</p>
      <p>"For about 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the (remaining) blackouts, when we settle one it reconnects five, 10, 20 clients," said Eric Martel, Hydro-Quebec president and CEO. "So obviously it's taking longer."</p>
      <p>The Crown Corporation is reminding people not to approach power lines and to never use outdoor equipment, such as barbecues and generators, inside.</p>
