      <p>'Nobody's Child' is a gripping crime thriller by Kanchana Banerjee.</p>
      <p>'Nobody's Child' is a dark and detailed story. Narrated from different points of view, the book tells of the crime against Asavri, an orphan who rose from a hard life to become the winner of a televised singing contest, Indian Koel. Just after winning she dies in a car accident and the daughter of another narrator, Kamini, is declared the winner. Two years later the police find a drugged and abused woman in the streets who tells them she is Asavri. The case of who that woman is and what happened to her is suddenly all over the news and we follow many characters as they respond to the situation in unpredictable ways.</p>
      <p>The book is well written and fast-paced, with lots of twists in the plot that keep readers hooked. The story is so fascinating that readers are likely to finish the book in 1-2 sittings. It wonderfully captures the dark side of many aspects of life, such as the influence of media on such cases, competition, politics and especially people. The book is a must-read for thriller lovers.</p>
