      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>'s opposition <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/labour-party.html">Labour Party</a> said on Monday it would examine closely a proposal to ban private jets and consult with the industry about a phase-out date for the use of fossil-fuel private planes.</p>
      <p>Andy McDonald, the opposition spokesman for the transport sector, said a report from the Common Wealth think-tank proposing a ban on private jets made a "very convincing argument".</p>
      <p>"Why is the government enabling billionaires to trash the climate when it's the rest of us who will suffer the consequences?" he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"In just a few years' time, it will be possible for these journeys to be made by electric aircraft - so long as [the] government puts in place the right incentives. Labour will examine these proposals closely and consult with industry on the introduction of a phase-out date for the use of fossil fuel private jets."</p>
