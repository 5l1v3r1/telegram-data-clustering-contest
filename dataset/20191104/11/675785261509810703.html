      <p>A man suspected of the sectarian murder of three children in Northern Ireland has been found dead in a river.</p>
      <p>Raymond Parke was implicated in the killings of brothers Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, aged 10, nine and eight respectively.</p>
      <p>Parke, reportedly a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), never stood trial over the brothers' deaths in a petrol bomb attack at their home in 1998.</p>
      <p>A relative of the boys says he hopes the suspected killer "rots in hell".</p>
      <p>He was identified by getaway driver Garfield Gilmour, who was later convicted of manslaughter.</p>

      <p>Parke, a father-of-two, was found dead in Coleraine on Thursday, shortly after his worried family issued an appeal for help finding him.</p>
      <p>Police are not viewing his death as suspicious.</p>
      <p>The boys' uncle, Frankie Quinn - who had to identify their burned bodies - told the Sunday World: "I hope he rots in hell."</p>
      <p>The three Catholic boys died after the bomb was thrown into the family home in Ballymoney, County Antrim, on July 12, 1998.</p>

      <p>Their mum, Chrissie Quinn, survived after jumping out of an upstairs window, the <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/raymond-parke-uvf-suspect-in-brutal-murder-of-quinn-boys-is-found-drowned-38657059.html">Belfast Telegraph reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Brother Lee was not at home when the attack happened as he was staying with his grandparents.</p>
      <p>The killings happened hours before a July 12 Orangemen parade in Portadown.</p>
      <p>During the week it happened, there were 137 petrol bomb attacks on Catholic homes.</p>
      <p>Gimour was jailed for 14 years for his role in the killings.</p>

      <p>Giving evidence, he told the court that Parke and another man, Johnny McKay, had carried out the petrol bombing.</p>
      <p>Parke was arrested, but never charged.</p>
      <p>A spokesman from the Police Service Northern Ireland (PSNI) said: "A <i/> post mortem has been carried out following the death of a man, whose body was discovered in the River Bann, Coleraine on Thursday 31st October.</p>
      <p>"The death is not being treated as suspicious."</p>
