      <h1>'Go home disappointed' - Stoke City man on missing international reunion against West Brom</h1>
      <h2>West Brom latest | Stoke City's Peter Etebo will miss the Championship clash, while Nigeria teammate Semi Ajayi is likely to line up for the Baggies as they chase top spot again</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:28:13+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Stoke City will be without midfielder Peter Etebo for tonight's Championship clash with West Bromwich Albion - and he is frustrated to be missing an on-field reunion with international teammate Semi Ajayi.</p>
      <p>Etebo - one of Stoke's standout players in a poor start to the season - has made 11 appearances in the League this season, but he managed only 21 minutes of the 1-0 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday last month before being forced off with a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>That problem will <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/stoke-city-west-brom-etebo-3498461">keep him out against the Baggies</a> when the teams meet at the bet365 Stadium this evening, with Slaven Bilic's side aiming to move back to the Championship summit.</p>
      <p>Ajayi is likely to start again at the heart of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> defence, while his Nigeria teammate Etebo watches on.</p>

      <p>"I would have loved to play against him this week. We played against each other twice when he was at Rotherham and it was a draw," Etebo told <a href="https://www.brila.net/etebo-regrets-missing-ajayi-showdown/">Nigerian sports website Brila.net.</a></p>
      <p>“I am disappointed not to be able to face him at his new club. This time, I will be there as a fan supporting my team.</p>
      <p>“I wish him well and hope he has a good game (against Stoke), but I am sure my team will win, so he will go home disappointed with the result.</p>
