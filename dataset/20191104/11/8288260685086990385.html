      <p>A stunning five bedroom mansion is up for sale - and it even has it's own go-karting track for the kids.</p>
      <p>The huge detached home, located in Mill Lane, Coventry, is on the market for a jaw-dropping £3,500,000.</p>
      <p>But Living Springs is every family's dream with a race track for the kids winding around the garden, virtual indoor golf, a playroom and a gym.</p>
      <p>Its beautifully decorated interior is the epitome of luxury, with a silver theme running throughout - though it is on the market without the gorgeous furnishings.</p>
      <p>The grand property also boasts eight acres of land, including a lake, a timed watering system for the rear courtyard and panoramic views of the idyllic Warwickshire countryside.</p>
      <p>The classy open plan kitchen-diner opens out onto a patio which is complete with loungers and sofas - perfect for entertaining.</p>
      <p>Constructed over eight years, the current owners have even thought to include a Sonus sound system in every room, stretching to the garden too.</p>
      <p>It features underfloor heating and to top it all off there's a jaccuzi bath in one of the three glossy en-suite bathrooms.</p>

      <p>Zoopla estimated the running of the household would cost almost £14,000 with the mortgage alone costing around £13,400.</p>
      <p>It's fully protected by automated driveway gates activated by a remote control and also CCTV and an intruder alarm.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/details/52787577">Zoopla advert</a> , hosted by Simon Burt Privilege, reads: "Living Springs is a truly magnificent, extraordinarily symmetrical, 5 double bedroom, contemporary country mansion residence, conceived and constructed to the highest possible standards by the current owners over a period of 8 years and offering nearly 7,500 square feet of the most highly specified and opulent family accommodation currently available on the market today!"</p>
