      <p>REUTERS: Manchester City playmaker David Silva is a doubt for Sunday's Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool after sustaining a muscular injury at the weekend, manager Pep Guardiola has said.</p>
      <p>Silva has featured in all 11 of City's league games so far this season and started in their 2-1 win over Southampton on Saturday but the 33-year-old was replaced by striker Gabriel Jesus just before halftime.</p>

      <p>"David Silva was injured. Five minutes before the first half ended he told me he had a muscular problem," Guardiola told reporters.</p>
      <p>"When he has a muscular problem and cannot play more minutes it is because he has something and when it is a muscular problem it is always a minimum of 10-12 days."</p>
      <p>Guardiola's team are six points behind Liverpool, who they face at Anfield on Nov. 10, four days after visiting Italy's Atalanta in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Champions City were the only team Liverpool lost to in the top flight last season as the Merseyside club finished second by a single point.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said it was too early in the campaign to view Sunday's match as being decisive in terms of the title race.</p>
      <p>"Now we go to Italy and when we come back we go to Anfield. We will see," he added. "Many things are going to happen and there are a lot of games to play."</p>
