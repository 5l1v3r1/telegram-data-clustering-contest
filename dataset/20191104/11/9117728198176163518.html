        <i>“You always need to look at the positives as well. It’s my best season in F1 so far so that’s good.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Looking at other positives, I’ve made huge gains in many areas in terms of race pace.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But winning the race in this way… Lewis, I’m sure he really wanted to win the title by winning the race. I could stop that. So that feels good.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Bottas needs to improve next season and will hope to take on board all the advice he can get as he looks to break down Hamilton in 2020. </p>
