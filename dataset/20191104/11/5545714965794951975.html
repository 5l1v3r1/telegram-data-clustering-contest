      <p><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-luigi-s-mansion-3-570488.phtml"><i>Luigi's Mansion 3</i></a> may not have succeeded in knocking Activision's<i> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-570785.phtml">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a></i> off of the top of the UK Charts, but the spooky-ooky title has still been a huge success, with the Switch release proving to be Nintendo's biggest launch title of 2019 so far.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-04-uk-charts-luigis-mansion-3-is-the-biggest-switch-launch-of-2019-so-far">As reported by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, physical sales of Luigi's new adventure were 140% higher than its 3DS predecessor, with the new sequel also outperforming both <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-legend-of-zelda-link-s-awakening-switch--566243.phtml"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</i></a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-super-mario-maker-2-560469.phtml"><i>Super Mario Maker 2</i></a> (though it should be noted <i>Luigi's Mansion 3</i> did get an extra day of sales, having launched on a Thursday to coincide with Halloween.) As is usually the case, the launch of a new Switch title brought a small sales boost to most other major Switch releases.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in the charts, Obsidian's <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-outer-worlds-569391.phtml"><i>The Outer Worlds</i></a> still sits comfortably in the Top Ten, as does Ubisoft's fan-mauled <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-in-progress-tom-clancy-s-ghost-recon-breakpoint-568557.phtml"><i>Ghost Recon: Breakpoint</i></a>. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../disney-classic-games-aladdin-and-the-lion-king-is-a-fantastic-collection-of-a-few-very-old-games-571007.phtml"><i>Disney Classic Games: Aladdin &amp; The Lion King</i></a> made a quiet debut at number 12, while 2K Games' maligned<i> WWE 2K20</i> began its descent, dropping from number 3 to number 14.<br/><br/><i>Modern Warfare</i> is likely to remain the game to beat for some time. The upcoming <i>Pokemon Sword and Shield</i> has the opportunity and ability to do so, though it will be hampered in its efforts to reach number 1 by having its sales split into two separate releases.</p>
