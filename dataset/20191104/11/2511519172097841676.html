      <p>A bus driver in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> rammed his vehicle into a crowd waiting by a stop, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/stabbing">stabbed</a> several people and jumped into the sea.</p>
      <p>It is unclear whether the 33-year-old crashed his bus deliberately during the incident on Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>He tried to escape the scene and was stopped by a man near the stop. The driver stabbed the man with a knife and then attacked others who tried to stop him with the blade.</p>
      <p>At least 13 people were injured in the incident, including two children. Around five of the victims are thought to have been critically wounded.</p>
      <p>Three <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Iran">Iranian</a> citizens are also among the injured. Detectives said the bus driver leapt into the sea in an attempt to escape but was later arrested by police officers.</p>
      <p>Videos from the scene show people running away, with injured victims lying on the ground as a panicking crowd surrounds them.</p>
      <p>The video also shows the bus, which has a shattered windscreen.</p>
      <p>“The wounded were taken to the surrounding hospitals by ambulances,” a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Istanbul">Istanbul</a> Metropolitan Municipality, the local authority, said.</p>
      <p>“We have started a comprehensive investigation about the driver, vehicle owner and Private Public Bus Company.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson added that the company was closely monitoring the status of the injured, according to Turkish news website <i><a href="https://t24.com.tr/haber/istanbul-besiktas-ta-otobus-duraga-daldi-yaralilar-var,846609">T24</a>.</i></p>
      <p>Istanbul police have opened an investigation into the crash, the spokesperson said.</p>
