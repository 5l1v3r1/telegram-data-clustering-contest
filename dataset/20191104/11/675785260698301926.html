      <h1>Bayern Munich ‘target Jose Mourinho appointment’ as Arsenal deny meeting</h1>
      <h2>Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich axed Niko Kovac on Sunday following a damaging 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:16:57+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Harris</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bayern-munich">Bayern Munich</a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> as their top target to replace Niko Kovac.</p>
      <p>The Croatian was dismissed on Sunday following talks with CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, president Uli Hoeness and sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic.</p>
      <p>Pressure was building on Kovac as Saturday’s 5-1 thrashing at Eintracht Frankfurt continued the team’s underwhelming start to the season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been out of work since leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last December.</p>
      <p>He has been credited with an interest in succeeding Unai Emery at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> but Bayern look set to make a play for his services, according to journalist Nicolo Schira.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were forced to refute claims Mourinho 'dined' with Head of Football Raul Sanllehi amid growing speculation over Emery’s future.</p>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> boss Massimiliano Allegri and former Gooner Mikel Arteta are among the candidates to replace the Spaniard if Emirates Stadium bosses pull the trigger.</p>
      <p>A move for Mourinho is unlikely because of his previous jibes at Arsene Wenger and the club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has never managed in Germany during his glittering career so the chance to sample life in the Bundesliga with Bayern could appeal.</p>
      <p>He has also been linked with Borussia Dortmund, and ex-United midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger claims ‘the Special One’ is curious about German football.</p>
      <p>“In any case, I can imagine Jose Mourinho in Germany, I remember well that he always asked me about Bayern and the Bundesliga,” Schweinsteiger told <i>Bild am Sonntag</i>.</p>
      <p>"He has not worked in the Bundesliga, so I can well imagine that he would be tempted by a commitment in Germany.”</p>
