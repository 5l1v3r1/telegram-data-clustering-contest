      <h1>Party-goers into drugs alarming -- PDEA</h1>

      <h3>PHILIPPINE Drug Enforcement Agency chair Director General Aaron N. Aquino yesterday aired his concern over young party-goers trying to smuggle illegal drugs at music festivals  to  boost their mood.</h3>
      <p>“I call for parents to check on their children in going to parties to avoid the same incident, or worst, just like the incidents on May 22, 2016, the Close-Up summer concert event where five died and linked to use of party drugs; and the 19-year-old woman who died due to an alleged drug overdose during Sinulog party in Cebu City on January 19, 2019,” Aquino said.</p>
      <p>Last October 26, the PDEA chief said  a female senior high school student was accosted for trying to sneak in marijuana during the Jack TV’s MADFest 2019, an annual event where music, arts and dance festival is showcased.</p>
      <p>Aquino said the minor was temporarily stopped after  a PDEA Narcotics Detection Dog or K-9 reacted towards her when she passed through a checkpoint set up at the entrance of the Globe Circuit Events Ground in Makati City.</p>
      <p>When frisked, the minor yielded around five grams of dried marijuana leaves and two glass tubes.</p>
      <p>She was turned over to the Makati City Social Welfare and Development Office after the incident. The minor will be facing charges for illegal possession of drugs under Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.</p>
