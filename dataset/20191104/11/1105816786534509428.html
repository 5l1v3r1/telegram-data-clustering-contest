      <p>“Everybody ages at a different rate. My boyfriend is unbelievably mature. He’s an old soul in a young body, what more could I want,” she said during the interview. “People are slightly frightened of older women, but he isn’t. Women can be very powerful when they’re older.”</p>
      <p>The star also feels it’s fun to date older woman. “Why can’t we be sexually and romantically attractive just when our eggs are expired? Actually it’s much more fun because we’re so freed of the terror, there is no consequence, it’s all just for fun,” she added.</p>
