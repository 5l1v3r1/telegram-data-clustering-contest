      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco  Gamboa yesterday asked each member of the 195,000-strong police force to voluntarily donate a minimum of P10 for civilian-victims of a series of earthquakes that ravaged parts of Mindanao.</h3>
      <p>The official said that the voluntary donation will be sent to help victims of the earthquake in Regions 10, 11 and 12.</p>
      <p>He said the PNP national headquarters will be taking care of policemen who were also affected by the quakes.</p>
      <p>Gamboa required all financial institutions servicing the PNP to offer “soft loans” or “zero-interest loans” to the policemen-victims.   </p>
      <p>The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) yesterday appealed for more support for thousands of families affected by the earthquakes.</p>
