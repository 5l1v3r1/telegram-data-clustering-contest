      <h1>Iran announces new violations of nuclear deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T11:52:18+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Associated PressÂ </a></address>
      <p>The head of Iran's nuclear program said on Monday that Tehran was operating 60 IR-6 advanced centrifuges in violation of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/smart-facts/what-iran-nuclear-deal-n868346">its atomic deal with world powers</a>.</p>
      <p>The comments by Ali Akbar Salehi mean that Iran is now operating double the amount of advanced centrifuges than was previously known.</p>
      <p>Salehi made the announcement to state TV on the 40th anniversary of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.</p>
      <p>An IR-6 centrifuge can produce enriched uranium 10 times as fast as the first-generation IR-1s allowed under the accord.</p>
      <p>The nuclear deal limited Iran to using only 5,060 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges to enrich uranium by rapidly spinning uranium hexafluoride gas.</p>
      <p>By starting up these advanced centrifuges, Iran further cuts into the one-year time limit that experts estimate Tehran would need to have enough material to build a nuclear weapon, if it chose to pursue one.</p>
