      <p>The latest flagship series of the ASUS range, the ZenFone 6, has started receiving the first stable version of ZenUI 6 based on Android 10.</p>
      <p>The distribution of the new OTA update to the Zenfone 6 and 6Z has only started in the past few hours. Reaching a limited number of devices sold in Canada, the United States and India. The roll-out in other countries has not yet started. But we can confirm that the final firmware is currently under test and that it should not be too long before a public release.</p>
      <p>The new features onboard the new release 17.1810.1910.63 include support for system updates via Google Play. Alongside with new full-screen navigation gestures, integration of the dark theme of Android 10 and more.</p>
