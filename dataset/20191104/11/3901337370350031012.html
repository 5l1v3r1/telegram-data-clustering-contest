      <p>After establishing himself as one of the hottest young prospects in Europe at Monaco, Mbappe chose PSG as the club to continue his journey with in 2017.</p>
      <p>The talented forward was on Real's radar as well as the French champions', but former Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev has now claimed that the Frenchman was determined to make a name for himself in France before taking his career elsewhere.</p>

      <p>"Why did he not sign at Real?" he told <i>Telefoot</i>.  </p>
      <p>"He told me: 'Vadim, I think it's too early, I'm Parisian, I do not want to leave my country like that, I want to become a great player here.'</p>
      <p>"I told him, 'Kylian, you're right'. He wants to win. And of course, the Champions League must be won for a player like that. If he wins it with Paris, it's better.</p>
      <p>"He remains the same person, the same Kylian. It's just that he has gained importance, power in the global landscape.</p>
      <p>"I know Cristiano Ronaldo quite well, and he always wants to break all records, go further. Kylian is the same."</p>
