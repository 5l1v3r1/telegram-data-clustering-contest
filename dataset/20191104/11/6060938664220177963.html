      <p>RANCHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shubman-Gill">Shubman Gill</a> scripted history on Monday when he walked out to lead India C in the 47th <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deodhar-Trophy">Deodhar Trophy</a> summit clash with India B at the JSCA International Stadium as he became the youngest captain to lead a side in the tournament's final.</p>
      <p>The right-hander broke current India captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>'s 10-year-old record. The India run-machine had led North Zone in the Deodhar Trophy final when he was just 21 years and 142 days old in 2009-10 while Gill is only 20 years and 57 days old.</p>
      <p>Gill, however, was dismissed for just a run by Mohammad Siraj.</p>
      <p>Batting first, India B put on 283/7, thanks on a fighting 86-run knock by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kedar-Jadhav">Kedar Jadhav</a>. For India C, Bengal pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ishan-Porel">Ishan Porel</a> scalped 5/43 in his 10 overs.</p>
      <p>In reply, India C were restricted to 232/9 in 50 overs as Parthiv Patel-led India B clinch the title.</p>
      <p>Gill was earlier a part of India's Test squad for the three-match series against South Africa, which India won 3-0.</p>
