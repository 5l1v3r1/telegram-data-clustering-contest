      <p>In what was his last appearance for his club and maybe his final match as a professional footballer, African legend Yaya Toure was sent off after just 10 seconds following a moment of madness this past weekend.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The former Manchester City midfielder celebrated yet another trophy win on Saturday after claiming the China League One title with Qingdao Huanghai.</p>
      <p>His final game for the team was a disappointing one, however, as he was given his marching orders less than a minute into their clash against Nantong Zhiyun for strangely kicking out an opponent off the ball.</p>

      <p><i>The Sun</i> reported that VAR was consulted before the match official in charge handed Toure his red card in what many believe might have been his last match as a footballer.</p>
      <p>Toure did, however, recently claim he does not have plans to retire just yet, and also confirmed he will be on the hunt for a new challenge after helping Qingdao win the league and secure promotion to the Chinese Super League.</p>
