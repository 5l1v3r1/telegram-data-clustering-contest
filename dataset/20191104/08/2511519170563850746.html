      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Liam_Payne">Liam Payne</a> has opened up about how leaving <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/One_Direction">One Direction</a> negatively affected his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/MentalHealth">mental health</a>, revealing he “kind of went off the rails a little bit”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to British <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gq-hype/article/liam-payne-interview-2019"><i>GQ</i></a>, the musician explained he went into therapy a few years after leaving the band, which announced a hiatus in 2015, and “couldn’t really figure out what was making [him] sad”.</p>
      <p>“So, you know, my team got somebody around to help me through a couple of different, difficult things that I was going through,” Payne continued. </p>
      <p>“I was just trying to figure myself out. It was just such a strange course through life, and then when the switch turns off you’re left to your own devices…”</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, who has a two-year-old son with former Girls Aloud singer Cheryl Tweedy, went on to allude to a period of heavy drinking that became a problem at around the same time.</p>
      <p>“I was drinking too much and getting into really bad, bad situations for quite some time actually,” Payne said.</p>
      <p>“And I hit a peak moment where I knew the drinking was going to get me; I needed to do something about it. I spent a lot of time drinking to escape the crazy world that I had created for myself.”</p>
      <p>In his first therapy session, Payne recalled being asked what he enjoyed doing and what he liked about himself and being unable to answer either question.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty scary stuff,” he added, before revealing that he went sober for roughly one year, but soon changed tack when he realised his social life was dwindling.</p>
      <p>“In a strange way I am trying to still figure all that out and get the balance right between being a party animal and being an animal in the gym – the latter not being fun at all,” Payne continued.</p>
      <p>“We are all at fault; we all need balance.”</p>
