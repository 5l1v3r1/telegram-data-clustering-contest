      <p>CHICAGO (AP) — McDonald’s ousted CEO Steve Easterbrook will receive 26 weeks of pay but forfeit millions in unvested stock options as part of his severance agreement.</p>
      <p>McDonald’s Corp. announced Sunday that Easterbrook was fired for having a consensual relationship with an employee. McDonald’s forbids managers from having romantic relationships with subordinates.</p>

      <p>Under his severance agreement, Easterbrook will be eligible for a prorated incentive payment for the 2019 fiscal year. He can also exercise stock options that have vested or will vest within three years.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2018, Easterbrook had unvested options worth $21.8 million.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook is also forbidden from working for a competitor for two years.</p>
