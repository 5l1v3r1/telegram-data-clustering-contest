      <h1>Arsenal's three managerial candidates rated and slated as pressure grows on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal have won just two of their past nine Premier League games and pressure is starting to grow on Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:32:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Pressure is starting to grow on Unai Emery and despite the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss being reassured that his job is not under threat, speculation continues to link some big names to the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho's name has cropped up more than most, with the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss apparently open to the idea of managing the Gunners.</p>
      <p>But other names are in the mix, including Mikel Arteta and Massimiliano Allegri.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have won just two of their past nine matches in the Premier League and fans are starting to turn on Emery.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard does have time to turn things around at the Emirates, but should he fail to do so he may be ousted by one of the three names mentioned.</p>
      <p>Here we take a closer look at each manager and weigh up the pros and cons for Arsenal.</p>

      <h3>Jose Mourinho</h3>
      <p>Arsenal fans need no introduction where Mourinho is concerned, having watched their team come up against his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and Manchester United sides over the years.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese is an out-spoken and often controversial character and even once clashed with the relatively placid Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>In terms of the pros, Mourinho knows the Premier League like the back of his hand and has a good grasp of what's required to be successful in the division.</p>
      <p>He's a born winner with a burning desire to win silverware, and will be looking to taste glory as quickly as he can.</p>
      <p>In terms of the cons, the Portuguese likes to spend big to achieve his goals, which could be a problem at Arsenal given the club's lack of financial firepower compared to the rest of the Big Six.</p>

      <p>He will also, as aforesaid, look to win trophies from day one and will sign players who have 'already made it' rather than build for the future.</p>
      <p>It's not a major issue, as most Gunners supporters are keen to win silverware, but it goes against the club's values and could therefore see Mourinho overlooked.</p>
      <h3>Mikel Arteta</h3>
      <p>Like Mourinho, Arsenal fans are already familiar with Arteta.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard played for the club from 2011 to 2016 before going into coaching and joining Pep Guardiola's staff at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , where he has helped the team to two titles.</p>
      <p>Arteta was right in the mix to get the Arsenal manager's job first time round before the club decided to hand Emery the keys.</p>
      <p>In terms of the pros, Arteta knows the club. He knows the staff, the players and the philosphy.</p>
      <p>He's had great training under Guardiola at Manchester City and has seen first hand what it takes to turn a top four team into one of the world's best.</p>
      <p>Arteta would also relish having the opportunity to manage Arsenal, and could have a Frank Lampard affect by uniting the team.</p>

      <p>In terms of the cons, Arteta has no experience in management - let alone at a club the size and stature of Arsenal.</p>
      <p>It would be a big risk for the board to remove Emery - a man with an impressive trophy cabinet - and replace him with someone unproven and it could quickly go more 'Ole Gunnar Solskjaer' than Lampard.</p>
      <h3>Massimiliano Allegri</h3>
      <p>Arsenal supporters will know less about Allegri than the other two candidates, but will have heard of his name nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Allegri dominated Italian football with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> for five straight seasons before going on a sabbitical.</p>
      <p>He's ready to return to the game, and has reportedly been learning to speak English in preparation of getting a job in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>In terms of the pros, Allegri is a proven manager at the highest level.</p>
      <p>He's won six Serie A titles - one with AC Milan - and knows exactly what it takes to instil a winning style and manage the best players in the world.</p>
      <p>In terms of the cons, Allegri has no experience managing in the Premier League, and why would he necessarily be any different to Emery?</p>

      <p>Like Emery, Allegri has won trophies on the continent, but whether this translates is anyone's guess. After all, managing a team like Juventus is similar to managing a team like Paris Saint-Germain (Emery's last job before Arsenal), given their standing in their league.</p>
      <p>And Allegri could struggle with the re-build job at Arsenal in the same way Emery is.</p>
