      <p>LONDON (Nov 4): The British election is likely to result in a hung parliament and the Brexit Party’s lawmakers could be kingmakers, leader Nigel Farage said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It is likely, it is likely that we are going to have a hung parliament next time around so actually if the Brexit Party get a reasonable amount of people in there they could exert a great influence,” Farage told ITV. “Mrs May was kept in power by 10 DUP MPs.”</p>
      <p>Former Prime Minister Theresa May was dependent on Democratic Unionist Party lawmakers to govern after her failed bet on a snap election lost her party its majority.</p>
      <p>Farage said he would hurt the opposition Labour Party “in the most extraordinary way”.</p>
