      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 4 — After several tailgating incidents where drivers tried to escape paying for toll, a Perodua Myvi driver had a new trick up his sleeves to weasel his/her way out without paying.</p>
      <p>In the 35-second recording that was posted on the “We are Malaysians” Facebook page, the Myvi was seen entering a Touch n’ Go toll booth reportedly along the PLUS highway before zooming past without paying.</p>
      <p>In the video, it can be seen that as the car suddenly swerves to the left and squeezes through the large gap between the boom gate and toll barrier.</p>
      <p>Based on the timestamp found on the dashcam footage, the incident is believed to have happened at 10.06am yesterday (November 3).</p>
      <p>Social media users condemned the driver for his reckless move, noting that the offender could afford a car but not the toll, while others advised him to be more responsible next time.</p>
      <p>“If you can’t afford to pay for the toll, just get a motorcycle or bicycle,” a Facebook user said.</p>
      <p>Other users also poked fun at the car’s compact size and called it “legend Myvi.”</p>
      <p>“I think Myvi’s sales will jump by 1,000 per cent if they put this in their commercials,” a user teasingly commented.</p>
