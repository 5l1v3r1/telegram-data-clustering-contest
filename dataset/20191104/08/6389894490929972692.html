      <p>Stephen Morana, GVC’s senior independent non-executive director, who led the recruitment process, said: “Our criteria for the new chairman included significant gambling sector experience, a demonstrable track-record of success on a range of high-profile public company boards, and a deep understanding of the evolving corporate governance landscape. After an extensive search, Barry stood out as exceeding all of those criteria.”</p>
      <p>Morana added: “On behalf of the board I would also like to thank Lee Feldman for playing such an instrumental role in GVC’s transformation from a small AIM listed business to a major main market, premium listed company. We wish him the very best for the future.”</p>
      <p>Gibson said: “I see enormous potential for this business and am looking forward very much to helping GVC to be the most successful and responsible operator in the sector.”</p>
