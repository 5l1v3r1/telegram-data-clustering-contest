      <h1>Carcass of Borneo pygmy elephant found on Sabah riverbank, cause of death unknown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:13:36+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>Wildlife officials in Sabah have been alerted to the <a href="https://www.bharian.com.my/berita/kes/2019/11/624633/bangkai-gajah-pygmy-borneo-yang-ketiga-ditemui">discovery of a dead Borneo Pygmy elephant</a> along the banks of the Kinabatangan river yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Villagers nearby alerted the Sabah Wildlife Department, who then deployed a team of officers to conduct an investigation and autopsy on the animalâ€™s badly decomposed body.</p>
      <p>At present, authorities are unsure if the critically-endangered elephant died of natural causes or at the hands of poachers. Officials will also have a hard time determining exactly where the animal died, as its body had already floated downstream when it was discovered.</p>
      <p>Pygmy elephant deaths have dominated Malaysian headlines since September, most notably after one of the majestic animals was found dead with <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/pygmy-elephant-had-70-bullet-holes-throughout-his-body-postmortem-on-going/">70 gunshot wounds near a plantation in Kalabakan, Tawau</a>. Another dead elephant was discovered near a plantation the following month, also with gunshot wounds, near a plantation in Beluran.</p>
      <p>In both deaths, the tusks had been removed from the animals.</p>
