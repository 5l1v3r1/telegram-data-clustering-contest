      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - A fire damaged at least one building at a World Heritage site in Japan on Monday, a fire department official said, just days after a blaze destroyed much of another Japanese World Heritage site, on its southern island of Okinawa.</p>
      <p>Monday’s fire broke out at a site featuring traditional gassho-zukuri houses in Gifu Prefecture, central Japan, a fire department official said. The houses were built hundreds of years ago and are known for their thatched roofs.</p>
      <p>The official said the fire was out and the damage was very limited.</p>
      <p>The cause was not known and the official declined to say how many buildings were damaged.</p>
      <p>Videos posted to social media showed firefighters hosing down one of the gassho-zukuri houses, which was engulfed in flames.</p>
      <p>Last week, a fire destroyed much of Shuri Castle, a World Heritage site on Japan’s southern island of Okinawa.</p>
