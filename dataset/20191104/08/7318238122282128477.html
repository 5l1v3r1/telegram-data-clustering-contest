      <h1>Vietnam arrests eight people in connection with Essex truck deaths</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:57:24+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Vietnamese authorities have made eight arrests in connection with the deaths of 39 people who were found in the back of a truck container in the UK, according to state media.</p>
      <p>This follows two arrests by Vietnam on Friday, and the questioning of several more individuals.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the state-run Vietnamese News Agency, the Nghe An province head Nguyen Huu Cau said: "Based on what we learn from the suspects, we will actively launch investigations to fight and eradicate these rings which bring people illegally to Britain."</p>
      <p>It comes after British police said last week that it believed all 39 victims were from Vietnam — an update after initially saying the victims were Chinese.</p>
      <p>The refrigerated container was discovered in an industrial estate last month after travelling from Zeebrugge, Belgium, to the British port of Purfleet.</p>
      <p>A number of Vietnamese families later came forward to say they believed their loves ones were among the victims aboard the truck.</p>

      <p>The family of 26-year-old Pham Thi Tra My told Sky News they had paid £31,000 (€36,000) for their daughter to travel to Europe for a better life.</p>
      <p>But the last they heard from her was in a series of text messages just hours before the container was found in which she apologised to her parents and said she thought she was dying.</p>
      <p>Screenshots of the messages shared on social media said: "I'm sorry Dad and Mum. The way I went overseas was not successful.</p>
      <p>"Mum, I love Dad and you so much, I'm dying because I can't breathe. Nghen, Can Loc, Ha Tinh, Vietnam. Mum, I am so sorry, Mum."</p>
      <p>Following the discovery of the bodies, the truck's 25-year-old driver, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, was arrested and charged with several offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Police have also arrested a 22-year-old, Eamonn Harrison, in Dublin, and are searching for two brothers, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of human trafficking and manslaughter.</p>
