      <p>A report on Chinese manufacturing also soothed jitters about a slowdown in the global economy.</p>
      <p>“There are concerns aplenty over the state of the world economy but hope springs eternal that a trade deal can be done,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com.</p>
      <p>Wilson added: “Noises on trade are quite positive. US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross says he’s optimistic the US and China will ink this phase one deal.”</p>
      <p>David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “Now that the Brexit chatter has cooled, the talk surrounding the UK general election has entered the fold.

The business friendly policies of the Tories have encouraged dealers to buy into sterling.”</p>
