      <h1>VICTON have a 'nostalgic night' in chic MV for comeback single</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/victon">VICTON </a>has released a new album!</p>
      <p>On November 4 at 6 PM KST, the group unveiled their fifth mini album '<b>nostalgia</b>,' featuring title track "<b>nostalgic night</b>."</p>
      <p>The album is the group's first in roughly one and a half years, and their first as a six-member unit after leader <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/seungwoo">Seungwoo </a>was placed in '<b>Produce X 101</b>'s project group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/x1">X1</a>.</p>
      <p>"nostalgic night" has a similarly vague evening mood as the group's 2018 single "<b>Time Of Sorrow</b>," paired with a powerful melody. For the music video, the members take on a more sensual, sophisticated concept, using the comeback as a way to signaling their transformation from the existing soft boyish image to a more dynamic and masculine one one.</p>
      <p>Check out the music video for "nostaglic night" above!</p>
