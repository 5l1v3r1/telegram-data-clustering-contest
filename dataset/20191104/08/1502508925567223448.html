      <h1>IndiGo says systems down across the network, operations likely to be hit</h1>
      <h2>IndiGo, owned by Interglobe Aviation Ltd, is the country's largest carrier with a nearly 50% share of the domestic market</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T08:33:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said its systems were down across the network since Monday morning, and that it expects operations at airports to be impacted as a result.</p>
      <p>"All efforts are being made to resolve the issue at the earliest," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said in a statement.</p>
      <p>IndiGo, owned by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/interglobe-aviation">Interglobe Aviation </a>Ltd, is the country's largest carrier with a nearly 50% share of the domestic market.</p>
      <p>Travellers affected by the outage took to Twitter to raise concerns.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>says systems down and huge queues till outside the main entrance gates in Mumbai T2," one user with the handle @Sathyantweets tweeted, referring to Terminal 2 at Mumbai's airport. "Chaos. No one knows when it will be resolved." IndiGo's outage comes as dozens of flights face delays or cancellations on Monday, according to reports, due to a decline in visibility because of hazardous air pollution shrouding New Delhi, home to India's busiest airport.</p>
      <p>Interglobe Aviation's shares had risen 0.3% by 1215 local time (0645 GMT) in Mumbai, while shares in rival airline SpiceJet Ltd were down 2%.</p>
