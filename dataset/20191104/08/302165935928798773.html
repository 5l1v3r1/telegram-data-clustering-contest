      <p>SRINAGAR, Nov 4 — One person died and at least 14 were injured today in a grenade attack in Indian-administered Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar, two Indian officials told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Nine people were admitted to hospital, with one still in a critical condition, after the blast on Hari Singh High Street in the centre of the city, said the officials, who declined to be named.</p>
      <p>The Muslim-majority Kashmir valley claimed by both India and Pakistan has been in turmoil since New Delhi announced it would strip the territory of its long-held autonomy and special status on August 5.</p>
      <p>India shut down the internet and arrested thousands in a historic crackdown it said was aimed at preventing unrest, while militant groups fighting its rule have attacked migrant workers from elsewhere in the country. — Reuters</p>
