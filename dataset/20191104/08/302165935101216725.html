      <p>KARBALA, Nov 4 — Three protesters were shot dead overnight during a demonstration outside the Iranian consulate in Iraq’s holy city of Karbala, the head of the forensics department there told AFP today.</p>
      <p>Security forces in Karbala fired live ammunition to disperse protesters trying to scale the walls of the consulate in the southern city and torch it.</p>
      <p>AFP correspondents witnessed protesters left motionless after suffering gunshot wounds, and the forensic medicine department later confirmed three people died.</p>
      <p>More than 250 people have lost their lives since anti-government rallies broke out in Iraq on October 1, but officials have stopped providing casualty numbers.</p>
      <p>In Karbala late yesterday, protesters hung Iraqi flags on the concrete blocks surrounding the imposing Iranian consulate and spray-painted “Karbala is free, Iran out, out!” on them.</p>
      <p>Others threw rocks or shot fireworks over the walls into the consulate, then set fire to tyres at the gates of the building as police officers looked on.</p>
      <p>As the crowds grew, heavy gunfire and volleys of tear gas rang out.</p>
      <p>“They’re not firing up in the air. They intend to kill, not disperse,” said one young protester wearing a medical mask to protect himself from the tear gas.</p>
      <p>“They’re protecting the Iranian embassy while all we want is a country. Why are they killing their own countrymen for another country?”</p>
      <p>Iraq has close but complicated ties with its eastern neighbour Iran, with whom it fought a deadly war in the 1980s but which now has significant political and economic sway in Iraq.</p>
      <p>Every year, millions of Iranian pilgrims travel to the holy city of Karbala, 100 kilometres south of Baghdad, to visit the golden-domed mausoleum of Hussein, the prophet Mohammad’s grandson.</p>
      <p>But many Iraqis protesting over the past month accuse Iran of being the primary sponsor of the corrupt, inefficient system they want to overthrow.</p>
      <p>Tehran, meanwhile, has sought to clamp down the protests next door, with sources reporting top commander Qassem Soleimani making several visits to “advise” Iraqi authorities on coping with the rallies.</p>
      <p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also slammed protests in Iraq and Lebanon as conspiracies by the US and others. — AFP</p>
