      <p>CLEVELAND — The Cleveland Browns have <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/browns/browns-cut-jermaine-whitehead-following-social-media-meltdown">cut safety Jermaine Whitehead</a> following a meltdown on social media on Sunday in which <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/browns/twitter-account-that-appears-to-belong-to-browns-safety-jermaine-whitehead-suspended-after-threats">he threatened a radio host and Browns fans</a> following the team’s <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/browns-photos/photos-cleveland-browns-fall-to-the-denver-broncos-24-19">loss to the Broncos.</a></p>
      <p>Whitehead struggled during the Browns 24-19 loss to Denver, missing multiple tackles throughout the game, one of which led to a Broncos touchdown.</p>
      <p>A few moments after the team left the field, Whitehead allegedly began responding to tweets about his play on his account, @j2whitehead_.</p>
      <p>Some of the responses contained explicit language and racial slurs.&lt;</p>

      <p>The account is not verified, but the Cleveland Browns' verified account follows the Whitehead account, and his Instagram handle, which is verified, is @j2whitehead, and in it he alludes to "getting smoke off my chest" tonight.</p>
      <p>Whitehead's post, seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4bOX6xABA5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">here,</a> contains explicit language.</p>
      <p>The Browns issued the following statement regarding the incident:</p>
      <p>"Jermaine Whitehead's social media posts following today's game were totally unacceptable and highly inappropriate. We immediately spoke with Jermaine upon learning of these comments. The Browns in no way condone that type of language or behavior. This matter will be further addressed internally."</p>
