      <p>SEOUL, Nov 4 — North Korea and the United States could hold another round of working-level talks as soon as mid-November to expedite progress before a year-end deadline set by Pyongyang, a South Korean lawmaker said today.</p>
      <p>North Korean and US officials met for the first time last month in Stockholm since US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un met and agreed in June to reopen denuclearisation talks that stalled after their failed summit in Vietnam in February.</p>
      <p>But that meeting also collapsed as the North’s envoy said the United States was not ready and failed to show flexibility.</p>
      <p>Both sides are expected to meet again no later than early December to kick-start negotiations before a year-end deadline set by Kim, South Korean lawmaker Lee Eun-jae said after attending a briefing by the National Intelligence Service (NIS).</p>
      <p>“The NIS expected the talks would resume this month or early December at the latest,” Lee told reporters.</p>
      <p>“It’s time for them to enter negotiations in earnest after checking each other’s stance in Stockholm, and there’s a deadline given by Chairman Kim.”</p>
      <p>Kim is eyeing another summit with Trump in December, Lee said. — Reuters</p>
