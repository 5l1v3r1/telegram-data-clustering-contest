A lot of features and services only require a smartphone you probably already own, while other advances can liberate people with mobility issues and disabilities.</p>
      <p>It's also big business, with a constant barrage of new wearables and fitness watches, apps and subscription services promising to make you healthier, stronger and fitter. How do you find the right device for you? How do you even start without spending a fortune?
