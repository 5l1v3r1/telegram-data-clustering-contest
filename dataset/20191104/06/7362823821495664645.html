      <h1>Greg Norman hits Tiger Woods over handwritten letter slight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T06:49:28+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 06:49</time> by <a rel="author">Edmund DeMarche</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/golf-legend-greg-norman-tiger-woods-america">Greg Norman</a> said that fellow golf legend Tiger Woods snubbed him by not responding to a handwritten letter that he personally delivered after Woods won this year's Masters Tournament.</p>
      <p>Norman, known as “The Great White Shark,” <a href="https://www.menshealth.com.au/greg-norman-mens-health-december-cover-2019">told Men’s Health</a> magazine that he does not maintain any kind of relationship with Woods, and he pointed to the goodwill gesture going unreturned.</p>
      <p>He recalled identifying himself to one of Woods' guards at his home and said, “I’ve got a note for Tiger—can you please hand-deliver it to him?’ Well, I never heard back from the guy.”</p>
      <p>Norman was recently on Fox Business and talked about the letter. He told host Stuart Varney that it essentially called Woods' return “truly impressive.”</p>
      <p>It was unclear if Woods' guard ever passed on the note. Woods has not spoken publicly about Norman's claim.</p>
      <p>Woods, 43, was praised for his first victory at Augusta National since 2005 and his first major title since 2008. He was also given the Presidential Medal of Freedom for the accomplishment.</p>
      <p>President Trump, a friend, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-tiger-woods-presidential-medal-of-freedom">said Woods was inspiring</a> and his relentless drive to win embodied "the American spirit of pushing boundaries."</p>
