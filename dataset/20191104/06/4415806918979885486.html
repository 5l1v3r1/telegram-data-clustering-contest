      <p>Kris Jenner has described rumours she had an affair with former American football player OJ Simpson as “tasteless and disgusting”.</p>
      <p>The matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner family broke down in tears when the rumours re-emerged on the anniversary of her friend Nicole Brown Simpson’s death.</p>
      <p>She was the ex-wife of Simpson. He was cleared of the 1994 murder of Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman following one of the most high-profile trials in US criminal history.</p>

      <p>Jenner has previously vehemently denied claims she had an affair with Simpson while married to the late Robert Kardashian.</p>
      <p>The rumour resurfaced in June, the anniversary of Brown Simpson’s death, with Jenner’s reaction shown during Sunday’s episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s really kind of pathetic that when rumours get started the media gives it life and breath and on the anniversary of Nicole’s death. It’s so tasteless and disgusting.</p>
      <p>“After 25 years, you’d think it just wouldn’t be a thing. It’s just lie after lie after lie after lie, and it’s only so much that one human being can take.”</p>
      <p>Jenner, 63, added: “I’m so over stupid rumours of things that never happened. I think it’s just really wrong.”</p>
      <p>She also revealed she had launched legal action against publications that carried the reports of the alleged affair.</p>
      <p>“I just think it’s really unfair to Nicole’s family, my family, for these stupid rumours to be flying around out there,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s always right there under the surface. My team has decided to take legal action because once and for all I have to do something about it.”</p>
      <p>Brown Simpson and Goldman were stabbed to death on the night of June 12 1994.</p>
      <p>Following a televised trial which transfixed the US, Simpson, now 72, was acquitted of the crime.</p>
      <p>The murder case remains unsolved.</p>
