      <p>Bouanga struck shortly before the hour to give Les Verts their third victory in four league games since former Southampton and Leicester City boss Puel took over four weeks ago.</p>

      <p>Monaco, who finished with 10 men after Ruben Aguilar was sent off two minutes into added time, dropped to 15th on 15 points.</p>
