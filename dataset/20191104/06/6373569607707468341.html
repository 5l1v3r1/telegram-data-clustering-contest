      <h1>Mothercare 'on brink of collapse' with thousands of jobs at risk</h1>
      <h2>The company has three stores across Devon and Cornwall</h2>

      <p>Mothercare is on the brink of collapse, placing 2,500 jobs at risk, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The troubled retailer is said to be ready to place the UK business into administration, which could see all stores close.</p>
      <p>The listed company is in advanced talks with lenders about fresh refinancing, according to Sky News.</p>
      <p>But the radical restricting plans would not directly affect its publicly quoted parent company, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-mothercare-plans-go-administration-20805304">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Mothercare's UK business represents only a small part of its overall group sales and is now dominated by its franchising business outside the UK.</p>
      <p>Mothercare has been trying for several months to find a buyer for its UK business.</p>

      <p>It opened its first store in the UK in 1961 in Surrey which now comprises just 79 standalone outlets.</p>
      <p>The company has around 2,500 employees who are now facing redundancy.</p>
      <p>In recent times, Mothercare has transformed itself into an international franchising group and trades from 1,000 stores in about 50 countries.</p>
      <p>The struggling retailer, which fell to a £36.3million loss last year under a controversial company voluntary arrangement (CVA).</p>

      <p>The news comes just months after Mothercare sold off its Early Learning Centre arm to The Entertainer for £13.5million.</p>
      <p>Mothercare’s UK business has been unprofitable for more than a decade, which sparked a mass of closures last year.</p>
      <p>In January,  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mothercare-sales-fall-stores-online-13831936">it warned of a "challenging period" after even digital sales at the retailer dropped 16.3%</a> .</p>
      <p>It blamed lower iPad sales led by its store closure programme as well as a smaller 'Toy offer' with less discounting.</p>
      <p>By the end of March 2019, the chain's business store count had fallen from 137 in May 2018 to 79.</p>
