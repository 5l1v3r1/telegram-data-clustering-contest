      <h1>Hong Kong: Even violent unrest fails to dampen the city's property demand</h1>
      <h2>Just a five-minute drive from Admiralty, tensions ran high as thousands of black-clad demonstrators gathered in Victoria Park chanting anti-government slogans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T06:35:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 06:35</time> by <a rel="author">Shawna Kwan | Bloomberg</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning in Admiralty on the fringes of Hong Kong’s central business district, prospective home buyers crowded the sales center for One Eighty, brochures and checkbooks in hand.</p>
      <p>Within a few hours, developer Three Tops (HK) Ltd had offloaded almost three-quarters of the 53 mainly one-bedroom units on offer, helping to push sales of new apartments over the weekend to the most since late August.</p>
      <p>The demand -- even after months of anti-government protests that have tipped Hong Kong’s economy into recession -- is testimony to the strength of the city’s real estate sector. Embattled Chief Executive Carrie Lam last month announced plans to help first-time home buyers break into what is the world’s least-affordable <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/property">property </a>market -- a move some analysts say will only send prices higher.</p>
      <p>“Demand for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/property">property </a>is still very strong,” said Sammy Po, the chief executive officer of Midland Realty <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Ltd.’s residential department. “Because of the social events, some people are saying they’ll emigrate. For those staying, they still have to buy a home.”</p>
      <p>At least 200 people were arrested and more than 70 injured over the weekend as protesters blocked roads and vandalized public facilities. Just a five-minute drive from Admiralty, tensions ran high as thousands of black-clad demonstrators gathered in Victoria Park chanting anti-government slogans. Things escalated quickly with police firing tear gas on Saturday afternoon in nearby Causeway Bay and Central, both key commercial districts.</p>
      <p>Citigroup Inc. analyst Ken Yeung said home prices that have faltered somewhat -- an indicator of secondary private residential apartments dropped for a 10th straight week last week -- will start rising again, spurred by Lam’s recent policy changes. Allowing purchasers to borrow up to 90% of a property’s value to a maximum of HK$8 million ($1 million), from HK$4 million previously, could unleash pent-up demand, he said.</p>
      <p>Rising prices will come as bad news for Hong Kong’s younger generation, many of whom have been struggling to get on the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/property">property </a>ladder. While Beijing’s encroachment on the city’s freedoms is at the heart of the protests, stratospheric home values are also fueling the anger.</p>
      <p>“It’s too easy to exceed the income cap for public housing, and at the same time, young people can’t afford” to buy a private apartment, said Kay Lee, a 25-year-old medical worker who was dressed in black at a rally in Central on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lee said even if she could afford it, she wouldn’t buy an apartment in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>because of the city’s gloomy future.</p>
      <p>“Some may consider owning a home in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/hong-kong">Hong Kong </a>the most important thing rather than freedom,” she said. “It’s just a matter of personal preference.”</p>
