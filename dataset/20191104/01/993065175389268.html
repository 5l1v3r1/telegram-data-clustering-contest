      <p>Cahill returns to sort out some unfinished business</p>
      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>The Irish News, November 4 2009: Dinny Cahill's 200-mile treks to Belfast are set to resume after his decision to accept the Antrim senior hurling manager's position for a second time.</p>
      <p>The Tipperary native previously managed the Saffrons from 2002 to 2005 and fills the post that was vacated by Terence McNaughton and Dominic McKinley in the summer.</p>
      <p>“I believe that I now have a chance to address what feels like unfinished business,” said Cahill after accepting the role.</p>
      <p>“When I first went up to Antrim, I had just finished coaching Tipperary minors and we were lucky enough to achieve All-Ireland success at that time. I was relatively inexperienced then as far as senior inter-county management was concerned.</p>
      <p>“Through my previous involvement with Antrim and, more recently, with Portumna and Graigue-Ballycallan, I have gained extensive experience to assist me in this new challenge.</p>
      <p>“With the right commitment from players, clubs and supporters in Antrim, we can build a more consistent and successful future for the county.''</p>
