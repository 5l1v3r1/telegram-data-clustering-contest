      <p>BORDEAUX: Storm winds blasted southern France on Sunday (Nov 3), whipping up giant ocean waves, uprooting trees and leaving some 140,000 people without electricity, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended hundreds of call-outs as storm Amelie brought gusts that dropped trees on roads and railway tracks and tore loose live electrical cables.</p>

      <p>No deaths have been confirmed, but a woman in her seventies was reported missing in southern Nice after a landslide.</p>
      <p>Emergency workers were searching the landslip on land overlooking her home to try to find the missing woman, an AFP journalist witnessed.</p>
      <p>In the southwest, which was worst affected, six people sustained minor injuries, mainly caused by falling branches.</p>
      <p>Early Sunday, 14 of the country's 100-odd departments had been placed on high alert as Amelie brought heavy rains to the Atlantic coast, with winds exceeding 160 kilometres per hour in places.</p>
      <p>Weather service Meteo France said winds as strong as 163 km/h were recorded in the coastal departments of Gironde and Landes, and 121 km/h in Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>Electricity supplier Enedis said it was working round the clock to restore electricity to some 140,000 customers left without power for hours.</p>
      <p>In the Landes department 47 people had to be evacuated from a camp site, and a casino roof collapsed.</p>
      <p>Several trains in the area were cancelled or delayed, after around 50 trees came down on the lines, said the rail operator SNCF.</p>
      <p>The southeast was not spared, with heavy rainfall forcing the evacuation of a travellers' camp.</p>
      <p>Around 30 motorists also had to be rescued as their cars got stuck in the deluge and several shops and homes had their basements flooded.</p>
      <p>The extreme weather forced the temporary closure of both the A7 and A21 motorways in the south of the country.</p>
      <p>Two flights were cancelled Sunday morning from Ajaccio, on Corsica, while other flights were rerouted to the island's other airport at Bastia.</p>
