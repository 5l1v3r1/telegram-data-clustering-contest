      <p>Saoirse Kennedy Hill, daughter of the Guildford Four's Paul Hill and granddaughter of Robert F Kennedy, died from an accidental drug overdose, according to her official death certificate.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was found unresponsive at the Kennedy family's Cape Cod residence in August.</p>
      <p>She was pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital.</p>
      <p>According to the Boston Herald, she had a mix of methadone, fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, diazepam, nordiazepam, and alcohol in her system at the time of her death.</p>
      <p>Fluoxetine is an antidepressant, and diazepam is used to treat anxiety and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.</p>
      <p>The compound where she was found has around six homes on Nantucket Sound in Hyannisport and famously served as President John F. Kennedy's summer White House.</p>
      <p>The Boston College student was expected to graduate in 2020.</p>
      <p>She was the only daughter of Mr Hill and Robert and Ethel Kennedy's fifth child, Courtney.</p>
      <p>Ms Kennedy Hill had written publicly about her struggles with mental health and a suicide attempt in a 2016 opinion piece for the Deerfield Scroll, the student newspaper for the Deerfield Academy boarding school in Massachusetts.</p>
