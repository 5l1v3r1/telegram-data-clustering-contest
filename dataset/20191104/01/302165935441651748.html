      <p>BERLIN, Nov 4 — Borussia Dortmund and their under-fire coach Lucien Favre hope to maintain the ‘feel-good’ factor from back-to-back wins as they chase Champions League revenge at home to Inter Milan tomorrow.</p>
      <p>A below-par performance saw Dortmund crash to a 2-0 defeat in Milan nearly a fortnight ago, sparking reports Jose Mourinho was waiting in the wings to replace Favre unless results improved, which the club subsequently denied.</p>
      <p>The German media piled into Favre after forward Lautaro Martinez give Inter a first-half lead, then had a late penalty saved, before winger Antonio Candreva raced clear to seal Dortmund’s defeat at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Dortmund were short of ideas against a water-tight defence and only Roman Burki’s fine save from Martinez’s penalty attempt prevented a rout.</p>
      <p>However, Dortmund have since improved.</p>
      <p>A goalless draw at Schalke last weekend was backed-up by dumping Bundesliga leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach out of the German Cup in midweek before trouncing Wolfsburg 3-0 on Saturday in the league.</p>
      <p>With one eye on Inter, Favre said it was “nice to see” his side has broken their habit of conceding late goals amidst nervous defending.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Joy element</b>
      </p>
      <p>“In the end, there was almost an element of joy back in our game again,” enthused sports director Michael Zorc.</p>
      <p>Now Favre needs a win over Antonio Conte’s Inter to get Dortmund’s Group F campaign back on track and maintain confidence with a crunch Bundesliga tie at Bayern Munich looming on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Both Inter and Dortmund come into tomorrow’s tie level on four points from three games, each with a win, a defeat and draw.</p>
      <p>Dortmund must repeat the rock-solid defending in their goalless draw at home to Barcelona in September to contain Inter’s attack and Saturday’s win over Wolfsburg suggests confidence is high.</p>
      <p>“We played at a higher tempo, were better between the lines. The combinations worked better and we created a lot of goals,” insisted Favre.</p>
      <p>For once, there were no whistles of displeasure from home fans, no awkward post-match questions and no frustrated out-bursts from players, as in previous weeks due to Dortmund’s habit of leaking late goals.</p>
      <p>“The fun is back again”, stated midfielder Julian Weigl.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s home win was also a timely confidence booster for goal-scorers Thorgan Hazard, who bagged his first goal since joining from Gladbach, and Mario Goetze, who converted a late penalty after starting most games this season on the bench.</p>
      <p>“I could have scored two or three goals, my first goal at home is a good feeling for the head,” beamed Hazard.</p>
      <p>However, the news is not all good for Favre.</p>
      <p>Chief playmaker and Germany star Marco Reus, who also missed the away defeat in Milan, limped off in the first-half on Saturday and is doubtful with a knock to the foot.</p>
      <p>Both clubs meet at Signal Iduna Park second in their respective league’s after Inter’s burly Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku scored twice in Saturday’s 2-1 win at Bologna to leave his side a point behind Juventus in Serie A.</p>
      <p>Despite two wins inside a week, Dortmund must take three points at home to Inter to calm fears of a group stage exit.</p>
      <p>“Now Favre has to win,” demanded Germany’s top-selling daily <i>Bild</i>, especially with group leaders Barcelona at home to bottom side Slavia Prague tomorrow. — AFP</p>
