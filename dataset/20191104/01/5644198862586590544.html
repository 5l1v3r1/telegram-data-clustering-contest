      <p>NEW YORK: Geoffrey Kamworor and Joyciline Jepkosgei sealed a double victory for Kenya at the New York Marathon on Sunday (Nov 3), storming to convincing wins in the men's and women's races at the annual showpiece.</p>
      <p>Kamworor, the 2017 New York champion, pulled clear in the closing stages to take the tape in Central Park 2hr 8min 13sec.</p>

      <p>Jepkosgei, making her debut over the distance, had earlier beaten compatriot and defending champion Mary Keitany with a time of 2:22:38, the second fastest time in New York history.</p>

      <p>Keitany, who had been chasing a remarkable fifth New York title, finished in second place after a thrilling battle with the less experienced Jepkosgei.</p>
      <p>The two women had been part of a three-pronged breakaway that led from around the 12-mile mark alongside Ethiopia's Ruti Aga.</p>
      <p>That trio remained out in front as they advanced into Manhattan at mile 16, although Keitany gave the first clue she was struggling after appearing to vomit.</p>
      <p>Keitany and Jepkosgei started edging away from Aga by mile 20 and soon the Ethiopian had been dropped from contention.</p>
      <p>Jepkosgei then made her move in mile 23, rapidly putting daylight between herself and Keitany and opening up a 16-second lead heading down the stretch.</p>
      <p>Heading into the final mile Jepkosgei grimaced as she dug in for victory, glancing over her shoulder to check the presence of Keitany.</p>
      <p>Keitany looked comfortable but by that stage had left herself too much work to do and Jepkosgei closed out a superb win, just missing out on Margaret Okayo's 2003 course record of 2hr 22min 31sec.</p>
      <p>"I knew Mary had more experience in marathon, so I was trying to push," a delighted Jepkosgei said after the win.</p>
      <p>The men's race had followed a similar pattern, with Kamworor judging his moment to perfection to pull away from Albert Korir over the closing stages and take first in 2:08:13.</p>
      <p>Kamworor, Korir and Ethiopia's Tamirat Tola had broken away from the field at the 21-mile mark.</p>
      <p>Tola, who had looked comfortable throughout, quickly fell away however, leaving Kamworor and Korir to battle it out.</p>
      <p>Kamworor's finishing speed was too much for Korir however and when the 26-year-old made his move at around the 24-mile mark, Korir was unable to respond.</p>
      <p>Korir eventually finished second in 2:08:36 ahead of Ethiopia's Girma Bekele Gebre, who took third place in 2:08:38.</p>
      <p>"I was feeling okay, very comfortable and I was ready for everything," Kamworor said afterwards.</p>
      <p>"The last few miles the race was so fast. But I was able to go and was feeling strong and that's when I decided to go away," he added.</p>
      <p>But there was disappointment for Ethiopia's defending champion Lelisa Desisa, who was making an improbable attempt to win back-to-back titles just 29 days after winning marathon gold at the World Championships in Doha last month.</p>
      <p>Desisa hit the front early on but looked to be clearly struggling, eventually withdrawing after seven miles.</p>
