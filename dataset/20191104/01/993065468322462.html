      <p>A CARPET business in west Belfast has been extensively damaged in a "despicable" arson attack in the early hours of yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>The blaze took place at Glendale Carpets and Flooring on Kennedy Way just before 12.45am.</p>
      <p>Four pumping appliances, an aerial appliance and a command support vehicle attended.</p>
      <p>NIFRS group commander Philip Martin said there was a "well-developed fire" when firefighters arrived and that part of the roof had collapsed.</p>
      <p>He said the fire was contained to the carpet warehouse but that some neighbouring businesses in the single storey building sustained smoke damage.</p>
      <p>The Fire Service, who were aided by a gas company and NI Water, remained at the scene until after 11am damping down the area.</p>
      <p>Kennedy Way was closed between the Andersonstown Road junction and the Glen Road junction for several hours.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Tom Phillips described it as a "despicable attack, which will undoubtedly have a severe impact on the businesses affected".</p>
      <p>He appealed to anyone with information to phone detectives on 101, quoting reference 95 of 03/11/19, or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a woman escaped injury in a house in Co Derry on Friday afternoon after her neighbours raised the alarm and helped her to safety.</p>
      <p>Police said they received a report around 12.50pm that a house and garage in Manor Court in Kilrea were alight.</p>
      <p>Both were extensively damaged and a vehicle parked at the front of the house was completely destroyed.</p>
      <p>Enquiries are continuing to establish the cause of the blaze.</p>
