      <h1>'There is a serious problem': German city declares 'Nazi emergency'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T01:19:19+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 01:19</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>City councilors in the German city of Dresden declared a "Nazi emergency" because of the growing influence of "right-wing" extremism.</p>
      <p>"The word 'Nazinotstand' is an exaggerated formulation for the fact that there is a serious problem — similar to the climate emergency — with right-wing extremism right up to the middle of society," Max Aschenbach, councilor in the city, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/02/europe/nazi-emergency-dresden-grm-intl/index.html">told</a> CNN on Sunday. "For years, politicians have failed to position themselves clearly and unequivocally against the right-wing extremists, and to outlaw them."</p>
      <p>Aschenbach said the declaration carried no legal authority but was meant for symbolic purposes.</p>
      <p>The center-right Christian Democrat Union party voted against the resolution, and a representative for the party said the resolution was meant to cause "provocation."</p>
      <p>"The choice of words in the title of the application does not do justice to the realities in our city: the vast majority of Dresdeners are neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic," Jan Donhauser, a chairman for the party on the council, said.</p>
      <p>The resolution comes as right-wing parties gain momentum in Germany with the Alternative for Deutschland party becoming the first right-wing party to be a part of the German parliament in the last 50 years.</p>
      <p>Dresden is a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50266955">stronghold</a> in the country for the AfD, and they have a history of neo-Nazi groups holding rallies there.</p>
