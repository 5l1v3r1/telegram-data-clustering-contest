      <p>Andy Murray and his wife Kim are celebrating the birth of a baby boy.</p>
      <p>It is the 32-year-old tennis star's third child with Andy and Kim already parents to girls Sophia, three and Edie, two.</p>
      <p>The family's latest addiction was born last week but the couple have only now told their friends that they have had wee boy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10272213/andy-murray-kim-son-birth/">Sun says</a> the baby was born at a hospital in London.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-wife-kim-celebrate-20805564">The Mirror</a> reports that it isn't yet known the name the couple have decided to pick for the baby .</p>
      <p>Andy's grandfather Roy Erskine, 88, told the Sun: "It's a wee boy.</p>
      <p>"He was born during the week, I don't know what his name is yet. My wife is away down, she went down this morning."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-murray">Andy</a> recently joked after winning the European Open that he needed to get back to touring as his family is getting 'out of control'.</p>
      <p>"I've got two young kids and a third one coming. I'll have three kids under four years old," he said.</p>
      <p>"When I've been off the tour the last few years my family has got bigger.</p>
      <p>"I need to get on the road so we're done before it gets out of control!</p>
      <p>"I'm excited for the third kid. My wife has been a huge support in getting me back on the court.</p>
      <p>"She's helped me fight to keep playing."</p>
