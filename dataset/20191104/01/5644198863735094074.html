      <p>NEW DELHI: Bangladesh ended their 20-overs jinx against India after Mushfiqur Rahim's unbeaten half-century helped secure their seven-wicket victory in the first Twenty20 International on Sunday (Nov 3).</p>
      <p>Their bowlers laid the platform for a memorable victory against their mighty neighbours by restricting India to 148-6 at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.</p>

      <p>Mushfiqur, dropped in the deep on 38, made 60 not out and featured in a crucial partnership with Soumya Sarkar as Bangladesh finally humbled India in this format at the ninth attempt.</p>
      <p>Rajkot hosts the second Twenty20 of the three-match series on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, touring captain Mahmudullah elected to field after winning the toss ending speculation about the match being scrapped because of Delhi's notorious smog.</p>
      <p>Air pollution in New Delhi and surrounding towns reached the worst levels so far this year on Sunday, with authorities having already declared a public health emergency and ordered the closure of schools.</p>
      <p>Home captain Rohit Sharma hit a couple of boundaries before falling in the first over from Shafiul Islam.</p>
      <p>Frontline batsmen KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer both looked comfortable but could not convert the starts they got.</p>
      <p>A subdued Shikhar Dhawan (41) hit his first six in the 15th over but was run out just when his team wanted him to accelerate.</p>
      <p>Rishabh Pant made 27 and India milked 30 runs from the last two overs but they still settled for a sub-150 total against Bangladesh's eight-bowler attack.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh lost Liton Das in the first over but Mohammad Naim and Soumya kept them on course with a 46-run stand.</p>
      <p>Yuzvendra Chahal removed Naim but Soumya (39) and Mushfiqur effectively killed off the contest with their 60-run stand.</p>
      <p>Skipper Mahmudullah pulled debutant Shivam Dube for a six to seal a memorable victory for his team.</p>
