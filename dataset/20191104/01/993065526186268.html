        <b>HOW DOES IT FEEL TO RETURN FOR A SECOND SERIES?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was so exciting as an actor to go back and play a character for the second time. I've never done that before! Alyssa is like my best friend, I'm really proud of her and I love playing her. I love doing this job.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DO YOU RELATE TO ALYSSA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I relate to being misunderstood in the way that she is. I will have an answer for everybody, and I will be able to speak to everybody. I can say exactly what comes into my head and be free of insecurity from that. I probably do come across like a very confident person – I can articulate the way that I feel.</p>
      <p>But really, I can also be the complete opposite of that, which I think is what a lot of seemingly confident people feel. I loved that being put more into the second series.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WAS IT EASY TO SLIP BACK INTO CHARACTER?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was weirdly easier than I thought. It was so strange. I read the first four episodes when I was doing a Harold Pinter play. I found that really hard and I didn't massively enjoy it. And so, when I read this, I was like, 'Thank god!'</p>
      <p>I don't like to feel like I'm acting, and it felt like what was required from that particular play was complete acting.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT HAPPENS TO ALYSSA IN SERIES TWO?</b>
      </p>
      <p>She's dealing with the possibility of James not being in her life – the removal of something really amazing that happened to her, at the same time as processing the trauma of that.</p>
      <p>A lot of people forget James was protecting her from a sexual predator. The series also explores what that felt like to Alyssa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>NAOMI ACKIE JOINS THE CAST AS BONNIE. WHAT'S HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ALYSSA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Women don't always like each other. Everybody constantly wants to show women supporting each other, but it's why Alyssa is brilliant and why I enjoy playing her – she is an extremely flawed character.</p>
      <p>It's great seeing her and Bonnie together – it's really funny, because they don't have anything in common with each other.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHY DO FANS LOVE THE SHOW?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think that people had never seen a TV show like The End Of The F***ing World before.</p>
      <p>It's very retro in the way that it looks. The way that music is used like a character as well, and a lot of really great TV shows that have stood the test of time have a fantastic soundtrack.</p>
      <p>The Channel 4 release date was at the beginning of a very infamous period with the Time's Up stuff. People wanted to see a vulnerable male character, they wanted to see a strong female character.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE SHOW WAS NOMINATED FOR A BAFTA, HOW DID THAT FEEL?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I never thought I would be in a Bafta-nominated TV show playing a character like Alyssa, no way!</p>
      <p>I haven't always found it the easiest being an actress. I didn't know what type of career I was going to have; I couldn't see an example of me in the industry. I've never had a career I can follow, because I never could see myself in any other actors.</p>
      <p>But, at the same time, what the industry does do really well here - and Bafta do it in all their schemes - is try and move with the times. And I think it was reflected a lot with our nomination.</p>
      <p>
