      <p>Adobe Photoshop is <a href="https://thenextweb.com/apple/2019/11/04/adobe-photoshop-finally-arrives-on-the-ipad/">now available for iPads</a>. From a report:<i> The release follows an official announcement at Adobe's MAX event last year. The app is free to download and use for 30 days, but you'll need a Creative Cloud subscription to continue using it after that. If you already have a subscription for Adobe's desktop apps that covers Photoshop, you should be good to go -- you just need to log in with your paid account credentials. The app has full support for Apple Pencil, and lets you work on full PSD files -- layers and all. The company has also modified oft-used Photoshop functions for touchscreen interfaces, such as quick selection and paintbrush.</i></p>
