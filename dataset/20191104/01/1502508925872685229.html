      <p>Disaster doesn’t come all of a sudden</p>
      <p>Whether it’s tackling bank failure or pollution, there is nothing better than seeing the smoke signals. If we can’t, the fate of TV channels awaits us — a loss of credibility. <i><b>Uddalok Bhattacharya</b></i> sums up</p>
      <p>A lesson from Pakistan – the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/electronic-media">electronic media </a>regulator there has ruled that anchors during TV discussions must restrict themselves to being moderator. Karan Thapar looks at the <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAaYej">big picture</a></p>
      <p>Time is running out for Lakshmi Vilas Bank, <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAaYeY">says</a> <b>Tamal Bandyapadhyay</b>.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it needs a white knight</p>
      <p>Banks, exchange-traded funds, and jewellers can get into some arrangement on gold deposit schemes, but regulation can hobble the process. <b>Ajay Shah</b> <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAb2Dj">explains</a>.</p>
      <p>Stubble burning is not the only source of <a href="https://mybs.in/2XAb2Dn">pollution</a>, says <b>Sunita Narain</b>. Sources are present throughout the year but we do not feel their impact in hotter months.</p>
