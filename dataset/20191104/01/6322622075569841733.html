      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): Foreign buying of local equities on Bursa Malaysia shrank to RM55.2 million last week, from RM302.4 million net in the preceding week, according to MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd Research.</p>
      <p>In his weekly fund flow report today, MIDF Research’s Adam M Rahim said support came from the rally on Wall Street overnight with the S&amp;P 500 index hitting a record high amidst positive signs of trade talks and better-than-expected corporate earnings.</p>
      <p>“Foreign net buying activity took a breather on Wednesday as international funds disposed [of] RM18.2 million net ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision.</p>
      <p>“Risk-on sentiment was also dampened by fresh concerns on the 'phase one' trade deal between the US and China which may not be ready for signing in mid-November 2019,” he said.</p>
      <p>Adam said the level of foreign net selling then accelerated substantially to hit RM117.7 million on Thursday following the third rate cut by the US Federal Reserve.</p>
      <p>He said regional peers such as Thailand and Indonesia also saw foreign net outflow on the same day but at a stronger momentum.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Adam said foreign investors made a comeback on Friday, accumulating RM51.7 million net of local equities.</p>
      <p>“Investors cheered the better-than-expected China manufacturing data in October 2019 which was the highest in almost three years with new orders rising at the quickest pace since January 2013.</p>
      <p>“The month of October 2019 saw a total foreign net outflow of RM484.6 million, the second lowest monthly foreign net outflow so far for the year,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Adam said on a year-to-date basis, foreign funds have taken out RM8.38 billion of local equities from Malaysia, making up 72% of last year’s total foreign outflow of RM11.69 billion.</p>
      <p>He said in terms of participation, foreign investors saw the largest increase in average daily traded value (ADTV) of 28.9% to reach the RM1 billion mark.</p>
