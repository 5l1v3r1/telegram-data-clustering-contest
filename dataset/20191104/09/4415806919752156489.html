      <p>A Dublin hotel, that has been shut for close to a decade, has been bought by an Austrian investor.</p>
      <p>TMR Hotel Collection announced today that it had acquired the 186-bedroom Tallaght Cross Hotel.</p>
      <p>They say they are planning a "multi-million euro refurbishment" of the hotel and plan to open it as a four-star hotel in early 2020.</p>
      <p>TMR Hotel Collection said the opening will create 70 jobs and it is the third hotel purchase by the group this year.</p>
      <p>In May it acquired two four-star hotels; the Plaza Hotel in Tallaght and Harvey’s Point in Donegal.</p>
      <p>They said in a statement that: "Acquisition and investment expenditure in these 3 hotels will be close to €60m."</p>
      <p>Eimear Fox, Director of TMR Hotel Collection, said: "We are delighted to have completed the purchase of Tallaght Cross Hotel which we expect to re-open in early 2020 creating over 70 permanent jobs.</p>
      <p>"Over the coming months we will implement a multi-million euro investment programme at our Tallaght Cross and Plaza Tallaght hotels which we see as a major vote of confidence in the area and a substantial boost to tourism and the local economy."</p>
