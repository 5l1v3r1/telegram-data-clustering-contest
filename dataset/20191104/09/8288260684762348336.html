      <p>A major police investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in water at the side of a road in Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>Emergency crews – including the Midlands Air Ambulance – were called to Dirtyfoot Lane, Lower Penn, after the grisly discovery at around 1.30pm on Saturday, November 2.</p>
      <p>Nothing could be done to save the woman and she was confirmed dead at the scene, a spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service confirmed.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The rural road was closed for more than 24 hours as forensic officers from Staffordshire Police scoured the scene for clues.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: “We were called to Dirtyfoot Lane, Wolverhampton, to reports of a woman in the water.</p>
      <p>“Two ambulances, two paramedic officers, a community first responder and the Midlands Air Ambulance was sent to the scene.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“On arrival, crews quickly found it apparent that nothing could be done to save the patient and she was pronounced dead at the scene.”</p>
      <p>Staffordshire Police has still yet to release anything official on the incident.</p>
