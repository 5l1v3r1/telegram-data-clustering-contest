      <h1>Netflix fans can't get enough of Robert Pattinson's accent in The King</h1>
      <h2>Historical epic The King hit Netflix last week and Robert Pattinson is the subject of many a meme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:05:27+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>He may be the new Batman, but Robert Pattinson is generating some conversation for his role in The King.</p>
      <p>Directed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-michod">David Michod</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> historical drama The King follows the trials and tribulations of wayward prince turned stern English monarch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/henry-v">Henry V</a> ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/timothee-chalamet">Timothee Chalamet</a> ).</p>
      <p>The new ruler soon finds himself in a very tense political stand-off with the heir to the French throne, the Dauphin ( <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/robert-pattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> ), prompting Henry to venture to France to wage war against his new foe.</p>
      <p>However, when Henry and the Dauphin come face to face, things get very tense, but not for fans at home, who had one thing on their minds: Robert Pattinson doing a very strong French accent.</p>
      <p>Naturally, viewers took to Twitter to air their reactions to his dulcet tones.</p>

      <p>One viewer wrote: "Robert Pattinson's fake french accent in The King is hilarious. I can't."</p>
      <p>Another said: "i loved the king. i love robert pattinsons goofy ass french accent. good nite"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, one referenced RPatz's Twilight past: "Robert Pattinson as the dauphin in 'The King' is hilarious. What is this French accent? He also looks like he should be one of the Volturi, finally."</p>
      <p>One fan noted: "Timothée Chalamet was brilliant in 'The King' but the highlight had to be Robert Patterson's French accent"</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "I honestly don't know how any of the actors kept a straight face while Robert Pattinson talked about big balls and a tiny c**k with his French accent LOL. He was perfect as the Dauphin. another scene stealer. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thekingnetflix">#thekingnetflix</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23theking">#theking</a> "</p>
      <p>Finally, one said: "Little known fact, Robert Pattinson's French accent in The King is based on René from Allo! Allo!"</p>
      <p>Well, it was certainly a highlight!</p>
