      <p>Cape Town – Rob Kardashian stepped out over the weekend to attend Kendall Jenner’s birthday party – and fans can’t get enough of how good the most private Kardashian is looking.</p>
      <p>Kendall turned 24, but hosted a big bash days before at Blind Dragon nightclub in West Hollywood, reports <a href="https://people.com/style/kendall-jenner-star-studded-halloween-party/"><b>People</b></a>. And in a photograph posted on Instagram by Kylie, though Rob’s wearing an oversized hoodie, he’s looking happy and healthy with a jawline sharp enough to make you swoon.</p>
      <p>And fans did!</p>
      <p>One user commented, "Oh my god, my man is back!" while another wrote, "Rob looks so good," complete with an in-love emoji.</p>
      <p>"He looks amazing, this makes me so happy," said another user, while others added a flame emoji commenting, "Rob looking fya."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/shows/kardashians/news/1088913/see-the-first-new-photo-of-rob-kardashian-in-more-than-a-year"><b>E! News</b></a>, Rob hasn’t been photographed, or rather, hasn’t posted a photo of himself, in more than a year. But before the party, he also shared a picture of himself next to mom, Kris Jenner, on Halloween. Again, he looks “fya” wearing apparel from his Halfway Dead streetwear line.</p>
