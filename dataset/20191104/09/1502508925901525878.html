      <p>Asserting that "Make in India" has become "Buy from China", Congress leader <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rahul-gandhi">Rahul Gandhi </a>on Monday hit out at the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rcep">RCEP </a>and alleged that the proposed free trade deal will flood the country with cheap goods, resulting in millions of job losses and crippling the economy.</p>
      <p>Gandhi's takedown of the proposed trade agreement came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Bangkok where negotiations for the long-overdue Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was heading towards finality.</p>
      <p>"'Make in India' has become 'Buy from China'. Each year we import Rs. 6,000 worth of goods from China for every Indian! A 100 per cent increase since 2014," the former Congress chief said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rcep">RCEP </a>will flood India with cheap goods, resulting in millions of job losses &amp; crippling the Indian economy," Gandhi said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>His remarks come two days after Congress president Sonia Gandhi launched a blistering attack on the government's economic policies and said signing the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rcep">RCEP </a>agreement will deal a "body blow" to the economy, resulting in "untold hardship" for farmers, shopkeepers and small enterprises.</p>
      <p>The proposed free-trade agreement includes 10 member-countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) and six of the bloc's dialogue partners China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The possible delay in firming up the RCEP during the three-day Asean summit in Bangkok has been attributed to India's demands on market access and tariff-related issues. Hardball negotiations to address sticky issues went down to the wire on Sunday, with India holding on to its demand for amicable resolution of its demands.</p>
