      <p>LONDON (Nov 4): Euro zone factory activity contracted sharply last month as demand was again whacked by a trade war being waged by the United States and by the continued lack of clarity over Britain’s departure from the European Union, a survey showed.</p>
      <p>IHS Markit’s final manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was 45.9, barely above September’s seven-year low reading of 45.7 and its ninth month below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.</p>
      <p>An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good barometer of economic health, rose to 46.6 from September’s near seven-year low of 46.1.</p>
      <p>“Euro zone manufacturing remained stuck in its steepest decline for seven years in October, meaning the goods producing sector is on course to act as a severe drag on GDP again in the fourth quarter,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.</p>
      <p>“Geopolitical concerns, ranging from Brexit to U.S. trade policy, continue to create uncertainty, further dampening demand both at home and in export markets.”</p>
      <p>An index measuring new orders rose to 45.3 from 43.4 but spent its 13th straight month below the breakeven mark.</p>
      <p>Other forward-looking indicators in the survey suggest there won’t be any turnaround soon, despite factories cutting their prices for a fourth month in October.</p>
