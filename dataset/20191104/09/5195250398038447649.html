      <h3>A fleeting glimpse of the car suggests that major design cues have been derived from the soon to be launched Altroz premium hatchback</h3>
      <p>With the unveiling of its premium hatchback Altroz slated for next month, Tata Motors is planning to give a facelift to its entire line-up by in 2020. In the same breath, the Tata Tiago was recently spotted with heavy disguise and a fair bit of tweaks as against the current model.</p>
      <p>The production-ready model comes with a host of changes in the front fascia. A fleeting glimpse of the car suggests that major design cues have been derived from the soon-to-be-launched Altroz premium hatchback. The car will come with a new headlight. The lower part will get horizontal slats while the upper part is a meshed grille.</p>
      <p>On the side, the car inherits the same silhouette. However, a little chrome treatment is expected in the new car that will be present around the handlebars and ORVMs. And also new will be the alloy wheel set up.</p>

      <p>At the rear, the car gets a few subtle changes such as a restyled bumper. Also new could be a rearview camera that the current version misses out on. Additionally, the taillights have been tweaked as well.</p>
      <p>On the inside, we can expect new upholstery with contrasting stitching. Also speculated are soft-touch materials and updated plastics and a refreshed cabin. A while back, Tata silently introduced digital instrument clusters in the higher variants of the Tiago and Tigor, which could be a standard offering in the new version.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the car is expected to be powered by the same 1.2-litre, four-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol motor. However, the company had earlier said that the 1.05-litre turbocharged diesel engine would be axed out due to high charge of upgradation. The petrol engine will be tuned to BS6 compliant and the current one churns out a total of 84 bhp with 114 Nm of peak torque. Transmission is limited to a 5-speed manual gearbox and AMT.</p>
