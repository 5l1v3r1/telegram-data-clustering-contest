      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/troon-fc">Troon</a> boss Jonathan Baillie says he fears the sack after they lost again in the league. </p>
      <p>The Seasiders only have two wins in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-junior-football-association">league football</a> this season and haven't yet won a game away from home.</p>
      <p>Another loss to newly promoted Rossvale extended that run, with Baillie saying he'd understand if the Portland Park board pulled the trap door. </p>
      <p>"Absolutely there's worry, we are getting beat every week. </p>
      <p>"We've lost three on the spin in the league... I've got to be under pressure we are down at the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>"If the club feel the need to make a change then that's fine, I'm not going to have any complaints, the results speak for themselves."</p>
      <p>After a lacklustre first-half the game sprung to life in the second when the seagulls had a goal ruled out.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>John Gemmell headed Ryan Stevenson's corner in, however it was judged as offside.</p>
      <p>A decision Baillie was bemused with, saying everyone in the ground thought Gemmell was onside.</p>
      <p>"The linesman was the only person in the whole ground that thought he was offside.</p>
      <p>"None of their players appealed, they all were saying he's on a mile and so was the manager." </p>
      <p>Minutes after that chance Troon went down to 10 men, new signing from Linlithgow Rose Ross Barbour seeing his second yellow. </p>
      <p>It went from bad to worse for Troon when Del McNab tucked in a rebound after Scott Johnstone spilled a shot.  </p>
      <p>The result extends ‘Vale’s winning streak to six consecutive games, four of those coming in the league and the other two in the Scottish Junior Cup.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>New Rossvale boss David Gormley has an excellent record winning all his games since taking over in September following the departure of Gordon Moffat to Clydebank.</p>
      <p>However, despite their fantastic form he says their goal is still just to stay up.</p>
      <p>"When I took over we were bottom of the league, it was a hard task but the aspiration was to stay in the league.</p>
      <p>“If we stay in the league you are playing against the likes of Pollok, Auchinleck and Kilwinning the big teams who you want to be playing against.</p>
      <p>"So our focus is still the league and any type of cup run would be good.”</p>
