      <p>Ah, do you smell that? It smells like <s>teen</s> Christmas spirit, because guess what, y’all—we are now only a month away from the biggest holiday of the year! And of course, with the imminent arrival of Christmas comes delightful (yet dreadful) <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g2401/gifts-under-5/">gift shopping</a>, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a49543/how-to-handle-awkward-family-situations/">spending time with loved ones (who you secretly hate)</a>, and, lest we forget, eating all the food (until you’re incapacitated)!</p>
      <p>To properly prepare yourself for the holidays, you've got to watch alllll the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g25226076/christmas-and-holiday-tv-episodes/">festive television</a> there is to be watched. Which is why your favorite country darling Kacey Musgraves is now dabbling into the realm of holiday programming. No, she isn’t producing her very own <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/movies/a29501295/hallmark-holiday-movie-guide/">Hallmark movie</a> (although I would SO watch), she’s making a Christmas show!</p>

      <h3>First of all, how can I watch The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show?</h3>
      <p>If you happen to do all your clothing and gift shopping via Amazon Prime, I have good news for you! You’ll already be signed up for Amazon Prime Video, which is where the special will be available for streaming.</p>
      <p>Don’t have Prime? Don’t worry—all you gotta do is sign up for Amazon Prime’s 30-day free trial to watch it, but of course, make sure to cancel it afterward if you don’t want to be charged a formal subscription fee. And while you’re signed up for the free Prime trial, you might as well knock out your Xmas shopping and take advantage of the free two-day package delivery. Win-win!</p>
      <h3>When will the show air?</h3>
      <p>Mark your calendars, kiddos—<i>The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</i> will be airing November 29...aka the day after Thanksgiving, so you’ll have plenty of time to recover from your multiple food-induced comas in time to watch.</p>

      <h3>Who’s going to be on the show?</h3>
      <p>EVERYONE. Just kidding, but for all intents and purposes, the people who will be guest-starring and/or performing might as well be called everyone because they are Just. That. Talented. We have Kacey, who will be acting as the ringleader, but there will also be appearances from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Camila Cabello</li>
        <li>Lana del Rey</li>
        <li>Troye Sivan</li>
        <li>Kendall Jenner</li>
        <li>Leon Bridges</li>
        <li>James Corden</li>
        <li>Zooey Deschanel</li>
        <li>Fred Armisen</li>
        <li>Dan Levy</li>
        <li>The Radio City Rockettes</li>
        <li>and Kacey’s grandmother, Nana!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So it kinda goes without saying that it will be lit AF, no pun intended.</p>
