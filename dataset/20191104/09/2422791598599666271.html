      <p>MADRID -- The parent company of British Airways and Iberia has agreed to buy Spanish rival Air Europa for 1 billion euros (US$1.1 billion).</p>
      <p>In a statement released Monday, the International Airlines Group, or IAG, says the purchase will be completed by the end of 2020 if competition regulators approve it.</p>
      <p>IAG expects the purchase to turn its Madrid base into "a true rival" to Europe's main air travel hubs in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris.</p>
      <p>The statement says that by taking control of Air Europa the group also expects to lead flights between Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>Air Europa operates 66 aircraft to 69 destinations in and outside of Spain. As one of the world's largest airline groups, IAG flies to 268 destinations with 573 airplanes.</p>
