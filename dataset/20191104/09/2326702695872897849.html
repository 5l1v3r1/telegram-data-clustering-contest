      <p>I’m sure many of our readers build their own <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/pc/">PCs</a>, but I bet not all of you did. There are many perfectly good reasons to go pre-built. You get guaranteed component compatibility, as well as a warranty on the whole system. Someone builds it for you, obviously, which can be a big benefit if you’re a busy person. Sourcing, taking delivery of all the components, and building a system can be rewarding, but it can be time-consuming too; not everyone wants to do that.</p>
      <h3>DinoPC Cryolos</h3>
      <p>There’s also cost too. Many times we’ve seen pre-built systems actually coming in cheaper than a self-build of the same specifications. That’s not always true though, but when you factor in the warranty, software bundles, etc, it can often be extremely competitive. Of course, that’s where <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/dinopc/">DinoPC</a> step in today. We’ve got one of their custom-built AMD Ryzen gaming PCs in for review!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AMD Ryzen 7 3800X processor</li>
        <li>Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 16GB DDR4 3000mhz RAM</li>
        <li>ASUS TUF Gaming X3 Radeon RX 5700 XT OC</li>
        <li>Samsung 970 EVO 250GB M.2 NVMe SSD</li>
        <li>2TB SATA 3 HDD</li>
        <li>ASUS ROG STRIX B450-I Gaming Motherboard</li>
        <li>Windows 10 Home</li>
        <li>Corsair Crystal Series 280X RGB Tempered Glass Micro ATX Case – White</li>
        <li>RM750x 750W PSU</li>
        <li>Corsair K55+ Harpoon RGB Keyboard and Mouse</li>
        <li>5-year warranty</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features &amp; Specifications</h3>
      <p>Our system features the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/amd">AMD</a> Ryzen 3800X, one of the best gaming CPUs on the market today! Not only that, but DinoPC has overclocked the CPU to 4.2GHz, which should give it an edge in just about any benchmark. That’s fitted to the fantastic <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/asus/">ASUS</a> RoG STRIX B450-I Gaming mini-ITX motherboard, with an ASUS STRIX Radeon RX 5700 XT doing the graphics heavy-lifting. That’s a pretty fantastic combo that should smash through the latest games at 1440p.</p>
      <p>It’s all built in a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/corsair/">Corsair</a> Crystal 280X, crammed full of a Corsair RGB fans and a Corsair white 240mm AIO for an ultra-clean look. On top of that, you also have an included bundle of the Corsair K55 keyboard and Harpoon RGB gaming mouse. AMD/Corsair/ASUS come together in one neat package; this should be pretty fantastic!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_092003-1-880x545.jpg"/>

      <h3>What DinoPC Had to Say</h3>
      <blockquote>“The Cryolos Gaming PC is a clean and bright build that showcases the latest AMD RX5700 graphics card, and Ryzen 7 3800X processor, all contained in the sharp Corsair Crystal Series 280X case. The RGB lighting is easy on the eye, with the fans, motherboard, and RAM all providing more subtle experience. It all comes together to form a clean and stylish gaming PC that you’ll definitely want to be the centre of attention.” – <a href="https://www.dinopc.com/custom-pc/extreme-pc/cryolos-amd-extreme-pc">DinoPC</a></blockquote>
      <h3>The Exterior</h3>
      <p>Firstly, the DinoPC Cryolos really does look fantastic. I’ve got the window off the side here you can clearly see inside. Of course, I’ll show it with the glass back on in a few moments when we fire up the RGB lighting. The Corsair Crystal series is by far one of the favourites. The 280X is especially stunning, and in white, even more so. It’s certainly a case worthy of having up on top of your desk, and even more so with what DinoPC have done on the interior.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093525-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While the case does feature plenty of RGB lighting, they’ve kept the build 100% monochrome. I really appreciate that attention to detail with the theme, it makes it feel special.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093551-1-880x575.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Water Cooled</h3>
      <p>The case is black/white, obviously. However, they’ve fitted a white 240mm AIO from Corsair, which also features white fans. These contrast well with the radiator and the black fans on the front, giving it some variety.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093702-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>All of the fans are RGB too, which are what will provide plenty of light for the build. With so much white and tempered glass in here, it should light up beautifully too. There are two fans bringing cool air in at the front, while heat passively exhausts out the rear. However, the AIO blows up out of the top of the case, which will also help remove any ambient heat too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093648-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Radeon Graphics</h3>
      <p>Next up, we have the graphics card. It’s an ASUS TUF Gaming Radeon RX 5700 XT. That’s the fastest card AMD has in their arsenal right now and it’s plenty fast for 1440p and high frame rate gaming. Plus, it’s paired with the AMD Ryzen 7 3800X CPU, which is a bit of a beast in its own right; and strong competition for the Intel i9 series.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093710-880x663.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The GPU keeps that black and white theme too. I love the huge aluminium backplate on it also, which has a digital graphic design towards the back.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093645-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Super Fast Storage</h3>
      <p>Keeping with ASUS for a bit, we have their STRIX series gaming B450 series motherboard. This features an M.2 heatsink, behind which you’ll find the Samsung NVMe drive. However, they tucked the 3.5″ drive in the back for mass storage too; out of sight, out of mind. Finally, we have that lovely white Corsair RAM, which features some big RGB lighting strips on the top.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093655-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Overall, it’s a very clean and tidy build. DinoPC clearly knows what they’re doing, with tight cable management, and a good match of components regarding compatibility, performance, as well as aesthetics.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_093906-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Free Keyboard and Mouse</h3>
      <p>Let’s not forget that it also comes with this handsome Corsair K55 keyboard and Harpoon mouse bundle. We actually reviewed these peripherals, check em out <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/corsair-k55-harpoon-gaming-keyboard-mouse-review/">here</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_111204-1-880x646.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>RGB</h3>
      <p>With RGB fans on the front panel, RGB fans on the radiator, RGB on the pump, RGB on the motherboard, and on the RAM, you’re not short on colour here. Everything has been synced through the built-in hub too. What this means is that from the moment you power on your system, it all matches!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_111234-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>By default, it’s on a slow colour cycle, which is perfect for me. However, if you really want to, you can use Corsair iCUE to customise everything to your liking. Effects, fades, brightness, reactions, or just turn them off. It’s really up to you, but I must admit, the purple is alluring.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_111232-1-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Get Ready for Benchmarks</h3>
      <p>So there we have it, a stunning and rather colourful build from DinoPC. However, we really want to see how it performs, so let’s go fire up some benchmarks. Check out a few more bonus pictures first though!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20191009_111158-1-880x822.jpg"/>

      <h3>Testing &amp; Methodology</h3>
      <p>To test each system or notebook, we want to stress every component of the system to check stability and performance, giving us an idea as to why those particular components were picked for this particular system. We use a wide variety of applications to gain a broad spectrum of results for comparing diverse aspects of system performance.</p>
      <h3>Games Used</h3>
      <p>All games are tested at both 1920 x 1080, 2560 x 1440 and 3840 x 2160 (4K) (where supported). *Please note that for systems which do not support a particular resolution, such as 1080p laptops, we <b>will not test</b> the higher resolutions on those devices.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to bring our games more into line with modern releases and specifically those that offer Nvidia RTX/DLSS features, we have decided to update some of our games accordingly. Please note that not all games listed below may be used in our tests.</p>

      <h3>Handbrake</h3>
      <p>To stress processors to their absolute limit and accurately judge their performance in video editing workloads, we transcode a 7.7GB compilation of gaming footage; this particular file is freely available from <a href="http://4ksamples.com/4k-gaming-montage/">here</a>. The captured footage is 22 minutes and 12 seconds long, it has a bit rate of 50.1 Mbps and it uses the Advanced Video Codec. Additionally, the video runs at a constant 30 frames-per-second and opts for a 3820 x 2140 (4K) resolution. Once loaded into Handbrake, we then transcode the 4K MP4 to an MKV file using the “normal” profile.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-121-880x495.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>3DMark Firestrike</h3>
      <p>Make no mistake, this is one very fast system. OK, it’s not the fastest we’ve had, but that mostly comes down to this being an upper-mid-range GPU. It can’t quite get the legs on the high-end RTX cards in some of these other systems. However, it looks like it’s strong enough to keep ahead of the RTX 2070 card in the Novatech Elite Sentinel. Regardless, this is a solid score for FireStrike.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1-1-751x1024.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Unigine Superposition 1080p Extreme</h3>
      <p>The same is true in Unigine 4K. This is a demanding benchmark that mixes heavy CPU and GPU loads, and again, we see the DinoPC build holding on to a very high score.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-1-751x1024.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>PCMark 10</h3>
      <p>Things get even better here, as the Ryzen 3800X is able to stretch its legs. This test benefits from fast single-core and multi-core performance. With the Ryzen 3800X overclocked to 4.2 GHz out of the box, and water-cooled, it has no issues thrashing everything else we’ve benchmarked so far.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/3-1-751x1024.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>WPrime 32m and 1024m</h3>
      <p>The same is true of the WPrime score, as it smashed our previous record into oblivion. Just 85 seconds is about what we would expect from an overclocked Ryzen 3800X. Of course, just because it’s what we expected, that doesn’t make it any less impressive.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/4-1-751x1024.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Cinebench R15</h3>
      <p>The eight-core and sixteen-thread CPU continued to pull its weight here too. The Novatech Reign PALADIN featured the 9900K and the RTX 2080 Ti, but it’s just not enough to fend off the Ryzen CPU in multi-core. However, even the single-core performance remained very competitive too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5-1-751x1024.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Handbrake MP4 to MKV Conversion 4K</h3>
      <p>Finally, we have Handbrake performance. Intel does have a little edge here, but at 75 FPS, the DinoPC system is happy in second place. For those doing any 4K transcoding, this is hardly a letdown.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/6-1-751x1024.png"/>

      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>Offering a 250GB NVMe M.2 SSD drive and 2TB SATA, DinoPC is giving us the best of both worlds here. Lots of storage at a decent speed for bigger games, media files, etc. However, the ultra-fast boost drive is picking up the slack for the OS. Of course, 250 GB is plenty to hold a game or two, depending on the size of the game at least. This is an all AMD system though, so you could use StoreMI to boost the HDD using the SSD.</p>

      <h3>Gaming Performance</h3>
      <p>The AMD Ryzen 3800X overclocked to 4.2 GHz combined with the fantastic ASUS Radeon RX 5700 XT is certainly a winning combination. For 1080p gaming, it’s blisteringly fast, and dialling things up to ultra settings should not be an issue. You’ll even get away with very high settings at 1440p even in very demanding games. However, if you’re pushing for 144 Hz 1440p gaming, medium to high settings would be the way to go.</p>
      <p>For 4K gamers, the 5700 XT isn’t really the perfect card for the job. However, if you’re wanting resolution most of all, dropping to medium settings would get you around 60 FPS in this setup. However, I think this combination of GPU and CPU is a winner for 1080p Ultra and 1440p High; typically that’s the standard of monitor most gamers buy these days anyway.</p>
      <p>It’s all AMD too, so you can reap those lovely FreeSync gains if you buy a compatible monitor. Most gaming monitors these days have FreeSync and are typically 144hz 1440p, so that’s not too much of a stretch in its self.</p>

      <h3>Acoustics &amp; Temperatures</h3>
      <p>Having the Corsair 240mm cooler on the CPU lends its self well to maintaining great performance. What’s impressive is that it did it at a good thermal limit too. Idle was a breezy 31c and full load didn’t break the 70c mark. It’s not too warm in here though, so in summer, the ambient could push that to the mid-70s.</p>
      <p>The graphics card had no issues with thermal throttling either. Of course, with two fans blowing a wall of cool air right at it, that’s hardly a surprise. The noise levels were pretty decent too. The 280X case is well filtered and has great airflow, so it never sounded like any particular fan was being stressed.</p>

        <b>Total Self Build Price (approximately) £1663.55</b>
      </p>
      <p>Building it yourself <i>could </i>work out at £211.45 cheaper, at current sale prices. That could be around £150 cheaper without the deals. Of course, with DinoPC, you get a full system warranty for 5-years, 30 days money-back guarantee, and their amazing UK support team. On top of that, they build the PC, configure the hardware and software setup for you, and provide their overclocking setup too. They also offer a price match promise, free delivery, and bring their 11+ years of market experience. That’s a hell of a lot of peace of mind for a little extra cash. Plus, it means you can simply open the box, plug it in, and get right to installing your games; easy!</p>
      <h3>Cryolos AMD Extreme PC £1875.00 on DinoPC.com</h3>
      <p>Remember you can configure the product too. If you tweak it to a black H100i rather than the white one, it’s £24.04 cheaper. You can save £103.86 without the OS installation too if you already have a key. Plus you can save another £85.86 without the keyboard and mouse bundle. Play around the configurator and price up your own build <a href="https://www.dinopc.com/custom-pc/extreme-pc/cryolos-amd-extreme-pc">here</a>!</p>
      <h3>My Configured Price £1661.24!</h3>
      <p>Honestly, I find no fault with this system at all. I think the strongest thing it has going is how damn good it looks. The white Corsair Crystal Series 280X RGB is by far one of my all-time favourites. Mixing that with the white Corsair AIO does cost a little more, but honestly, it really helps complete the visuals of this build. Not to dismiss the performance of the components they chose either. The 280X has superb airflow and that AIO does a great job of taming the fantastic AMD Ryzen 3800X at overclocked speeds.</p>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>I’ll admit, I don’t think you need to overclock the 3800X, it’s pretty happy left on auto, especially with a big cooler installed on it. Regardless, the performance is hardly lacking here. They chose one of the best AMD 5700 XT graphics cards out there, and it’s a good pairing for those wanting high-frame-rate 1080p and 1440p game, without compromising on quality. Triple digital FPS are easily attained with this setup. Of course, at this price, you should hope so. This is a high-end gaming system and it does exactly what you ordered.</p>
      <h3>All-Around-Power</h3>
      <p>The PC is no slouch outside of gaming though. The combination of a slick M.2 drive for those ultra-fast loading times is welcome. Plus, it’s backed up with some mass storage for everything else. Personally, I would pay a little more for a bigger M.2 or a second SSD in here, but that’s just me. Each to their own! The 3800X is a great CPU though, it’ll render videos all day, and works great for streamers and other multi-core demanding tasks. Plus, the overclocked CPU means that it’ll deliver great gaming performance at the end of a day’s work.</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>I know there are people who scream “Uh, I can build my own K thx bye” and that’s fantastic, go do it! However, don’t dismiss the work from DinoPC. They guarantee components will be compatible, plus they do a fantastic job of building the system.</p>
      <p>Not everyone has the experience to build a really good looking PC. Then there’s those who are too busy to source all the components, deal with the multiple deliveries of that, then put it all together and set it up. With a pre-built, you take one delivery, plug it in and get playing. Plus, with their support team and warranty on the whole system, you have that extra peace of mind.</p>
      <p>I think they’re right on the money with this PC, although I’d likely ditch their keyboard and mouse bundle in the configurator as it’s a little overpriced. Beyond that, I highly recommend this system, it’s just a shame they want it back when I’m done, ha!</p>
