      <h3>​Spilling Details on New Album</h3>
      <p>Earlier, the <i>Don't Start Now</i> hitmaker had opened up on what fans can expect from her new album, which had been eagerly anticipated since her acclaimed 2017 self-titled debut. The singer-songwriter confessed it is a mix of both her old music and also some new genres.</p>
      <p>​Speaking about her new song, she said at the award ceremony:</p>
      <p>“It’s very disco-orientated. I guess I got a lot of inspiration from 'Electricity' and 'One Kiss'; it felt like the natural progression. The album is really nostalgic with new sounds.”</p>
