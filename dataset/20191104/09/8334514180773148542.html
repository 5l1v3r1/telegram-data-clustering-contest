      <p>FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank denied on Monday a report in the Financial Times that it is putting pressure on Deutsche Bank’s Christian Sewing to give up his dual role as chief executive and investment bank head.</p>
      <p>“The story is incorrect,” an ECB spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The FT had written that the ECB was concerned that Sewing’s twin responsibilities could undermine the group’s radical restructuring and posed a potential conflict of interest.</p>
