        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Have you been using tech for more than five years? I’d put a lot of money on that being most of us. If that’s the case, then I know something you’ve experienced: data loss.</p>
      <p>Now, I don’t necessarily mean forgetting to save a file, or accidentally deleting something, I’m talking about a huge range of your digital things just… no longer existing.</p>
      <p>Old photographs are a prime example. From what I can tell, every picture I had before I got an iPhone (and by extension, iCloud) is gone. That’s probably eight-odd years of memories that are lost and I’ll never get back. Which sucks.</p>
      <p>And that’s just the photos. Think of all the music, schoolwork, videos, assorted documents, game save files, and so much more that have simply ceased to exist.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of times where I consider all this lost data and think: fuck, I wish I bought an external hard drive earlier.</p>
      <p>Does that seem like familiar feeling? If so, we’ve got a surprise for you. Close your eyes. Actually, no, then you won’t be able to read. But imagine you’ve closed your eyes. Perfect.</p>
      <p>The WD 3TB My Passport Ultra HD currently <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FMy-Passport-Ultra-3TB-White-Gold-Portable-Hard-Drive-by-Western-Digital%2F293133327487%3F_trkparms%3D5373%253A0%257C5374%253AFeatured%257C5079%253A6000001691">has a $45 discount</a>, meaning you can pick one up for the very reasonable price of $75. That is 37 percent off its list price.</p>
      <p>I’ve had a similar WD external hard drive for five or six years now and it’s still going strong. It’s quick, is simple to use, and — in my experience — has a build quality that lasts.</p>
      <p>So, if you’ve been thinking about getting an external, portable hard drive to back up your important data, now could be a good time. The WD 3TB My Passport Ultra HD is only $75 — <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FMy-Passport-Ultra-3TB-White-Gold-Portable-Hard-Drive-by-Western-Digital%2F293133327487%3F_trkparms%3D5373%253A0%257C5374%253AFeatured%257C5079%253A6000001691">pick it up here before it’s too late</a>.</p>
