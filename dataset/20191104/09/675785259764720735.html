      <h1>Piers Morgan upsets Ruby Turner by calling her wrong name with rude hidden meaning</h1>
      <h2>The Good Morning Britain presenter accidentally slipped up - embarrassing Ruby Turner, Susanna Reid and himself</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:14:59+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle O'Sullivan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kyle-osullivan/</a></address>
      <p>Piers Morgan made a massive blunder on today's Good Morning Britain by calling Ruby Turner the wrong name.</p>
      <p>The soul singer, songwriter and actress was in the studio for a debate on John Legend scripting new modern lyrics for 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' in wake of the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>When introducing the guests, Piers said: "We've got in the studio a veritable fest of superstars. Ruby Murray..."</p>
      <p>The mortified singer was left open-mouthed, while Piers realised his mistake and emphatically apologised.</p>
      <p>Susanna Reid was shaking her head in shock as Ruby cried: "Oh Piers, you're at it."</p>

      <p>Piers confessed: "Sorry I've just identified you the wrong way, ironically."</p>
      <p>The GMB host then turned to another guest, American singer-songwriter Shelia Ferguson.</p>
      <p>While Susanna had her head in her hands, her co-host joked: "And Sheila...I think you're still Ferguson."</p>

      <p>Good Morning Britain viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> after watching the awkward moment.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "I cannot believe I have just witnessed Piers Morgan, mistakingly calling the great Ruby Turner, Ruby Murry, Cockney rhyming slang for curry, how embarrassing....what a guy??"</p>
      <p>"Did @piersmorgan just call Ruby Turner a curry? Wow. #woke," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "@piersmorgan  calling Ruby Turner Ruby Murray has made my Monday"</p>

      <p>Piers and Ruby clashed during the debate, with Ruby backing the decision to change the Christmas song's lyrics.</p>
      <p>Ruby said: "Here's the thing. They haven’t rewritten a whole song. Tweaking one or two lines isn’t taking away from the song. They've taken on a very popular Christmas song and tweaked a few lines.</p>
      <p>"To be honest with you that song is written in 1944 back then it was OK to sing stuff like that. Things have changed. People have moved on. The #MeToo situation.</p>
      <p>"If you put the lyrics under a microscope you might understand."</p>

      <p>Piers argued that it was just "flirting" and that the woman in the song was "not being attacked".</p>
      <p>Deana Martin, the daughter of singer Dean Martin, said the original version was "flirty fun" and changing the words was "absurd".</p>
      <p>On her dad's opinion, she said: "He would have laughed. He wouldn't care about something like this. It's too absurd for him. It's a fabulous song and been recorded by so many people.</p>
      <p>"My dad didn't care about things like that. He was a such a great guy and it's a fabulous song. I think John should have just left it alone."</p>

      <p>Most GMB viewers were opposed to changing the lyrics of the Christmas song.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, one viewer asked: "People have nothing better to do than whine about the lyrics of a Xmas song?"</p>
      <p>"What a load of nonsense sone of these do gooders need to read most rap/grime lyrics. Toe curling," added another.</p>
      <p>A third agreed: "Why are people so offended by a Christmas Song??? There is nothing wrong with it. It’s just a Christmas song"</p>
