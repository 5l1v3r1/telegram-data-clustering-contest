      <h1>Meet The Vietnam Fighter Aces That Terrorized U.S. Pilots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Sebastien Roblin</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>Sixteen Vietnamese aces were recognized in the Vietnam War.</p>
      <p>Col. Nguyen Tomb — or “Toon” — is one of the names immortalized in military aviation, like Baron von Richthofen and Eddie Rickenbacker.</p>
      <p>I first encountered Tomb when I was 10 years old, playing Chuck Yeager’s Air Combat on my dad’s computer. In one mission, you fly against the Vietnamese ace, infamous for having scored 13 air-to-air kills.</p>
      <p>Tomb was the only Vietnamese pilot named in the game, and I was curious, like many others before and since, to learn more about this mysterious aviator. The top-scoring American pilots in Vietnam, by comparison, had only five kills each.</p>
      <p>On paper, the air war over Vietnam should have been a grossly one-sided contest. The U.S. Air Force and Navy, the strongest air arms in the world, opposed the jets of the Vietnam People’s Air Force, averaging 70 warplanes in the early years of the air war, and peaking at 200 near the end.</p>
      <p>It was far from one-sided. The Vietnamese received extensive technical assistance, training and replacement aircraft from Russia and China. They also drew upon decades of experience fighting materially stronger opponents.</p>
      <p>Vietnamese MiG fighters launched hit-and-run attacks on U.S. attack formations that flew on predictable schedules, inflicting heavy losses even on supersonic F-105 Thunderchief bombers. Ground-based radars guided Vietnamese pilots into perfect ambush positions.</p>
      <p>American aviators, in turn, had rules of engagement prohibiting them from firing missiles at unidentified aircraft or attacking enemy airfields. The Vietnamese ultimately lost more aircraft than they shot down in air-to-air combat, but they forced many air raids to abort mission and ditch their bombs.</p>
      <p>NSA signals intelligence units spying on Vietnamese radio communications appear to be responsible for Tomb’s rise to fame. An <a href="https://ajaxairpowertour.wordpress.com/colonel-toon-nsa/"><u>NSA report</u></a> made public through the Freedom Of Information Act, tells us how it began.</p>
      <p>
        <i>…the NSA could identify each North Vietnamese pilot by his own unique call sign suffix […] SIGINT analysts became familiar with many of the unseen North Vietnamese flyers and built case histories on individual pilots, their ranks, organizations, number of missions flown, even their combat records.</i>
