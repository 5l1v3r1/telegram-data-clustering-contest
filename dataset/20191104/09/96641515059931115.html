      <h1>Microsoft's new Office app for mobile combines Word, Excel and Powerpoint</h1>
      <h2>Making and signing PDFs on-the-go should also be easier.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T09:00:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-office-app-mobile-word-excel-powerpoint/mathewtsmithuk" target="_blank">Mat Smith</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft's having a busy Monday morning, and for anyone that uses Office on the go, its new app might be the major gamechanger.</p>
      <p>The company's <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-Apps-Blog/Introducing-Office-Your-new-go-to-mobile-app-for-getting-work/ba-p/977172">newly unveiled Office app</a> is an attempt to put everything you might need in one place. Instead of grabbing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/06/office-for-iphone-hands-on/">separate apps</a> for Word, Excel and Powerpoint (aka the Office Triforce), today's public preview puts them all together.</p>

      <p>The app also includes a new Actions pane that should be especially effective for document editing on-the-go. Microsoft says you'll be able to create and sign PDFs with ease from your tinier smartphone screens, and sharing files has also been simplified and streamlined.</p>
      <p>The Office app also makes better use of your phone's talents, with the ability to take a photo of a document and turn it into an editable Word file on the fly, or even do the same with printed-out tables in Excel. Details ahead of today's launch were otherwise a little scarce -- but nevermind, you can test them out for yourself. The Office app preview is available on Google Play <a href="https://aka.ms/OfficePreviewforAndroid">now</a>, and for iOS users that are <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/eHAKJBtM">using Testflight</a>. There's no date yet for when the app will launch outside of preview.</p>
