      <p>Bali Police have confirmed that Scott James Harrison, an Australian national who was detained last week after he allegedly attacked security guards at a Kuta hotel while he was drunk, has made peace with his victims and therefore released from custody.</p>
      <p>“It means that the case is put to a stop, as both parties have chosen an alternative dispute resolution,” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kanalbali/pemukulan-3-satpam-oleh-warga-australia-berujung-damai-1sBgB0blBS0">I Putu Ika Prabawa from the Kuta Police told <i>Kumparan</i> today.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/australian-national-arrested-after-alleged-drunken-attack-on-hotel-security/">The 40-year-old was detained last week</a> after he allegedly went on a rampage and lashed out at the security guards of the hotel he was staying at in Kuta, who were trying to calm him down. </p>
      <p>According to local media reports, Harrison threw punches at three security guards, who suffered bruises and went on to file a police report soon after the incident.</p>
      <p>Harrison might have dodged a bullet there, as he could’ve faced a maximum sentence of two years and eight months in prison for the alleged assault under Indonesia’s criminal code.</p>
      <p>Last week, a prosecutor in Denpasar demanded Nicholas Carr, an Australian man who was arrested in August for allegedly fly-kicking a man off a moving scooter while he was drunk, <a href="https://coconuts.co/bali/news/bali-prosecutor-demands-australian-who-fly-kicked-scooter-driver-be-sentenced-to-4-months-in-prison/">be sentenced to four months </a>in prison. </p>
