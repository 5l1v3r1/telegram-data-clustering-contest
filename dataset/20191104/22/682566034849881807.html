      <p>Islamabad - This month's <b>Davis Cup</b> tie between <b>Pakistan</b> and <b>India</b>, scheduled to take place in Islamabad, must now be played at a "neutral venue" due to security concerns, the<b> International Tennis Federation (ITF) </b>said Monday.</p>
      <p>The Asia/Oceania Group I match had initially been planned for September, but was pushed back to November 29-30 after safety fears were raised by India amid tensions between the neighbouring nations over Kashmir.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the ITF said the decision to move the match was taken "following a review of the latest advice given by the ITF's independent security advisors."</p>
      <p>"The ITF and Davis Cup Committee's first priority has always been the safety of athletes, officials and spectators and the decision was made on this basis," the ITF said.</p>
      <p>According to Davis Cup rules, "the Pakistan Tennis Federation now has the choice to nominate a neutral venue and has five working days to confirm their proposed venue," it added.</p>
      <p>"The venue will be announced once the choice has been submitted and approved."</p>
      <p>Tensions are simmering between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Kashmir has been divided between the two countries since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both claim the territory in full and have fought two wars over it.</p>
      <p>In August, New Delhi revoked the special status of the part of the region that it administers.</p>
      <p>An Indian tennis team last played a Davis Cup tie in Pakistan in 1964, when they beat the hosts 4-0. Pakistan lost 3-2 when they played in Mumbai in 2006.</p>
