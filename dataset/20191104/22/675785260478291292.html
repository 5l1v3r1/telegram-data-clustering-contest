      <h1>Richard Keogh's agent believes Derby sacking could 'open can of worms'</h1>
      <h2>The 33-year-old defender was sacked by the club over gross misconduct for his role in the drink-drive car crash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:13:21+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p>The agent of sacked <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/derby-county-fc">Derby</a> captain <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/richard-keogh">Richard Keogh</a> believes the club may have opened up a "big can of worms" by terminating the defenders contract.</p>
      <p>Keogh's deal at Pride Park was torn up despite having almost two years left to run due to his part in a drink-drive car crash.</p>
      <p>The Rams <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-richard-keogh-sacked-derby-20759768">parted ways</a> with the 33-year-old, citing gross misconduct, after Keogh was badly injured in the smash involving him and his Derby teammates.</p>
      <p>Tom Lawrence, 25, and Mason Bennett, 23, have since been banned for drink-driving following the incident, but have escaped lesser punishment from the club, while Keogh - who was a passenger in Lawrence's Range Rover - has lost his job.</p>
      <p>Agent Cos Toffis, who represents Keogh, told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10278783/richard-keogh-derby-sacking-can-of-worms/">the Sun</a> : "I think it could be quite a big can of worms.</p>

      <p>"If this goes in Derby's favour there will be a lot of players in difficult positions at their football clubs.</p>
      <p>"Older players with less market value who are on a lot of money, these are scenarios you have at every football club in the world.</p>
      <p>"Should they start wrapping themselves up in cotton wool to avoid any situations like this?"</p>
      <p>Keogh was ruled out for the season after seriously damaging his knee in the smash, with him since being resigned to crutches.</p>

      <p>The players had been on an arranged club night out, which finished at around 8pm, before some of the team heading on to other drinking venues afterwards.</p>
      <p>Later Lawrence's vehicle crashed into the back of Bennett's, before striking a lamppost, with the two drivers fleeing the scene, leaving Keogh unconscious in the back.</p>
      <p>Toffis claimed the whole ordeal has had a detrimental effect on Keogh who is struggling to come to terms with what has happened.</p>
      <p>He added: "Richard is in a really bad way, it's heartbreaking.</p>

      <p>"Heâ€™s bled in that shirt, fought in that shirt.</p>
      <p>"I don't think I can put into words how much he's hurting and what his family are going through.</p>
      <p>"Richard's world has been absolutely rocked."</p>
      <p>Keogh still has 14 days to appeal Derby's decision.</p>
      <p>Rumours suggest Keogh rejected the chance to see out his contract on significantly reduced terms, but this remains unconfirmed.</p>
