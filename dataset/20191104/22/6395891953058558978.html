      <p><b>WAYNESVILLE, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Police say a pair of dogs suspected in the deadly mauling of an Ohio woman had bitten her and others in the past.</p>
      <p>A corner says 49-year-old Mary Matthews of Waynesville bled to death from numerous bites. Police say her husband found her body Friday.</p>
      <p>Police say it's not clear yet whether both or one of the Great Danes at the house were involved in the attack.</p>
      <p>Officers say they found blood in the garage, bathroom, living room and other areas of the house south of Dayton.</p>
      <p>Both dogs were handed over to the Warren County Dog Warden and euthanized on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Matthews' husband told police that one of the dogs was vicious and that his wife would have trouble defending herself if the dogs attacked.</p>
