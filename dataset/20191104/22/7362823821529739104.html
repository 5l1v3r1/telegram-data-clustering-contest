      <h1>Ted Cruz defends Ilhan Omar from 'reprehensible' death threats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:30:20+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ted-cruz">Ted Cruz</a>, R-Texas., came to the defense of Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ilhan-omar">Ilhan Omar</a>, D-Minn., on Monday after the progressive congresswoman received multiple death threats on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Over the weekend, Omar put a spotlight on the threats she had received from other Twitter users, telling the social media giant that the posts about her were "unacceptable." One tweet had called her a "terrorist" who "should be hanged for treason."</p>
      <p>Cruz expressed solidarity with Omar amid the viral threats.</p>
      <p>"This is reprehensible," Cruz <a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1191458383309787137">tweeted.</a> "Disagree with @IlhanMN on the merits, fine, but death threats to anyone are not a joke."</p>

      <p>This wasn't the first time Cruz had reached out to a member of the "Squad" of House Democrats. Earlier this year, the GOP senator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-expresses-optimism-on-super-bizarre-partnership-with-ted-cruz-im-encouraged">formed a legislative alliance</a> with Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, D-N.Y.,  in hopes of cracking down on politicians who later would become lobbyists.</p>
      <p>"I'm looking forward to seeing where and how far they'd be willing to move on that, but I'm encouraged," Ocasio-Cortez said in June. "I think there's some wiggle room here. It's super-bizarre, really weird. Never thought in my life that one of my first pushes would be alongside Ted Cruz."</p>

      <p>“I think it really shows what the true spirit of not being partisan is,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“And, that bipartisanship doesn’t mean let’s come together to go to war and lower taxes on the rich. But, bipartisanship means, OK, I will swallow all of my distaste in this situation, because we have found a common interest.”</p>
