      <h3>Guess who?</h3>
      <p>Little Jaydee-Lee Dummett had a string of surprises on a day trip to London.</p>
      <p>First the schoolgirl heard <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amanda-holden">Amanda Holden</a> and Jamie Theakston talking about her on their Heart Breakfast Show, then she saw her face on a billboard in Leicester Square.</p>
      <p>The hilarious finale was Ant and Dec emerging from behind newspapers with Child of Courage winner Jaydee-Lee as the front-page story.</p>
