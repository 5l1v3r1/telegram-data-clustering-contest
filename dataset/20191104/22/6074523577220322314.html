      <h1>Huobi Global Is Forcing US Customers to Use Its Local Partner</h1>

      <p>Huobi Global will kick all of its U.S. customers off its platform later this month.</p>
      <p>The cryptocurrency exchange announced it would freeze all U.S. accounts on Nov. 13, framing the move as a compliance step made to conform to U.S. laws and regulations. Huobi is recommending that customers transfer their assets to HBUS, the U.S. firm affiliated with the global brand.</p>
      <p>“Our User Agreement expressly prohibits users in the United States from using our platform,” <a href="https://huobiglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000659122-Arrangement-to-freeze-US-user-accounts-on-13-November-2019-GMT-8-">Huobi said</a> of its main platform.</p>
      <p>The move finalizes Huobi’s drawn-out shuttering of U.S. accounts as as it continues to push users to HBUS, which is based in San Francisco. Led by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-exchange-huobi-poaches-app-exec-to-lead-new-us-branch">Frank Fu</a>, formerly of Chinese photo editing app Meitu, HBUS has been operating within the U.S. since early last year.</p>
      <p>Huobi said all outstanding balances must be withdrawn by the Nov. 13, and offered to assist users holding amounts below the withdrawal minimum via customer support.</p>
      <p>Customers can receive their funds in bitcoin or USDT, according to the announcement. Huobi also pledged to refund points card purchases at a 1:1 ratio in USDT.</p>
      <p>Huobi’s account freeze parallels similar steps by other international exchanges. In June, Binance also <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-exchange-to-block-crypto-trading-for-u-s-customers">cracked on American users</a>, pushing them to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/binance-says-its-launching-a-us-exchange-with-fincen-registered-partner">FinCEN-registered partner</a>.</p>
