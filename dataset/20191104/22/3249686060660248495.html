        <i>"Hello. This is South Club's Nam Tae Hyun.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>First, I apologize for the delay of our 5 song EP. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Our band found a label and the label I was running called 'The South' has been dissolved. Although 3 years is a short time, I learned a lot about running a company and sometimes I struggled due to some systems. However, I  am glad that a new family has formed and that a systematic way and employees will be helping us focus on our music, which makes me happy. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The 5 songs that were planned to be released is postponed after a long discussion with the label. We will be greeting the public with brighter songs and a single album first. We will continue to prune ourselves and find you with good songs. I wanted to let you know first before another announcement was made. Thank you for trusting and waiting for my lacking self and thank you for loving me.</i>
