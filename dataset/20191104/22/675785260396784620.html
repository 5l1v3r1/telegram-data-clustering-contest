      <h1>Son Heung-min could miss Tottenham trip to Belgrade over mental impact of Andre Gomes injury</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham star Son was left distraught after his late challenge on Andre Gomes led to the Everton midfielder suffering a horror injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:30:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham are concerned over Son Heung-min's mental state ahead of their trip to Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Spurs return to action in the Champions League on Wednesday night following their 1-1 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Son saw red for a late challenge on Andre Gomes, that led to the Everton midfielder suffering a fractured and dislocated ankle.</p>
      <p>The South Korean star was visibly distraught by Gomes' injury and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have offered him counselling to help him get over the trauma.</p>
      <p>There are doubts over whether he will be in the right mindset to travel to Belgrade with Spurs set to make late checks on him before making a decision.</p>

      <p>Tottenham have appealed Son's red card after referee Martin Atkinson appeared to initially pull out the yellow card.</p>
      <p>Son is expected to reach out to Gomes in the coming days, with the midfielder undergoing successful surgery on Monday.</p>
      <p>There is no timescale on his recovery although initial suggestions are he could be out for up to a year.</p>

      <p>Speaking after the draw, Son's teammate Dele Alli said: "He is devastated and in tears. It’s not his fault. Son is one of nicest people you’ve ever met.</p>
      <p>"He can’t even lift his head up, he’s crying so much."</p>
      <p>Son was consoled by Everton captain Seamus Coleman in the away dressing room at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane could return for Spurs against Red Star Belgrade after missing the clash through illness, while Totteham will hand late fitness tests to Jan Vertonghen and Erik Lamela.</p>
