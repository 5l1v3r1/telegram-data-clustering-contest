      <p>A helicopter carrying Bolivia's president Evo Morales made an emergency landing on Monday due to a mechanical fault, the military said, raising suspicions among his supporters after opponents vowed to oust him.</p>
      <p>No one was hurt, the air force said, but the incident fuelled tensions in the country where protesters have been rallying against the leftist president for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The EC-145 helicopter "had a mechanical fault in the tail rotor during take-off, which prompted an emergency landing," the Bolivian Air Force said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The fault struck as the helicopter was taking off from a village in the Andes where Morales had been inaugurating a new road, it said. Videos of the incident circulated on social media.</p>
      <p>The air force said it was investigating the causes of the fault.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a conservative opposition leader in the eastern Santa Cruz region, Luis Fernando Camacho, threatened to "take decisive action" on Monday night to drive Morales from power.</p>
      <p>Former interior minister Hugo Moldiz in a Twitter message branded the helicopter incident "a criminal attack."</p>
      <p>Morales has accused his opponents of plotting a coup against him.</p>
      <p>Deadly unrest has gripped the South American country since Morales was named winner of an election on October 20 for a fourth term.</p>
      <p>His opponents have branded the result a fraud, citing alleged irregularities in the vote-count.</p>
      <p>Morales's rival in the polls, Carlos Mesa, has called for a new vote to be held.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators returned to block roads in the capital La Paz on Monday in fresh protests.</p>
      <p>In his address to supporters on Saturday, Camacho called on the military to "be on the side of the people."</p>
      <p>Morales responded by accusing his opponents of seeking bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Carlos Romero said Monday the government had "absolute trust" in the armed forces.</p>
      <p>Romero alleged on Sunday that "a violent confrontation is being prepared" for Monday night near the presidential palace in La Paz.</p>
