      <h3>FIVEaa’s Stephen Rowe has slammed animal activists planning protests for Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup.</h3>
      <p>Rowey told David &amp; Will on FIVEaa Breakfast:</p>
      <blockquote>“Animal activists may try and rail road the race. Fair dinkum, get a life you losers, is what I would say. They’re just professional activists aren’t they? Don’t they just save the whales and mining protests -- go get a job.”</blockquote>
      <p>Penbo wasn’t so sure…</p>
      <blockquote>PENBO: “I’m with you about not disrupting the race, but that footage the other night was full on… I don’t think it’s necessarily rent a crowd. I actually think this is a problem for the industry. There might have been a bit of a shift…”<br/><br/>ROWEY “Yeah, probably a bit hard.”</blockquote>
