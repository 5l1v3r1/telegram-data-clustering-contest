      <h1>Councillors approve deal for 80% of units in Dublin housing development to be social and affordable</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:24:00+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Dublin city councillors have approved a deal that will see 80% of housing at O'Devaney Gardens being used for social and affordable homes.</p>
      <p>This evening's vote comes after developer Bartra Capital and council officials agreed to increase the number of social homes by 30%.</p>
      <p>Councillors had been fighting for improved terms in recent weeks after the vote on the original plan was postponed a month ago.</p>
      <p>Labour councillor Alison Gilliland says tonight's vote is a positive for the council and the development of the North Circular Road site.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there was one councillor in the chamber that felt wholly comfortable with the proposal that was put in front of us," said Cllr Gilliland.</p>
      <p>"But given the constraints of government funding to us and housing policy at the moment, it was the best of a bad deal.</p>
      <p>"We did strive to deliver as much as we could for the local citizens of Dublin."</p>
      <p>Speaking before this evening's vote, Councillor Mary Fitzpatrick said: "For the first time there will be an affordable rental scheme on the site, there will 824 residential units.</p>
      <p>"We are also very proud to have secured ringfencing of three-and-a-half million [euro] for community facilities.</p>
      <p>"There will be no co-living, there will be no student accommodation, there will be no hotels. There will actually be homes."</p>
