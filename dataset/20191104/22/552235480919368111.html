      <h1>James Tavernier nabs Rangers keepsake as beaming skipper shows bus driver his Hamdpen memento</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox skipper has come under fire for some high-profile mistakes but he was at his rampaging best in the 3-0 win over Hearts on Sunday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-04T22:09:12+00:00">04 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>It was a day to remember for Rangers at Hampden and one to savour for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-tavernier">James Tavernier</a> .</p>
      <p>The Ibrox skipper has come under fire for some high-profile mistakes but he was at his rampaging best in the 3-0 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> semi-final win over Hearts on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It's Tavernier's first victory at the national stadium as the club's captain enjoyed every moment of it...both on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> marked the big occasion by installing large player cards for each player on their locker and the 28-year-old made sure he didn't leave without it.</p>
      <p>The club uploaded a clip of Tavernier looking proud as punch as he showed off his Hampden souvenir to the club's bus driver after the comprehensive win.</p>
      <p>It was a big win for the Ibrox side but they know the sternest test is yet to come when they return on December 8 as they aim to put an end to Celtic's domestic dominance.</p>
      <p>And Tavernier will be hoping it's not just a replica image he's leaving Mount Florida with as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> goes in search for his first trophy in management.</p>
