      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft">Microsoft</a> tested out a four-day work week in its Japan offices and found as a result employees were not only happier – but significantly more productive.</p>
      <p>For the month of August, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> experimented with a new project called Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019, giving its entire 2,300-person workforce five Fridays off in a row without decreasing pay.</p>
      <p>The shortened weeks led to more efficient meetings, happier workers and boosted productivity by a staggering 40%, the company concluded at the end of the trial. As part of the program, the company had also <a href="https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20190516/p2a/00m/0bu/012000c">planned to subsidize</a> family vacations for employees up to ¥100,000 or $920.</p>
      <p>“Work a short time, rest well and learn a lot,” Microsoft Japan president and CEO Takuya Hirano said in a statement to Microsoft Japan’s website. “I want employees to think about and experience how they can achieve the same results with 20% less working time.”</p>
      <p>In addition to the increased productivity, employees took 25% less time off during the trial and electricity use was down 23% in the office with the additional day off per week. Employees printed 59% fewer pages of paper during the trial. The vast majority of employees – 92% – said they liked the shorter week.</p>
      <p>The experiment is not the first time long weekends have been experimented with in the corporate world. In 2018, New Zealand trust management company Perpetual Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success">trialled a four</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success">-day work week</a> over two months for its 240 staff members. Employees reported experiencing better work–life balance and improved focus in the office. Staff stress levels decreased by 7%.</p>
      <p>Workers have often said they could be more productive with less time in the office. A survey of 1,500 workers and 600 human resources managers by <a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/compensation-and-benefits/popular-perks-incentives-and-benefits?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release">HR consulting firm Robert Half</a> found 66% of workers said they wanted to work less than five days a week.</p>
      <p>Another experiment <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/12/the-case-for-the-6-hour-workday">published by the Harvard Business Review</a> shows shorter work days, a decrease from the average 8-hour work day to a 6-hour work day, increased productivity. A 2018 survey of 3,000 employees by the <a href="https://workforceinstitute.org/the-case-for-a-4-day-workweek-nearly-half-of-employees-worldwide-could-do-their-jobs-in-5-hours-or-less-each-day/">Workforce Institute at Kronos</a> found more than half of full-time workers thought they could do their job in five hours a day.</p>
      <p>Microsoft Japan’s challenge was just a pilot project, the company told the Guardian in a statement, and it’s unclear if these changes will be implemented in offices elsewhere or on a longer term basis. It plans to implement another iteration of the challenge this winter.</p>
      <p>“In the spirit of a growth mindset, we are always looking for new ways to innovate and leverage our own technology to improve the experience for our employees around the globe,” a Microsoft spokesman said.</p>
