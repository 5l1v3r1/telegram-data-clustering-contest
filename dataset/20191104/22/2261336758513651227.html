      <p>Jorge Masvidal could be looking to follow in the footsteps of Conor McGregor following his stoppage win over Nate Diaz at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>McGregor temporarily put his MMA career on hold to face Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a boxing match back in 2017 and, speaking to reporters at the UFC 244 post-fight press conference, Masvidal teased of his own boxing superfight against multi-division champion Canelo Alvarez, who knocked out Sergey Kovalev this past Saturday to capture the WBO light heavyweight title.</p>

      <p>‘Gamebred’ believes he has the skills to beat Alvarez at his own game, telling the media he would have no problem whopping Canelo’s ass if the opportunity presented itself.</p>
      <p>“I’m open to the money and [Diaz is] a money fight,” Masvidal said, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/4/20946102/jorge-masvidal-reveals-hit-list-next-fight-including-nate-diaz-rematch-canelo-alvarez-boxing-match">per MMA Fighting’s Damon Martin</a>. “If Canelo wants to get his ass kicked, that’s a fight I’ll take,” Masvidal said. “I’m just here to get the biggest checks possible but Nate is in the future for a fact. We’re doing it next year or the year after that but it’s going to happen.”</p>
      <p>“I can box. I can hit hard. I’ve got different angles. I’m not going to get tired in a 12 round boxing event, especially if I have time to prepare for it,” he added. “It’s just kind of fate. He’s fighting today, I’m fighting today. I heard we f*cking killed him on the pay-per-views.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know I’d like to break his face. Just fight, just test myself, make a lot of money for testing myself. But I truly feel I could make it 1-1 MMA versus boxing.”</p>

      <p>Masvidal thrashed Diaz in the UFC 244 main event to win the ‘BMF’ title and extend his win streak to 3-0, winning all three fights by way of stoppage. As well as being crowned the ‘baddest motherf-cker’ in the world, Masvidal holds the record for the fastest KO in UFC history (five seconds), KO’ing former ONE FC and Bellator welterweight champ Ben Askren with a flying knee at UFC 239 back in July.</p>
