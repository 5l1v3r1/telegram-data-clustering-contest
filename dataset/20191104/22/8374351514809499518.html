      <p><b>LONDON</b> – World shares touched a 21-month high on Monday on signs that the United States and China could soon put an end to a damaging trade war as well as indications that the world may yet dodge an economic recession.</p>
      <p>Beijing and Washington spoke on Friday of progress in talks aimed at settling a trade dispute that has bruised the global economy and repeatedly shaken financial markets, with U.S. officials saying a deal could be signed this month.</p>
      <p>The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, climbed 0.3% to its highest since February 2018, with major European indexes following Asia upwards.</p>
      <p>European stocks followed Asian indexes upwards, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 gaining 0.9%. Frankfurt’s main index .GDAXI, seen as highly exposed to the trade war, climbing 1.2% to reach its highest since June last year.</p>
      <p>Wall Street futures ESc1 gained 0.5%.</p>
      <p>The optimistic tone reached currency markets, too, with the Chinese yuan CNH=EBS rising to a 12-week high versus the dollar.</p>
      <p>Investors expect the world’s two biggest economies to reach a “phase one” trade deal, with U.S. President Donald Trump hoping to sign an agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
      <p>The key date in focus is Dec. 15, when new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports from toys to electronics are due to kick in.</p>
      <p>Both sides have an interest in averting those tariffs, with Trump in particular seen as aiming to reap political benefits from sealing a deal ahead of the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“It will be a convenient decision for President Trump to let phase one be signed,” said Alessia Berardi, senior economist at Amundi. “This is a kind of low-hanging fruit to collect and is very much possible.”</p>
      <p>Still, Berardi warned that intellectual property would be a thornier issue and could yet complicate talks next year.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the positive mood on trade had sent Asian stocks surging, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS up 1.2%.</p>
      <p>Indexes in Hong Kong .HSI and Seoul .KS11 gained 1.7% and 1.4% respectively, while mainland Chinese blue chips .CSI300 added 0.7%.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ECONOMIC RESILIENCE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Also emboldening investors was a sense that a global recession, predicted by many economists and investors to hit next year, was a diminishing risk.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report added to signs of economic resilience. Job growth slowed less than expected in October, with hiring in the two months before that better than previously estimated.</p>
      <p>“The macro environment is still resilient, stabilized and maybe even showing signs of improvement – and that is a net positive for risky assets,” said Olivier Marciot, senior portfolio manager at Unigestion.</p>
      <p>Bond markets, too, suggested that the United States may have dodged a slowdown. The three-month to 10-year Treasury yield curve – a key warning sign of U.S. recession when inverted – is rising again after staying in negative territory for long periods since May.</p>
      <p>And on the earnings front, U.S. results are for the third straight quarter defying expectations for an annual aggregate contraction.</p>
      <p>“Expectations were low going into earnings, and things are getting better than expected,” Marciot said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WAITING FOR LAGARDE</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the Chinese yuan strengthened, the euro trod water. Investors were waiting for Christine Lagarde’s first speech as European Central Bank president.</p>
      <p>Markets are assuming that Lagarde, due to talk at 1800 GMT, will stick with the easy policy script of her predecessor, Mario Draghi.</p>
      <p>Lagarde has struck a balanced tone in recent comments, saying an accommodative monetary policy was needed but also had side effects that needed monitoring.</p>
      <p>The euro EUR=EBS was last flat at $1.1161, close to the $1.1180 high reached last month. The dollar against a basket of six major currencies .DXY edged up 0.1% to 97.289.</p>
      <p>In commodities, oil prices crept higher on the trade optimism. Brent crude futures LCOc1 gained 69 cents to $62.58 a barrel shortly before midday, its highest in over a month.</p>
