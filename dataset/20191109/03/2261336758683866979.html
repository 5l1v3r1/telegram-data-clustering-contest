      <p>The New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) has fined two fighters, and one coach, following the blockbuster UFC 244 pay-per-view at Madison Square Garden last Saturday.</p>

      <p>First on the hit list were Kelvin Gastelum and head coach Rafael Cordeiro, who were accused of cheating at the official UFC 244 weigh-ins on Friday. Gastelum, who dropped a split decision to Darren Till in the UFC 244 co-main event, appeared to lean on Cordeiro to manipulate the scales and cheat the weigh-in process. Gastelum was fined $1000, while coach Cordeiro received a $200 penalty.</p>
      <p>Top-five UFC light heavyweight contender Corey Anderson also received a whopping $10,000 fine for ‘unsportsmanlike and disorderly conduct’, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/8/20955654/nysac-fines-kelvin-gastelum-rafael-cordeiro-and-corey-anderson-for-ufc-244-actions">per MMA Fighting’s Steven Marrocco</a>. Anderson, who disposed of Johnny Walker via first-round KO, is reported to have pushed the referee during his post-fight celebration. The usually reserved light heavyweight has since apologized for his outburst and promised not to repeat his actions.</p>
