      <p>LONDON: An armed mugger has been jailed for 10 years after attempting to rob <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arsenal">Arsenal</a> duo <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mesut-Ozil">Mesut Ozil</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sead-Kolasinac">Sead Kolasinac</a> of luxury watches worth £200,000 ($257,000, 231,000 euros).</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Harrow-Crown-Court">Harrow Crown Court</a> heard that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashley-Smith">Ashley Smith</a> and his accomplice did not count on the bravery of Bosnian defender Kolasinac in fighting back during the attack in London in July.</p>
      <p>Ozil then drove them from the ambush as the would-be robbers pursued them on a stolen moped and threw stones, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Smith, 30, was described by judge Ian Bourne QC as a prolific "career criminal" who was well known to police.</p>
      <p>A second man, Jordan Northover, has also pleaded guilty to the attempted robbery just feet from Kolasinac's home, and will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
      <p>Smith and Northover were "armed and dangerous" with a knitting needle and a pointed screwdriver as weapons, according to the judge.</p>
      <p>"Between them they produced these weapons which they threatened Mr Kolasinac with, a long pointed blade which was thrust in the victim's direction and made contact with him.</p>
      <p>"The two of them had not counted on Mr Kolasinac fighting back and he behaved incredibly bravely."</p>
      <p>The court heard that footage showed Kolasinac attempting to engage with the culprits, but he was able to get in the car which was then driven away by Ozil.</p>
      <p>Both players and Ozil's wife were able to flee despite being pursued by the defendants, who threw stones at the car.</p>
      <p>Officers were able to trace the defendants and arrest them after a member of the public later saw the moped being parked in Boreham Wood and called police.</p>
      <p>The judge stated that Smith has "an appalling criminal record" of 20 convictions from 38 offences dating back to when he was 14 years old.</p>
