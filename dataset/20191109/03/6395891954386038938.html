      <p><b>DEDHAM</b> - The Ashland Clockers dream season continues as they go into Veterans Memorial Stadium in Rockland and beat the previously undefeated Rockland Bulldogs 33-16.</p>
      <p>With the win, Ashland moves on to the Divsion 6 playoff final next week. </p>
      <p>Ashland was led by Quarterback Dominic Cavanugh who rushed for two touchdowns and ran the offense to near perfection against a very tough Rockland defense.</p>
      <p>Ashland has dedicated this entire season to two former teammates who passed away in the past year from the same form of Cancer.  Both Jake Silver and PJ Ferrier died from Osteosarcoma within three months of each other.  The players on this current Ashland team played with Jake and knew PJ.</p>
