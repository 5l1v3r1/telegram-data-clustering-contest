      <p>Photographer and filmmaker Robert Freeman, the artist behind the Beatles’ seminal early album covers, has died at the age of 82, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/paul-mccartney-beatles-photographer-robert-freeman-tribute-910071/"><i>Rolling Stone</i> reports</a>. The band’s official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/thebeatles/status/1192869515622854658">also posted about Freeman’s passing</a> on Friday, as did Ringo Starr.</p>
      <p>Initially a photographer for Britain’s <i>Sunday</i> <i>Time</i>s, Freeman was commissioned for a portrait of the Beatles by band manager Brian Epstein in 1963. His relationship with the Fab Four ended up spanning years, and included the album covers for <i>With the Beatles</i>, <i>Beatles for Sale</i>, <i>Help!, </i>and <i>Rubber Soul, </i>in addition to the credits sequences for their films <i>Help!</i> and <i>A Hard Day’s Night. </i>Freeman would go on to direct the cult Swinging London film <i>The Touchables</i>, as well as shoot the first Pirelli Calendar.</p>

      <p>Paul McCartney posted a personal remembrance of Freeman on his blog, describing in detail how the photographer captured the Fab Four for <i>Meet the Beatles </i>and <i>Rubber Soul</i>. “He was one of our favourite photographers during the Beatles years who came up with some of our most iconic album covers. Besides being a great professional he was imaginative and a true original thinker,” the singer <a href="https://www.paulmccartney.com/news-blogs/news/paul-on-robert-freeman">wrote in part</a>. “I will miss this wonderful man but will always cherish the fond memories I have of him.”</p>
