      <h1>Mark Meadows caught MSNBC's anti-GOP bias 'in real time,' Charlie Kirk says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T03:46:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 03:46</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk praised <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/mark-meadows">Rep. Mark Meadows</a>, R-N.C., on Friday, after Meadows interrupted an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">MSNBC</a> reporter on the air to defend his fellow Republican lawmakers and President Trump.</p>
      <p>Meadows "caught [MSNBC] with their own bias in real-time," Kirk said, during an appearance on Fox News' <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/ingraham-angle">"The Ingraham Angle."</a></p>
      <p>On Wednesday, MSNBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell was reporting live from Capitol Hill about the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>"Republicans continue to hang everything on Ambassador [Kurt] Volker," Caldwell told viewers, referring to the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, who resigned from the State Department in September after his name appeared in a whistleblower complaint about a July phone call between Trump and the leader of Ukraine.</p>

      <p>During Caldwell's report, Meadows -- a member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee -- walked by with his staff, so Caldwell attempted to flag him down for an impromptu interview, but he declined.</p>
      <p>Caldwell then continued her report, claiming Republicans "are really struggling to defend the president."</p>
      <p>Meadows was off camera at the time but within earshot of Caldwell. Suddenly, he returned to Caldwell, leaned into her camera shot, and sternly responded:</p>
      <p>"I'm not struggling on anything. The Republicans are not struggling on anything," he said, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/469299-meadows-breezes-past-msnbc-reporter-in-live-shot-returns-to-defend-trump">continuing</a> to further defend <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>On "The Ingraham Angle," Kirk admonished Caldwell, suggesting she should have asked Meadows whether the GOP was struggling rather than make a statement herself.</p>
      <p>"Be a journalist," Kirk said. "Say, 'Are you struggling?' You don't have to tell the congressman what is going on because you're the journalist."</p>

      <p>"He is upbeat, he's focused ... he's energetic," Lord said.</p>
      <p>"He passionately believes in the American people. ... He was terrific when I saw him."</p>
