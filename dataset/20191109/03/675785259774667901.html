      <h1>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez 'wants MLS transfer', claims Uruguay teammate</h1>
      <h2>Nicolas Lodeiro says US move for former Liverpool striker is 'only a matter of time'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T03:41:12+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 03:41</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez is keen on a move to MLS, according to his Uruguay teammate Nicolas Lodeiro.</p>
      <p>Lodeiro, who plays for Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders, says Suarez is ready to make the move across the pond after fulfilling his dream by playing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> for the past five years.</p>
      <p>Suarez's compatriot says the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker is "always asking" about MLS and declared it's "only a matter of time" before he leaves Barca to head Stateside.</p>
      <p>Since joining Barcelona from Liverpool for £74million in 2014, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/luis-suarez">Suarez</a> has won nine major trophies with the Catalan club, including the Champions League in 2015.</p>
      <p>Suarez is still in fine form and has six La Liga goals from nine games so far this season.</p>

      <p>However, with the striker set to turn 33 in January, it is widely expected that the end of his time at Camp Nou is near, and Barcelona <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/barcelona-enter-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-20834572">having been linked with a swoop for Arsenal's Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang</a> to replenish their attacking ranks.</p>
      <p>And MLS is Suarez's most likely destination, according to Lodeiro.</p>
      <p>"I think you need to convince Barcelona [because] he wants to come to MLS," the Sounders midfielder told <a href="https://global.espn.com/football/soccer-transfers/story/3984487/sources-barcelona-facing-suarez-dilemma-amid-mls-interest">ESPN</a> .</p>
      <p>"He is always asking me about the league. His dream was to play for Barcelona. He's playing at a great level and he feels comfortable there.</p>

      <p>"Sooner or later he'll come to MLS, though.</p>
      <p>"Well, hopefully. He likes the league. He's always asking me things about it. I think it's only a matter of time before he's out here."</p>
      <p>Suarez is contracted to Barcelona until the summer of 2021, and even at his age is currently valued at £45m, according to football stats website <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/luis-suarez/profil/spieler/44352">Transfermarkt</a> .</p>
