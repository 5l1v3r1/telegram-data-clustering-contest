      <h1>Python Finally Overtakes Java on GitHub</h1>

      <p>"The hit programming language Python has climbed over once-dominant Java to become the second most popular language on Microsoft-owned open-source code-sharing site GitHub," reports ZDNet: <i>Python <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-python-overtakes-java-on-github-as-google-dart-use-soars/">now outranks Java based on the number of repository contributors</a>, and by that metric Python is now second only to JavaScript, which has been in top spot since 2014, according to GitHub's <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">'State of the Octoverse' report for 2019</a>...<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of GitHub's report is its ranking of fastest-growing languages. Google's Dart programming language and Flutter, for building UIs for iOS and Android apps, are getting major traction with developers on GitHub. Dart was the fastest-growing language between 2018 and 2019, with usage up a massive 532%. It was followed by the Mozilla-developed Rust, which grew a respectable 235%. Microsoft is experimenting with Rust in its Windows code base because it was designed to address memory-related security bugs -- the dominant flaw-type in Microsoft software over the past decade. <br/><br/>Last year Kotlin, the Google-endorsed programming language for Android app development, was the fastest-growing language on GitHub. It's not a top-10 language yet, but it still grew 182% over the year. Microsoft-backed TypeScript, its superset of JavaScript, is also growing fast, up 161% over the past year as more developers use it to grapple with large-scale JavaScript apps. <br/><br/>Other languages making up the top 10 fastest-growing category are HCL, PowerShell, Apex, Python, Assembly, and Go.</i></p>
