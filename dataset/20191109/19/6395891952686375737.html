      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Boston resident Rachel Valerio thought her $90-a-night Airbnb apartment in New York City was a good deal until she realized she had booked an apartment in a New York City Housing Authority complex.</p>
      <p>Valerio tells The New York Times that the apartment was highly rated on Airbnb but it smelled like gas and there was a roach trap next to the bed.</p>
      <p>On the plus side, the apartment in the Housing Authority's Fulton Houses was next door to the High Line and Chelsea Market.</p>
      <p>Subletting a government-subsidized apartment is illegal but it does occasionally happen. The Times reports that an Airbnb listing appeared last week for a "charming, private apartment" at the Queensbridge Houses in Queens.</p>
      <p>The Housing Authority says it is investigating.</p>
      <p>Airbnb refunded Valerio's money last week.</p>
