      <p>The woman who died after being swept away by floodwater has been named as the former High Sheriff of Derbyshire, Annie Hall.</p>
      <p>Derbyshire <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/shocking-moment-bikers-lead-police-20839932">Police</a> said Mrs Hall's body was found in the early hours of Friday after she was swept away by water in Darley Dale, near Matlock.</p>
      <p>It came as parts of the Midlands and northern England were <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bad-weather">battered</a> by a month's worth of rain in one day.</p>

      <p>"I am shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely and tragic death of my friend, and former High Sheriff, Annie Hall," Derbyshire Police's Chief Constable Peter Goodman said. "Annie was a great leader in Derbyshire in both industry and on the civic front. She will be hugely missed."</p>
      <p>Her family also released a statement, saying: "It is with great sadness that we, the family of Annie Hall, report her sudden passing. "We are in great shock and grieving."</p>
