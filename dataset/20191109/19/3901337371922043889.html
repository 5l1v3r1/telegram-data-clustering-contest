      <p>Kaizer Chiefs head coach Ernst Middendorp insists claiming three points in the Soweto derby was all that matter on the day.</p>

        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/kaizer-chiefs/absa-premiership-report-kaizer-chiefs-v-orlando-pirates-09-november-2019/667127">Chiefs Win Soweto Derby Thriller To Move 10 Points Clear</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Chiefs moved 10 points clear of Mamelodi Sundowns after claiming a 3-2 win over Orlando Pirates on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Buccaneers did hit the woodwork on a few ocassions, but the German-born mentor was just pleased to see his side walk away with three points after admitting it was not their best showing.</p>
      <p>"Ja, three points, definitely not one of our best performance in terms of playing, but in terms of commitment, focus, doing the right thing in the right moment I think we have the three points," Middendorp told SuperSport after the game.</p>
      <p>"In certain moments definitely we were exposed, left and right full-back position, despite [having] spoken about it but you have to understand, Kaizer Chiefs does totally a round-up, new building at the beginning of the season, having a 21-year old player at the right-full back and a 22-year old player at the left full-back coming from the lower league, that's not normal.</p>
      <p>"In certain moments, not really to watch the calmness in the opposition side, but it belongs to the soccer, a soccer game is a game of mistakes and if you make a mistake in the defence, mistake in the attacking, you're not good. What are you expecting, you're expecting to win? I don't think so," he continued.</p>
      <p>"We had probably our possibilities, we had chances in our finishing activities [in the] first half, two, three very clear moments, second-half, just for example I don't know why on the penalty spot, Khama Billiat is not taking the shot with the right, he gave it to the left foot, we can go on.</p>
      <p>"This nonsense I can hear that is coming, goal-post and whatever, tactically, etc I can tell you already, this is nonsense, in the end it is the result that counts if you do it with the fighting spirit as we've done it today, then it's okay.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately we lost Erick [Mathoho], I don't know what happened really, unfortunately Daniel Akpeyi got another yellow card, good we have two, three weeks time we will see as we prepare ourselves for the next game."</p>
