      <h1>Arsenal board members watch Leicester loss amid Unai Emery sack speculation</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery is under increasing pressure at Arsenal following the 2-0 defeat to Leicester at the King Power</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:29:35+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal's defeat to Leicester was watched by senior Emirates chiefs amid increased pressure on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Emery's future has been under speculation in recent weeks after a disappointing start to the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> were beaten 2-0 at the King Power on Saturday evening as Jamie Vardy and James Maddison found the net.</p>
      <p>The victory took <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> into second in the Premier League and nine points ahead of the Gunners, who are now sixth.</p>
      <p>Arsenal face an uphill challenge to make the top four and that will do little to ease the pressure on Emery going into the international break.</p>

      <p>And the presence of technical director Edu and Head of Football Raul Sanllehi won't have helped matters.</p>
      <p>The pair were seen looking glum as Leicester dominated the second half and claimed victory.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are not believed to be considering sacking Emery but fans have made their feelings clear after the latest defeat.</p>

      <p>The setback at the King Power is the latest in a line of poor results on the road under Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have won just one of their last six Premier League matches and have won just once on the road, at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> on the opening weekend.</p>
