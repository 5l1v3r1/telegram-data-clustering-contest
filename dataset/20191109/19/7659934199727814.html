      <p>Sudan needs up to $5 billion in budget support to avert economic collapse and launch reforms after the ouster of Omar al-Bashir, its finance minister told Reuters.<br/><br/>The country has only enough foreign currency reserves to fund imports for a few weeks, said Ibrahim Elbadawi, part of a transitional government formed in August.<br/><br/>Sudan has had some support for fuel and wheat imports but about 65 percent of its 44 million people live in poverty and it needs up to $2 billion in development funding along with a hoped-for $2 billion from Arab development funds, he said.<br/><br/>Outlining reform plans in detail for the first time, Elbadawi said public salaries would need to be increased and a social support network established to prepare for the painful removal of fuel and food subsidies.<br/><br/>Months of demonstrations over price hikes for fuel and bread and cash shortages triggered the uprising against Bashir, who was toppled in April by the military. Protests have continued since.<br/><br/>"We have started the process (of reforms)," Elbadawi said in an interview on Thursday. "The people of Sudan deserve to be seen in a radically different prism than the international community used to see Sudan, as a country ruled by a pariah state."<br/><br/>"Now we have a revolution," he said. Asked how much budget support was needed for 2020 he said: "Some estimates say between three to four billion (US dollars), maybe even five billion."<br/><br/>The civilian government Elbadawi is part of has taken over for three years under a power-sharing deal with the military. It has drawn slightly more than half of $3 billion in support for imports of wheat and fuel offered by Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates in April, he said.<br/><br/>A "friends of Sudan" donor meeting is planned for December and the government had agreed with the United States it could start engaging with international institutions while still on a list of countries deemed sponsors of terrorism, Elbadawi said.</p>
