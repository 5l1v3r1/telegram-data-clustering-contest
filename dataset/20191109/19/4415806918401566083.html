      <p>A Norway spruce purchased as a sapling 60 years ago has been installed as New York City’s famous Rockefeller Centre Christmas tree.</p>
      <p>The 77ft tree from the village of Florida, New York, was lifted into place on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Carol Schultz bought the sapling in 1959 and planted it in her front garden after the Christmas season and watched it grow.</p>
      <p>She and friend Richard O’Donnell went on to Rockefeller’s website in 2010 and entered the tree into the selection pool.</p>
      <p>They learned earlier this year that it had made the cut.</p>

      <p>The tree was chopped down on Thursday and lifted by crane on to a flatbed truck for transportation to Manhattan.</p>
      <p>A ceremony to switch on its lights will take place on December 4.</p>
