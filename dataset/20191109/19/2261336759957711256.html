      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has laid out the terms for a rematch with Conor McGregor, claiming that the Irishman must win at least ‘nine or ten’ fights before he considers running it back with ‘The Notorious’.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov, who submitted McGregor back at UFC 229 to retain his lightweight title, says, as of right now, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion isn’t even on his radar.</p>
      <p>”As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights. If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that’s completely possible,” Nurmagomedov said at a press conference in Moscow on Friday (<a href="https://www.sportbible.com/ufc/rivalries-khabib-claims-conor-mcgregor-needs-10-wins-to-earn-rematch-20191109">h/t Ryan Sidle of SportBible</a>).</p>
      <p>The undefeated Dagestani also laid out the terms for his next fight, claiming he will not compete in Las Vegas unless the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) apologizes for issuing him a whopping $500,000 fine and six-month suspension following his post-fight brawl at UFC 229, which saw Khabib attack McGregor teammate Dillon Danis in the stands.</p>
      <p>“They offered me to fight in Vegas in March, but I told them that if Vegas officially apologizes for wrongly fining me for that incident on October 6, 2018, then I’ll fight there,” Khabib said.</p>
      <p>”If not, then they can assign me to another date. As far as I know, they’re planning in April to hold (a fight card) somewhere in New York, so I’m saying I’m ready for April, or March if Las Vegas apologises.”</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov’s next title defense is expected to be against Tony Ferguson, with the Russian claiming there’s a ‘95 percent chance’ he fights ‘El Cucuy’ next.</p>
