      <p><i>"Some solutions are interesting, but I don't like the rear wing, I would have done something different. I believe, however, that the definitive single-seater will be a bit different from the one we saw in the presentation, maybe those guidelines will be, but I expect some news,"</i> Massa said. </p>
      <p>
        <i>"But I believe that the car is only a part, you need a championship that works for the public, in the end, this will be the goal."</i>
