      <p>There is a royal family reunion tonight. On Saturday, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first joint appearance with Prince William and Kate Middleton in months for the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance. This is the first time the two couples have stepped out publicly together since the Trooping the Colour event back in June to celebrate the Queen’s official birthday.</p>

      <p>Saturday’s event is dedicated to servicemen and women who have died in the line of duty, and has been an annual tradition since 1923. The reunion for William and Harry marks the first time they’ve been seen together since Meghan and Harry’s interview with Tom Bradby, where Harry revealed he’s on a “different path” from his older brother, sparking rumors of a rift.</p>

      <p>A Kensington Palace source revealed that William and Kate are worried about how Meghan and Harry are doing, but that Kate is trying to steer clear of the brotherly drama.</p>
      <p>“While Kate’s concerned about Harry and Meghan’s wellbeing, she tries to stay out of the drama,” <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1202180/meghan-markle-news-prince-harry-rift-prince-william-kate-middleton-royal-news-remembrance">the source said</a>. “She hopes William and Harry will eventually heal the rift and let bygones be bygones.”</p>
      <p>As for Meghan’s portion of the interview, her comments were interpreted by some as a slight to the royal’s traditional way of handling criticism.</p>
      <p>“I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought that it would be fair,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meghan-markle-stiff-upper-lip-harry-and-meghan-an-african-journey-2019-10-21/">she said</a> about her new life as a constant topic in British tabloids. “I've really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip...I tried to...I tried, but I think what that does internally is probably really damaging.”</p>
