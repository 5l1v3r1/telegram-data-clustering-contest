      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:22:13+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-william">Prince William</a> have tonight been pictured together for the first time since an insightful documentary explored their relationship.</p>
      <p>The brothers are at a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Day</a> service with other <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">royals</a> , including their partners <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> and Kate Middleton.</p>
      <p>The event at the Royal Albert Hall, part of Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, commemorates all those who lost their lives in conflicts.</p>
      <p>The Queen will also be present.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-harry-says-william-different-20661918">Harry, 35, confirmed a rift with William</a> in the documentary last month. He conceded they have had "bad days".</p>
      <p>It is understood <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/concerned-prince-william-didnt-see-20671450">William, 37, did not watch the ITV programme</a> ahead of its airing and was left "concerned" for his brother afterwards.</p>

      <p>Speaking in it to anchor Tom Bradby, Harry said: "Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under ­inevitably, you know, stuff happens.</p>
      <p>“But look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers.</p>
      <p>"We’re certainly on different paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me.</p>
      <p>"You know, we don’t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we’re so busy.</p>
      <p>"But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing.</p>
      <p>"Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days."</p>
      <p>The royals will tomorrow attend the traditional Remembrance Sunday services and lay wreaths to commemorate those who lost their lives in conflicts.</p>
