      </p>
      <p>The Kings led 16-0 early in the second half, before the hosts launched a gallant fightback.</p>
      <p>The match was played in treacherous conditions and the Kings were forced to defend for large periods towards the end of the contest.</p>
      <p>Ospreys twice had a chance to sneak a win at the death, but replacement flyhalf James Hook missed with two penalty attempts in the dying moments.</p>
      <p>Kings fullback Scott van Breda was on fire with his boot, kicking three penalties and a conversion to help his side to a valuable win.</p>
      <p>It was the Kings' first win of the PRO14 season, having lost their first five games on the trot.</p>
      <p>The Kings' next match is against Irish side Connacht in Galway on November 30.</p>
