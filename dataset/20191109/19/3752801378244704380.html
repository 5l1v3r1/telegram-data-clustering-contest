      <p>A man has been stabbed to death while fishing with his friend at Emmarentia Dam in Johannesburg on Friday night.</p>
      <p>SAPS Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said police were investigating a murder case, and that the suspect was a 38-year-old male.</p>
      <p>Peters said the deceased, a 36-year-old man, was fishing with his friend when an unknown man approached them.</p>
      <p>He said an argument ensued between them when the suspect started to shine a torch in the victim and his friend's face.</p>
      <p>"The argument then started and the deceased and his friend then started to leave after packing their fishing rods," Peters said.</p>
      <p>"The argument continued, and the suspect started hitting one victim on the left jaw. He sustained a cut underneath the jaw, but managed to run away."</p>
      <p>The suspect then allegedly turned on the other man and started stabbing him repeatedly.</p>
      <p>"When the victim who ran came back, he found the paramedics trying to help his friend, with the suspect still at the scene," Peters said.</p>
      <p>The man was declared dead on scene.</p>
