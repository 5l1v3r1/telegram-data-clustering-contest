      <p>Ouch, Cheryl, you might want to look away! Your ex Liam Payne has been opening up about his new love, US model Maya Henry – and it could make grim reading...</p>
      <p>The ex-One Direction singer says his romantic past has been “super-horrendous”.</p>
      <p>And he appeared to suggest that former Girls Aloud star Cheryl wasn’t the real deal... even though they have a little one together.</p>
      <p>Liam says: “I’m really happy right now and things are good. Being in love, how would I describe that? F***ing s*** got real.</p>
      <p>"Now that I’ve found someone who’s genuinely my best friend as well as my partner, it’s massively changed things for me.</p>
      <p>"She’s just so relaxed about everything. Someone who’s completely got your back with everything is just the wildest thing. I don’t think I’ve really experienced that before in someone.”</p>

      <p>Liam, 26, split with Cheryl, 36, in July 2018. They have two-year-old son Bear together.</p>
      <p>And he confessed that with “love and relationships” his past has “been super-horrendous so far”, adding: “Honestly, with love, I think you don’t really understand it until it gives you that sting.</p>

      <p>“It took a long time for me, something really hurt me, and it made me really appreciate love and people a lot more.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about him and Cheryl now, he says: “We’ve put Bear at the forefront. I think we’ve managed to do quite a good job of it so far.”</p>
      <p>Over to you, Cheryl!</p>
