      <h1>Bayern Munich crush Dortmund thanks to Robert Lewandowski double</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:45:12+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/09/Reuters" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Bayern Munich crushed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/borussiadortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a> 4-0 with two goals from Robert Lewandowski lifting them into third place and giving interim coach Hansi Flick an impressive debut.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski kept up his sensational run, netting in the 17th and 76th minutes to take his league tally to 16 goals and broke a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball">Bundesliga</a> record in the process by scoring in each of the first 11 games of the season.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry was also on target – as was Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, who capped a disastrous performance by the visitors with an 80th-minute own goal against his former club.</p>
      <p>Bayern bounced back in style from last week’s 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt that cost coach Niko Kovac his job, outclassing lacklustre Dortmund in every department as they try to get their bid for a record eighth consecutive league title back on track. They have won their first two games under Flick, after beating Olympiakos 2-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dortmund had the better start to the game, but after a quarter of an hour Bayern gradually took control and Lewandowski put them in the driving seat. They launched attack after attack, and Dortmund’s backline were dazed. Dortmund coach, Lucien Favre, took Jadon Sancho off after 36 minutes and replaced him with Raphaël Guerreiro but to no avail. Bayern struck again two minutes after the restart with Gnabry, who had put the ball in the net in the first half as well only to be ruled offside.</p>
      <p>Dortmund created only one clear chance in the game through Paco Alcácer but were unable to score, while Lewandowski made it 3-0 from close range in the 76th and Hummels turned a cutback into his own net four minutes later to compound his side’s defeat.</p>
