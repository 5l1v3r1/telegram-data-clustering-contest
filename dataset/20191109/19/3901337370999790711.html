      <p>Slovakian-born coach Jozef Vukusic has turned a dire situation around since arriving at Usuthu, after winning three consecutive games that moved them away from the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>In contrast, new Chippa coach Norman Mapeza has not hit the ground running at the Port Elizabeth based outfit, as they are still yet to win a league game this season.</p>
      <p>The Chilli Boysâ€™ losing extended their losing run to four matches in the Absa Premiership after going down 2-0 to Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday. As a result, they are rooted at the bottom of the log.</p>
      <p>In their meetings last season in the league, Usuthu won the first round clash 1-0, while Chippa repeated the same scenario of winning the return fixture in Durban.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>AmaZulu: </b>28. Mbatha, 4. Morton, 17. M.Gumede, 27. Xoki, 18. Booysen, 34. Maduna, 33. Darpoh, 19. Sithebe, 11. Karuru, 20. Majoro, 7. Ntuli.</p>
