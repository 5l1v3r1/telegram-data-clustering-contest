      <h1>Hilary Duff Teases Ethan Craft and Lizzie McGuire Might Have ‘Thing’ In Reboot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:09:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author">Erika Harwood</a></address>
      <p>Hilary Duff is dropping more clues about the <i>Lizzie McGuire </i>reboot, and frankly, it raises more questions than answers. Duff is currently filming the series, which is currently being shot in New York, but fans are still wondering who, exactly, will be returning from the original cast. While all the actors from Lizzie’s immediate family have been confirmed, Duff dropped a new hint about someone else: Ethan Craft.</p>
      <p>“He is hot. He's very hot,” <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1090743/hilary-duff-s-latest-scoop-about-lizzie-mcguire-revival-will-have-fans-freaking-out">Duff told E! News</a>. “I'm pretty sure there's going to be, there's going to be a thing.”</p>
      <p>So, Ethan Craft is still hot and most likely will be back. As for Lizzie’s other love interest and best friend Gordo, Duff added that she “can't give away too much” and left it at that. Why must you, Hilary?</p>
      <p>Duff also shared what it’s been like stepping back into the shoes of the Disney character that made her famous.</p>
      <p>“It's been fun to find the new version of [Lizzie]. She's a little less frantic and a little more confident. She has some years of life under her belt. There's that relatability that I think that everyone loves in her,” she said. “She is going to be coming across some challenges that the show is gonna serve up and a lot of what people want to see or the answers to questions that they never got.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear when the reboot will be premiering, but the show will exclusively stream on Disney+, so get your subscriptions ready.</p>
