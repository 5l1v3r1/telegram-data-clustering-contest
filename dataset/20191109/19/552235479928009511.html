      <h1>Unai Emery slaughtered by Arsenal fans as Kieran Tierney snub in Leicester defeat leads to sacking calls</h1>
      <h2>The former Celtic star was dropped to the bench and it's fair to say Arsenal fans aren't happy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:23:55+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal fans have reiterated their calls for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> to be sacked as manager after defeat to Leicester.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were beaten 2-0 at the King Power after goals from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison gave <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> side a deserved win.</p>
      <p>Emery was already under pressure but the decision to leave <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> and Nicholas Pepe on the bench angered the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> support.</p>
      <p>The resulting defeat left them even more annoyed and fans thought the decision to switch to 3-5-2 would have been the perfect time to play Tierney ahead of Kolasinac.</p>
      <p>And fans were quick to take to Twitter to call for the Spaniard to be axed as Tierney was left on the bench for the full 90 against his old side.</p>
      <p><b>@dare4exploits</b> said: You want to play a tactic that involve crossings into the box and you left your best crosser #Tierney on the bench allowing Bellerin to waste pull outs all day long. #EmeryOut"</p>

      <p><b>@idderz</b> added: 2-0 down after 75 mins and he keeps tierney and pepe on the bench...get out this club asap! #emeryout</p>
      <p><b>@MrDTAFC</b> said: "What did I say last week, Emery always does something that baffles us, Tierney and Pépé on the bench."</p>
      <p><b>@VieiraPaddy</b> added: "Can someone please tell me why Tierney started on Wednesday and Kolasinac is starting today and not the other way around."</p>
      <p><b>@dalecstewart</b> said: "Well, seems like, once again, #Arsenal do not realise just what a talent they have left to sit on the bench, in Kieran Tierney"</p>
      <p><b>@gwillie555</b> said: "U need ur wingback to be a creative outlet with good deliveries and u bench Tierney who's one of the best crossers around for Kola who's crossing is average. Emery, guys! Top tactician."</p>
      <p><b>@lokomopeter</b> added: "Emery is clueless. Why is he reinventing the wheel every single weekend. Chambers in midfield? Pépé and Tierney on the bench?"</p>
      <p><b>@timiprelondon</b> said: "Tierney would’ve been brilliant in a game like this"</p>
