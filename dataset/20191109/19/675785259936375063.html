      <h2>Ellen White's goal for England Women proved in vain as Germany claimed victory at Wembley. Klara Buhl popped up with a late winner as the visitors took the bragging rights</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:25:59+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Klara Buhl struck a last-gasp winner to earn Germany victory at Wembley.</p>
      <p>Alexandra Popp gave the visitors an early lead before Ellen White levelled on 44 minutes for England Women.</p>
      <p>However, Buhl found the net at the death as Phil Neville's Lionesses suffered late heartbreak.</p>
      <p>It was Germany who came closest at the start of the game.</p>
      <p>Lena Oberdorf drove forwards to create the space before passing to captain Popp, whose effort forced Earps to tip the ball onto the crossbar.</p>
      <p>With their second chance of the match it was the visitors who took the lead in the ninth minute.</p>

      <p>Popp flicked a header past Earps from a Kathrin Hendrich cross to put the second-ranked team in the world ahead.</p>
      <p>Beth Mead, who had looked one of England's brightest options going forward, went down under a heavy tackle in the 28th minute.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old was involved in a challenge with Sara Doorsoun, who was shown a yellow card, but was able to continue.</p>
      <p>The Lionesses were awarded a penalty in the 35th minute, with referee Stephanie Frappart ruling Mead was brought down by goalkeeper Mere Frohms.</p>

      <p>White had threaded a ball through for Mead before she was fouled, with the referee awarding a spot-kick and a yellow card to the diving goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>With a chance to level the tie, Nikita Parris stepped up to take the penalty, having scored just one out of three at the World Cup in the summer.</p>
      <p>The Lyon forward's low drive was saved by the goalkeeper, as the Germans kept their 1-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Ellen White levelled the score for the Lionesses just before the half-time whistle.</p>
      <p>The experienced forward beat the offside trap and got on the end of a clever lofted cross from Kiera Walsh to score her 36th international goal.</p>

      <p>Parris went down at the start of of the second half after Sophia Kleinherne appeared to catch her Achilles. Kleinherne was shown a yellow card for the attempted tackle, and Parris had to receive treatment before continuing.</p>
      <p>Just as the game looked to be lacking in intensity, Germany stormed forward forcing Earps into a low diving save to deny Klara Buhl.</p>
      <p>Lina Magull followed up from an offside position, and did have the ball in the back of the net, but the flag had been raised.</p>
      <p>Just as the game looked to be heading towards a draw, Germany started piling on the pressure, and captain Steph Houghton managed to make to important blocks to deny the visitors.</p>
      <p>But in the 89th minute, Klara Buhl retook the lead for Germany, with a calm finish as she shot across goal into the far corner.</p>
      <p>Jodie Taylor came close to finding an equaliser seconds later, but her outstretched effort was straight at Frohms.</p>
