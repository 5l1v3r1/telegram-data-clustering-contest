      <h1>Arm wrestler learns the horrific truth of crippling pain down side of his body</h1>
      <h2>Jason "Levi" Holley, 44, has a inoperable cancerous tumour in his brain and doctors said appropriate treatment in New Zealand is not available</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T19:08:23+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A fitness fanatic and arm wrestler has been rocked after doctors found a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancerous</a> tumour in his brain.</p>
      <p>Jason 'Levi' Holley, 44, had for months felt a crippling pain down one side of his body and doctors were unable to diagnose him.</p>
      <p>But they eventually found the tumour and discovered it was inoperable.</p>
      <p>"I have inoperable brain cancer. I plan to live with cancer, not die from it," the arm wrestler, of New Zealand, said.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had plenty of fights on my hands over the years and I’ve won all of them.</p>
      <p>"For those who have been part of my journey all these years, thank you. The journey continues."</p>
      <p>Jason has been in and out of hospital since the September diagnosis.</p>

      <p>The actor now faces gruelling chemotherapy and radiation.</p>
      <p>Doctors, though, have warned him other treatment options not yet available in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>He wants to travel internationally to find the relevant help.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/levi-holley?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR2MrmjXR4QhziXgyWTlrpAtyusollci14hWLmruKqzUjx-9Jw7cy_Encgc">GoFundMe page</a> to help raise funds for this has already helped Jason reach the £7,000 mark ($ Aust. Dollars 13,000).</p>

      <p>"No procedure is off the table," the webpage reads.</p>
      <p>The athlete also intends to sell his car, possessions and even a prized Batman costume to fund his treatment.</p>
      <p>Brain tumours are growths of cells in the brain which multiply in abnormal, uncontrollable ways.</p>
      <p>The NHS says generally, around 15 out of every 100 people with a cancerous brain tumour will survive for five years or more after being diagnosed.</p>
