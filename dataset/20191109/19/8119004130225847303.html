        <b>The “very severe” cyclonic storm Bulbul has started lashing the Indian coasts of Odisha as it is approaching the Sundarbans delta on the Bangladesh-West Bengal shorelines.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It has reportedly caused two deaths in India.</p>
      <p>It was centred about 35km southeast of Sagar Islands in West Bengal, 80km east-southeast of Digha, and 125km south-southwest of Kolkata at 7:30pm on Saturday, the Indian Meteorological Department said.</p>
      <p>It means the storm with a diameter of around 400km and an approaching speed of around 12km already started the process of landfall.</p>
      <p>The centre of the storm system is likely to cross the coast about 11pm, the IMD said.</p>
      <p>Trees were uprooted in various parts of Kolkata killing one person in a renowned club, state media the Press Trust of India said on Saturday, citing officials.</p>
      <p>Incessant rain since the early hours left parts of Kolkata and its adjoining suburbs with waterlogged streets and overflowing drains, leading to traffic congestion during busy office hours.</p>
      <p>West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she is herself monitoring the situation and the administration has taken all measures to tackle any contingency in view of the Cyclone Bulbul.</p>
      <p>Photos posted on social media showed police helping rescue workers clearing uprooted trees on the streets in Odisha.</p>
      <p>Information about the death of one person due to a rain-related wall collapse incident has been received from Kendrapara district, the PTI reported citing an official who said the authorities were checking the matter.</p>
