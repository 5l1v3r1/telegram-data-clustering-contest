      <p>Republicans on Saturday submitted an <a href="https://republicans-intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/rm_letter_to_chm_re_witness_request.pdf">impeachment hearing witness list to Democrats which includes the son of Vice President Joe Biden</a>, along with the intelligence community whistleblower who initially touched off questions about President Donald Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to launch certain investigations to help Mr. Trump's 2020 election bid.</p>
      <p>In a five page letter to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) blasted the process involved in the impeachment process, labeling it a 'one-sided and purely political' effort against President Trump.</p>
      <p>"Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite the Democrats' efforts to retroactively legitimize it last week," Nunes wrote, referring to a House vote to approve plans for the impeachment inquiry opposed by GOP lawmakers.</p>
      <p>The GOP request named eight specific witnesses:</p>
      <p>+ Hunter Biden, son of the former Vice President.</p>
      <p>+ Devon Archer, tied to Biden through a Ukraine energy company.</p>
      <p>+ Alexandra Chalupa, a former DNC staffer.</p>
      <p>+ David Hale, the third-ranking State Department official, who testified behind closed doors on November 6.</p>
      <p>+ Tim Morrison, National Security Council official who testified on October 31.</p>
      <p>+ Nellie Ohr, a frequent target of the GOP from the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>+ Kurt Volker, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, who was the first witness deposed by Congress.</p>
      <p>+ The whistleblower who brought the Ukraine issue to officials in the U.S. Intelligence Community.</p>
      <p>On his way to the Alabama-LSU college football game on Saturday, President Trump added his own jabs at Democrats.</p>

      <p>"PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!" the President tweeted, in a familiar complaint about the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>The GOP letter also asks to hear publicly from 'All individuals relied upon by the anonymous whistleblower in drafting his or her secondhand complaint.'</p>
      <p>It was not clear how many witnesses would be approved by Democrats; as of now, it's not known how long the hearings will go, or how many public sessions will be conducted.</p>
      <p>"We expect that you will call each of the witnesses listed above to ensure that the Democrats' "impeachment inquiry" treats the President with fairness," Nunes wrote.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The immediate reaction from Democrats did not seem positive for the GOP effort to call Hunter Biden and others.</p>

      <p>"This inquiry is not, and will not serve, however, as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the President pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit," Schiff wrote in a Saturday afternoon response.</p>
