      <p>Maybe it shouldn't be surprising for a war film to dominate the Veterans Day weekend box office. But this particular war film -- Roland Emmerich's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2474397/midway"><i>Midway</i></a> -- wasn't expected to dominate this particular Veterans Day 2019. And yet, here we are. World War II probably should've taught us not to underestimate Midway!</p>
      <p>Going into this weekend, it looked like the Stephen King adaptation <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2474954/doctor-sleep"><i>Doctor Sleep</i></a> would rule the weekend. <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/article/ed3798991876/?ref_=bo_hm_hp">Box Office Mojo</a> was estimating it would take #1 with about $27 million, followed by <i>Last Christmas</i> with $15 million, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> with about $13.4 million, and then <i>Midway</i> with $13 million.</p>
      <p>Not anymore! Not even close, it seems.</p>
      <p>After Friday's numbers came in, the box office estimates were recalculated. Now <i>Doctor Sleep</i> might be lucky to top $12.5 million across three days, with <i>Midway</i> looking to take the leaderboard with something closer to $18.5 million.</p>
      <p>Many war films tend to be critic-proof, and <i>Midway</i> is another one. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2483883/midway-review-your-granddads-new-favorite-movie">Reviews have been mixed-to-bad</a>, with 40% on Rotten Tomatoes, but the RT Audience Score is a much more effusive 90%. Not only that, <i>Midway</i> earned an A CinemaScore from moviegoers polled on opening night. Ticket buyers got what they paid for.</p>
      <p>That's not to say <i>Doctor Sleep</i> is getting bad reviews from fans. Not according to what's out there, anyway. <i>Doctor Sleep</i> has a B+ CinemaScore and a 91% RT audience score from 1,403 user ratings. <i>The Shining</i> sequel also has a 7.6/10 rating from 10,791 IMDb users. Meanwhile, <i>Midway</i> has a 6.7/10 rating from 2,122 IMDb users.</p>
      <p>So this is great news for <i>Midway</i>. But will it be enough? According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/doctor-sleep-midway-last-christmas-opening-weekend-box-office-1202780077/">Deadline</a>, a domestic box office of $65 million would be the break even point for Lionsgate with <i>Midway</i>, which reportedly cost $100 million to make. And that's with director/producer Roland Emmerich having to curb his ambitions a bit to keep costs down.</p>
      <p>At any rate, this has to be exciting news for Roland Emmerich and the star-studded <i>Midway</i> cast -- including Ed Skrein, who wanted to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484331/ed-skrein-wants-midway-to-honor-all-of-the-men-who-fought-in-that-battle">honor all of the soldiers who fought</a> in the real Battle of Midway; and Dennis Quaid, who explained <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484250/dennis-quaid-explains-why-midway-was-such-an-important-battle-for-america">why Midway was such an important WWII battle</a>; plus Nick Jonas, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484080/nick-jonas-with-a-mustache-heres-what-his-wife-priyanka-chopra-thought-of-his-midway-look">who grew that mustache</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Vikings</i> star Alexander Ludwig is also one of <i>Midway</i>'s stars, playing Lieutenant Roy Pearce, and he posted about the movie's unexpected box office victory:</p>

      <p>What went wrong for <i>Doctor Sleep</i>? That will be a point of discussion, I'm sure. I'm guessing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484338/doctor-sleep-how-different-was-the-movie-from-stephen-kings-book">changes from Stephen King's book</a>, and the 2.5 hour runtime, are probably in the mix. Be sure to check out our full weekend box office rundown tomorrow (Sunday, November 10) for all the details.</p>
