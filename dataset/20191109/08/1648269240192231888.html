      <h1>PSA-FCA Merger Will Retain All 13 Automakers In The Lineup</h1>
      <h2>Guess one of the biggest elephants in the room has been addressed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>When the PSA-FCA merger has been <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/379538/psa-fca-merger-plan-announced/">officially announced</a>, it gave birth to the fourth-largest automaker in the world, next to the VW Group, Toyota, and the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance. The new merger is a hodge-podge of automakers from different countries, amounting to a total of 8.7 million cars sold annually.</p>
      <p>But one can't deny that this brings forth an important question – will all brands under both companies soldier on after the 50/50 merger?</p>
      <p>Of note, there are four automakers under PSA, namely Peugeot, Citroen, DS, and Opel/Vauxhall. On the other hand, FCA has quite a number of carmakers under its belt – nine, to be exact – including Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, and Ram.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, PSA CEO Carlos Tavares shed a light about the issue in an interview with <i><a href="https://bfmbusiness.bfmtv.com/entreprise/pas-de-necessite-de-supprimer-des-marques-apres-la-fusion-explique-carlos-tavares-pdg-de-psa-1801937.html">BFM Business</a></i>, a French television station.</p>
      <p>According to a report by <i><a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/psa-fca-will-maintain-brands-after-merger-tavares-says">Automotive News Europe</a></i>, Tavares said that both PSA and FCA have no plans to ax any of the brands under their belt as a result of the $50-billion merger. With that said, all of the 13 brands listed above will soldier on under the new PSA-FCA alliance.</p>
      <p>"I see that all these brands, without exception, have one thing in common: they have a fabulous history," Tavares told <i>BFM Business</i>. "We love the history of car brands, it gives us a foundation on which we can project ourselves into the future. So today, I don't see any need, if this deal is concluded, to remove brands because they all have their history and they all have their strengths."</p>
      <p>Tavares also added that the brands complement each other well geographically. <i>Automotive News Europe</i> reported that 66 percent of FCA's revenue comes from North America in contrast to PSA's 5.7 percent. On the other hand, PSA gets most of its revenue from Europe.</p>
