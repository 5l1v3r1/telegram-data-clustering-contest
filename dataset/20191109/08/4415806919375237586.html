      <p>An Irish Sea first is happening this morning.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of men are wading into the wintery waves at a beach in Skerries in Co Dublin to raise funds for male cancer care at the Mater Public Hospital.</p>
      <p>The Dickie Dip is "an all-male, bare-all swim" with participants "braving the Irish Sea wearing only a dickie bow at a secret location in Skerries."</p>
      <p>According to the Mater Foundation: "To learn where the beach is, and to register for the event, just join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/492322301587261/">Facebook Group</a> and fill out this sign up form."</p>
      <p>Organiser Dermot Higgins says the Dickie Dip is a life-affirming event.</p>
      <p>"We've got 200 brave souls who are braving the cold water of the Irish Sea," said Mr Higgins.</p>
      <p>"It's not a nice day but we are going to dip into the Irish Sea today to raise funds for prostate cancer care."</p>
