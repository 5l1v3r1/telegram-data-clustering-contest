      <p>During his earlier days as a professional footballer, Mulenga owned a black BMW 318i, and often took to Instagram to post pics of himself posing next to his ride.</p>
      <p>As for "Die Hond", the attacker owned a pimped out BMW 325i, which is a newer version of the iconic "<i>gusheshe</i>".</p>
