      <p>Perth - <b>Ashleigh Barty</b> played the "best match of her life" to crush <b>Caroline Garcia 6-0, 6-0</b> and haul <b>Australia</b> back into contention at the <b>Fed Cup final</b> on Saturday after France's <b>K</b><b>ristina Mladenovic</b> whipped <b>Ajla Tomljanovic</b>.</p>
      <p>The world No 1, fresh from winning the WTA Finals in China, came on court in Perth under pressure after the nervous Tomljanovic was thrashed 6-1, 6-1.</p>
      <p>But in searing 38 degrees Celsius heat she kept her cool to embarrass a stunned Garcia in a rare double bagel, with the Frenchwoman having no answers to the Barty armoury in front of 13 000 fans.</p>
      <p>It left the tie evenly poised at 1-1 ahead of Sunday's reverse singles and a doubles clash if needed, with Australia targeting an eighth title and first in 45 years, while France are seeking a third, their first since 2003.</p>
      <p>"This is remarkable, I couldn't have asked for a more perfect match. I think that's the best tennis match I've ever played in my life," said Barty.</p>
      <p>"I felt like I served really well, made a lot of returns. Most importantly I played the big points well. I really wanted to assert myself and I was able to do that really well today."</p>
      <p>The French Open champion, capping a breakthrough season, was imperious, firing down pinpoint first serves and effortlessly pushing Garcia around the court, forcing errors.</p>
      <p>She set the tone by breaking Garcia's first service game and there was no way back for a player who was once ranked fourth in the world but has slipped to 45.</p>
      <p>Barty wrapped up the first set in 29 minutes and there was no let up as she sent down 11 forehand and four backhand winners.</p>
      <p>"I was a little bit stressed today, but not too stressed, and I don't think that was why I didn't play well," said Garcia.</p>
      <p>"Today she just played a very good match from the first point to the last one."</p>
      <p>The ease of Barty's 56-minute win was a huge relief for Australian captain Alicia Molik, whose gamble to play Tomljanovic in singles ahead of veteran Samantha Stosur spectacularly backfired.</p>
      <p>Tomljanovic is scheduled to play again on Sunday, against Garcia, but given her performance Molik may change her mind and revert to Stosur - Australia's most successful ever singles player, spanning 16 years of Fed Cup action.</p>
      <p>France captain Julien Benneteau faces a similar dilemma with Garcia. His other options are Alize Cornet, Fiona Ferro or Pauline Parmentier.</p>
      <p>Currently Barty and Stosur are down to play Mladenovic and Garcia in what could be a doubles decider.</p>
      <p>World number 40 Mladenovic gave her country a 1-0 lead by destroying Tomljanovic in 71 minutes.</p>
      <p>"I think she played good but I just came out there and basically wanted to win," said Mladenovic after clinching her 22nd career Fed Cup win.</p>
      <p>"I really did almost the perfect match, I was really in the zone. I love these sort of matches, the bigger the pressure, the more special the event."</p>
      <p>Tomljanovic failed to hit a single winner in the opening set. She was broken in the first game and Mladenovic quickly turned the screws, racing to a 3-0 lead before a double-fault on break-point in game four allowed Tomljanovic a rare glimmer of hope.</p>
      <p>But it didn't last long with Mladenovic's powerful forehand proving too hot to handle.</p>
      <p>She kept the momentum going in the second set as Tomljanovic wilted under the pressure, galloping to a 5-0 lead before the Australian finally won a game only for Mladenovic to comfortably serve out the match.</p>
      <p>"I gave my all and it didn't really go as planned," said a dejected Tomljanovic, admitting the occasion overwhelmed her.</p>
