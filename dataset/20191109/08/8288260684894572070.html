      <h1>'Unfair' - Tyrone Mings has this warning for Aston Villa fans ahead of Wolves clash</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Wolves latest | After their 2-1 Carabao Cup win in October, Mings is expecting a far more competitive Wolves side to line up opposite them at Molineux this weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:30:55+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/tom-leach/</a></address>
      <p>Tyrone Mings has warned <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> supporters not to expect their <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> clash with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Sunday to be quite as straight forward as last month's Carabao Cup meeting.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's side were 2-1 winners that day in October with goals from Anwar El Ghazi and Ahmed Elmohamady securing progression in the competition, either side of a Patrick Cutrone strike <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nuno-made-promise-ahead-wolves-17224456">for the visitors</a>.</p>
      <p>But Mings is expecting a far more competitive Wolves side to line up opposite them at Molineux this weekend for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/its-derby-game-us-aston-17227389">what promised to be a passionate West Midlands derby</a>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Facing them in the Carabao Cup was definitely an unfair judgement of them as a Premier League team," Mings told the <a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/AVTV/2019/11/07/Interview--Tyrone-Mings-on-Liverpool-and-Wolves">AVFC website</a>.</p>
      <p>"But the way we handled ourselves [in that cup game], I felt, was extremely professional.</p>
      <p>"Going into the game we have a plan for how are going to play and a plan for how we are going to try and nullify them.</p>

      <p>"We are fully aware of the threat that they pose too. They had a fantastic season last year and their quality hasn't changed.</p>
      <p>He continued: "For the fans, I think it is great. It means a little bit more for them because they get bragging rights around the city.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"There are colleagues working together or friends or families that are supporters of Wolves so it will always mean a little bit more - but we are solely focused on getting three points.</p>
      <p>"The atmosphere will be a good and the Villa fans will, of course, make themselves heard."</p>
