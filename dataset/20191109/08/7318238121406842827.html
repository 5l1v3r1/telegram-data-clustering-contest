      <h1>Indian court rules in favor of Hindu temple on disputed land</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:35:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters and Associated Press </a></address>
      <p>NEW DELHI — India's Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Hindu group on Saturday in a centuries-old dispute with minority Muslims over a place of worship in northern India that has been a lightning rod for tension between the two communities.</p>
      <p>The court said the disputed land be handed over to a Hindu trust to build a temple while Muslims will be provided a separate parcel of land. A lawyer for a Muslim group said the decision was disappointing and the group was likely to file a review petition.</p>
      <p>In 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed the 16th-century Babri Mosque at the site in the northern town of Ayodhya, triggering riots in which nearly 2,000 people were killed.</p>
      <p>Millions of Hindus believe the mosque in Ayodhya was built at the birthplace of Lord Ram, one of their most revered deities who is considered a physical incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu.</p>
      <p>They say the mosque was built after a temple dedicated to the Hindu god was destroyed by Muslim invaders.</p>
      <p>Muslims say Islamic prayers have been offered at the site since 1528, when the Babri Mosque was first built during the rule of the Islamic Mughals.</p>
      <p>Hindu supporters and activists celebrated the ruling on the court lawns, blowing bugles and chanting "Jai Shree Ram," hailing the god Ram.</p>
      <p>An attorney representing the Muslims deplored the ruling.</p>
      <p>"We are not satisfied with the verdict," said Zafaryab Jilani, who is representing the Muslim community's Babri Action committee.</p>
      <p>"These 5 acres of land don't mean anything to us," he said. "We are examining the verdict and whatever legal course is open for us."</p>
      <p>Vishnu Shankar Jain, an attorney who represented the Hindu community, said the journey over several years had been a struggle.</p>
      <p>"It was a huge legal battle and we are happy that we convinced the Supreme Court. It's a historic moment for Hindus," he said.</p>
      <p>Raj Nath Singh, India's defense minister, appealed to all to "accept the court verdict and maintain peace."</p>
      <p>In Islamabad, Pakistan's foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, criticized the verdict, saying it was indicative of the "hate based mindset" of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.</p>
      <p>Modi had promised to build the temple in 2014 elections that brought him to power.</p>
      <p>But he later decided to wait for the court verdict, despite pressure from millions of Hindu hard-liners who asked his government to bring legislation to build the temple.</p>
      <p>Modi's Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) secured a second term in power with a landslide election victory this year.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court's ruling is likely to have a significant impact on the fraught relations between India's majority Hindus and minority Muslims, who constitute 14 percent of its roughly 1.3 billion people.</p>
      <p>Authorities increased security in Ayodhya, 350 miles east of New Delhi, and deployed more than 5,000 paramilitary forces to prevent any attacks by Hindu activists on Muslims.</p>
      <p>The strict measures included a ban on the assembly of more than four people at one place.</p>
      <p>The BJP had mobilized tens of thousands of people in Ayodhya in 1992 when fiery speeches inflamed the crows and led to a Hindu mob tearing down the mosque.</p>
      <p>The destruction of the mosque sparked some of the deadliest riots in independent India's history and deepened communal divisions.</p>
