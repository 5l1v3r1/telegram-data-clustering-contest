      <h1>Cyprus Now Receiving Most Migrants Per Capita in Europe</h1>
      <h2>As migration routes in the Mediterranean sea change, the island of Cyprus is now being inundated with migrants and has the most arrivals per capita.</h2>

      <p>The migrants, who tend to arrive in Greek southern Cyprus from boats or air from the Turkish-controlled northern part of the island, have come at a rapid pace, according to <a href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/cypern-tar-emot-flest-flyktingar-per-capita">a report</a> from Swedish broadcaster SVT.</p>
      <p>Christoffer Wendick, a correspondent for the broadcaster, said that Cyprus has become attractive to many and is the easiest way to reach the European Union.</p>
      <p>“It allows you to take a flight from the Turkish mainland to the Turkish part of Cyprus and it is almost like a domestic flight,” he said.</p>
      <p>Another report from the <i>Cyprus Mail</i> released late last month, claimed that Cyprus could have as many as <a href="https://cyprus-mail.com/2019/10/29/cyprus-could-have-100000-asylum-seekers-in-just-five-years-says-minister/">100,000 migrants</a> in just five years with migrants making up as much as 3.5 per cent of the population overall.</p>
      <p>“You understand what this means for a country like Cyprus,” Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides said. He added: “We are currently experiencing the largest population displacements ever seen and according to the UN 250 million to 300 million people are migrating each year.”</p>

      <p>Petrides called on other European Union member states to take in migrants from Cyprus and said: “Not many of them are refugees. These are economic immigrants who abuse or exploit this particularity.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/246118/article/ekathimerini/news/131-syrian-migrants-reach-cyprus-by-boat">131 Syrian migrants</a> reached the coast of Cyprus, with 118 men, nine children, and four women being allowed to disembark the boat.</p>
      <p>In June, the Cypriot government and Interior Minister Petrides <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/06/24/cyprus-govt-certain-turkey-trafficking-migrants-into-eu-via-occupied-north-en-masse/">claimed</a> that the government of Turkey might be helping traffick migrants into the southern part of the island.</p>
      <p>Petrides slammed the Northern Cypriot authorities, saying that they were facilitators of trafficking rings and said the behaviour “cannot be tolerated on a European level”.</p>
