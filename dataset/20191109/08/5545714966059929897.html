      <p>[<b>Update:</b> So you might have noticed we didn't have a show this week. Well, long story short, food poisoning. Very, <i>very</i> bad food poisoning. So we're moving community questions to this week's show and giving you another chance to ask us what's on your mind.]</p>
      <p>What a busy week for video games. Big releases, big announcements, and big reviews capped off an interesting and certainly memorable October. Now there are just one or two more big releases left in 2019. Will they be good? Will they suck? We can't answer those questions but the Podtoid crew can answer any other questions you have for us on this week's show. So ask away in the comments below.</p>
