      <h2>The rivalry between KSI and Logan Paul will finally be settled as they fight for the second time - and this time it is in Los Angeles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, Martin Domin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul will finally settle their rivalry tonight when they clash in their eagerly-awaited rematch.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars fought to a controversial draw in Manchester last August before finally coming to terms for the sequel earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The rivals have turned professional for the second fight and will dispense with the head guards and pull on 10oz gloves at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - has made the trip from London for the fight but will start as the underdog against his American foe.</p>
      <p>Unlike their first fight, the undercard will not feature any other social media stars but will showcase two world champions in super-middleweight ruler Billy Joe Saunders and recently anointed lightweight king Devin Haney.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about the fights...</p>
