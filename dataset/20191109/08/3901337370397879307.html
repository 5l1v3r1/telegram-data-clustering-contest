      <h1>Derby Fever: Teko Opens Up On Khune Rivalry</h1>

      <p>Ahead of yet another mouthwatering Soweto derby, former Orlando Pirates midfield general, Teko Modise has opened up to SL Radio on his memorable rivalry with Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune.</p>
      <p>While Khune may not form part of this weekend’s action, the 32-year-old was involved in some feisty derbies over the years, particularly against the now-retired Modise, who has fond memories of the clash.</p>
      <p>“Mzansi’s finest, what I can say is the battle between him and I was real! We also had a conversation about it. He always used to say I’ll never score against him. Even when we walked in the tunnel. He reminded me “don’t forget, you will not score, even if we lose” I loved that,” the general revealed.</p>

      <p>When asked about the Instagram video Khune posted on his Instagram where he seemingly got the better of Modise, the 37-year-old set the record straight.</p>
      <p>“If you watch the video, you’ll see he made one save and the rest were hitting the upright. I remember that game, we were playing in Rustenburg, it was scorching hot and I knew for me to get into the box against the Kaizer Chiefs defense will be very difficult, so I had to shoot from outside the box. I had the belief and the power that I could do it.”</p>

      <p>The general further revealed that he had in fact, never scored against the Ventersdorp-born star during his time at Pirates,rather it was at Mamelodi Sundowns where he scored a memorable goal against his former Bafana teammate.</p>
      <p>“It’s unfortunate that I never scored against Itu in open play when I was at Orlando Pirates. When I was at Sundowns I scored against him from the centre line, which cancelled everything out,” a laughing Modise said.</p>
