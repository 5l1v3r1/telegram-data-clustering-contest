      <h1>Ghostbusters 2020: Bill Murray confirmed to return as Dr Peter Venkman</h1>
      <h2>Co-star Dan Aykroyd finally broke the news about which original cast members are reprising their roles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:57:03+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ellie Harrison</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bill-murray">Bill Murray</a> has officially been confirmed to reprise his iconic role for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ghostbusters"><i>Ghostbusters 2020</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The actor will return as Dr Peter Venkman in the forthcoming sequel, as revealed by his co-star Dan Aykroyd.</p>
      <p>While it always seemed likely Murray would return for the new film, this is the first time the news has been officially confirmed. In addition to Murray and Aykroyd, original Ghostbusters stars Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver and Annie Potts have also been confirmed to feature. </p>
      <p>Aykroyd confirmed the news on <i><a href="https://twitter.com/TheGregHillShow">The Greg Hill Show</a></i>, adding: “Jason Reitman wrote a beautiful, heartfelt script that takes the real DNA from the first two movies and transfers that directly to the third, the next generation. It hands the legacy off to a new generation of stars, and players, and actors, and characters.” </p>
      <p>It is not yet clear exactly how much screen time Murray and the original cast will have, as <i>Ghostbusters </i><i>2020</i> focusses on a new, younger team of heroes. </p>
      <p>New cast members include Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard and McKenna Grace.</p>
      <p><i>Ghostbusters 2020</i> will be released in UK cinemas on 10 July 2020.</p>
