      <h1>Indonesian palm oil exec arrested over journalist killings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T08:44:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>An <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/">Indonesian</a> palm oil executive has been arrested for allegedly ordering the killing two activist journalists who were mediating a land dispute between his company and local residents, police said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Maraden Sianipar’s body was found last week in a ditch near a palm plantation in Labuhan Batu in North Sumatra province.</p>
      <p>Police found the remains of his colleague, Maratua Siregar, in the same area a day later. Both had been stabbed multiple times.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, North Sumatra authorities said they had arrested businessman Wibharry Padmoasmolo for allegedly masterminding the plot by paying nearing $3,000 to four men to commit the killings.</p>
      <p>Padmoasmolo owns a firm that produces palm oil — a widely used vegetable oil found in everything from soap to chocolate — which was in a dispute with locals that the two victims were advocating for, police said.</p>
      <p>The killings were aimed at stopping the pair’s involvement, according to authorities, who added that Padmoasmolo has denied owning the firm under questioning.</p>
      <p>In all, five people have been arrested in connection with the murder plot and police said they’re still searching for several more suspects still at large.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for the three, while the five other suspects have been detained for further questioning,” said North Sumatra police chief Agus Andrianto.</p>
      <p>Victims Sianipar and Maratua worked together for a local online news portal before going freelance in 2017.</p>
      <p>A friend of Siregar said they had recently become known for their activism in land disputes — a common source of conflict across the resource-rich Southeast Asian archipelago.</p>
      <p>The friend said Siregar was active in an organization that advocated for residents in the dispute.</p>
      <p>Many cases of violence against journalists in Indonesia go unsolved, according to the Independent Journalists Alliance, which has reported at least two dozen cases this year alone.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is ranked 124th out of 180 countries on the 2019 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.</p>
