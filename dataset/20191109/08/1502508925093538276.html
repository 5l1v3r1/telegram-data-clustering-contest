      <p>Spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravishankar, who was part of a three-member mediation panel in the Ram Janmbhoomi-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babri-masjid">Babri Masjid </a>title suit, on Saturday described the Supreme Court verdict on the matter as "historic" and said it has brought "joy and relief" to people of both the communities from a long-standing dispute.</p>
      <p>In an unanimous verdict, the Supreme Court on Saturday paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>In one of the most important and most anticipated judgements in India's history, a 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to the more than a century old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.</p>
      <p>Ravishankar told reporters that he "wholeheartedly" welcomes the judgement of the Supreme Court and the case which had been going on for long has finally reached a conclusion. He urged people to maintain peace and harmony in the society.</p>
      <p>"I wholeheartedly welcome the historic judgment of the Hon. Supreme Court. This has brought joy and relief to people of both communities from a long-standing dispute," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>The apex court first appointed a three-member mediation panel, comprising Justice FMI Kallifulla, spiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living Foundation Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior advocate and renowned mediator Sriram Panchu.</p>
      <p>But when the SC was told that the four-month-long mediation proceedings did not result in any final settlement, it decided to take up the matter in marathon hearings.</p>
      <p>Yoga guru Ramdev also hailed the apex court's judgement and said the "we should set an example of unity in front of the world".</p>
      <p>"Hindu brothers should set an example by helping Muslim brothers in construction of mosque," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>He further said no celebrations should be held which would hurt the sentiments of anyone.</p>
      <p>BJP leader Subramanian Swamy said that Ashok Singhal, former international working president of Vishva Hindu Parishad and in-charge of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>Ram Janmabhoomi movement, should be conferred with Bharat Ratna.</p>
      <p>"At this hour of victory let us remember Shri Ashok Singhal. Namo Govt must immediately announce Bharat Ratna for him," he said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>"Only when Lord Rama wanted, the green light for re-building the temple is being given. JaI Shri Ram," he said in another tweet.</p>
