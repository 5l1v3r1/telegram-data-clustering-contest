        <i>The shade has been given an overdue update</i>
      </p>
      <p>For decades, the marketing definition of “nude” was, like most things from American tan tights to Sloaney patent heels, based on some mythical caucasian ideal – an evenly dipped honeyed blonde. A nude lipstick, for example, was invariably a brown-based pale pink that looked far from natural on most women on either side of the archetype (much as it still may look fabulous, of course). In reality, a nude in a beauty context is any shade that naturally appears in skin, from palest cream to deepest espresso, and the industry has been forced to rethink. Essentially, what we’re looking for in a basic, always flattering, wear-anywhere-and-with-anything nude lipstick is something the same, but one or two shades darker, than our real lip tone.</p>
      <p>For me, that’s <b><a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maccosmetics.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F13854%2F52596%2Fproducts%2Fmakeup%2Flips%2Flipstick%2Flustre-lipstick%23%21%2Fshade%2FHug_Me&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/09/the-perfect-nude-lipsticks">M</a></b><b><a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.maccosmetics.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F13854%2F52596%2Fproducts%2Fmakeup%2Flips%2Flipstick%2Flustre-lipstick%23%21%2Fshade%2FHug_Me&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/09/the-perfect-nude-lipsticks">ac Lustre Lipstick in Hug Me</a></b> (£17.50), a neutral inner-flesh tone with a sheer finish that can be worn alone, or slicked over a bolder shade to bring it down to earth. Your mileage will obviously vary, so it’s worth whiling away a few minutes on one of the clever nude lip finders available on-counter and online.</p>
      <p>Clinique’s ingenious Shade Match Science tool uses models of all colours and offers three appropriate nude shades, from the barely noticeable to the dramatic, in <b><a href="http://go.theguardian.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clinique.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F1605%2F68809%2Fmakeup%2Flipsticks%2Feven-bettertm-pop-lip-colour-foundation%0D&amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/09/the-perfect-nude-lipsticks">Even Better Pop Lip Foundation</a></b> (£17.50. A satin, like this, will look most natural; try a matte if you prefer a more “done” look). Counter staff are also trained to match your Clinique foundation shade with a spectrum of nudes.</p>
      <p>My makeup artist friend Sam Chapman recently raved to me about <b><a href="https://www.avon.uk.com/perfect-nude-lipstick">Avon’s bargainous nude lipsticks</a></b> ( only £4), and she wasn’t wrong. The website features real women of all tones, and offers up two appropriate nudes – one pinky, one brown – in a creamy, comfy, lasting matte formula that behaves like something much dearer. There’s a popular school of thought that believes the most natural and flattering lipstick is one that matches your bare nipples. It sounds nifty and funny in a headline, but in practice is mostly nonsense. Many very pale-faced women have dark brown areolae, just as many dark-skinned women have rosy ones. What works under the bra isn’t automatically what flatters the mouth – and that’s before we even consider how the skintone on one’s face can differ from that of one’s torso. I’ve never topless sunbathed in my life, and my chest shares a Dulux paint chart with blue.</p>
