        <b>Santosh Rangnekar, who happens to be BCCI’s first ever Chief Financial Officer, decided to put in his papers on Thursday although he himself refused to comment on the news. Rangnekar is the first of the Board’s professionally-hired old guard to have quit after the BCCI elections last month.</b>

      <p>Only a fortnight after <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sourav_ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>'s new <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/bcci">BCCI</a> administration took charge, BCCI’s second-most senior official on the management team has communicated his decision to step down to the board CEO Rahul Johri. Rangnekar was hired in 2016 as the Supreme Court-appointed Lodha committee reforms mandated the recruitment of a CFO.</p>
      <p>According to Cricbuzz, whether Rangnekar will be quitting the position with immediate effect or serve his notice period is unclear. Clarification on whether Rangnekar will walk away with a severance package if the resignation comes into immediate effect is also to be seen. Either way, the BCCI will now have to put up an ad to land a new CFO for the national body.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year — July, to be specific — Rangnekar was handed a fancy assessment by the CoA which - among other things like his allegations against then treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry, the trips to the United States, his bringing up of the Champions League T20 payment history and more - had become a talking point.</p>
