      <h1>CrossFit competitor Darcia Ondrovcik says the sport helped her overcome the trauma of domestic violence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:10:12+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/michael-rennie/11138612" target="_blank">Michael Rennie</a></address>
      <p>Darcia Ondrovcik survived a childhood of horrific family violence to become the first Indigenous Australian to compete at the CrossFit Games.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Darcia Ondrovcik says her parent's relationship was marred by domestic violence</li>
        <li>She always had a love for athletics and found CrossFit helped her to stay on the right path</li>
        <li>Ondrovcik will be mentoring athletes at this weekend's CrossFit games in Brisbane</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The coach and mentor said the sport saved her from a life of drugs and alcohol and also helped her break the cycle of domestic violence in her family by giving her a positive focus.</p>
      <p>As a child, Ondrovcik would use her natural athletic ability as an escape from the trauma she was experiencing at home.</p>
      <p>"Athletics was the one thing that I did really well at and Cathy Freeman was my idol," she said.</p>
      <p>"The 400-metre race was my race."</p>
      <p>But witnessing the abuse had a profound impact on her that she still deals with today.</p>
      <p>"A lot of isolation, lack of confidence, not knowing how to love. Not trusting males, not trusting people in general," she said.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of insecurity around men in general, and I've had to overcome all that stuff and work through to be able to live the life that I am today."</p>

      <p>In her late teens, Ondrovcik left home in a bid to start a better life for herself, by moving from her hometown of Dubbo to Port Macquarie in New South Wales.</p>
      <p>"I started working in bars, hanging out with a lot of older people that were maybe 10 years older," she said.</p>
      <blockquote>"I started taking drugs, drinking a lot, and it was a coping mechanism to deal with all the emotional trauma.</blockquote>
      <p>"Rock bottom for me would have been, I was living Port Macquarie, I [had] just come out of a relationship. I didn't have anywhere to live.</p>
      <p>"I stayed in my car down on the beach in Port Macquarie, and I'm just sitting there going, 'what has my life come to?'.</p>
      <p>"I was 18 by this stage, I just turned 18, I'm sleeping in my car.</p>
      <p>"My decision was I can either live in my car and stay in Port Macquarie, or go back to Dubbo, my hometown, and just give off on it all."</p>
      <h3>Training to push yourself through adversity</h3>
      <p>She ultimately decided to stay in Port Macquarie and credits CrossFit with helping her cope with her trauma.</p>
      <p>"I found CrossFit when I was about 20 [and] I got hooked straight away because athletics was one thing that I wanted to do," she said.</p>
      <p>"I also love lifting weights, and CrossFit combined those two together.</p>
      <p>"I found out that there was CrossFit competitions, so I did the CrossFit Open in 2011."</p>

      <p>From there Ms Ondrovcik rapidly progressed in the sport of CrossFit and competed in the team events at the 2016 CrossFit Games.</p>
      <p>"It just made a huge impact in my life because I used the sport to deal with my emotional trauma," she said.</p>
      <p>"It helped me live a happier, healthier, positive life that put me in a positive environment."</p>
      <p>Ms Ondrovcik met her husband through CrossFit and now has a two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>She is also the manager of CrossFit Torian, one of the biggest CrossFit gyms in Australia, and works as a mentor with men and women wanting to overcome emotional trauma.</p>

      <p>This weekend Ms Ondrovcik will be mentoring and working with athletes competing in a major CrossFit competition at Pat Rafter Arena, where <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-08/tia-clair-toomey-wins-world-crossfit-games/8784360">Australia's Tia-Clair Toomey</a> and another of the sport's greats, Rich Froning, will be working out alongside around 500 other competitors.</p>
      <p>About 10,000 spectators are tipped to attend the event and Ondrovcik said the sport was attracting big crowds because of the unique community it has been able to cultivate.</p>
      <blockquote>"You've experienced something hard together. It's like any adversity in life, you experience a bit of adversity in life, you have a different perspective," she said.</blockquote>
      <p>"All our members are experiencing a bit of adversity through their workout, because what's up here is the biggest challenge.</p>
      <p>"They grow through their mindset, and then being able to experience that together.</p>
      <p>"You put everyone together in a colosseum or in a massive grandstand to watch a CrossFit competition, you're there for the same reasons, because you love it and you know every athlete out on the floor had to start somewhere."</p>

      <p>Ondrovcik's father Dennis died in a car accident in Dubbo four years ago and despite all the heartache he put her family through, she has been able to forgive him.</p>
      <p>"My dad passed away in 2015 and I was 25 years old then â€” that would have to be the first time in my life that I lived without fear," she said.</p>
      <p>"Even though I moved out of home [and] my father wasn't in my life, there was still stuff going on, and I still feared for my life. I feared for the safety of my sisters.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't until he passed away that that fear just left me and I started to speak openly about what I experienced as a child."</p>
