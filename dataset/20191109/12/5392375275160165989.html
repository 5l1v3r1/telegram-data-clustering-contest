      <p>The recently released entry-level smartphones, Redmi 8 and Redmi 8A came with Android 9 Pie-based MIUI 10 straight out the box. With the imminent arrival of MIUI 11, the Chinese company promised to start the rollout in India on November 13. Today, all of sudden, Xiaomi is<a href="https://in.c.mi.com/thread-2031987-1-0.html"> deploying</a> the referred update in the country. But apart from the MIUI specific changes, it still is based on Android Pie.</p>
      <p>The new skin update weighs in 544MB for the Redmi 8A and 600MB for the Redmi 8. Both updates come bearing version number 11.0.1.0.PCPINXM. Both smartphones are exactly similar when it comes to the chipset and battery. However, there are some changes such as the absence of a fingerprint scanner on the 8A variant. Despite this, we believe that Xiaomi uses the same firmware base for both handsets.</p>

      <p>If you’ve been expecting to see this MIUI 11 update bringing Android 10 to the entry-level smartphones, we have some bad news. The update is still based on Android 9 Pie, but that’s not a big surprise, after all, Xiaomi tends to implement new MIUI features without the need of updating the Android base. The update brings the System-Wide Dark Mode, New Quick Replies, new natural sounds, alarms and more. Last but not least, it includes the October 2019 security patch.</p>
      <p>It’s a staged rollout, so it may take a few days to reach all eligible units.</p>
