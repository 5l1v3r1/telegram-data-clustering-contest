      <h2>Annie Hall, a former High Sheriff of Derbyshire who was appointed to the ceremonial position by the Queen, was swept away in floodwater in Rowsley and found two miles away</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:49:42+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:49</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A businesswoman who died after being swept away in raging <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/floods">floodwater</a> was a former High Sheriff of Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Mum Annie Hall was appointed to the position, which dates back more than 1,000 years, by the Queen in 2017 and was very active in the county for decades.</p>
      <p>She was swept away in the rain-swollen and debris-filled River Derwent in Rowsley, near Matlock, in the early hours of Friday and her body was reportedly found about two miles downstream in Darley Dale.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall's devastated family, including her husband Michael and children, said in a statement: “It is with great sadness that we, the family of Annie Hall, report her sudden passing.</p>
      <p>“We are in great shock and grieving. Please allow us to mourn privately for the time being.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“If you would like to contact us, please send any messages to <a href="mailto:condolencesforhallfamily@hotmail.com">condolencesforhallfamily@hotmail.com</a>. We will publish details of the funeral arrangements when they are known.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall, who lived in Ashford in the Water in the Peak District, had run a number of businesses and was involved in a number of local charities.</p>
      <p>Derbyshire Police Chief Constable Peter Goodman said: “I am shocked and deeply saddened by the untimely and tragic death of my friend, and former High Sheriff, Annie Hall.</p>
      <p>“Annie was a great leader in Derbyshire in both industry and on the civic front. She will be hugely missed.</p>

      <p>“My deepest sympathies go to Michael and all the family at this time.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the force added: "Emergency services were called to the River Derwent in Darley Dale, near Matlock, in the early hours of Friday, 8 November to reports that a woman had been swept away by the water.</p>
      <p>"Tragically a body was found further downstream a short time later.</p>
      <p>"Mrs Hall served as the county’s High Sheriff in 2017, and struck up a close bond with our Chief Constable Peter Goodman during her tenure."</p>

      <p>Originally from Wincanton, Somerset, Mrs Hall was sworn into the non-political role in April 2017, serving for a year until a new sheriff took over from her.</p>
      <p>At the time, she pledged to promote Derbyshire to the rest of the UK and the interests of the county’s "incredible" women and people who were doing great work.</p>
      <p>When she was younger she began training to be a psychiatric nurse, but she and her husband at the time moved around, ending up in Derbyshire, and set up a business making industrial winches, according to a May 2017 profile by <a href="https://www.derbyshirelife.co.uk/people/derbyshire-s-high-sheriff-annie-hall-1-5017407">Derbyshire Life.</a></p>
      <p>Mrs Hall told the publication they arrived "with no money, no business qualifications and frankly, no plan".</p>

      <p>She added: "But I had married someone who was an entrepreneur and I always say my role was the sweeper.</p>
      <p>"He would have the idea and I would look at it to see if it would work – it couldn’t be a leap into the unknown."</p>
      <p>The business, Northern Industrial and Marine Services, later became NIM Group.</p>
      <p>The business ran for 20 years until it was sold it to a competitor in 1994 and a new company called Pickup Holdings was established.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall was chairman of Pickup Holdings, which ran a plastic coating business and a marina, and manufactured luxury narrowboats.</p>
      <p>Her son and daughter, David and Joanna, eventually took over the company.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman was the first female president of the Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce, a founding member of the Training Enterprise Council, a non-executive director and vice-chairman of Derbyshire Mental Health Trust, and a Foundation Derbyshire trustee.</p>
      <p>The Hall Family Fund helps community groups working in rural areas or groups addressing rural issues.</p>
      <p>Members of the emergency services, mountain rescuers and a Coastguard helicopter were involved in the search and rescue mission.</p>
      <p>As the county paid tribute to Mrs Hall, Derby Cathedral tweeted: "Shocked and saddened by this tragic news. Annie Hall was Chair of Derby Cathedral Council and a good friend to the whole Cathedral community. Our prayers are with her and her family as they grieve."</p>
      <p>Mrs Hall was swept away as more than a month's worth of rain fell in Yorkshire and the Midlands and rivers surged to record levels, inundating homes and leaving cars submerged.</p>
      <p>The heaviest rainfall was at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm in 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Parts of Sheffield recorded 85mm.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of homes were evacuated and more than 100 residents were rescued by firefighters in South Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Severe flood warnings remained in place in Doncaster on Saturday, along with dozens of warnings and alerts across Yorkshire and the Midlands.</p>
