      <h1>Gerard Butler snapped at light show at Glasgow's Botanic Gardens</h1>
      <h2>The Hollywood megastar struck a pose while exploring the GlasgGlow event last night.</h2>

      <p>Scottish actor <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gerard-butler">Gerard Butler</a> was spotted out in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow's west end</a> last night.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood megastar struck a pose while exploring the  <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/glasgglow-spectacular-light-show-return-16700659">GlasGLOW</a>  event at the  <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/all-about/glasgow-botanic-gardens">Botanic Garden</a>s.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old, who is originally from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paisley">Paisley</a>, was one of the thousands of visitors to experience the light show spectacle before it ends on Sunday (November 10), reports <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/gerard-butler-spotted-enjoying-glasglow-17228763">Glasgow Live</a>.</p>
      <p>And he dropped a massive hint that he might return to the city at Christmas.</p>
      <p>Gerard was snapped grinning in front of a giant poster for  <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/whats-on/elfingrove--tickets-seven-new-17048132">Elfingrove</a>, the winter wonderland festival that's due to  <a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/all-about/kelvingrove-art-gallery-and-museum">Kelvingrove</a> Art Gallery and Museum next month.</p>

      <p>The 300 star is no stranger to the city - he was spotted in Glasgow earlier in the week having a coffee at a Bearsden cafe. Could it be that he's ditched the Hollywood hills for Dear Green Place?</p>
      <p>The Grace and Favour team uploaded a snap of the PS I Love You heartthrob to their Facebook on Thursday afternoon, and of course they entitled it "dish of the day".</p>
      <p>We hope you stick around in Glasgow, Gerard! And if you'd like to drop by Glasgow Live HQ, we really could do with a Butler of our own.</p>
