      <p><a href="https://coingaming.io/">Coingaming</a>, a software provider for white-label Bitcoin casino solutions, is glad to announce a Last Man Standing contest that the company has recently run on its crypto sports bookmaker Sportsbet.io. The event is being held to celebrate the addition of TRX crypto on all Coingaming’s brands. While predicting sports outcomes, all participants have a chance to win 1 Million TRX, that the company aims to grant one lucky punter with most correct forecasts.</p>
      <p>Based in Tallin, Estonia, Coingaming Group represents itself an innovative and rapidly growing company that specializes in the development and maintenance of the websites related to e-sport and gaming industries. With such huge names in the crypto gambling space as <a href="https://bitcasino.io/">Bitcasino.io</a> and <a href="https://sportsbet.io/">Sportsbet.io</a>, that have already joined Coingaming brands, the company is now proud to welcome the TRON community.</p>
      <p>Both deposit and withdrawal options are already available, so that TRON users could enjoy the industry-leading user experience of fun, fast and fair gaming with the digital currencies of the future. All of the aspects of TRON as a modern cryptocurrency are intact, and even transferred to Coingaming products: every transaction costs nothing (zero fees), and happens almost instantly, matching the fast micro betting options at any of Coingaming brands.</p>
      <p>Lower deposit threholds can enjoy really low rates – the minimum deposit is only 100 TRX that is equal to EUR 1.80. Users now have an opportunity to enjoy provably fair crypto gaming with such a low entry barrier to play at Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io. As TRON’s popularity is already high enough among gaming Dapps, the usage of the crypto on such huge names as Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io may very likely result in TRX’s soon becoming the gamer’s choice of crypto.</p>
      <p>According to Tim Heath, CEO of the Coingaming Group, the introduction of low minimum deposits coupled with zero transaction fees was simply their way of helping more people enjoy the benefits of crypto and blockchain-based gaming. This, he said, was also reflective of the Coingaming philosophy which always placed customers at the heart of everything they do.</p>
      <p>On the new TRON partnership, he said:</p>
      <blockquote> “The TRON community is one of the most engaged, forward-thinking and dynamic in the cryptocurrency world. It is also passionate about gaming, so this is a great opportunity to introduce TRX holders to the fun, fast and fair world of the Coingaming Group brands. We are certain they will enjoy the ride.”</blockquote>
      <p>TRON founder Justin Sun pointed out that Bitcasino.io, as a licensed and recognized world-class player in the space, had already attracted big game providers such as OneTouch, Evolution Gaming, GameArt, and Kalamba. And now, thanks to the partnership, Bitcasino users can now deposit TRX directly and wager on titles from these providers, without needing to convert to other currencies. Justin reflected:</p>
      <blockquote>“One of the TRON Foundation’s core missions is to support growth by providing engaging, real-world use cases for TRX. We’ve been aware of the market-leading gaming brands operated by the Coingaming Group for some time now; Bitcasino.io and Sportsbet.io are fantastic examples of what is possible when crypto-led products put the customer above everything else.”</blockquote>
