      <h1>Barcelona’s out of favour star seeks Serie A job as soon as possible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:07:05+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Juventus, AC Milan, and Inter Milan are all lining up for a bidding war for Barcelona’s midfielder Ivan Rakitic.</h3>
      <p>Ivan Rakitic has been out of favour in the Camp Nou having made only 10 appearances across all competitions for Barcelona this season which includes a single starter and nine substitution roles.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old’s current contract with the club expires in 2021, and with just 18 months remaining, the Croatian international is seeking opportunities away from the Spanish champions.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191108/471445700585/la-juve-vuelve-a-la-carga-con-rakitic-con-el-inter-al-acecho.html"><b>sources</b></a>, Juventus and Inter Milan have previously attempted to sign the midfielders back in August, but Barcelona and the clubs failed to reach an agreement. Juventus still perceive Rakitic to be the missing element in the midfield in order to win the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Inter Milan’s coach, Antonio Conte, has also issued a warning to Internazionale chiefs to act quickly as interests for the player are building up.</p>
      <blockquote>‘We should plan this year much better. I’m tired of always saying the same. I hope a leader comes here and says something too”      – <a href="https://onefootball.com/en/news/inter-coach-conte-attacks-the-club-we-should-have-planned-better-in-the-summer-en-27905355?variable=20191109"><b>Conte</b></a></blockquote>
      <p>Chief Football Officer of AC Milan, Zvonimir Boban, is looking to use his good relationship with fellow Croatian Rakitic to lure him to San Siro. <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191107/471439859924/rakitic-boban-fichaje-milan-inter-interes-traspaso-enero-mercado.html"><b>Mundo Deportivo</b></a></p>
      <p>Rakitic joined the Blaugrana in 2014 and quickly became the undisputed starter for Barca, but has struggled so far this season to have the same impact as he once had. In the past five years, the midfielder has won three La Liga titles, four Copa del Rey trophies and one Champions League.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants are willing to let Rakitic go in the upcoming January transfer market but are in no hurry to make a decision and will look to cash in the player before his contract expires.</p>
      <p>Which team will lure Ivan Rakitic away from the Camp Nou?</p>
