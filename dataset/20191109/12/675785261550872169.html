      <h1>Fish with 'human face' spotted in lake - and it's really creeping people out</h1>
      <h2>People on social media have been thoroughly creeped out by a video doing the rounds of a fish, with a very human-like face</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:58:36+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>Recently an adorable <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/adorable-dog-looks-human-people-20422452">dog went viral</a> for having a face that looked more human than canine.</p>
      <p>The cute pooch, named Nori, baffled people online who thought his face had been digitally altered.</p>
      <p>But now there's another strange <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/animals">animal</a> shocking people on the internet, only this one lives in water instead of on land.</p>
      <p>A rather unusual fish has been spotted in a lake in China, which appears to have some very odd markings on its face, causing it to look quite human.</p>

      <p>A visitor to a village outside the city of Kunming in south China captured a video of the creepy carp.</p>
      <p>The video was shared on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform and in the clip the fish can be seen swimming to the edge of the lake and poking its head above the surface of the water.</p>
      <p>On the fish's head are dark dots which look like two eyes, two vertical lines which resemble the sides of a nose and one horizontal one underneath where a mouth would be.</p>
      <p>During the clip a woman can be heard saying: "The fish has turned into a fairy."</p>

      <p>People were understandably freaked out by the sight.</p>
      <p>One person commented: "This is scary."</p>
      <p>Another replied: "Who dares to eat it?"</p>
      <p>The video was later shared on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> by a user called @Unexplained where it creeped out more people.</p>
      <p>"Holy s***," proclaimed one user.</p>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "I am so freaked out right now."</p>
      <p>Others compared the fish to Voldemort, an alien and the animated fish from the 2004 film Shark Tale.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time someone has seen a human-like carp.</p>
      <p>Back in 2010, a 44-year-old British man claimed that a carp he had bought five months before had begun to develop human-like facial features.</p>
      <p>Brendan O'Sullivan from Dagenham, Essex, said: "It was astonishing. I could easily make out from the markings two eyes, a nose and a mouth.</p>
      <p>"I thought I was suffering from sunstroke."</p>
      <p>The fish was believed to be worth an estimated £40,000.</p>
