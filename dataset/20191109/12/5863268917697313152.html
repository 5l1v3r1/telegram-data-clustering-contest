      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan has made Kartarpur Corridor to eradicate hatred and urged India to change its policy over Kashmir if it also wants peace.</p>
      <p>The foreign minister spoke to BBC and maintained that Kartarpur Corridor is spreading love and is a goodwill message by Islamabad. India never responded to Pakistan’s various attempts of restoring peace, he stressed.</p>
      <p>Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced immediately after assuming charge that Pakistan will move two steps forward if India takes one for establishing peace, but India responded with criticism, border violations and confrontation.</p>
      <p>People of occupied Kashmir as well as Pakistan have rejected India’s unconstitutional, illegal and unilateral move of scrapping IoK’s autonomy and no Kashmiri leaders are supporting New Delhi’s narrative, Qureshi reiterated.  </p>
