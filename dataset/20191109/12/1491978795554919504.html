        <i>Move challenges BBC decision to include only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in 6 December programme</i>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberaldemocrats">Liberal Democrats</a> have said the party is considering court action over Jo Swinson’s exclusion from a BBC election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The corporation announced on Friday that it would host a traditional head-to-head debate between the prime minister and Labour leader on 6 December.</p>
      <p>Swinson had said earlier in the week that her party would take legal action if ITV did not include her in its own leaders’ debate, scheduled for 19 November.</p>
      <p>Layla Moran, the Lib Dems’ education spokeswoman and Oxford West and Abingdon candidate, said it was critical the TV debates had a remain voice.</p>
      <p>She told Sky News: “We are the biggest, strongest remain party fielding candidates in all parts of the UK and actually we are the only party that can challenge Labour and the Conservatives on this.</p>
      <p>“We are in discussions with lawyers about what we are going to do with the ITV debate and we are also looking at court action for the BBC one too.”</p>
      <p>Moran said it was “entirely possible” that Swinson could be prime minister.</p>

      <p>“I think in this election – and no one is saying this isn’t a huge mountain to climb, no one is pretending that it is not – but what we did see is that in the European [elections] – different electoral system, I get it – but we polled higher than the Conservatives and the Labour party for the first time in 100 years.</p>
      <p>“There is something weird happening in British politics right now. It’s showing itself in the last few months . Anything is possible.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the BBC said: “Our aim is to cover political parties fairly and proportionately during the election campaign.</p>
      <p>“The BBC’s plans are for a head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, a four-way Question Time additionally involving Nicola Sturgeon and Jo Swinson, a seven-handed debate where wider views are also heard and a similar multi-party debate aimed specifically at younger audiences, plus separate debates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“We believe this is fair and proportionate.”</p>

Labour has said it would provide 30 hours of free childcare a week for every child from the age of two.</p>
      <p>Under current rules, three-year-olds are eligible for 15 hours of free childcare a week and lower-income parents receive extra help from when their child turns two.</p>
