      <p>CAPE CORAL, Fla. â€”A big thanks to everyone that made time to say hello to us Friday night at the Coconut Festival in Cape Coral. The Fox 4 team had a great time and even got to say hello from the stage as the performers got ready to entertain the crowd. Four in your corner is a proud sponsor of the festival, which continues all weekend, and our station has a booth set up just to the left when you come through the entrance. Please stop by and say hello, we would love to see you and we'll be there all weekend.</p>
