      <h2>Aston Villa injury latest | Villa captain, Jack Grealish, has missed the last two games - so here are the latest injury updates ahead of the Premier League meeting with Wolves</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa will be looking to bounce back from successive defeats against the Premier League's top two when they travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers this weekend.</p>
      <p>After losing 3-0 to Manchester City at the Etihad the weekend before, Andrew Robertson and Sadio Mane scored late goals to seal a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/this-coming-national-media-verdict-17192014">2-1 win for Liverpool at Villa Park</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Villa captain Jack Grealish injured his calf in that loss away to City and so missed the Liverpool defeat, as well as the Carabao Cup meeting with Wolves earlier in the week.</p>
      <p>Now attentions turn to the Molineux trip and Grealish's fitness will be a hot topic this week for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> fans, while there is the boost of seeing James Chester back on the field following his run out for the under-23s against Newcastle United on Monday night.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's Villa's injury list in full...</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Keinan Davis</h3>
      <p><b>Injury:</b> Hamstring</p>
      <p><b>Details:</b> Substituted after 50 minutes of his third start of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Last match:</b> Wednesday, October 30 - Villa 2-1 Wolves, 50 minutes.</p>
      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Manchester United (away), December 1.</p>
      <p><b>What Smith has said:</b> "He's had a scan and he's got a hamstring injury. It's likely he'll be out for three to four weeks. The only good thing with that is that we've got an international period which can eat a few days into his injury. It's a blow because he's been doing well. He's been pushing Wes."</p>

      <p><b>Expected return date:</b> Wolves (A), November 10.</p>
      <p><b>What Smith has said:</b> "It's 50/50 at the moment to be honest. I expected him to be training by now. He's still got a lot of pain.</p>
      <p>"He's certainly physically OK, he's been doing an awful lot of work in the swimming pool, we just need to make sure he can get through a training session tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"So we are hopeful, but it's a 50/50 one at the moment."</p>
