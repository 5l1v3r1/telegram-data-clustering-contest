        <b>Two people are being treated in Scotland for the potentially deadly diphtheria infection.</b>
      </p>
      <p>NHS Lothian has confirmed the two cases are related and both patients are thought to be in hospital in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>The health board said those involved had recently returned from overseas.</p>
      <p>Public health experts said the likelihood of any additional cases was very small, as most people were protected by immunisation given in childhood.</p>
      <p>In Lothian, 98% of children are vaccinated against diphtheria by the age of 24 months.</p>
      <p>Alison McCallum, director of public health for NHS Lothian, said: "All close contacts of these patients have been identified, contacted and followed up in line with nationally agreed guidelines.</p>
      <p>"We encourage people travelling abroad to visit <a href="https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home">Fit for Travel</a> where they can access information on how to stay safe and healthy abroad, as well as destination specific health advice."</p>

      <p>Diphtheria is a highly contagious and potentially fatal infection that can affect the nose and throat, and sometimes the skin.</p>
      <p>It can lead to difficulty breathing, heart failure and paralysis.</p>
      <p>The infection is spread by coughs and sneezes, or by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothes or bedding with an infected person.</p>
      <p>It is rare in the UK, because babies and children are routinely vaccinated against it.</p>
      <p>There is a small risk of catching the disease while travelling in some parts of the world.</p>
