      <p>Kaizer Chiefs need to make sure they don’t ‘get worried about the atmosphere’ at FNB Stadium today when they go up against their bitter rivals, Orlando Pirates.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Amakhosi are guaranteed to remain top of the Absa Premiership regardless of what happens today’s Soweto Derby, but they can extend their impressive lead even further if they pick up three points against their Soweto neighbours.</p>
      <p>Chiefs haven’t beaten Pirates in a league game since December 2014 when they picked up a 2-0 victory on the way to lifting the 2014/15 title, but they will be buoyed by their recent penalty shootout victory in the Telkom Knockout and their form puts them as favourites for the clash.</p>
      <p>Middendorp remains wary though, and speaking to the club’s official website, the German said, “You can sense the anticipation in the camp… It is a matter of the players managing the situation. If you try to do too much or get worried about the atmosphere in the stadium, you might fall short.</p>
      <p>“It is one game where two teams are seen as equal and chasing the same goals. We want to go on with our pattern. We don’t allow the hype to change our approach. We are not focusing on the opponents. We are looking much on what we can do. We are on a good run and we want to continue to win games.”</p>

      <p>Chiefs have a number of players set to return today following their absence for the 2-0 win over Chippa United midweek, though Kearyn Baccus wasn’t passed fit to play as he deals with a shoulder injury.</p>
