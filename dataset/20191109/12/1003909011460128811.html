      <h1>Brooks: Splash of Red Gala helps vulnerable youth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T12:00:52+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Brooks, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>For 80 years, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Calgary has helped young people dream of possibilities beyond their own four walls. Over and above its traditional club programming, the clubs address youth homelessness, addiction, unemployment, poverty, mental health issues, trauma and neglect. And its annual signature fundraising event, Splash of Red Gala — now in its 14th year — has raised more than $4.9 million since inception, ensuring vulnerable youth get the help they need. Last year, the clubs served more than 4,000 children and prevented more than 100 youth from experiencing homelessness.</p>
      <p>More than 300 guests gathered at the Metropolitan Centre on Oct. 26 to attend the 14th annual gala. The SRO event featured: fabulous live auction items as varied as a day with the grizzlies and a Palm Springs retreat to an alpine escape at Sun Peaks Resort and a three-night stay at the Mount Engadine Lodge; a WestJet raffle for two to any WestJet Vacation destination; myriad silent auction items; dancing with TR3; and a tear-inducing address from special guest youth speaker, 14-year-old Kayla, who shared her personal story of struggles in school and the resulting negative influences that led to alcohol and drug abuse. “If I could share some advice with other youth it would be that it all starts with you – you have to want the change and believe in yourself. Believe that you can do it and you will, because no one else will do that for you,” said the wise-beyond-her-years teen.</p>
      <p>Kudos to all involved on the Qualico Communities’ sponsored event and take a bow sentiments go out to invaluable volunteer committee members: Ruth Beddoe; Holly Goulard; Barb Shaunessy; Elaine Frame; Murlyne Fong; Sara Shaak; and Alyson Xotta. And two thumbs up to the Beddoe family on matching all donations made this night.</p>
      <p>Others in attendance included: Jeff Dyer, CEO, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Calgary and his wife, Hospice Calgary’s Kristy Gauld Dyer; BDP partner Doug Mills and his wife Mavis Clark; WestJet president and CEO Ed Sims with his wife Claire McKay and WestJet colleagues Mark Porter and Richard Bartrem; Andy and Nancy Wiswell; Brent and Kathy Foster; Tom and Kathy Pinder; Steve Beddoe and his wife Jane; Derek Cook; Ray Lippitt; Terry O’Callaghan; my terrific handlers Anita Hofer and Shannon McClennan-Taylor; and others pictured.</p>
