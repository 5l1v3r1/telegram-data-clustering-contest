      <p>Former Arsenal boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsene-wenger">Arsene Wenger</a> will not be the next manager of Bayern Munich after ruling himself out of contention.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga big boys are searching for a replacement for Niko Kovac after the 48-year-old paid the price for his side's inconsistent start to the season.</p>
      <p>Wenger has been out of work since leaving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> last summer after a storied 22-year stay in North London.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old has insisted he still has the urge to return to the dugout as he currently combines punditry duties with his charity work.</p>

      <p>But the next gig won't be with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> contenders <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/bayern-munich">Bayern</a> after delivering an emphatic statement.</p>
      <p>He told beIN Sports: "I wish good luck to Bayern, and for me the situation is settled."</p>
      <p>Wenger had previously revealed he was set for talks with the Bavarian giants over the vacancy.</p>
      <p>He said: "On Wednesday afternoon, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge called me. I could not answer at that moment and, by politeness, I called him back.</p>

      <p>"He was in his car going to the game against Olympiacos. We talked for four to five minutes maximum and he told me they had assigned Flick to be the coach and he will manage the next two games because they play Dortmund tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"He asked me if I would be interested because they are looking for a coach. I told him I didn't have any thoughts about it. It needs some time to have a think about it.</p>
      <p>"We decided together we will talk next week because I am in Doha until Sunday night. This is the true story."</p>
