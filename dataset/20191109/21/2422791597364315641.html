      <p>WINTER HAVEN, Fla. - Authorities in central Florida say two Disney workers and a former assistant principal at a middle school were among 17 arrested in a child porn sting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polksheriff.org/news-investigations/polk-county-news/2019/11/08/polk-county-sheriff-s-office-computer-crimes-unit-arrests-17-during-operation-guardians-of-innocence-iv-fall-haul">In a news release </a>, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Friday that the 17 men arrested range in age from 19 to 77.</p>
      <p>Authorities say 52-year-old Walt Disney World Resorts janitor Donald Durr of Davenport had images of child porn on an electronic tablet.</p>
      <p>Investigators say 40-year-old Brett Kinney of Lake Alfred told officers he had an addiction to child pornography and worked as a guest experience manager at Disney World.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Disney says Kinney is no longer employed by the company and Durr is on unpaid leave.</p>
      <p>It's unclear if either has an attorney who could comment on the charges.</p>
