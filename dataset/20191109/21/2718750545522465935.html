      <h1>Laura Dern Identifies As a Jane, Not a Renata</h1>

      <p>To watchers of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-season-2-review.html"><i>Big Little Lies</i></a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/big-little-lies-saddest-richest-whitest-lady.html">Laura Dern <i>is</i> Renata Klein</a>. So it surprised us to learn, at <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/laura-dern-vulture-festival-honorary-degree.html">Dern’s Vulture Festival conversation in New York</a> today, that she doesn’t identify as Renata of the Monterey Five. “I probably was Jane,” she said, referencing the young single mom played by Shailene Woodley — and you can imagine our shock! But she assured us, there’s hope yet: “If we ever did it again, and it gets in me even a little bit more, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/big-little-lies-finale-clip-meryl-streep-versus-laura-dern.html">I’m becoming Renata</a>. Because I so agree with her on so many fronts. I think we all need Renata in us somewhere.” And thanks to her, we have it, and it comes out when we repeat <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/big-little-lies-season-2-episode-2-recap-tell-tale-hearts.html">Klein’s iconic season-two line</a>. “They come up, and almost like this [<i>puts hand in front of face</i>], go, ‘I will not not be rich!’ in my face. And I’m like, ‘You needed that!’” she said of her fans. “I feel like it’s everybody’s, which is what’s great about Renata — she’s waking up the things we want to say, but don’t.” So HBO, you have to understand: We need a third season of <i>Big Little Lies</i>, so Laura Dern can truly become Renata Klein.</p>
