        <b>The cyclonic storm Bulbul has started crossing coastal Bangladesh in a weakened form after lashing the West Bengal coasts in India near the Sundarbans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The storm made landfall near Sagar Islands in West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district with its status downgraded to “severe” from “very severe” about 9pm on Saturday as the gale wind speed dropped to about 115-125km per hour.</p>
      <p>It took about three more hours for the entire storm system to move across the shorelines.</p>
      <p>It was centred over coastal West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh about 15km southwest of the Sundarbans National Park in the district of South 24 Parganas at 2am on Sunday, the Indian Meteorological Department said.</p>
      <p>The wind speed near the centre of the storm was 95-105kph gusting to 115kph at the time, the IMD said.</p>
      <p>The storm later moved north-eastwards into Bangladesh and was crossing Satkhira coasts about 3:15am, said Zulfiker Ali Ripon, the in-charge of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department in the district.</p>
      <p>Amanullah, a resident of Gabura neighbourhood in the district’s Shyamnagar Upazila, told bdnews24.com he had to remain at home because he “could not secure a place at any cyclone shelter”.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s raining with gusts,” he said.</p>
      <p>The cyclone is very likely to weaken gradually into a cyclonic storm over coastal Bangladesh and adjoining South and North 24 Parganas districts of West Bengal by Sunday morning, according to meteorologists.</p>

      <p>The cyclone wreaked havoc upon parts of coastal West Bengal, according to the local media.</p>
      <p>Khejuri, Nandgram, Nayachar and Ramnagar in East Midnapore and Kakdweep and Bakkhali in South 24 Parganas districts were worst-affected, the Times of India reported.</p>
      <p>Trees got uprooted, roofs gave way and houses and shops suffered damage while power supply was also disrupted in many areas, according to the report.</p>
      <p>It also caused at least two deaths in India. Trees were uprooted in various parts of Kolkata killing one person in a renowned club, state media the Press Trust of India said on Saturday, citing officials.</p>
      <p>Information about the death of one person due to a rain-related wall collapse incident has been received from Kendrapara district, the PTI reported citing an official who said the authorities were checking the matter.</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh Meteorological Department warned that storm surge of 5-7 feet high above normal astronomical tide is likely to inundate the low-lying areas of the coastal districts during the cyclone’s passage.</p>

      <p>The coastal districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Chattogram, Noakhali, Laxmipur, Feni, Chandpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Barishal, Bhola, Pirojpur, Jhalskathi, Bagerhat and their offshore islands and chars are likely to experience wind speed of up to 80-100kph in gusts or squalls with heavy to very heavy falls during the passage of the storm, the Met Office warned.</p>
      <p>Besides the maritime ports of Mongla and Payra, Great Danger Signal No. 10 has been hoisted in the coastal districts of Bhola, Barguna, Patuakhali, Barishal, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, Satkhira and their offshore islands and chars.</p>
      <p>Chattogram port and the nearby districts have been asked to hoist Great Danger Signal No. 9.</p>
      <p>Great Danger Signal No. 10 is the maximum warning level the BMD issues when it fears the worst havoc. Another warning level beyond the maximum is there for any situation when a disaster causes total disconnection of an affected area.</p>
      <p>In Sunday’s weather forecast, the BMD said light to moderate rain or thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty or squally wind is likely to occur at most places across the country while many parts may experience moderately heavy to very heavy falls.</p>
      <p>Night temperature may fall by 1-3° Celsius and day temperature may remain nearly unchanged over the country.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Disaster Management and Relief Secretary Md Shah Kamal told a media briefing after Saturday midnight that over 2.1 million people have been evacuated to nearly 5,600 storm shelters in the coastal districts.</p>
      <p>“Our efforts are going to see a successful ending,” he said.</p>
      <p>A total of 2,000 packets of dry food have already been supplied to each of the shelters, according to the state minister.</p>
      <p>Volunteers raised alert through microphone and 22 community radio stations.</p>
      <p>The government has also suspended the Junior School Certificate (JSC) and Junior Dakhil Certificate (JDC) exams scheduled for Nov 9 and Nov 11.</p>
      <p>The National University tests set for Saturday were also deferred and the new dates for it will be announced later.</p>

      <p>Panic spread among the residents of Bagerhat’s Sarankhola Upazila, which had been badly affected by the Cyclone Sidr in 2007, after the Met Office advised the maritime ports of Mongla and Payra to hoist Great Danger Signal No. 10.</p>
      <p>More than 800 people are feared to be affected by the damage of an embankment in the Bogi area at the Upazila’s South Khali Union.</p>
      <p>Most of them refused to move to cyclone shelters. But the administration was increasing pressure on local residents to evacuate people to the shelters.</p>
      <p>Fishermen in Bagerhat said they were enjoying hay days, thanks to an abundance of hilsa following a fishing ban during the breeding season. But they had to return home as the sea became rough due to the cyclone</p>
      <p>The Bangladesh Navy said it was prepared to undertake emergency rescue and relief operations with warships, if required, in the event of Cyclone Bulbul causing any havoc.</p>
      <p>Naval contingents and five medical teams were also ready to provide services, life-saving drugs and oral saline in the affected areas, the military’s press wing ISPR said in a statement.</p>

      <p>The authorities have suspended all sorts of activities at maritime ports and inland water transport services across the country until further notice.</p>
      <p>All fishing boats and trawlers over the North Bay have been advised to remain in shelter until further notice while ships have been asked to move from the jetties to the outer anchorage.</p>
      <p>Police have been deployed to ensure that those who were not heeding the calls for evacuation are taken to the safety shelters, said Patuakhali’s Kolapara Upazila Nirbahi Officer Munibur Rahman.</p>
      <p>Around 56,000 volunteers were ready to conduct rescue and relief efforts while the military bases at the coastal districts remain on alert.</p>
