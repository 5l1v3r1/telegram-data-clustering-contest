      <p><b>Teams:</b> Borussia Dortmund 0-4 Bayern Munich</p>

      <p>Bayern Munich returned to winning ways in the Bundesliga after thrashing Borussia Dortmund 4-0 thanks to a brace by for Dortmund star Robert Lewandowski on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Both sides were unchanged from their midweek UEFA Champions League victories, with Lewandowski and Thomas Muller leading the attack for Bayern, while Mario Gotze played a 'false nine' role alongside Thorgan Hazard, Julian Brandt and Jadon Sancho for Dortmund.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians eventually opened the scoring in the 17th minute after Lewandowski glanced a header past goalkeeper Roman Burki from Benjamin Pavard's cross on the right channel.</p>
      <p>Bayern continued to create chances but they were thwarted by Burki, who was keeping Lycien Favre's men in the game with great saves.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry thought he had doubled the lead for the Bavarians with seven minutes remaining of the first stanza after slotting home Lewandowski's deflected shot but the goal was disallowed for offside.</p>
      <p>Gnabry eventually doubled the lead for Bayern barely two minutes into the second stanza after tucking home a cross from Lewandowski, with the Video Assistant Referee coming to their rescue after the on-field referee had initially ruled the goal out.</p>
      <p>Bayern were cruising with 14 minutes remaining after Lewandowski grabbed his brace with a close range finish past Burki after Muller delivered a teasing cross in the danger area.</p>
      <p>With ten minutes remaining, the defending league champions were four goals ahead after former Bayern defender Mats Hummels turned Ivan Perisic's cross into his own net.</p>
      <p>The victory sees Bayern move up to third spot in the standings, while Dortmund drop fourth position.</p>
