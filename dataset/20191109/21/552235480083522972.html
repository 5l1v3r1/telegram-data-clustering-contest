      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/scots-couple-stunned-after-lewis-20755689">Lewis Capaldi</a> joked he was Troy Bolton from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-kids-going-crazy-over-15863464">High School Musical</a> as he posed in a snappy red and white varsity jacket given to him by the NRJ Awards.</p>
      <p>The Scots singer took to Instagram to reveal he is in Cannes for the posh ceremony on Saturday night. After arriving at his hotel he was given a number of gifts by the French radio station.</p>
      <p>His fave present was a bright red and white jacket – which Capaldi said made him look like high school basketball player Troy – played by Zac Efron.</p>
      <p>Capaldi said: “See that? Is that the captain of the basketball team?”</p>
      <p>“Is that the jock going out with the head cheerleader? He’s the coolest guy in school.</p>

      <p>“Thank you NRJ Awards for this lovely jacket. It makes me feel like I’m Troy Bolton.</p>
      <p>“I’m Troy Bolton – I’m the prom king, captain of the school basketball team, star quarterback.”</p>
      <p>Lewis said he had been wanting to “spice up” his look for a while – making the memorable varsity jacket a perfect gift for him.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/whitburn-star-lewis-capaldi-celebrates-20758314">Whitburn</a> singer also revealed that the jacket had his name on the back. He joked: “It says my f***ing name on the back of it. You misspelled s**gger.”</p>
