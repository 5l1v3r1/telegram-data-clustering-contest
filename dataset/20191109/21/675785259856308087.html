      <h1>Gary Lineker blasts Premier League for trying to justify 'absurd' VAR decision</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham produced yet another limp Premier League display as they stumbled to a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United that was marred by more VAR drama</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:49:20+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Lineker has blasted the Premier League after more VAR drama overshadowed Sheffield United's battling draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Spurs have endured a miserable start to their league campaign and it got no better against the Blades after Son Heung-min's opener was cancelled out by George Baldock.</p>
      <p>Baldock's 78th-minute strike was the second time United had got the ball in the back of the net, but VAR scrubbed off the first after John Lundstram's toe was ruled to be offside after a lengthy decision-making process.</p>
      <p>The Premier League attempted to explain the decision, posting on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "It was tight but the replays show Lundstram was offside in the build-up."</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>But Match of the Day pundit Lineker, who has been a critic of the Video Assistant Referee this season, was left baffled by the league's response.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "This proves nothing. Stop trying to justify these absurdities."</p>
      <p>And Blades boss Chris Wilder was another to question the decision-making process.</p>
      <p>"John Lundstram's big toe is bigger than it should be," he said. "It's just a bit of confusion from our point of view. When is the reset?</p>
      <p>"It's gone down the right, John has crossed, it's gone back out, where does it reset because we have attacked down the left-hand side.</p>

      <p>"The length of that stoppage I think doesn't do anybody any good, from the managers to players and, more importantly, the supporters. If it is offside, it's offside and we have to get on with it and accept it.</p>
      <p>"My heart sinks every time. It is here to aid referees. It affects the game, the length of time it takes, that's the disappointing aspect of it.</p>
      <p>"We have to have a big look at it in the summer, it is going to be here to stay, there's no doubt about that. It is going to have to run its course.</p>
      <p>"It seems like every press conference it is the major talking point.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed with that because we should be talking about how we have gone toe-to-toe with the Champions League finalists, it fills me with immense pride with how we have played."</p>
