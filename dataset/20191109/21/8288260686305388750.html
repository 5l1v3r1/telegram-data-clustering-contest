      <p>Lonwijk is described as ‘a strong and athletic defender’ and has been playing for the club’s U19 side and has also represented the Netherlands at age group level.</p>
      <p>The defender has reportedly already told teammates that he has completed his departure and will sign a 'multi-year' contract at Molineux when the window opens in January.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Wolves have made it a priority in recent years to sign talent from across the continent to compliment their development squads.</p>
      <p>Meritan Shabani and Raphael Nya arrived this summer from Bayern Munich and PSG respectively, whilst Pedro Neto and Bruno Jordao signed from Lazio.</p>
