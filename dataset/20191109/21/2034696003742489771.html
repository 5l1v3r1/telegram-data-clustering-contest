      <p>In a new interview with BBC’s <i>Newsnight</i>, Mitchell, who played Mark Corrigan in hit British comedy series <i>Peep Show</i>, offered a manifesto that he thinks would make for a better country.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, proportional representation,” he began. “So the percentage of the vote a party gets, dictates the percentage of the seats in the House of Commons it gets. I think that would be more sensible.”</p>
      <p>Moving onto his second point, Mitchell thinks “MPs should be paid a lot more while at the same time saying they can’t do anything else and that includes when they retire.”</p>
      <p>Elaborating on this point, he added: “So when they retire, or they get voted out, you give them a decent pension, but you say ‘you can’t get involved in business,’ so that essentially the malign effect of lobbyists is massively reduced.</p>
      <p>His third point focuses on carbon tax. “I think we’re a money obsessed world and we have to somehow equate the the environmental cost with the financial cost of things,” he said. “So a lot of things that do environmental damage have to be made more expensive, unpopular though that will be.”</p>
      <p>He added: “And that’s the keyword, unpopular and that’s why my manifesto will never be put into action.”</p>
