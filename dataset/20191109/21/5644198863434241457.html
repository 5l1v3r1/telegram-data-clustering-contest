      <p>Levante goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez has been cleared to play in Sunday's La Liga game at Athletic Bilbao after being excused from working at a polling station in Spain's parliamentary election on the same day.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Levante goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez has been cleared to play in Sunday's La Liga game at Athletic Bilbao after being excused from working at a polling station in Spain's parliamentary election on the same day.</p>
      <p>"Good news. The electoral commission has excused our goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez from being a reserve at the Mondragon polling station. We'll see you at San Mames," Levante tweeted on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Fernandez, who is from the Basque town of Mondragon, had been drafted onto a list of reserves who are required to attend the polling station on the morning of the election to see whether their presence is required.</p>
      <p>Levante's preparations for the game at San Mames had been thrown into chaos as second-choice keeper Oier Olazabal is injured. However, Fernandez will now be able to turn out for his side, who beat champions Barcelona 3-1 last week.</p>
      <p>All Spaniards on the electoral register are liable to be called up to work at polling stations, for which they are paid 65 euros (US$72), and require mitigating circumstances to be excused.</p>
      <p>Fernandezâ€™s team mate Jorge Miramon had also been drafted in to work on election day in his hometown of Zaragoza but was released from duty earlier in the week.</p>
