      <h1>Trump receives mostly warm welcome at Alabama-LSU game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:24:28+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author">Morgan Phillips</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> attended his third major sporting event in 13 days Saturday, traveling to Tuscaloosa, Ala. to take in the much-anticipated SEC matchup between the hometown <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/alabama-crimson-tide">Crimson Tide </a>and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/lsu-tigers">LSU Tigers</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump and first lady Melania Trump, sitting in a box one tier above the field, were introduced to the capacity crowd at Bryant-Denny Stadium just before the game began. The couple received sizable cheers, with a few boos mixed in. The crowd started chanting “USA, USA” shortly after they were introduced.</p>

      <p>Trump, who won Alabama with 63 percent of the vote in the 2016 presidential election, smiled, gave a thumbs-up a few times and threw a couple of fist bumps into the air as the Alabama fans waved red and white pompoms in response. Melania Trump got an equally enthusiastic welcome.</p>

      <p>Joining the Trumps in the box were Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and members of Congress from both states. The group included Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala., who is running for Senate against a field of primary opponents that includes former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>

      <p>The president's motorcade pulled away from the stadium early in the fourth quarter. LSU defeated Alabama, 46-41.</p>
      <p>There was little sign of political sentiment on campus but plenty of bipartisan grumbling about the long lines to get in due to enhanced security.</p>
      <p>The inflatable figure depicting a baby Donald Trump wearing a diaper, which has been seen at protests around the world, made an appearance in Tuscaloosa. A protester carried a sign that said "Roll Tide Impeach 45" and a woman held a signing saying she had sold her ticket and donated the money to the Alabama Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>But there were more pro-Trump signs. One woman wore an oversized red MAGA hat and carried a sign saying: "Make BAMA #1 Again." There were flags emblazoned with "Trump 2020" and banners that read: "Keep America Great Trump 2020."</p>

      <p>A crowd of more than 100,000 crimson-clad fans cheered long before kickoff as the P.A. announcer hyped the “game of the century” and praised  American service members ahead of Monday's Veteran's Day holiday.</p>
      <p>Trump refrained from choosing a side in the Alabama-LSU matchup, the first regular-season game between the AP poll's top two teams since 2011.</p>

      <p>"I love Alabama," Trump said Friday. "I'm going to go watch a very good football game, which is tomorrow with LSU, and it's going to be great.”</p>
      <p>"Regardless of your political views, that's pretty cool, having the president at the game," said LSU quarterback Joe Burrow.</p>

      <p>Alabama wide receiver Henry Ruggs III said, "Just for him even wanting to come to this game, it just shows, like I said, the magnitude of the game."</p>
      <p>On Oct. 27, Trump attended Game 5 of the World Series between the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-roundly-booed-by-world-series-crowd-as-fans-yell-lock-him-up">Washington Nationals </a>and Houston Astros, where he was roundly booed.

      <p>Trump became the first president to decline to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a World Series game, “in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible” according to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.</p>
      <p>Last week, Trump honored the Nationals after ther first-ever World Series championship. Nationals all-star catcher Kurt Suzuki, unlike many of his fans and teammates, took no issue with the president. Suzuki put a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-hugs-washington-nationals-kurt-suzuki-world-series-maga">red "Make America Great Again" hat</a> on his head as he made his way to the podium.</p>
      <p>Trump received a mixed reaction when he <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cheered-and-booed-at-ufc-match-in-new-york-city">attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> card at Madison Square Garden in New York City last Saturday.</p>
