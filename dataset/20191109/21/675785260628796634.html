      <h1>Parking firms targeting festive shoppers after rise in addresses sold by DVLA</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Festive shoppers need to keep one eye on the bargains and one on the clock, otherwise they might receiving an unwelcome present - a parking fine</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:49:15+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hayward, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Greedy parking firms are set for a Christmas cash bonanza as they chase shoppers for hefty fines.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands more drivers could end up with parking tickets this year compared with last Christmas.</p>
      <p>The warning follows a 35% jump in the number of drivers’ addresses sold to private car parking firms by the DVLA.</p>
      <p>The firms – which have faced criticism for overzealous practices – run thousands of car parks at retail parks and supermarkets.</p>
      <p>The DVLA charges £2.50 per vehicle record which is used to pursue owners for penalties of up to £100.</p>
      <p>The RAC Foundation, which has analysed the figures, says firms are set to cash in as motorists come out in force to do their shopping.</p>

      <p>The motoring research charity is warning drivers to be wary about using shopping centre car parks during the festive period.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Philip Gomm said: “Festive shoppers need to keep one eye on the bargains and one on the clock, otherwise they are likely to find themselves receving an unwelcome present.</p>
      <p>“The danger for big stores is that their customers get so fed up with over-keen parking operators they decide to do their shopping online.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the first half of the latest financial year, parking firms bought 4,324,522 records from the DVLA - up 35 per cent from 3,192,626 over the same period the previous year.</p>
      <p>In October, November and December last year, firms bought 1,781,347 records.</p>
      <p>If the number bought this year rises by the same proportion, the RAC Foundation says this would total 2,404,350 - meaning 623,000 more drivers could get a ticket.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Parking firms have been accused of treating motorists as “cash cows” by MPs who have called for new laws to regulate the industry.</p>

      <p>Drivers have complained about being fined for returning to their cars a few minutes late, or after being unable to buy a ticket because of a faulty machine.</p>
      <p>Ministers have promised to enforce a statutory code of practice that companies must follow to obtain motorists’ addresses - but this is not expected to happen until next year.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest firms, Parking Eye, manages more than 800 store car parks across the UK.</p>
      <p>Last year it made nearly £13.6million in profits, up by 39 per cent from the previous 12 months.</p>
