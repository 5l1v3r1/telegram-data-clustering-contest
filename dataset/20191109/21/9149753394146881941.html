      <h1>PUBG might be getting a clan system on PC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T21:14:24+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 21:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/lauren-morton/" target="_blank">Lauren Morton</a></address>
      <p>Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is no stranger to regular updates (you can keep up with the patch notes on our <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-update/">PUBG updates</a> page) and an upcoming one may add a clan system to the game. </p>
      <p>A frequent dataminer known as PlayerIGN who previously predicted the <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayerIgn/status/1184079210563850241?s=20">PUBG Global Championship skins</a> has returned with more datamined information and some leaked images. According to the images PlayerIGN tweeted out listing the information gathered, clans will be able to have a title, slogan, and a max number of 20 members.</p>

      <p>If you're curious, here's the rest of the character limit and more detailed information that PlayerIGN posted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cost:</b> 5000 BP (Battle Points)</li>
        <li><b>Title:</b> 2-15 character limit</li>
        <li><b>Tag:</b> 2-4 character limit</li>
        <li><b>Slogan:</b> 30 character limit</li>
        <li><b>Presentation:</b> 180 character limit</li>
        <li><b>Members:</b> 20 limit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Clans will also be able to receive resumes from recruits, though whether those will be custom-created in some way by players or just an automatic form with their name and stats we don't know.</p>
      <p>PUBG <a href="https://www.pubgmobile.com/en-US/news_detail/webplat/info/news_version3/35372/35373/35374/35386/35387/m20497/201807/743855.shtml">added a clan system</a> to the mobile version of the game back in July of 2018 so it doesn't come as a huge surprise that this update might make its way to PC. The bigger question is <i>when</i> this supposed feature might make it into an update. </p>
