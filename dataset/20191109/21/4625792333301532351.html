      <p><b>NEW LONDON</b>, New Hampshire — The man whom Joe Biden once told, "I probably have a much higher IQ than you do," says he is voting for the former vice president in the New Hampshire Democratic primary.</p>
      <p>Frank Fahey, a New Hampshire resident, asked the then-Delaware senator during his first White House run in 1987 about his law school academic record, which led a famously heated exchange.</p>
      <p>“I think I have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect. I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship,” Biden said, before later falsely claiming that he graduated in the top half of his class.</p>
      <p>Biden later admitted that nearly none of that statement was true: He did not graduate in the top half of his class or receive an academic scholarship to the Syracuse University School of Law, where he failed a class for plagiarizing part of a term paper.</p>
      <p>Fahey and Biden met again Friday, this time in New London, New Hampshire. During a Q&amp;A session at Colby-Sawyer College, Fahey introduced him as the man who sparked that exchange more than 30 years ago.</p>
      <p>Fahey then proclaimed that he "loved Biden" and believed he was the most qualified person running for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>After the two shared a laugh, Fahey asked Biden another tough question. This time, Fahey inquired about his handling of the Clarence Thomas hearings.</p>
      <p>"Frankie, baby, no wonder I love ya. You ask all the easy questions," Biden answered, before saying he always believed Anita Hill's accusations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her.</p>
