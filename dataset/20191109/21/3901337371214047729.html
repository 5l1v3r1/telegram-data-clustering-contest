      <p><b>Report:</b> Leicester City 2-0 Arsenal</p>

      <p><b>Venue:</b> King Power Stadium</p>
      <p>Leicester City jumped up to second spot in the Premier League after defeating struggling Arsenal 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Mesut Ozil started back-to-back league for the first time this season, while Pierre-Emerick captained the side after Granit Xhaka was stripped of the armband this week.</p>
      <p>The Foxes started the brighter of the two sides, but the game's first opening fell to Alexandre Lacazette, who fired wide of the target from 10-yards out on 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were nearly made to pay for the sloppiness at the back as Hector Bellerin gifted the ball to the Ayoze Perez, who sent his strike inches over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Leicester had a couple more half chances in the latter stages of the first half, with James Maddison going closest with a free-kick that shaved the top of the crossbar.</p>
      <p>The Foxes came out with the same fighting spirit in the second half which nearly resulted in the opening goal as Ricardo picked out Wifried Ndidi, who rattled the crossbar from close range.</p>
      <p>The deadlock was eventually broken in the 67th minute as a superb passing move ending with Jamie Vardy turning home Youri Tielemans' low cross in the box.</p>
      <p>It got better for the home side with 15 minutes remaining as Vardy turned provider to set up Maddision, who sent a fine first-time finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>In the end, 2-0 was how the encounter finished as the Foxes move up to second spot, six points behind Liverpool who face Manchester City on Sunday night.</p>
