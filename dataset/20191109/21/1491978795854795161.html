      <ul>
        <li>France 10-20 England</li>
        <li>Red Roses win in France for first time since 2012</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sarah Hunter scored two tries as England beat France 20-10 in Clermont, earning their first win in France since 2012 and laying down a marker for the Women’s Six Nations.</p>
      <p>Simon Middleton’s side had to weather an early storm from the hosts, who took the lead with a Jessy Tremouliere penalty in the 11th minute. England centre Emily Scarratt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/england-emily-scarratt-womens-world-player-of-the-year">named player of the year</a> at last Sunday’s World Rugby awards, levelled the scores with a place-kick of her own.</p>
      <p>Hunter then took charge, powering over for her first try in the 35th minute after a series of driving mauls. The England captain went over again moments later, strong forward play allowing Sarah Beckett to create space for the score.</p>
      <p>Scarratt converted both tries to give England a commanding 17-3 half-time lead, but France got back into the game with 15 minutes to go. Marlie Packer was shown a yellow card and the hosts made the advantage count, with Camille Boudaud finishing off a blindside break.</p>

      <p>Tremouliere’s conversion cut the gap to seven, but Scarratt added a penalty on 72 minutes to give England breathing space, and they held on to win their first autumn Test match of the year.</p>
      <p>England host France next Saturday at Sandy Park, before facing Italy in Bedford on 23 November. The Red Roses will next visit France for the opening match of the 2020 Six Nations, in a game that could decide the destiny of the trophy.</p>
