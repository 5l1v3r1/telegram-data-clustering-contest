      <p>Cape Town - <b>Maritzburg United</b> mounted a titanic comeback as they scored two goals at the death to clinch a <b>2-2</b> draw against <b>Bloemfontein Celtic</b> at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The first half was a one-sided affair as Maritzburg created several good goal-scoring chances while Celtic failed to make any headway in the hosts' defensive third of the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Team of Choice started on the front foot and put together a well worked team move in the fifth minute, but Gabriel Nyoni was unable to direct his header on target after Pogiso Sanoka whipped the ball in towards the back post.</p>
      <p>They again went close to claiming the lead just four minutes later as Thabiso Kutumela latched onto Micah Lea'alafa's flicked header before smashing the ball against the post.</p>
      <p>The hosts created two chances in quick succession around the half-hour mark, Nyoni forcing a save from Celtic 'keeper Jackson Mabokgwane before Jeremy Brockie fired narrowly wide just two minutes later after meeting Keagan Buchanan's cross at the near post.</p>
      <p>However, the scores would remain locked at 0-0 as Maritzburg failed to find a way through in the remaining minutes, Celtic doing enough to keep their clean sheet intact.</p>
      <p>And Maritzburg were made to rue their wastefulness in front of goal as Celtic bounced back with a much-improved performance after the half-time break.</p>
      <p>Celtic claimed the lead after just five minutes of play, Sera Motebang slotting home after catching the defence flat-footed on the break.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg, having made all three of their substitutions, were dealt a major blow in their bid to draw level when Siyanda Xulu had to leave the field of play after failing to recover from a clash of heads.</p>
      <p>Celtic made full use of their numerical advantage as they stretched further ahead in the 82nd minute, catching the hosts on the break once again as Siphelele Luthuli added his name to the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>But Maritzburg didn't allow their heads to drop and they clawed one back just one minute later, Daylon Claasen earning a penalty before dusting himself off and converting the spot-kick.</p>
      <p>And, with the home support roaring them on, Maritzburg would draw level in the third minute of injury time as Judas Moseamedi burst into the danger area before firing a powerful effort into the top-right corner.</p>
