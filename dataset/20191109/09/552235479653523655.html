      <p>Emerging <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> star Leon King is being watched by a clutch of Europe's top sides - according to a report.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old Ibrox academy star has been turning heads at youth level and had already played with the club's U20 side.</p>
      <p>And his impressive displays have led to interest from the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and RB Leipzig. The English pair are believed to have watched him in person during last month's development loss to Carlisle, according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1285129/2019/11/09/chelsea-and-liverpool-among-those-looking-rangers-15-year-old-defender-king/?redirected=1">The Athletic</a> .</p>
      <p>The central defender turns 16 in January and cannot sign his first professional contract until then.</p>

      <p>King is highly regarded and partnered former Celtic star Liam Morrison, who earned a summer move to Bayern Munich, in the heart of Scotland's U17 defence last month.</p>
      <p>His meteoric rise bears a resemblance to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/billy-gilmour">Billy Gilmour</a> 's accelerated Ibrox push before his move to Chelsea in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>The former Rangers youth standout has played three times for the senior side and the 18-year-old started against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in the Carabao Cup. </p>
      <p>U20s boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Graeme Murty</a> is a big fan of King and included him on the bench for their UEFA Youth League win over Slovan Bratislava on Wedesday.</p>
      <p>He said: “He’s someone who is getting a lot of press now because he’s quite young but he’s there on merit. We don’t hesitate in pushing them forward if we think we can extend their learning and that’s what it’s about. It’s about making sure that Leon is challenged to the right level.</p>

      <p>“There will be a time that he drops to his own age and we expect him to be the best player on the pitch, regardless of who else is on it. And there will be a time when he plays a couple of years up and we expect it to be a struggle for him.</p>
      <p>“And then if we throw him into a game like this (UEFA Youth League) and really make him struggle, that’s where his development will accelerate the fastest. We just need to make sure we’re mindful of his age and we do it at the right time.”</p>
