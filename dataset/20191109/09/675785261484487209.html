      <h2>Liverpool fans caused damage to the Man City team coach as it arrived at Anfield for the two club's Champions League quarter-final in April 2018 - with the Reds winning the fixture</h2>

      <p>Vincent Kompany believes Liverpool fans attacking Manchester City's team bus was the starting point for the two club's rivalry.</p>
      <p>City were on their way to Anfield for 2018's Champions League quarter-final first leg when Reds supporters started to throw items, such as bottles and flares, on their approach to the ground.</p>
      <p>The blitz on the vehicle forced <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> to issue an apology, with the club handed a £17,500 fine by UEFA - although despite trawling through 130 hours of footage, the police were unable to make any arrests.</p>
      <p>But that incident, which smashed windows and required a replacement coach to take the players home, is seen as the flash point which turned the two sides to enemy status.</p>

      <p>That was intensified by last season's title race - which saw Liverpool lose once all season, to City, and Pep Guardiola's men lift the crown having won the battle by a point.</p>
      <p>It looks set to be another close tussle for top spot in the Premier League, and former City skipper Kompany, who is now a player-manager at Anderlecht, reckons that evening in April on Anfield Road was the flash point.</p>
      <p>“The rivalry increased and they became our No. 1 team to beat," Kompany recalled in his book 'Treble Triumph', which is currently being serialised in the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10308847/liverpool-fans-bus-attack-man-city-kompany/">Sun.</a> "The mood among City fans towards these games against Liverpool had changed.</p>

      <p>“They’d always been seen as tough fixtures but now there was more tension.</p>
      <p>“None of us were sitting on that coach saying they were scared. But it was very unpleasant and should never have been allowed to happen.</p>
      <p>“I do think that incident changed the way that a lot of neutrals looked at Liverpool. To give them some credit, they had also become the hardest team to win against. But I could see it becoming a deep rivalry.</p>
      <p>“But it changed the way we saw games against them from that moment. It became even more important to us to win our games against Liverpool."</p>
