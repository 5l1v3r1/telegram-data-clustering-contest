      <h3>A poor judgment joke</h3>
      <p>Korean boy band MONSTA X was recently embroiled in a scandal when two members, Monsta X Minhyuk and Wonho, made a poorly-received joke during a speech at a fan signing event on 9 March.</p>
      <p>A video of the incident spread on Twitter on 25 October, just before the group’s scheduled comeback with their new mini album “Follow: Find You”.</p>
      <p>The footage shows Minhyuk putting his mic on Wonho's chest and saying in Korean, "Mr. Nipple, please say something" while Wonho puts his hand up and shouts in English, "Me too".</p>

      </figure>
      <p>​The video <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910271077161828-intl-fans-support-monsta-x-amid-metoo-scandal-while-k-pop-band-grilled-at-home/">generated a storm among Korean fans</a>, according to local media reports, with the boys criticised for having mocked the MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>Most international fans, however, rushed to Twitter to support the musicians, insisting the situation was taken out of context.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the South Korean company Starship Entertainment issued an official statement that the main vocalist Wonho, who has been with the band since its formation during the reality survival programme No.Mercy in 2015, would be permanently leaving the group, which would now feature only six members.</p>
