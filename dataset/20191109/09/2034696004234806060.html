      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-national">The National</a> have teased that their Homecoming festival could be set to return next year – check out the post below.</p>
      <p>Matt Berninger and co. launched the event in Cincinnati, Ohio last April, with the band themselves performing two headline sets over the weekend. Their self-curated line-up boasted the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/future-islands">Future Islands</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/father-john-misty">Father John Misty</a>, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/feist">Feist</a>.</p>

      <p>Though the festival didn’t return in 2019, it now appears that a 2020 instalment could be on the cards.</p>
      <p>Posting on their official Instagram last night (November 8), The National shared a live shot of themselves featuring the repeated word “Homecoming” in all-capitals. Captioning the black and purple photo, The National wrote the ‘Bloodbuzz Ohio’ lyrics “<i>I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees</i>.”</p>

      <p>“Looks a lot like I’ll be taking a road trip soon,” wrote one fan in the comments section. Another said: “Yes please let’s do this again.”</p>

The musician revealed that the upcoming record will be produced and arranged by Booker T. Jones and that we’ll hear “more on it soon”.</p>
