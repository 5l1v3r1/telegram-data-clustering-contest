      <p>A man claims he was forced to mourn his mother's death in a hospital corridor as she died while waiting for a room.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Cork's Red FM, Steve Crowley claimed his mum died in the A&amp;E of Cork University <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">Hospital</a> in an area with no privacy.</p>
      <p>He said people were 'coming in and out' and claims staff told him they had no room for his mum, Evelyn.</p>
      <p>Steve has been left feeling angered and betrayed as he spoke of the overcrowded conditions.</p>
      <p>He said when they eventually did get a room, it was so small it was barely big enough for a bed.</p>
      <p>"People deserve so much better to have their final moments in that," Steve, from Cork in Ireland, told <a href="https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/cork-mans-horror-after-mother-17223641">CorkBeo.</a></p>
      <p>Steve said he cared for his mother for 14 years after coming back from Australia when she was diagnosed with MS.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, she was rushed to hospital and sadly passed away in just a matter of hours.</p>
      <p>He told Neil Prendeville: "The first problem for us was the wait when you get off the ambulance and get into the hospital.</p>
      <p>"That took the bones of two and a half hours.</p>
      <p>"Once she got in she was put in a corner to do tests on. Thursday morning we were told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/what-sepsis-signs-symptoms-treatment-7246541">Sepsis</a> had set in.</p>
      <p>"She was gone within ten hours.</p>
      <p>"Everything happened so quick it was like a switch going off."</p>

      <p>As Steve grappled with the news of his mother's passing, he told of the overcrowding conditions forcing him to mourn in a hospital corridor.</p>
      <p>"They left us alone but there was still people coming in and out.</p>
      <p>"The main nurse said sorry that they had no where to put my mother, that they had no room for her.</p>
      <p>"You are trying to come to terms in your mind with what was happening while you are in something from the wars.</p>
      <p>"The curtains were closed but the fella in the bed across from her, he was trying to put a ringtone on his phone. Like that is annoying at the best of times.</p>
      <p>"People were sticking their head in looking for people. People were walking in and walking out.</p>
      <p>"A priest came in, shook my hand and said a prayer. But while he was saying it, at least four of five people came in.</p>
      <p>"The noise of the place was so loud. Between people talking and their ringtones, and all I wanted was to be there alone with my mam."</p>
      <p>There was some consolation for Steve, who was told that a nurse stayed with his mother up until her final moments.</p>
      <p>"A nurse came over and said she held her hand as she passed away and I needed to know that she was not on her own.</p>
      <p>"At the time the words felt empty, but the more times goes on the more I feel better.</p>
      <p>"The last thing I wanted was her all alone in a A&amp;E with all the noise and lonely."</p>
      <p>Eventually him and his mother were taken to a room for more privacy, but this only worsened their situation.</p>
      <p>Steve added: "The main nurse took her into a hospital room that was not big enough for a hospital bed.</p>
      <p>"They had to take the chairs out. You couldn't open the door without banging on the bed. The room wasn't designed for this.</p>
      <p>"Every time someone would come in they would bang the bed. I kept saying to myself is this where we are.</p>
      <p>"I will never forgive the system for being like that and I never want to have that memory.</p>
      <p>"People deserve so much better to have their final moments in that."</p>
      <p>This week, CUH has had the second highest number of people waiting on trolleys in the country with 65 patients looking for beds. At the Mercy 23 people were waiting and five at Bantry General.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Cork University Hospital told <a href="https://www.joe.ie/life-style/woman-dies-cork-university-hospital-ae-waiting-hospital-bed-686620">Joe.Ie</a> : "Cork University Hospital does not comment on individual patient cases."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has made attempts to contact Cork University Hospital.</p>
