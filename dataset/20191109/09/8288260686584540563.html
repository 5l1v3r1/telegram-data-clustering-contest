      <p>Ahead of what could prove to be a pivotal weekend at the top and bottom of the Premier League table, data analysts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/possible_tables/">@Possible_tables</a> have outlined where every team could finish up by Monday morning.</p>
      <p>After Watford's win on Friday night, Villa sit three points outside of the relegation zone and although the table does show they could drop into the bottom three, they have a 15 better goal difference than Southampton so realistically, can only finish as low as 17th.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In order for that to happen, Everton will need to beat Southampton and Dean Smith's men lose out to Wolves.</p>
      <p>However, for those of a glass half full persuasion, Villa can make a big leap up the table with a win in the Black Country.</p>

      <p>Should results go their way, they could end the weekend in the top half and in 10th position. The team directly above them, Newcastle United face Bournemouth at home, whilst the two teams above the Magpies, Burnley and West Ham square off at Turf Moor.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Should that end in a draw and Villa beat Wolves, they will leapfrog their claret and blue rivals.</p>
      <p>Finally, they could overtake both Tottenham and Manchester United, should they lose to Sheffield United and Brighton respectively.</p>
