      <p>A child sex pervert was unmasked after sending a naked video and pictures of himself to a decoy he believed was a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Paisley man Mark Gemmell, 45, was rooted out by vigilante groups after attempting to groom the youngster, who was actually an adult member of a group hunting paedophiles.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard Gemmell was also caught distributing indecent images of youngsters through social media as well as downloading and possessing the vile material.</p>
      <p>He was caught thanks to the work of a decoy, who posed as a 13-year-old girl called Sasha.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Keri Marshall said: “A self-styled decoy, part of a group Soloceptors, posed as 13-year-old female Sasha on Kik messenger app.</p>
      <p>“At the end of July 2018, the accused entered a chat room on Kik called Teen UK Only and began talking to people in the room, including Sasha.</p>
      <p>“During the course of the conversation, the accused asked Sasha to provide her ASL – age, sex and location – to which she replied 13.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The court heard Gemmell, of Howard Street, Seedhill, sent Sasha a picture of a sex toy with a comment, “Yes, feels good”.</p>
      <p>The fiscal added: “He sent a further picture of a smaller sex toy, stating, ‘You can take my smaller one.’</p>
      <p>“Over the course of the following weeks, the accused continued to send Sasha sexual images and pictures of himself.”</p>
      <p>The court heard these included a picture of a penis and, in further conversations, he asked her if she would “join him in bed” and “touch him”.</p>
      <p>Ms Marshall said Gemmell even sent her a video of himself naked in the bath, and this prompted the decoy to report him to police.</p>

      <p>The decoy forwarded the chat logs and picture files as evidence.</p>
      <p>Cops swooped on his home on September 3 last year and arrested him.</p>
      <p>They also recovered a Samsung mobile phone, which had 791 images of child abuse on it.</p>
      <p>Cyber Crime Unit analysis revealed 102 of these were category A, the worst level of classification, 96 were category B and the remaining 593 were category C.</p>
      <p>Ms Marshall explained that 83 still images depicting the sexual abuse of children were found to have been distributed from Gemmell’s mobile phone “to a number of different contacts” via Kik and WhatsApp instant messenger.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Gemmell appeared at a pre-trial hearing and pleaded guilty to charges of taking, or permitting to be taken, indecent images of children between September 2012 and September 2018 at an address in Paisley.</p>
      <p>He admitted distributing indecent photographs of children between September 2013 and November 2014.</p>
      <p>Gemmell also pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to cause an older child to look at sexual images and communicate indecently to obtain sexual gratification between July 1, 2018 and September 3, 2018.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Jonathan Manson said Gemmell was “well aware of the consequences of actions”, but reserved his comments until sentencing.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Tom McCartney placed Gemmell on the Sex Offenders’ Register and jailed him ahead of sentencing.</p>
      <p>He told him: “Due to the serious nature of these offences, bail is revoked and you will be remanded in custody.”</p>
      <p>Gemmell will discover his fate when he appears back at court on November 28.</p>
