      <p>Thermaltake released their fantastic looking TOUGHRAM a few weeks ago. <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/thermaltake-toughram-rgb-ddr4-review/">We actually reviewed it here</a> on eTeknix and couldn’t have been more impressed. Well, that was until today!

It looked good with the black and chrome, but I’ll be damned if this isn’t one of the best looking white kits on the market today!</p>
