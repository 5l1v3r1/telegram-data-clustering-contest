      <p>A beer maker in Fresno, California has started selling an unusual, limited batch with "2019/11/06 EPSTEIN DIDNT KILL HIMSELF." printed on the bottom of its beer cans, according to the news media outlet FOX 26.</p>
      <p>According to the company manager Carlos Tovar, the idea came to him because the question of if Jeffrey Epstein really committed suicide is "a big thing right now."</p>

      <p>​On August 10, Epstein allegedly committed suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he had been held ahead of his pending trial; he was charged with sex trafficking for allegedly having procured underage girls for high society patrons.</p>
      <p>Police have been investigating Epstein for nearly two decades and arrested him in 2005 for molesting an underage girl. Epstein served a sentence of 13 months. In July 2019, Epstein was arrested a second time for allegedly trafficking underage girls for sex in his mansion. Some of the charges dated back to the 2000s.</p>
      <p>Epstein pleaded not guilty to all charges against him, but faced up to 45 years in prison had he been convicted.</p>
