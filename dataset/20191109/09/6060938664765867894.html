      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Disha-Patani">Disha Patani</a> is on a roll not only with the multiple projects but the grandeur of her projects also makes her the talk of the town. The talented actress has already started shooting for her upcoming films '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/KTina">KTina</a>' and '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Radhe:-Your-Most-Wanted-Bhai">Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai</a>'.</p>
      <p>In 'KTina' the actress would be seen in a Punjabi avatar while on the other hand in 'Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai', Disha will be sharing the screen with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a> for the second time after 'Bharat'.</p>
      <p>Disha is surely in the awe of superstar and elaborating on the same, she shares how she's inspired by him. "There’s too much in there for me to choose one to be honest. Salman sir is one of the most humble and kind people I’ve ever come across. There’s this aura about him that makes you feel comfortable around him even though he’s one of the biggest superstars in India. Watching him work is nothing short of inspiring. So to sum up, I can’t decide on any one specific thing!"</p>
      <p>Recently, Disha shared a picture in a white outfit from the Muhrat pooja of 'Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai' and fans just went gaga over her astounding look.</p>
