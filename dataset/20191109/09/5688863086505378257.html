        <b>Jamshedpur FC’s in-form striker Farukh Choudhary reckons that their 0-0 draw in a tough game against defending champions Bengaluru FC was a good result for them. Unbeaten so far, Jamshedpur will be on the road to face ATK in their fourth match of the Hero Indian Super League (Hero ISL) 2019-20.</b>

      <p>Having managed a win against the new teams Odisha FC and Hyderabad FC, Antonio Iriondo’s welcomed the defending champions at home and salvaged a point. </p>
      <p>“I think it was a good result for us. We didn’t lose, we got a point out of it at least. It was a tough game really. I think all the players gave their best in that match, including <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/bengaluru_fc">Bengaluru FC</a> players. Both the goalkeepers played an outstanding game that night. Subrata (Paul) bhai and Gurpreet (Singh Sandhu) bhai,” Farukh told indiansuperleague.com in an exclusive interview.</p>
      <p>Next up is a trip to the two-time champions ATK, who are just below them on the points table with six points from three games — Jamshedpur has seven. But as Farukh prepares for the clash on Saturday, he is also looking forward to playing against his friend and former teammate Michael Soosairaj.</p>
      <p>“Our coach always says, we look at our strengths and what we can do to hurt the other team. We are not too focused on them but yes, we are approaching this game the same way we approach any other game. ATK are a really good side. Their attacking line is great. My ex-teammate Soosai (Michael Soosairaj) and a few guys I know are there, and they are doing well. We’ll see what happens in the game,” Farukh said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what he thinks because he was here last season. For us it’s just another game, obviously off-the-field he’s my friend, but when we enter the field, we are opponents. We are going to give our best for our team,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Personally, Farukh has had an excellent start to the season, scoring the opener and setting up the second during their 3-1 win over Hyderabad. </p>
      <p>“I am giving my 100% every time I enter the field. I think if you put in the effort, the results will come. I am really glad I got a goal and an assist, and I am looking forward to doing more in the upcoming games,” Farukh added.</p>
