        <b>Former Ferrari driver Eddie Irvine says that Charles Leclerc is the only driver capable of taking a fight to Lewis Hamilton and has aimed another swipe at Leclerc's teammate Sebastian Vettel.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Monegasque has outperformed his more experienced teammate this season, who has again struggled in some key moments, although his victory in Singapore showed all the qualities that made him a four time champion.</p>
      <p>Irvine told the Italian version of Betway: <i>"I don't think he is a worthy four-time world champion. He simply makes too many mistakes for that.</i></p>

        <i>"I was surprised that Ferrari hired him, because that happened the moment he lost to Ricciardo. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"You see in battles between Vettel and Hamilton that he always comes in second place, Hamilton knocks him out. It's hard for Mattia Binotto.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Vettel can harm Leclerc in his fight for the world championship. Leclerc is the only one who can ride at Hamilton's level and I look forward to seeing more of him."</i>
