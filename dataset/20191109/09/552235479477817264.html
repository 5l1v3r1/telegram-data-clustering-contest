      <p>A Larkhall mum has shed more than three stone in a bid to become a slinky mother of the bride-to-be.</p>
      <p>Pauline McGrory joined her local Slimming World group and dropped several dress sizes by losing 3st 4.5lbs.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three kick-started her weight loss after seeing herself in family photographs, and knew that the next big event where snaps would be taken would be her daughter Caitlyn’s university graduation.</p>
      <p>Further motivation arrived after hearing that her two daughters, Caitlyn and Amber, got engaged and she wanted to shed those pounds for their big days.</p>
      <p>Her daughter’s graduation came one year after her weight loss and she felt proud of herself for slimming down and feeling confident.</p>
      <p>Now Pauline has trained as a consultant for Slimming World and is set to welcome new members to her 9.30am group on Tuesdays at Lesmahagow Bowling Club.</p>
      <p>Pauline says her new role has never been more important. The 47-year-old explained: “Obesity is becoming such a huge issue across the UK.</p>
      <p>“When I first joined Slimming World as a member, I never dreamed that I would end up helping other people to lose weight, but now I just can’t wait to get started.</p>
      <p>“After losing over thee stone and completing my training, it’s a privilege for me to be able to pass on the experience, insight and understanding that helped me, so that I can give my members the support they need to get to target.</p>
      <p>“Support is really the most important thing. It all starts with feeling that you’re not alone.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t have lost 3st 4.5lbs without the weekly help, encouragement and understanding of my own consultant and group.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was destined to struggle with my weight for the rest of my life, but when I came to Slimming World it was different. I never felt like I was on a diet. The eating plan encourages you to eat lots of tasty, filling foods like pasta, rice, potatoes and lean meat and fish, you are never hungry and no foods are banned, so there’s no deprivation.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe I’d found a way to lose weight without starving myself. Slimming World isn’t just about changing what you eat. Becoming more active is important too.</p>
      <p>“Our Body Magic programme takes the threat out of activity by showing people, many of whom have unpleasant memories of being forced to take part in activity at school, how they can build activity into their daily routine without having to take up traditional forms of exercise like going to the gym or running.”</p>
