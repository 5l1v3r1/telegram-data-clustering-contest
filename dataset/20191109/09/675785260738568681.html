      <h2>The former EastEnders actress has a phenomenal figure post-partum that she keeps in check with shakes and exercise classes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent</a></address>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa is a mother to two daughters Ella, four, and one-year-old Mia - who she shares with former TOWIE star Dan Osbourne.</p>
      <p>Following the birth of her second child last year, Jacqueline, 27, has flaunted her phenomenal curves with regular social media posts that show her trim frame modelling swimwear, glitzy party outfits and day-to day casual looks.</p>
      <p>Unafraid to show the real her, the bombshell often posts make-up free images and encourages her social media fans to follow in her healthy footsteps.</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders actress has spoken honestly about her changing shape after sharing that she "didn't want to let herself go" as a result of being at her largest size in between the births of her two little ones.</p>
      <p>In order to keep on track and share her progress she started an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account that is dedicated to her fitness journey named @fitness_jja and Jacqueline began a shake diet meal replacement plan and went on to lose an impressive one and a half stone.</p>

      <p>Discussing her body, the star told her social media followers: "Before I had Mia in between Ella and Mia I was the biggest I have ever been.</p>
      <p>"Then I got pregnant and so I decided that I wanted to change as soon as I had Mia I thought I'm not going to let myself go," she said.</p>
      <p>"I thought I really want to get back to a comfortable weight where I feel good where I feel confident.</p>
      <p>"And I'm still on my journey but I'm already feeling so much better I've lost a stone and a half.</p>

      <p>"I do feel comfortable and I maybe want to lose a little bit more and I want to tone up as well. But I just feel so much better," she said.</p>
      <p>The pretty brunette has managed to maintain her killer curves since and continues to keep herself toned by taking part in fitness classes that are run at her performing arts school such as boogie bounce which combines trampolining with circuit training.</p>

      <p>Always being honest and open with her fans, Jacqueline has also told her fans of times where she has overindulged.</p>
      <p>During a recent holiday to America, she revealed: "After a few weeks of eating way too much of the wrong foods. I cannot cope anymore. I must stop!! Getting back on my journey and this time I’m going HARD!"</p>
      <p>Proving she enjoys food, she added: "Don’t get me wrong I love a cheat day but a cheat month is too much! actually sick of American fatty food and can’t wait for my Herbalife shake for breakfast! Wondering what flavour to go for."</p>

      <p>Always keeping it candid, Jacqueline has also spoken out on being trolled for her figure.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with new! magazine, Jacqueline told how she's gets sent mean messages online every single day.</p>
      <p>She told the publication: "For me, trolling is an everyday occurrence. I've become accustomed to it over the years - it affected me more when I was younger. I received online abuse from the second I joined EastEnders in 2010.</p>

      <p>"I can't remember specifics, but I get nasty comments about my weight. You have to have a thick skin. I don't like when someone says something negative about my talent... but I don't reply unless the trolls target my children.</p>
      <p>'I almost want to say to them, "I feel sorry for you, are you OK? Do you have people to talk to?" A normal human doesn't do that stuff. Maybe they don't have the right people around them?"</p>

      <p>She has also addressed her shape when she filmed a series of clips talking about motherhood and self-esteem on her Instagram stories.</p>
      <p>Lying on her sofa under a blanket, the makeup free actress told other mums to take as many pictures with their kids as they can so they don't miss out on anything.</p>
      <p>The actress mused: "It's amazing how many mums are saying they don't really like getting in pictures and that they don't feel confident enough or they have to wear full face of makeup before getting in pictures.</p>
      <p>"I do understand that and I do get that but it's such a shame that's the world we live in."</p>
