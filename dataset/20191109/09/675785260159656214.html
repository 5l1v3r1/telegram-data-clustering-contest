      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:03:28+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celeb</a> 's high profile signing Caitlyn Jenner has admitted she's got no idea how the show works and could be in for a nasty shock.</p>
      <p>The US athlete-turned-reality TV star all but confirmed she's going into the jungle next week as she broke her silence last night.</p>
      <p>ITV have yet to formally announce her as their big name star, but she was part of a leaked line-up which emerged yesterday.</p>
      <p>When asked about I'm A Celeb during an event in California last night, Caitlyn, 70, said she's been banned from talking about it.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10307692/caitlyn-jenner-im-a-celeb-no-idea/">The Sun Online</a> , she explained: "I am not allowed to talk about this until next week."</p>
      <p>When she was wished luck on the show, she explained she's got no idea what's in store for her once she enters the jungle.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn said: "Thank you. I don't know how it works."</p>
      <p>The former track star is believe to be due to enter the camp next week ahead of the launch on November 17.</p>
      <p>It means she will be due to fly to Australia this weekend as the stars star to arrive Down Under.</p>
      <p>She may want to spend the journey watching some old episodes of the series to prepare herself for the grim Bucktucker Trials, which often involve eating animals parts or getting covered in bugs.</p>

      <p>Show bosses are also believed to have also signed footie legend Ian Wright, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Andrew Whyment and former EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Also joining them are said to be Girls Aloud legend Nadine Coyle, DJ Roman Kemp and rugby player James Haskell.</p>
      <p>An ITV spokesperson told Mirror Online: "We'll officially announce our I'm A Celebrity line up for 2019 in due course."</p>
      <p>Producers like to keep tight-lipped about the stars they've signed, but as the show is such a massive production, word always manages to slip out.</p>
