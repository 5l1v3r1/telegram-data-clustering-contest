      <h1>New VW Corrado Based On Golf 8 Is A Pipe Dream</h1>
      <h2>Well, a man can dream.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/jacob-oliva/" target="_blank">Jacob Oliva</a></address>
      <p>Remember the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/">Volkswagen</a> Corrado? Well, most of us won't but it was a gem of the early '90s. A two-door, 2+2 liftback coupe that was designed Herbert Schäfer, the Corrado was regarded by many as VW's best driver's car. Its final iteration carried a compact VR6 engine that packs a punch – 188 horsepower (140 kiloWatts) and 181 pound-feet (245 Newton-meters) torque to be exact. The Corrado introduced the VR6 engine into the North American market. Not to mention, the active rear spoiler was a nifty feature of its time.</p>

      <p>But like any great car, the Corrado was gone too soon. It only had a seven-year run from 1988 to 1995, and again, like any great car, it's surely missed. But what if VW revives the nameplate but with a modern twist? The folks from<a href="https://www.kolesa.ru/news/novyy-volkswagen-corrado-kakim-on-mozhet-byt"><i> Kolesa.ru</i></a> made a rendering of a modern-day Corrado, which you can see below.</p>
      <p>Based on the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/volkswagen/golf/">new VW Golf</a>, this rendering of the Corrado adapts several styling cues of the German compact. From the wide lower grille, the unique rims, down to the classy LED taillights, the Golf 8 styling fits the bill. Interestingly, the rendering doesn't carry the Corolla-esque headlights of the Golf 8.</p>

      <p>A Golf 8-based Corrado isn't far-fetched, though. The Corrado was based on the Mk2 Golf using the A2 platform as the basis of its architecture. The front-wheel-drive coupe could very well live in this updated styling. It can stand side-by-side with the upcoming Golf GTI in terms of performance while offering a different flavor.</p>
      <p>We'll never know if VW would actually want to resurrect the nameplate, but as I've mentioned above, a man can dream.</p>
