      <p>Two people have been arrested after police launched an early morning drugs raid in Paisley.</p>
      <p>Cops in riot gear burst through the door of the George Street flat after a tip-off from fed-up members of the public.</p>
      <p>A 44-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman have been arrested and reported to the procurator fiscal after a large quantity of suspected Class-A drugs was seized in the operation.</p>
      <p>The Violence Reduction Unit and community Police officers used a the ‘big red key’ to crash through the front door of the flat.</p>
      <p>The town centre raid was launched on Thursday morning as part of Police Scotland’s Your Home, Your Street, Our Community initiative which asked members of the public to highlight main concerns in the area.</p>
      <p>Drug dealing came high on the list and now officers are taking the fight to pushers and peddlers.</p>
