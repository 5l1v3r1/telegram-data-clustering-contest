      <p>The two assists were the first points of Persson’s nine-game NHL career.</p>
      <p>The Pacific Division-leading Oilers scored three goals in the second period and received a 29-save performance from goalie Mikko Koskinen to snap a two-game losing skid. Koskinen recorded his first shutout of the season and the fifth of his NHL career.</p>
      <p>Edmonton has struggled to receive secondary scoring, and it finally received some against a Devils team that had high hopes before arriving in Alberta. New Jersey also lost 5-2 at Calgary on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Lightning 3, Sabres 2</p>
      <p>Nikita Kucherov, Alex Killorn and Yanni Gourde scored goals to help Tampa Bay beat Buffalo in the first of two meetings this weekend at the NHL Global Series in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>Andrei Vasilevskiy made 20 saves for the Lightning, who won in regulation for just the second time since Oct. 15.</p>
      <p>Sam Reinhart scored twice, and Linus Ullmark made 31 saves for Buffalo, which has lost four in a row and is 1-4-1 since an 8-1-1 start.</p>
      <p>Red Wings 4, Bruins 2</p>
      <p>Robby Fabbri scored twice on the power play in his Red Wings debut as Detroit stunned visiting Boston.</p>
      <p>Dylan Larkin and Anthony Mantha also scored, and Tyler Bertuzzi had two assists as the Red Wings snapped a four-game losing streak. Detroit entered the contest mired in a 1-11-1 funk.</p>
      <p>David Krejci and Torey Krug tallied for the Bruins, who lost a second straight in regulation for the first time this season. Jonathan Bernier stopped 26 shots for the Red Wings. Tuukka Rask made 28 saves for the Bruins.</p>
      <p>Jets 4, Canucks 1</p>
      <p>Kyle Connor had a goal and an assist as Winnipeg defeated visiting Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Jack Roslovic, Mark Scheifele and Adam Lowry also scored and goaltender Connor Hellebuyck made 32 saves as the Jets improved to 3-0-1 this month.</p>
      <p>J.T. Miller scored for the Canucks, who lost for the second consecutive night, and goalie Thatcher Demko stopped 31 of 34 shots. Vancouver had an eight-game points streak (5-0-3) snapped in a 5-2 defeat Thursday in Chicago.</p>
