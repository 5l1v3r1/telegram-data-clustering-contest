      <p>Viscountess Weymouth says she is still reliving her last Strictly dance.</p>
      <p>She and her pro partner Aljaz Skorjanec were booted off Strictly Come Dancing following a dance-off with Mike Bushell and Katya Jones.</p>
      <p>The Viscountess, 33, told the Daily Mail: “I’m very hard on myself so I keep reliving every moment of that last dance.</p>

      <p>“I torture myself about every step, every mistake. I did Strictly with my whole heart, my whole soul. I genuinely put everything into it.”</p>
      <p>The judges sparked some criticism for saving BBC sports presenter Bushell from the axe for a third time in the dance-off.</p>
      <p>But the Viscountess said: “You have to respect the judges’ decision. I can’t change it. I gave it my best shot.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I haven’t lost my marbles but I’m going to miss it massively. I’ll miss Aljaz. He was such an incredible teacher. I didn’t want to let him down.</p>
      <p>“I wish I had one more chance. I really do.”</p>
