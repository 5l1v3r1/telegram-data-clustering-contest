      <h1>DFA : Don’t use tourist visas to work abroad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:55:23+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/cristina-lee-pisco" target="_blank">Cristina Lee-Pisco</a></address>
      <h3>SEVENTY ONE distressed overseas Filipino workers (OFW), who all left the country using visit visas, have been sent back home. The 71 distressed OFWs from United Arab Emirates arrived in Manila at 8:40 a.m. today. They were accompanied by Consul General to Abu Dhabi Marford M. Angeles.</h3>
      <p>As a result, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) reiterated its warning to Filipinos seeking employment abroad against the use of tourist or visit visa to secure jobs overseas.</p>
      <p>“OFWs without the proper employment documents are more prone to abuses and exploitation abroad. The DFA has been receiving an increasing number of reports about illegal recruiters using a third or fourth country, usually where a visa is not required for Filipinos, as jump-off points,” said Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Sarah Lou Y. Arriola.</p>
      <p>The DFA, through the Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers’ Affairs, shouldered the airfare of the 71 OFWs to Manila, cost of processing of exit visas, and maintenance and operating costs of government shelters in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>
