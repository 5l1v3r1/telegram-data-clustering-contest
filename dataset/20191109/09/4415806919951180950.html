      <p>The Labour Party's annual national conference takes place today in Mullingar, Co Westmeath.</p>
      <p>With a general election on the horizon, the party will be discussing its five key policy areas - jobs, housing, health, children and climate.</p>
      <p>The conference will also see the official launch of Labour’s by-election campaign.</p>
      <p>The one-day event will also have an address by the party leader, Brendan Howlin.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to welcoming delegates from across the country to Mullingar and discussing with them our political priorities for the months ahead," said Mr Howlin ahead of the conference.</p>
      <p>He added that the conference "will discuss the detail of how Labour would build 80,000 homes and Labour’s plan to ensure good, sustainable jobs are created alongside fighting climate change.</p>
      <p>“With four by-elections at the end of the month, I will be asking party members to work with us over the next three weeks to ensure the Labour message is heard in Cork, Dublin and Wexford.</p>
      <p>"We know that there is no substantial difference between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil when it comes to national politics, and that is why I have called for unity among progressive opposition parties in the by-elections to ensure a genuine voice for change is elected in each of the four constituencies."</p>
