      <p>Cape Town - <b>Sipho Mbule</b> scored in injury time as <b>SuperSport United</b> clinched a <b>1-0</b> victory over <b>Bidvest Wits</b> in their Absa Premiership clash at Bidvest Stadium on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The first half was tense and tightly contested with neither side able to gain the edge.</p>
      <p>The first real chance of note came after seven minutes of play, with SuperSport 'keeper Ronwen Williams producing a great save to deny Gift Motupa's long-range shot.</p>
      <p>SuperSport hit back five minutes later as they threatened to snatch the lead, but the chance came to nothing as Bradley Grobler's shot rifled into the side netting.</p>
      <p>After a brief lull in play, SuperSport earned a free-kick in a dangerous position and Sipho Mbule lined up to take it. However, Mbule failed to hit it cleanly as his shot went sailing over the bar.</p>
      <p>Wits countered quickly and eventually got the ball to Motupa, but the forward's speculative effort from range was saved with ease by Williams.</p>
      <p>The hosts continued to press for the opener and went close from a set-piece situation on the half-hour mark as substitute Elias Pelembe lifted his free-kick over the wall, only for Williams to make the save.</p>
      <p>There was one last chance as the first half drew to a close, SuperSport's Luke Fleurs heading wide from a corner after breaking up an attack at the opposite end of the pitch just moments earlier.</p>
      <p>The second half took a while to get going with the match playing out at a cautious tempo.</p>
      <p>However, the pace picked up around the hour mark after Motupa made a surging run forward and forced a save from Williams.</p>
      <p>SuperSport fashioned a chance of their own in the 64th minute as Mbule tired his luck from outside the box, but his shot flew high and wide, much to the relief of the defence.</p>
      <p>The visitors continued to grow in confidence as the second half began to wind down, with Webber firing wide on the half volley on 76 minutes.</p>
      <p>And just when it seemed like the match would end in stalemate, SuperSport eventually got the breakthrough they were looking for in injury time as Mbule headed home from Aubrey Modiba's inviting cross to send the visiting fans into wild celebrations.</p>
