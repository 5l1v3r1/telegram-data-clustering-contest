      <h2>Arsenal are hoping to arrest a slide of four straight draws in all competitions in their Premier League clash with Leicester - with a defeat meaning they could go nine points adrift of the top four to pile the pressure on Unai Emery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is set to stick with the back-three formation which struggled to a draw in the Europa League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> suffered a 1-1 draw with Vitoria as Bruno Duarte bagged a 90th minute equaliser to cancel out Shkodran Mustafi's strike.</p>
      <p>Under fire Emery utilised three centre backs - Sokratis, Rob Holding and Mustafi - for the first time in Portugal, and is likely to do the same against high flying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Calum Chambers, David Luiz and Sokratis are expected to be the trio to line-up in front of Bernd Leno.</p>
      <p>They will probably have defensive width provided by Hector Bellerin, who will make his first Premier League appearance since his injury - having been left on the bench against Vitoria - and Sead Kolasinac.</p>

      <p>The Gunners have drawn their last four matches in all competitions and haven't won in the Premier League since a 1-0 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on October 6.</p>
      <p>Dani Ceballos is the only injured player after the Spain international suffered a hamstring injury in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Granit Xhaka will once again miss out as he continues to sit out following his bust up with Arsenal fans against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>But Emery is expected to name a strong XI - with Mesut Ozil keeping his place in midfield.</p>

      <p>The German is set for back-to-back Premier League starts for the first time this season, having previously been frozen out by Emery.</p>
      <p>He should provide the tip to a midfield alongside Matteo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>Up front, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will be partnered by Nicolas Pepe.</p>

      <p>If Arsenal were to lose to the Foxes they will be left nine points adrift of the top four, and Emery has branded the fixture a must-win.</p>
      <p>“This a very big opportunity. After two matches at home that we drew, tomorrow is a very good opportunity. Yesterday the players worked and trained very well with a good spirit and they give me confidence,” said Emery.</p>
      <p>“The most important is our mentality and going there thinking: ‘We are Arsenal.’ And we will go there with confidence and also strong in our mentality to be together to go to work against them.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances - Ozil, Kolasinac, the Laurent Koscielny circumstances and if he was still here then he would still be captain and there would be no problem. But the team inside now, they are strong.</p>
      <p>"Is this must-win? Yes. But in our mind, for each match it is only to win.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Arsenal likely XI: Leno; Bellerin, Chambers, Luiz, Sokratis, Kolasinac; Guendouzi, Torreira, Ozil; Pepe, Aubameyang</i>
