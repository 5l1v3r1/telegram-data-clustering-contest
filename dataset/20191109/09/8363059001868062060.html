      <h1>Let's All Feed OpenAI's Predictive Text Generator the Daftest Crap We Can</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T09:00:33+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom McKay</a></address>
      <p>This week, Elon Musk-backed OpenAI <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/turns-out-elon-musk-backed-openais-text-generator-is-more-funny-than-dangerous-for-now/">released to the public</a> the latest version of their <a href="https://talktotransformer.com/">GPT-2 predictive text generator</a>, which is capable of taking a writing prompt and continuing based on 40 gigabytes of data pulled from around eight million websites. This is impressive, next-generation technology, and I absolutely cannot stop feeding it the daftest crap imaginable and seeing what it does.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, this submission from a Twitter user, who prompted GPT-2 with a fake interview between a reporter and the Moonman, who is infuriated by the suggestion that this is his first time on Moon. GPT-2 extended the interview to the subject of Moonman’s wife (dead) before having the interviewer grill the Moonman on whether he was the one captured by the Nazis during World War 2 (haha, of course not, why do you ask???).</p>
