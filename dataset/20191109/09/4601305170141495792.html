      <p>Lisa Rein writes, "Today, Saturday November 9th is Aaron Swartz Day all over the world. We have <a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/world-cities/">events going on all over the world here</a> - with a Zoom channel and Gitters set up for questions that will be monitored from San Francisco all day (<a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/sf2019/">The San Francisco event details are here for FOIAPALOOZA</a>).</p>
      <p>Also we have a ton of projects, that folks can hack on from anywhere - even the comfort of their own home. These include SecureDrop &amp; Open Library, which Aaron co-created, and also, for journalists and researchers, <a href="https://www.aaronswartzday.org/projects-to-hack-on">we've collected all the documents from our Police Surveillance Project.</a>"</p>
