      <p>Following his outburst at the supporters after being taken off against Bournemouth, the Swiss midfielder was removed as the club captain while he has not featured in the last three games.</p>
      <p>Now according to English publication The Times, Newcastle United are considering a move for the 27-year-old once the January window opens up.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to claim that Xhaka feels that losing his spot in the side could prove detrimental to his chances of representing Switzerland at the European Championship next year.</p>
      <p>It is believed that manager Unai Emery has given the midfielder no assurance about a return to the team, and is reportedly going to ask to leave in January.</p>
      <p>Xhaka did apologise for his actions last month, but he has since been frozen out by Emery as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was announced as the club's new captain earlier this week.</p>
