      <p>While there’s always the option to delete old photos from your profile, that seems pretty final - especially if you love a bit of nostalgia from time-to-time.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there’s another option, which lets your remove photos from your profile without deleting them.</p>
      <p>This feature, known as Archive, was never officially announced by Instagram and is widely unknown.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know about archiving, including what it is and how to do it.</p>

      <p>2. Tap the three dots in the top right of the photo</p>
