      <p>The immediate effect of the new alliance is the addition of the TRX cryptocurrency to <a href="https://bitcasino.io/">Bitcasino.io</a> and <a href="https://sportsbet.io/">Sportsbet.io</a>, two of the largest <a href="https://coingaming.io/">gaming platforms for cryptocurrency</a> users and premier brand names of Coingaming Group.</p>
      <p>While merely having the ability to use TRX on such high traffic websites will bring in constant users to the TRX ecosystem, Sportsbet.io has kickstarted things by giving away 1 million TRX to the winner of Sportbet’s “Last Man Standing” Competition, whereby the lucky contestant had to successfully predict correct outcomes every day in sports, defeating others until he was the only contestant left.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of Using TRX</h3>
      <p>When players are gaming there’s nothing that kills one’s mood than wait times. Wait times for deposit processing, earnings to validate, or for withdrawals to hit users’ personal wallets.</p>
      <p>Thanks to TRX’s almost instant transaction times without fees, this makes all of these problems a thing of the past. The lower friction will ensure more business for both websites of Coingaming Group, as well as player preference to use the TRX currency over others supported by the platform.</p>
      <p>To further lower the barrier of entry for both TRX use as well as gaming on either platform, a player can get started with a minimum deposit of only 100 TRX, costing them less than 2 euros. And since there are no transaction fees to eat away at their deposit or potential earnings, it’s never been easier to access TRON, as well as play to win with it.</p>
      <p>This unique blend of zero fees and instant transactions have quickly made TRX the ultimate gaming coin of choice for many players. Tim Heath, CEO of Coingaming Group, echoed a similar sentiment to what many of the players must be feeling regarding TRON:</p>
      <blockquote>“We always work hard to put our customers at the center of the universe, and by adding TRX gaming we are once again at the cutting edge of what is possible in this space. We are particularly excited to offer a low minimum deposit threshold and zero transaction fees, ensuring<a href="https://bitcasino.io/"> Bitcasino.io</a> and<a href="https://sportsbet.io/"> Sportsbet.io</a> gaming can be enjoyed by even more players for the first time.”</blockquote>
      <h3>More TRON Native Support </h3>
      <p>Support for the currency has already spread from platforms to the games themselves. Industry-leading game providers like OneTouch, Evolution Gaming, GameArt, and Kalabmba are now offering native TRX play through BItcasino.io, with users able to play directly in TRX without any in-game currency conversions (or fees lost to said conversions)!</p>
      <p>Justin Sun, Founder of TRON, had this to say regarding the impressive feedback TRX has been receiving:</p>
      <blockquote>“One of the TRON Foundation’s core missions is to support growth by providing engaging, real-world use cases for TRX. We’ve been aware of the market-leading gaming brands operated by the Coingaming Group for some time now;<a href="https://bitcasino.io/"> Bitcasino.io</a> and<a href="https://sportsbet.io/"> Sportsbet.io</a> are fantastic examples of what is possible when crypto-led products put the customer above everything else. It is genuinely thrilling to see another world-class brand open its doors to the TRX community.”</blockquote>
      <p>It will be exciting to see what else is in store, with a quickly growing partnership between a hugely popular coin and one of the biggest names in crypto gaming. Together, they have present some of the most compelling real-world use cases for cryptocurrency. </p>
