      <h1>Kris Jenner selling mink Gucci coat with a whopping price tag on Kardashian Kloset site</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:48:36+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">New York Post</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/kardashians">Kris Jenner i</a>s spreading the wealth, continuing to offload some of her most valuable <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/style-and-beauty">designer </a>clothes and offer them up to her fans — for a price.</p>
      <p>The latest batch of clothing on her famous family’s Kardashian Kloset website includes winter staples like a mink ankle-length Gucci coat plucked from the 64-year-old matriarch’s closet and priced at a whopping $50,000.</p>
      <p>Jenner’s section of the website features numerous other fur coats, including a vintage Christian Dior fox piece that fans will recognize from the iconic black and white headshots in her home (on sale for $5,000). There’s also a Zandra Rhodes mink coat ($5,000) and a Yves Saint Laurent vintage fox one ($7,000).</p>

      <p>While Jenner is also selling items for $500 and less, some other pricey picks include a $17,000 mini Givenchy croc handbag, an all-white Alexander McQueen suit that Ariana Grande happens to also own ($2,100), a vintage beaded Calvin Klein dress ($2,500) and more.</p>
      <p>Kris isn’t the only Kardashian giving up the goods. Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Kylie have all offered up their used clothing too, from Good American bodysuits to a $1,700 Fendi diaper bag presumably used for Stormi Webster.</p>
      <p>Taking after her mom, Kylie’s even parting with an $11,000 Saint Laurent sheepskin fur coat.</p>

      <p>It seems that rabid Kardashian fans are not afraid of sticker shock; Kris Jenner has already successfully sold more than one Hermès Birkin bag for five figures.</p>
      <p>The family has a long history of auctioning off their personal items on eBay, typically with a small portion of proceeds going to charity.</p>

      <p>However, as Page Six Style previously reported, Kardashian Kloset sales don’t appear to benefit a philanthropic cause. The site’s “About” page states that the goal of Kardashian Kloset “is to share a part of the Kardashian Jenner family lifestyle by offering you the opportunity to own one of a kind items, while promoting sustainability.”</p>
      <p>A representative declined to comment on the business.</p>
