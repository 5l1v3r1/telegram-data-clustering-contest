      <p>In the corner of Devonport Park sits the Soapbox Children's Theatre. The modest brick building juts out amongst the 33 acres of green Victorian parkland and is home to <a href="https://www.stiltskin.org.uk/">Stiltskin Theatre Company.</a></p>
      <p>The unique theatre company create specialist theatre projects for children and young people.</p>
      <p>This month, in the run up to remembrance day, they have been offering an immersive learning experience on the Plymouth Blitz for local school children - which is very apt considering the theatre started life as WWII mustard gas decontamination unit.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The converted unit is now an accessible Children's Theatre<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The brick structure was built in 1941 by the MOD. The threat of mustard gas attacks during the second world war were so high that six decontamination units were built in Plymouth alone.</p>
      <p>The historic structure in Devonport Park is one of the last remaining venues of its kind in the country and certainly the only one that has been converted into a theatre for children.</p>
      <p>Thankfully mustard gas didn't really come into the equation during WWII and so the decontamination unit was never used for its original purpose.</p>
      <p>In the present day you would scarcely associate the bright and busy space with such a cause but a few stark reminders still remain of the former purification site.</p>

      <p>Sulphur Mustard or mustard gas as it was more commonly known was a chemical weapon used predominantly in WWI. In a high enough dose it can be fatal but it was mainly used to disable the enemy and pollute the battlefield.</p>
      <p>Those exposed to the oily liquid would receive huge blisters to their skin, sore eyes, vomiting and difficulty breathing.</p>
      <p>The Geneva Protocol which was signed in 1925 following the aftermath of WWI put paid to the use of lethal gas but not the stockpiling of it.</p>

        <figcaption>Stiltskin Theatre Co. have installed a temporary air raid shelter in the venue<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>WWII later saw all major combatants stockpile the chemical weapon as a deterrent, hence the construction of decontamination units and use of gas masks up and down the country.</p>
      <p>Britain stockpiled 40,179 tons of the sulphur mustard against Germany's 27,597 but thankfully it was never intentionally used in battle.</p>
      <p>As such Plymouth's seemingly last remaining decontamination unit in Devonport Park ended up being used as an allied cook house and shower block by Canadian and American servicemen who were camped out in the park during wartime.</p>
      <p>Iain Slade who runs Stiltskin Theatre Co. with wife Jacqueline explained that in its original incarnation the building would have been comprised of a series of airlocked chambers.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3520068.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_EBP_DCM_071119SOAPBOXTHEATRE_07JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>You can still see the scars where the original unit would have been separated into separate decontamination chambers<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"There would have been a wall right down the centre of the building" he says, "you can see the scar".</p>
      <p>"They would have come in and had their outer clothing taken off and then burnt, then they would have stepped through the airlock which you can still see.</p>
      <p>"They would have gone through a series of chambers getting their clothes off, then into the shower room.</p>
      <p>"Then they would have been helped to shower by nurses and then dressed in hospital gowns and taken to hospital."</p>
      <p>"The reason we know how the building was probably used is there's one in London and they actually had a poster that showed how people moved through the building," Jacqueline adds.</p>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3520073.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_EBP_DCM_071119SOAPBOXTHEATRE_13JPG.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Interestingly if you go to the side of the building you'll be able to see a small circular plaque displaying an image of a gas mask and the words 'gas 46'.</p>
      <p>It's reported that the 46 relates to the centre being number 46 of a series of plaques that were part of a history tour of Devonport in recent years.</p>
      <p>Aside from allied servicemen, the venue was also used as a shower block by the Canary Girls.</p>
      <p>"The Canary Girls were making munitions in the technical and art college down the road," Iain tells me.</p>
      <p>"They were making bombs in the basement - they would come here to shower.</p>
      <p>"They were called Canary Girls because the cordite turns your skin and pupils yellow."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cordite was one of the elements used in the ammunition making alongside TNT. The ingredients had to be mixed by hand so came into direct contact with the workers' skin.</p>
      <p>The chemicals in the TNT reacted with melanin in the skin to cause a yellow pigmentation.</p>
      <p>It wasn't just skin and pupils that were stained though, the workers' hair also turned blonde and some workers even gave birth to 'bright yellow' babies.</p>
      <p>Thankfully the colouration wore off and the babies eventually returned to their natural state.</p>
      <p>After the war the Devonport block was used as a scabies clinic.</p>
      <p>"We've had people coming in saying 'I remember being doused in purple powder,'" says Iain.</p>
      <p>"Scabies was rife in areas of malnutrition and poor sanition. A lot of the houses here wouldn't have had indoor toilets and because of the bombing in the area there would have been lot of devastation."</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.plymouthherald.co.uk/incoming/article3520056.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_EBP_DCM_071119SOAPBOXTHEATRE_01JPG.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The inside is currently set up like a WWII kitchen - the same time period as when the building was originally constructed<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It then became a football changing room for a while until a demolition order by Devon County Council almost saw it destroyed.</p>
      <p>Iain explains how the council sent down their demolition crew in the 1980s but due to a clerical error the nearby Victorian tennis court pavilion was knocked down instead.</p>
      <p>Bad news for tennis fans but amazing news for our local heritage.</p>
      <p>The Devonport Park premises is now one of the few remaining physical reminders of the mustard gas precautions put in place during the war.</p>
      <p>According to Jacqueline there used to be several more units scattered around the city but they have been lost over time:</p>
      <p>"I know that there was definitely one at St Budeaux. I think there was one at Cattedown too, so they would have been in all the different areas."</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The gas mask plaque on the wall is one of the few distinguishing features that hark back to its days as a decontamination unit<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Aside from a brief stint as a model railway headquarters, the fascinating building was left mostly derelict until Stiltskin Theatre came along and saw it being advertised as a storage unit.</p>
      <p>They've had three crowd funders to help turn it into the bright and thriving local hub that it is today.</p>
      <p>The duo who have been working together for almost 20 years say that the history of Plymouth has been really important in their work and their storytelling.</p>
      <p>"We've always worked on educational projects and we're storytellers so this is one of those stories," explains Jacqueline in her WWII costume.</p>
      <p>"This wartime piece is a nod at the building really - to say this still exists, this is the reason why and then bulking it out."</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>It's fair to say that the educational experience, set inside a wartime relic has gone down very well with all the staff and children that have visited.</p>
      <p>"Plymouth in the Blitz is such an important part of our history and as we move forward in time, WWII will eventually become a period of time that is beyond living memory so it is vital that future generations have a rich knowledge and understanding of this era so that they can continue to share important messages in the future," wrote a representative from one of the visiting schools.</p>
      <p>"Our inspiring visit has most certainly helped us to teach our young children about Plymouth's history. The whole environment was extremely well researched and prepared so that our children really felt as though they were a child in Plymouth at that time."</p>

        <figcaption>From the welcoming cafe and foyer you would never know what the original intention for the structure was<cite>(Image: Erin Black/Plymouth Live)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Stiltskin are hoping to put together a performance in the future based on the rich past that the building has lived through over the past 70+ years.</p>
      <p>Until then, you can see the construction for yourself still standing against all odds in the Exmouth Road corner of the park.</p>
      <p>And if you do go inside to participate in any of the other events on, make sure you say hello to Trudy who makes a lovely cup of tea.</p>
