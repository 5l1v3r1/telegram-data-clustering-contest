      <h1>Video: Tyson Fury trains MMA with UFC’s Darren Till, catches Dana White’s attention</h1>

      <p>Lineal boxing heavyweight champion Tyson Fury is serious about crossing over to MMA, as video has surfaced of him training with former UFC welterweight title challenger, Darren Till.</p>
      <p>Last month, Fury hinted at an MMA move when he revealed former two division champ Conor McGregor had <a href="https://twitter.com/thenotoriousmma/status/1188535815590305792?s=21">offered to train him</a>, however “The Gypsy King” has now <a href="https://twitter.com/btsportufc/status/1192494905005936640">revealed he will be training with Till</a> in the hopes of kicking off his MMA career.</p>
      <p>“Good news everybody, I’m going to go training with Darren Till this weekend,” Fury said. “We are going to smash it, and he’s going to get me started on my MMA career.”</p>
      <p>Both Fury and Till share the same management team, MTK Global. Fury posted a picture to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4phkU9Jcxv/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a> account on Saturday showing him and Till in the cage at a gym in Liverpool. UFC heavyweight Francis Ngannou recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyson_Fury/status/1192220550443274240?s=20">called out Fury for a fight in boxing</a>, but he was keen on saving the fight for when he gets started in MMA and is done with his boxing career.</p>

      <p>And here’s video of Fury firing off knees and elbows. Dana White certainly took notice on Instagram, <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Dana-White-Doesnt-Think-it-Would-Go-Well-if-Tyson-Fury-Transitioned-to-MMA-165343">and he doesn’t think much of Fury’s plans</a>.</p>

      <p>Fury, 31, is currently undefeated in boxing and is set to rematch Deontay Wilder at some point next year. The two fought to a draw in their first fight in December 2018. Since then Fury has won fights against Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin.</p>
