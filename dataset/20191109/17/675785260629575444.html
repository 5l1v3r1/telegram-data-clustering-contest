      <h2>The Royal Family's job is to remind us what is best about ourselves, how utterly brilliant and brave some are, and to pay tribute - and at last they’ve shown us a bit of ­traditional style</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:48:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Anne Diamond, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/anne-diamond/</a></address>
      <p>Now that is what the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">royals</a> are for. And it took this special time of year, as we wear our poppies with pride, to remind them – and us.</p>
      <p>I have a son in the Army right now, and I will be at a Remembrance service as you read your paper on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>I have never felt so proud, nor so scared, nor so ­worried about where our world is ­heading – with persistent ­conflict, ­terrorism and threat.</p>
      <p>But after all of the stupid ­bickering and headline trading that’s been going on within the Royal Family for the past few months – and yes, even they confirmed there were clashes between brothers we all believed were joined at the hip – at last they’ve shown us a bit of ­traditional style.</p>

      <p>This week, the Sussexes and the Cambridges were out bowing their heads to the ­ordinary men and women who are, or who ­represent, true heroes.</p>
      <p>And that’s how it should be. They do not live in palaces and castles to lord it over us, they are there to embody what is best about us as a country, as a human community.</p>
      <p>Their job is to remind us what is best about ourselves, how utterly brilliant and brave some are, and to pay tribute.</p>

      <p>This week, they did that job ­really well. It’s been a long time coming. The last few months of “William and Kate this versus Harry and Meghan that” has been ­nauseating, ­destructive and disrespectful.</p>
      <p>And I can’t help thinking how their mum would feel. Diana would, I think, bang their heads together.</p>
      <p>But how brilliant to see Meghan crouching on her knees to go eye to eye with a true British war widow, pictured below.</p>
      <p>She got on her haunches to talk to 96-year-old Elizabeth Herschel, in a wheelchair and proudly wearing her medals.</p>

      <p>And don’t you just love the devil may care attitude that comes with age?</p>
      <p>Mrs Herschel gave Harry some personal advice. “I told him you can’t pick your family but you can pick your friends, and he said, ‘I will remember that’.”</p>
      <p>Prince Harry, wearing full ­ceremonial uniform, ­acknowledged her words and saluted.</p>
      <p>He and Meghan bowed their heads as they planted tiny crosses at the Westminster Abbey Field of Remembrance to pay their respects to ­servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile the Cambridges helped launch the National Emergencies Trust, a new ­independent charity that will specialise in a better resourced and more ­efficient response to disasters like 7/7 and Grenfell.</p>
      <p>All of the royal fashionistas ­twittered about both duchesses’ couture choices.</p>
      <p>Each wore solemn blue and looked ­“demure, slim and stylish”.</p>
      <p>I thought Meghan and Kate were pretty understated. You could even say boring.</p>
      <p>Fan-bloody-tastic! Because the most important thing was that they smiled, they made eye contact with the people who mattered, and they bowed to them.</p>
      <p>Do you think the Queen has had a word?</p>
      <p>I think so.</p>
