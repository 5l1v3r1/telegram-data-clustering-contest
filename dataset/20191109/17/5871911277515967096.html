      <h1>North Dakota Makes Statement in Thumping Miami</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:59:27+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/goon48/" target="_blank">Eric J. Burton</a></address>
      <p>On Friday night, the University of North Dakota spanked Miami University in impressive fashion, 7-1. The game was over by the middle of the second period. With the win, UND improves to 6-1-1 (.813).</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s early and we shouldn’t <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=out%20over%20our%20skis">get out over our skis</a>. With that said, I don’t see this team finishing in the bottom half of the NCHC.</p>
      <p>So far this season, the Hawks have been an improved hockey team. I will break down a couple of things that have caught my attention early on. For the most part, they’re playing 60-minute games. Even when the game wasn’t in question anymore, they kept competing and trying to add to their 7-1 lead.</p>

      <h3>Protect Home Ice</h3>
      <p>During one of the season’s first hockey press conferences, junior defenseman Gabe Bast said something that caught my attention.</p>
      <p>“Like Schmidty (Cole Smith) said a couple of weeks ago, it was a salty offseason,” Bast said. “This year, we’re really trying to establish a swagger to our group and play with confidence every night and just believe in ourselves that we can get the job done.”</p>
      <p>So far, this season, the Hawks players have embraced that philosophy. Through six games, Ralph Engelstad Arena has been a tough place to play. With the 7-1 win, UND has won eight straight games at home dating back to last season.</p>
      <p>“I think it starts with the fan base,” junior defenseman Matt Kiersted said. “They’re, unbelievable and it’s so much fun playing at the Ralph. You’ve got have 10 and a half thousand (fans) a night. That’s a great atmosphere. They’re all engaged, and it really kind of feeds into our energy. So, that’s really important is that because that crowd and that kind of gives us like I said that energy does keep winning, and keep playing the right way.”</p>
      <p>In listening to the players and head coach Brad Berry during the press conferences, it sounds like it was a tough summer. I’ve also heard that coach Berry challenged a few of the players to work harder in the offseason. It also sounds like there was a lot of self-reflection in the offseason. From the early season results, it appears that this approach has worked.</p>
      <p>“I’ve worked hard this summer,” <a href="https://insidehockey.com/north-dakota-blasts-miami-7-1/">sophomore defenseman Jonny Tychonic said</a>. “I’m trying to lead it to pay off is the type of thing that I’m looking at. I’m trying to do everything that I can the right way. I’ve been doing lots of video with the coaches and they’ve really helped me kind of develop this year.”</p>
