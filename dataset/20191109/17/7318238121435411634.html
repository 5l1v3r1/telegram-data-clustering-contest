      <p>The Berlin Wall fell again — but this time it was made entirely of chocolate.</p>
      <p>French chocolate maker Patrick Roger built a chocolate bar in Paris to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the real wall.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, he removed the creation in front of one of his shops and distributed parts to people who came to see.</p>
      <p>"It's amazing, 200 kilograms of chocolate went in a few minutes," he said. "It's amazing to share taste, values ​​and certain winds of freedom because we all need them at these times. I even have goosebumps as I'm talking about them."</p>
