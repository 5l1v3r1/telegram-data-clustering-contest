      <p>President Donald Trump plans to attend the LSU-Alabama football game Saturday afternoon, an event coincidentally occurring on the last day of early voting in the Louisiana gubernatorial election runoff.</p>
      <p>Trump is stumping aggressively for Republican Eddie Rispone, trying to give him an edge over incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D-LA). Trump wants a Republican victory all the more after Gov. Matt Bevin (R-KY) <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/stivers-republican-kentucky-delegitimizing-election-beshear-bevin">apparently</a> fell to his Democratic challenger despite Trumpâ€™s best efforts.</p>
      <p>Trump already held a <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/kentucky-louisiana-elections-2019-trump">rally</a> in Monroe, Louisiana earlier this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/louisiana/">According to the most recent polling,</a> the race is extremely close, with Edwards having a slight lead. Edwards has successfully navigated the deep redness of the state by holding conservative views on abortion and gun rights intermixed with more traditional Democratic positions.</p>
