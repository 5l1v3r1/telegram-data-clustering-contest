      <p>Fletcher's is currently the best-rated restaurant in the city according to Trip Advisor.</p>
      <p>Having only opened in 2018, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/plymouth-new-top-rated-restaurant-3500963">the fine dining restaurant is now currently ranked in first place</a> out of 470 establishments on the review site.</p>
      <p>Formerly Chloe's restaurant, 24-year-old Fletcher Andrews took over the lease last November and runs the business as sous chef, along with his fiancée Jess Harkom whose role is front of house. Fletcher's co-shareholders also include his sister Tolon Andrews and her boyfriend George Roberts.</p>
      <p>And Plymouth seems to love it.</p>
      <p>With this in mind, it seemed only right that we took a visit to Fletcher's ourselves to find out why it has earned such good reviews.</p>
      <p>Situated in Princess Street, the restaurant offers an a la carte menu in the evenings, along with a pre-theatre and lunch time set menu.</p>
      <p>Heading down in the middle of the day, we were excited to try the set menu, served from midday - 2pm every day.</p>
      <p>What struck me almost instantly was the chilled atmosphere and charming decor with no fewer than 22 lamps decorating the ceilings throughout.</p>
      <p>Each table was complete with a small bunch of flowers and calming acoustic music played throughout our meal in the background, making the venue an instant romantic spot for a date night.</p>
      <p>For starters we chose the roasted artichoke and Parmesan soup alongside a black pudding scotch egg, served with burnt apple, honey and mustard with fresh apple.</p>

      <p>I can't say I have ever tasted artichoke soup before so I decided to give it a go, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. It had lovely flavours and was extremely filling, I almost think I would have been satisfied with the one course for the rest of the afternoon.!</p>
      <p>I didn't try the black pudding scotch egg myself, but my colleague said it was also very tasty, and one of the best she had ever had. A good sign.</p>
      <p>For main course, we went with beer battered fish and triple cooked chips, which was served with mushy peas, tartar sauce and pickled onion.</p>
      <p>As someone who rarely eats fish, again I decided to go for something different. The presentation was lovely.</p>
      <p>Served with lemon, the tartar sauce comes in a little jar which I thought was a sweet touch.</p>

        <figcaption>The fish and chips was so yummy!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The fish batter was so light and nothing like the grease pool you can be met with at traditional fish and chips shops. I would even go as far to say it was one of the best fish and chip dishes I have had - my only negative was that I was too full to finish the plate!</p>
      <p>Always room to squash in some dessert though, and this time we tried raspberry sorbet - again beautifully presented - so no complaints here as it rounded off our meal perfectly.</p>
      <p>I managed to grab Fletcher and Jess for a chat, who, despite their successes at such a young age, are an extremely down-to-earth and friendly couple.</p>
      <p>Before Fletch opened his own establishment he worked at the New Continental Hotel under executive chef Ryan Marsland and head chef Paul Doidge, and was also head chef at the Treby Arms.</p>

        <figcaption>The sorbet dessert was gorgeous</figcaption>

      <p>"At one point I was looking to move away to pursue my career elsewhere focusing on fine dining, but I love Plymouth, it's my home and all my family are here. So that's why I decided to open Fletcher's here in Plymouth," he said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone said it was really risky in the first instance, but I thought, 'Well, I haven't got a lot to lose if it doesn't work out..' apart from our little house! But it seems to be paying off, thankfully!"</p>
      <p>The team at Fletcher's are always incredibly busy, with Jess training to be a solicitor five days a week, and then managing the front of house in the evenings.</p>
      <p>Jess said: "When it's your own thing you love it so much and you don't mind putting everything into it.</p>
      <p>"I'll work all day and night and then I'll be up at like 1am on websites at home, and Fletch will be doing menus at all hours too, even in his breaks he doesn't stop."</p>
      <p>Fletcher also likes to update what's on offer, and let us in the know that there will be a few menu changes coming soon, as well as a Christmas menu.</p>
      <p>I asked him what it is about his restaurant that has so many people singing its praises.</p>
      <p>He explained: "We have four people in the kitchen at present. There's myself and then a sous chef, he's worked in a lot of restaurants around Plymouth too and then we have two apprentices.</p>
      <p>But as much as people like to come for the food, it isn't just about that, my front of house team are amazing. My fiancé, sister and her boyfriend all help massively to make the place what it is.</p>

      <p>"At the weekends my mum helps out with the pot washing when we are busy and dad also help us behind the scenes. My brother was working here at one point too; they've all got my best interests at heart and I'm very lucky."</p>
      <p>"There are also some front of house staff who aren't family but they are amazing, we are like a big family really," he added.  </p>
      <p>Fletcher and Jess even have customers coming in weekly to see them.</p>
      <p>"I've had people coming in where even if they've gone for food elsewhere, they'll come here after for a drink or just to see us," Jess said.</p>
      <p>"It's so lovely and it really makes your night, of course I enjoy it here anyway but it's very special when people come back over and over again." </p>
      <h3>So what's next for Fletcher's?</h3>
      <p>"We'd like to redesign the inside of the restaurant soon," Fletcher said. "Updating all the tables and decor would be great, and we also want to put in a seating area so that we can welcome guests who just want to come in for a drink.</p>

        <figcaption>The restaurant has a warm and inviting feel</figcaption>

      <p>"For new year, we are hosting a pre-booked event in which guests will get to sample a taster menu based on Mayflower 400. We're going to get a harpist to come in to play on that evening too. It should be a good night."</p>
      <p>After experiencing the tasty food, friendly service, and chilled environment for myself, it is not hard to see why Fletcher's is building the great reputation it already has.</p>
      <p>My only complaint was that I was full <i>way</i> too quickly!</p>
