      <h1>Huge Greta Thunberg mural going up in San Francisco</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T17:29:30+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>A large mural of environmental activist Greta Thunberg is being painted in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>The mural, which features the Swedish teenager staring forward with an expressionless face, is set to be completed on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/us/greta-thunberg-mural-san-francisco-trnd/index.html">according</a> to CNN.</p>
      <p>The mural is located in the downtown part of the city near Union Square and is being painted by artist Andrés Petreselli. Petreselli is known for painting another mural in the city, one of late comedian Robin Williams, which is how executive director of OneAtmosphere.org Paul Scott discovered the artist.</p>
      <p>Scott said that the purpose of the mural is to raise awareness about the issue of climate change and its impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>“If we can amplify her message and get more people involved and listening to what she's saying, then we're doing some good,” Paul said.</p>
      <p>Paul said that the reaction to the massive painting has been largely positive and that it has given allowed passersby an opportunity to find out more about Thunberg’s activism.</p>
      <p>“They're struck by the image and want to learn more,” he said. “If they take the time to learn more about what she's trying to share, that I think has an impact on most people. Makes them want to help.”</p>
      <p>Petreselli said he is doing the painting for free and hopes it amplifies her message.</p>
      <p>“We're pretty much at the beginning of our extinction, so if we don't do anything right now, it's going to be too late,” Petreselli said.</p>

      <p>In September, an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-thunberg-has-a-bright-and-wonderful-future">impassioned speech</a> that Thunberg delivered before the United Nations about climate change went viral.</p>
      <p>“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” she said. “Entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!”</p>
      <p>Thunberg is known for founding an international movement called Fridays for Future, which encourages students to skip school on Fridays to protest climate change. While in the United States, she also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/democrats-invite-teen-climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-to-testify-before-congress">appeared before</a> the House Ways and Means Committee to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>Instead of flying from Europe to the U.S., Thunberg undertook a much-publicized journey across the Atlantic Ocean in a solar-powered boat that was emission-free.</p>
