      <p>Forecasters said Sunday would be predominantly dry, sunny and cold with a few light showers in the east.</p>
      <p>However a yellow severe weather warning for icy patches forming on roads, pavements and cycle paths has been issued overnight for the eastern part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a>.</p>
      <p>The lowest temperature of the autumn thus far, -7C, was recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire.</p>
      <p>Southern and western England bore the brunt of the persistent rain on Saturday with sunshine in the north and east.</p>
      <p>Met Office meteorologist Sophie Yeomans said there were potentially difficult driving conditions in areas affected by the showers.</p>
      <p>The first snowfall of the season was also recorded on Saturday in Wales and in Shropshire. Yeomans added: “It was quite a dusting in a few places.”</p>
      <p>Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the areas worst affected by the heavy downpours on Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p>Train operator Northern has advised passengers not to travel on some routes, including between Sheffield and Doncaster, Sheffield and Goole, and Doncaster and Scunthorpe.</p>
