        <b>Absa Premiership</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Polokwane City 1-0 Baroka FC</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Peter Mokaba Stadium</p>
      <p>Baroka FC claimed the bragging rights in the Limpopo derby after claiming a 1-0 win over struggling Polokwane City on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The visitors were eager to build on their 0-0 draw with Mamelodi Sundowns earlier this week, while Polokwane were without a permanent head coach following the departure of Zlatko KrmpotiÄ‡.</p>
      <p>Prince Nxumalo kept his spot in the Baroka side after making his debut on Wednesday against Sundowns, while Ntswane came into the defence after Matome Kgoetyane was sent off in the stalemate.</p>
      <p>Nxumalo got off to the perfect start as the former Ajax Cape Town forward broke the deadlock for Baroka after just six minutes with his first goal for the club.</p>
      <p>Rise and Shine were finding it tough to break down the Baroka defence in the first half as the likes of Charlton Mashumba, who bagged a hat-trick midweek, was unable to get any joy in the final third.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Rise and Shine, it was more the same in the second stanza and even with the introduction of Walter Musona on the hour mark, goals were hard to come by.</p>
      <p>Baroka, for the second game in a row, put in a solid defensive showing to keep their provincial rivals at at bay to secure a crucial victory to end their six-game winless run across all competitions.</p>
      <p>As a result, Baroka moved up to 11th position with their third league win while Polokwane remain in 10th, although they are only out ofthe top eight due to an inferior goal difference to Maritzburg United.</p>
