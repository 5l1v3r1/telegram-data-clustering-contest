      <p>Greek police said on Saturday that they had arrested three people and seized an arms cache in an ongoing anti-terrorist operation officials likened to high profile arrests of Revolutionary Struggle group members in 2010.</p>
      <p>Police said two men - a 41 and a 45-year-old - and a 39-year-old woman, allegedly implicated in terrorism, were arrested during a "wide operation" launched in Athens on Friday. They added that a 46-year-old man remained at large.</p>
      <p>During the raids on 13 houses, a Greek anti-terrorist squad seized weapons, including five AK-47 automatic rifles, detonators, dynamite and grenades.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old man arrested was also detained in 2010, accused of being a member of far-left group Revolutionary Struggle (EA), behind a series of "anti-capitalist" attacks.</p>
      <p>The Citizen Protection Ministry said one of the assault rifles found during the raids was used in an October robbery at a betting shop in the northern suburb of Cholargos.</p>
      <p>Another AK-47 was used in multiple attacks carried out by the "Organisation of Revolutionary Self-Defence" group against PASOK socialist party headquarters in Athens, as well as against the Mexican embassy in Athens in 2016.</p>
      <p>The group also claimed responsibility for a grenade attack on the French Embassy in Athens in 2016.</p>
      <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis hailed the operation as "a very big success".</p>
      <p>"Let me repeat, for one more time, our commitment to put a definitive and irreversible end to the problem of domestic terrorism", he added.</p>
      <p>A top police official told AFP the operation could be compared to the arrests in 2010 of Revolutionary Struggle leaders Paula Roupa and Nikos Maziotis.</p>
      <p>Their group, which first emerged in 2003, was once deemed by authorities to be the country's most dangerous far-left organisation.</p>
      <p>The United States put a bounty on the group after it fired a rocket at the US embassy in Athens in 2007, though nobody was injured.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the group also exploded a booby-trapped car outside a Bank of Greece office in central Athens as the country prepared to make a highly symbolic debt sale. Again, no-one was hurt.</p>
