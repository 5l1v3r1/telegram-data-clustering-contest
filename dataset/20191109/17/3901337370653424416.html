      <p>Amakhosi coach Ernst Middendorp brought the regulars back into line-up, that included goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi and the attacking trio of Khama Billiat, Leonardo Castro and Lebohang Manyama. Meanwhile, Pirates made three changes from their midweek draw with Maritzburg United, as Thembinkosi Lorch returned, while Paseka Mako and Xolani Mlambo got starts.</p>
      <p>Chiefs took the lead with 45 seconds played after a lack of communication at the back between the defence and goalkeeper Wayne Sandilands led to Ntsikelelo Nyauza nodding into his own net.</p>
      <p>Rhulani Mokwena's charges nearly replied instantly, as Fortune Makaringe hit the post with a strike from just outside the box that left Akpeyi with no chance.</p>
      <p>However, Middendorp's men continued to dominate and eventually doubled their lead in the 28th minute after Castro found the bottom corner with a free header inside the box from George Maluleka's corner.</p>
      <p>Pirates pulled a goal back with six minutes remaining of the first stanza after Vincent Pule curled home a delightful free-kick from an tight angle Akpeyi at the top of his near post to give the Buccaneers some hope.</p>
      <p>The Buccanners were knocking on the door after the break, hitting the woodwork twice through Lorch and Pule but Mhango eventually levelled matters on the hour-mark with a curling strike towards the bottom corner after cutting inside from the left.</p>
      <p>Middendorp made a tactical change with 18 minutes, bringing on Bernard Parker in place of Frosler, while Mokwena needed fresh legs in attack, as Justin Shonga came on Pule.</p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Amakhosi change brought positive impact in the last five minutes after Parker was brought down inside the box by Mako and they were awarded a penalty that was converted by Daniel Cardoso to restore Chiefs' lead.</p>
      <p>There was controversy in the last minute of the match, after Chiefs were reduced to ten men after Erick Mathoho was red-carded for a push on Abel Mabaso in a scuffle from both set of players.</p>
      <p>Tshegofatso Mabaso had a glorius chance to equalise for Buccanners in stoppage time after being teed up in the centre of the box but his shot was saved by Akpeyi as Chiefs held on to claim three points.</p>
      <p>
