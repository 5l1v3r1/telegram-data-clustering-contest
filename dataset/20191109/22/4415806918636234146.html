      <p>Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick, including two stunning free-kicks, as Barcelona saw off Celta Vigo 4-1 at the Nou Camp to regain top spot in LaLiga.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid had earlier kept the pressure on their rivals with a convincing 4-0 win at Eibar.</p>
      <p>Messi set Barca on their way with a penalty, but Lucas Olaza equalised with a fine free-kick for Celta’s first goal under new boss Oscar Garcia.</p>

      <p>The Barcelona number 10, though, soon had his side back in front just before half-time when he crashed home another superb deadball strike.</p>
      <p>Messi completed his treble early in the second half, clipping the ball up and over the wall from 25 yards, and Sergio Busquets crashed in a late fourth.</p>
      <p>Barcelona are level on 25 points with Real Madrid, top on goal difference, while Real Sociedad are now two behind following their draw against Leganes on Friday.</p>

      <p>Celta had been able to limit Barcelona’s attacking intent during the opening exchanges, with Messi seeing a low shot comfortably saved by Ruben Blanco.</p>
      <p>The home side were awarded a penalty in the 20th minute for a handball by Joseph Aidoo. Messi made no mistake from the spot, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way.</p>
      <p>Barca, though, had been forced into a change before the kick could be taken as Nelson Semedo limped off with a calf injury, replaced by Sergio Busquets.</p>

      <p>Messi thought he had scored again from Arthur’s cutback, but the ball had run out of play in the build-up.</p>
      <p>The Argentine forward then tracked back to concede a free-kick just outside the Barcelona penalty area in the 42nd minute.</p>
      <p>Celta left-back Lucas Olaza stepped up to curl a wonderful effort over the wall and into the right side of the goal.</p>
      <p>There was, though, still time for Barcelona to regain the lead before half-time.</p>

      <p>Arthur was fouled some 25 yards out – and Messi promptly lashed the free-kick into the top corner.</p>
      <p>Barca boss Ernesto Valverde sent on Ousmane Dembele to replace Ansu Fati for the start of the second half.</p>
      <p>The French forward was soon in the action, lashing a low drive which was just off target.</p>

      <p>Celta conceded another free-kick in a dangerous position just outside their own penalty area three minutes into the second half.</p>
      <p>Messi needed no second invitation as clipped a left-foot shot up over the wall once again, which flew past Blanco and into the top corner to complete his hat-trick – matching the record of Cristiano Ronaldo of 34 in LaLiga.</p>
      <p>Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen had to be alert when tested by a long-range effort from Celta winger Pione Sisto.</p>

      <p>At the other end, Antoine Griezmann was played clear by Messi, but Blanco was out quickly to make a smart save.</p>
      <p>Luis Suarez replaced the France forward for the closing 18 minutes.</p>
      <p>Defender Busquets produced a fine strike of his own with five minutes left, lashing home an angled drive from 20 yards.</p>
