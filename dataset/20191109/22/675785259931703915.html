      <h1>Man City boss Pep Guardiola dismisses Liverpool favourites tag ahead of Anfield clash</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool can go nine points clear of Manchester City with victory at Anfield but Pep Guardiola insists the title won't be over</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>A defiant Pep Guardiola has warned Jurgen Klopp that he is not going to Anfield as an underdog.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss ­refuses to accept that the ­champions will be handing over the title to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> after already falling six points behind Klopp’s men at the top of the ­Premier League.</p>
      <p>City’s team has been ravaged by injuries – with goalkeeper Ederson the latest player to join a casualty list that includes David Silva and long-term absentees Leroy Sane and Aymeric Laporte.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is aware of the size of his task at a ground where City have won just twice in the last 63 years.</p>
      <p>But the Catalan has declared his intention to go to Merseyside to win and blow the title race wide open.</p>

      <p>Guardiola said: “I’ve never gone into a game feeling like an ­outsider and feeling like I’m not going to win.</p>
      <p>“Of course, Liverpool are in a position six points ahead and they are playing ­fantastic all season.</p>
      <p>“We also have many problems in some ­departments.</p>
      <p>“But I’m not going to take the bus to Anfield on Sunday thinking I’m going to lose the game.</p>
      <p>“That has never ­happened in my career. I have always had the feeling that if we do the special things we plan to do, then we will have our chance to win.</p>
      <p>“People keep talking about what will happen if we lose. But what if we win?”</p>

      <p>Guardiola’s four trips to Anfield brought three defeats before a goalless draw last season.</p>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez squandered the chance to blow away the Blues’ bogey when he missed a last-­minute penalty.</p>
      <p>But the result still provided the solitary point that was to prove decisive for City in their bid to retain the title.</p>
      <p>Yet City’s struggles at Liverpool run deep. Their only Premier League win was back in 2003 – and Kevin Keegan is the only man still alive to have managed the Blues to victory there.</p>
      <p>Guardiola admits he is at a loss to explain why Anfield has become such a graveyard for City. He said: No, I cannot ­explain it. I can explain my period here, when we have played there.</p>
      <p>“Last season, in the last ­minute, we could have won but we missed a penalty.</p>

      <p>“Sometimes it happens. It shows how difficult it is. It is not easy to go to Camp Nou or ­Madrid or Bayern Munich or the biggest stages to win away.</p>
      <p>“I will try to tell the players what they have to do to win the game in terms of the ­mental approach and tactical ­decisions. Maybe it happens this time and it is done.”</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: “To win these kind of games you have to be at the top level.</p>
      <p>“We can’t be half and half ­because the way Liverpool play demands incredible attention in all the details for 95 minutes.</p>
      <p>“The only chance we have is if we play well and create chances.</p>
      <p>“Not just at Anfield, but all the big stadiums around the world.”</p>
