      <h1>Man Utd enter race for £50m Andre Onana despite David de Gea new deal</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Red Devils made De Gea one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League in September</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are shock contenders to sign Ajax’s £50million-rated keeper Andre Onana – just two months after handing David De Gea a new £350,000-a-week contract.</p>
      <p>Ajax have slapped a huge asking price on the Cameroon international after United joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and Paris Saint-Germain in asking to be kept informed of any plans to sell the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>Spurs have lost skipper Hugo Lloris for the season with a dislocated elbow.</p>
      <p>But United made De Gea one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League in September after spending the last 12 months desperately trying to convince the Spaniard to sign a new four-year deal.</p>

      <p>Onana has become one of Ajax’s most prized assets after helping the Amsterdam giants win a Dutch league and cup double last season.</p>
      <p>The Cameroon international also helped Erik ten Hag's side to the semi-finals of the Champions League, beating the likes of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> before their exit to Spurs.</p>
      <p>He joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> at the age of 13 after impressing at Samuel Eto’s soccer school.</p>
      <p>He moved to Holland in the summer of 2015 but has recently spoken of his ambition to play in England.</p>

      <p>United’s interest has shocked officials at Ajax, where former United keeper Edwin van der Sar is chief executive.</p>
      <p>Onana is under contract at the Amsterdam Arena until June 2022 after extending his current deal with the Eredivisie club at the end of March.</p>
      <p>However, despite his claims he is happy at the Dutch giants, the 23-year-old recently admitted he would be interested in a move to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Speaking after Ajax's 4-4 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in the Champions League on Tuesday, Onana told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47746581">BBC Sport</a> : "There's good competition and everyone wants to play here but to play you need to get a chance.</p>
      <p>"The Premier League is not for everybody so we will see. Now, I am with Ajax and I am happy to be the first-choice goalkeeper."</p>
      <p>He added: "It's always important for me to move on. I am not going to stay here forever but now I am focused, so let's keep it this way."</p>
