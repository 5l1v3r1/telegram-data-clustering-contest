      <p>SINGAPORE: A 37-year-old man was arrested earlier this week for his suspected involvement in two hit-and-run accidents that prompted a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/two-hit-and-run-geylang-police-searching-information-man-12076786">manhunt for the suspect</a>. </p>
      <p>On Saturday (Nov 9), he was charged with drug trafficking. </p>

      <p>The Singapore Police Force and Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) in a joint news release said the police were alerted to the accidents on Wednesday morning. </p>
      <p>Investigations showed that the car involved first hit a taxi along Geylang Bahru Road towards Bendemeer Road and later crashed into a parked car near Block 22 St George's Road. </p>
      <p>After the second accident, the driver abandoned the car and fled. </p>
      <p>The authorities issued an alert that night saying they were searching for a man, whose picture they provided, in connection with the two accidents. </p>
      <p>Officers from the Central Police Division and CNB eventually identified the suspect through ground enquiries and CCTV footage, and arrested him along Sing Joo Walk on Friday. </p>
      <p>Suspected controlled drugs were found on him as well as during a subsequent search of a residential unit along Sing Joo Walk. </p>
      <p>Police and CNB said the man suffered a fit during the arrest and was taken to Changi General Hospital, where his condition stabilised. </p>
      <p>He was charged at the hospital on Saturday with trafficking in Class A controlled drugs. </p>
      <p>Investigations are ongoing. </p>
