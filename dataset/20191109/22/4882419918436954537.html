      <h1>Right-back problems? Sergi Roberto suspended against Leganes</h1>
      <h2>Sergi Roberto is banned after picking up his fifth booking of the season</h2>

      <p>Sergi Roberto collected his fifth yellow card of the season on Saturday when he was booked in Barcelona's 4-1 win over Celta Vigo at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>The right-back was booked in the 52nd minute of the match after a foul on Junca and will be banned for the game at Butarque against Leganes after the international break.</p>
      <p>Roberto had started the game in midfield but moved to right-back when Nelson Semedo was forced off with a calf problem. If the Portugal defender is out for any length of time, Bar√ßa could have a problem in two weeks.</p>
      <p>Luckily for coach Ernesto Valverde, he does have a third right-back in the first team squad: Moussa Wague. The young Senegal international could finally get his first chance this season.</p>
