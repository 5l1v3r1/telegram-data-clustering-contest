      <p>Martin Bashir and a group of Love Islanders have been axed from X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The journalist has been competing on the ITV show, judged by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger.</p>
      <p>But the broadcaster, famous for his interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, lost the public vote following his performance of Frank Sinatra’s That’s Life.</p>

      <p>“It’s been a spectacular experience. I’m 57 in January. I would have never tried something like this,” he said afterwards.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, Bashir survived the axe despite forgetting the words to his song.</p>

      <p>This weekend he appeared to accidentally hit presenter Dermot O’Leary in the face while reaching over to hug Scherzinger.</p>
      <p>Island group No Love Lost also had to go following a sing-off with V5, a girl band made up of social media influencers.</p>
      <p>Walsh and Scherzinger opted to save V5.</p>
      <p>But Love Island star Eyal Booker told O’Leary: “This is just the start for us. You’re going to be seeing a lot more of us.”</p>

      <p>And bandmate Samira Mighty said: “This experience has been absolutely amazing, from the villa and now on stage in front of Simon Cowell. We’re not going to stop.”</p>
      <p>Cowell later told the group there was a chance they could be back in the final saying he had made a last-minute decision that “whoever is the most popular loser (will go) into the final”.</p>

      <p>The night also saw performances from footballer turned actor Vinnie Jones, reality TV star Megan McKenna and professional quizzer Jenny Ryan.</p>
      <p>Walsh told McKenna: “You tick all the boxes” following her performance on the ITV show.</p>
