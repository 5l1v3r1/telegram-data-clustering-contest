      <h1>Probe of Boris Johnson's relationship with US woman shelved until after election</h1>
      <h2>The independent police watchdog has delayed its announcement on whether Boris Johnson should face an investigation over his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:41:49+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Perry, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/keith-perry/</a></address>
      <p>Fury has erupted after it emerged a police inquiry into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson's</a> friendship with Jennifer Arcuri will be shelved until after the general election.</p>
      <p>The independent police watchdog has delayed its announcement on whether the Prime Minister should face an investigation into possible criminal misconduct until after a new Government is voted in.</p>
      <p>The decision caused anger among Westminster politicians and London assembly members who said it appeared a ruling had been “suppressed” to protect Mr Johnson from potentially damaging headlines during the campaign.</p>
      <p>It is said the decision was made in a private meeting held before parliament was dissolved last week.</p>

      <p>Officials from the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) agreed not to announce whether they were going to investigate “possible criminality” over allegations about a conflict of interest in Johnson’s dealings while mayor of London with the American technology entrepreneur until after the election, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/09/boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-iopc-delay-announcement-investigation">Observer</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the investigation claim the watchdog was on the verge of announcing its decision on whether it was proceeding with a criminal investigation.</p>
      <p>The IOPC was tasked by the Greater London Authority to establish whether criminal charges should be brought because of the then-mayor’s responsibility for London’s policing.</p>

      <p>It is alleged Ms Arcuri received favourable treatment due to her friendship with Mr Johnson, including receiving large sums of public money for her technology firms.</p>
      <p>The offence of misconduct in public office carries a maximum term of life imprisonment.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has denied any impropriety.</p>
      <p>Jon Trickett, shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: “This is incredible. It’s a suppression of information which the public is entitled to have.</p>

      <p>"Given the fact we’re in a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> there should be maximum transparency.”</p>
      <p>He added: “This decision must be reversed immediately.”</p>
      <p>Caroline Pidgeon, a Lib Dem member of the London assembly’s oversight committee, said the delay raised the possibility of Downing Street contact with the IOPC before its decision.</p>
      <p>“It raises questions over how independent the IOPC really is and whether the prime minister’s lawyers have been exerting undue pressure,” she said.</p>
