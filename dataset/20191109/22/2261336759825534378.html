      <p>CSKA Arena in Moscow, Russia was home to a mediocre afternoon of fights. The card saw two (T)KOs, two submissions and nine decisions, including two split-decisions.</p>

      <p>Today’s card was a long, drawn-out affair with a multitude of decisions, some of which scored a less-than-exciting rating from fans. The main card saw more voltage than the prelims in the form of a slobberknocker between Ed “Short Fuse” Herman and Khadis Ibragimov, a massive knockout of Zelim Imadaev courtesy of Danny “Hot Chocolate” Roberts, and a sensational three-round battle between Zabit Magomedsharipov and Calvin Kattar.</p>
      <p><b>Performances of the Night:</b> David Zawada, Magomed Ankalaev</p>
      <p>There were only four finishes with David Zawada, Karl Roberson, Magomed Ankalaev, and Danny Roberts ending up in the win column. David Zawada’s outstanding round-one triangle choke of Abubakar Nurmagomedov won the first of two performance bonuses and Magomed Ankalaev’s third-round, front kick knockout of Dalcha Lungiambula won the other.</p>
      <p><b>Fight of the Night:</b> Zabit Magomedsharipov vs. Calvin Kattar</p>
      <p>The main event was a competitive fight with Calvin Kattar falling short on the scorecards (28-29 x3). Kattar, who normally is like a bullet out of the gate, got off to a slow start and Zabit took advantage of that, firing on all cylinders and throwing all sorts of spinning shit. That said, by the beginning of the final stanza, Magomedsharipov’s questionable cardio made an appearance, and Kattar easily took round three, even with a late takedown from Zabit. Had the contest been five rounds, we might have seen a different arm raised.</p>
      <p>Nine fights went to decision with Davey Grant, Pannie Kianzad, Roosevelt Roberts, Rustam Khabilov, Shamil Gamzatov, Anthony Rocco Martin, Ed Herman, Alexander Volkov and Zabit Magomedsharipov all charting victories.</p>
