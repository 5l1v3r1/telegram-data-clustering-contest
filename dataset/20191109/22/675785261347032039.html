      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Spy bosses have employed unprecedented measures to protect candidates from foreign cyber attacks after it was discovered that some phone accounts were being targeted by hackers</h2>

      <p>MI5 has mounted a top-secret election operation to protect MPs’ phones from Russian hackers.</p>
      <p>Spy chiefs have ordered unprecedented measures to beef up the security of candidates vulnerable to foreign cyber attack.</p>
      <p>Warnings were issued to MPs and their staff after it was discovered that some phone accounts were being targeted by hackers.</p>
      <p>Personal and political communications have been shut down on MI5 advice, disrupting campaigns and throwing election planning into turmoil.</p>
      <p>Targeted MPs have been told to stay silent about the interference from a “foreign power” and instructed not to use any of their usual devices until they have been cleared by bugging sweeps.</p>

      <p>One said he was informed there had been a “concerted effort to hack my accounts by a foreign power”.</p>
      <p>Staff were advised to report any “odd” activity on phones and computers.</p>
      <p>It comes amid continuing mystery over the contents of a report on Kremlin interference in UK elections which has been suppressed by PM <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> .</p>
      <p>The report, from Parliament’s intelligence and security committee, examines Russian interference and sabotage in successive British elections and the 2016 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> referendum.</p>

      <p>No10 says the document needs time to process – but there is concern it has been withheld because it contains information that could have a bearing on the 12 December poll.</p>
      <p>One source said: “If it shows the result of the referendum was affected by Russian intelligence then the underlying point of this election now could be called into question.”</p>
      <p>Dominic Grieve, who chaired the committee’s inquiry, said: “There has been a lot of disquiet about the possibility of Russian interference.”</p>
