      <p>John Bercow has claimed David Cameron “thinks people like him are born to rule” as he criticised the former prime minister’s “enormous” self-confidence.</p>
      <p>The ex-Commons speaker accused the former Tory PM of calling the referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union for selfish political reasons.</p>
      <p>“David is relentlessly tactical rather than strategic. Let’s face it, he chose to call the referendum. Was there a clamour for it? There was not,” he told the Observer.</p>
      <p>“There was chuntering in his own party, but the public wasn’t demanding one. He just thought it would work for him.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow, who attended a comprehensive school, said Eton-educated Mr Cameron has the “most enormous, probably public-school-instilled, self-confidence”.</p>
      <p>“He thinks people like him are born to rule, that the natural order is that people like him run things, and that he is in a superior position.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bercow refused to say how he would vote at the election – despite representing the Tories before he became speaker.</p>
      <p>He stood down as MP for Buckingham at the end of last month after more than two decades in Parliament.</p>
