      <p>South Africa opened their Africa U-23 Cup of Nations campaign with a goalless draw against Zambia in Group B on Saturday evening at Al-Salam Stadium.</p>
      <p>South Africa coach David Notoane did not have a full compliment of the players he selected in his squad due to various club commitments but he called upon the experience of the likes of defender Tercious Malepe, who skippered the side, Kobamelo Kodisang, Happy Mashiane and Thabiso Monyane.</p>
      <p>The young Bafana side were enterprising in the early exchanges and they almost opened the scoring in the 20th minute after Kamohelo Mahlatsi dribbled his way toward the box and had a clear sight of goal but his strike was saved by gaolkeeper Mangani Banda.</p>
      <p>Zambia were getting to the game after the half-hour mark, keeping shot-stopper Darren Johnson busy but they were not clinical enough to break the deadlock, but chances were few and far between in the latter phase of the first stanza.</p>
      <p>Notoane's charges upped their intensity coming from the break and they came close to breaking the deadlock with 21 minutes remaining after Monyane embarked on a great run into the box but his powerful strike was kept out by Banda.</p>
      <p>Notoane made his first change with eight minutes remaining, after bringing on Keletso Makgalwa for Kodisang but the South Africans could not find the breakthrough despite creating chances as the encounter ended all square.</p>
      <p>The SA U-23 side will take on Ivory Coast, who are leading the pool with three points, in their second match of the group on Tuesday in the evening.</p>
