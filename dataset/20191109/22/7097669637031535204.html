      <h1>Vaping deaths: Health officials find possible cause of mystery illness linked to e-cigarettes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:36:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zoe Tidman</a></address>
      <p>Researchers have made a breakthrough in determining exactly what could be behind the mystery <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vaping">vaping</a>-related <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lung-illness">lung illness</a> which has killed 39 people in the US.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/vitamin-e">Vitamin E</a> acetate, an oil, was found in every lung fluid sample from afflicted patients tested by the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/centres-for-disease-control-and-prevention">Centres for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).</p>
      <p>“This is the first time that we have detected a potential chemical of concern in biologic samples from patients with these lung injuries,” <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information">the CDC said</a>.</p>
      <p>As of last week, there had been over 2,000 recorded cases of e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated injury (ECVPI) by the CDC.</p>
      <p>Most patients said they had used vaping products containing THC, the high-producing ingredient in marijuana, before falling ill.</p>
      <p>However, scientists have not concluded exactly how vaping leads to the illness. <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaping-illness-lung-cannabis-oil-marijuana-e-cigarette-vitamin-e-fda-a9094086.html">Vitamin E acetate has previously been flagged as a possible f</a><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/vaping-illness-lung-cannabis-oil-marijuana-e-cigarette-vitamin-e-fda-a9094086.html">actor</a>.</p>
      <p>In September, the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FoodAndDrugAdministration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) found the chemical in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marijuana">marijuana</a> products used by people who had fallen ill with the vaping-related lung illness.</p>
      <p>The oil was also found in nearly all cannabis samples from patients in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-york">New York</a>, said a state health department spokeswoman.</p>
      <p>While those showed the oil present in products, the new findings “provide direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury within the lungs”, the CDC said.</p>
      <p>The CDC, which is working alongside the FDA and local health departments to investigate the mystery illness, analysed 29 samples, 82 per cent of which contained THC.</p>
      <p>Vitamin E acetate can be added to black market vaping products to dilute THC or thicken e-liquids.</p>
      <p>The oil can be ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin and does not usually cause harm, the CDC explained.</p>
      <p>However, “previous research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning”.</p>
      <p>Reported symptoms of the vaping-related illness include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoeal and weigh loss.</p>
      <p>The CDC said: “While it appeals that vitamin E acetate is associated with EVALI, evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals.”</p>
      <p>It recommends people avoid using vaping products which contain THC while other investigations are ongoing.</p>
