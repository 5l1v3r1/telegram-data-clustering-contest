      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Tottenham are keen on Lyon forward Depay despite his struggles during his last stint in the Premier League at Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Richardson</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham are ready to make a £50million move for Manchester United flop Memphis Depay.</p>
      <p>The Dutch striker has enjoyed a new lease of life after moving to Lyon and is also now an integral part of Ronald Koeman’s impressive Holland side.</p>
      <p>Lyon rescued Depay from an underwhelming time at Old Trafford in which he was better known for his flamboyance off the pitch rather than his performances on it.</p>
      <p>But since arriving in France in January 2017 the 25-year-old has matured and gone from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>That has attracted the attention of a number of leading clubs including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> who have had the speedy forward regularly scouted including in the two recent Champions League games between Lyon and Benfica.</p>

      <p>It was also an opportunity to watch Depay’s team-mate, former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fulham-fc">Fulham</a> and Celtic striker Moussa Dembele.</p>
      <p>Spurs were interested in the 23-year-old Frenchman before he left Scotland for Lyon but it appears Depay is now their main target as they looked to bring in another forward.</p>
      <p>They will discover that his price has risen considerably from the £15 million Lyon handed over to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> although the Old Trafford club inserted a buy back option into the agreement.</p>
