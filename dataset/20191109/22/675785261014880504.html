      <h1>Man Utd target Jadon Sancho hauled off in Borussia Dortmund defeat to Bayern Munich</h1>
      <h2>The England star was substituted 36 minutes into his side's 4-0 defeat in 'Der Klassiker'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:04:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>England star Jadon Sancho was substituted after just 36 minutes during Borussia Dortmund's heavy defeat to Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was replaced by Portugal international Raphael Guerreiro during the first half of Saturday's 4-0 thrashing in 'Der Klassiker' - while Dortmund were one goal down.</p>
      <p>Sancho had been a doubt for the match after he suffered a hamstring injury during his side's 3-2 win over Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It was initially feared that the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> youngster had aggravated the same problem, but manager Lucien Favre insisted that his decision to replace him was due to tactical reasons.</p>
      <p>"He was not injured, he trained yesterday," Favre said after the game (via <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7668369/Jadon-Sancho-hooked-Bayern-Munich-thrashing-tactical-reasons-confirms-Favre.html">The Mail</a> ).</p>

      <p>"I had to go on what I was seeing and, to be honest, it was not good enough."</p>
      <p>Sancho, who has been heavily linked with the likes of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , was recently included in Gareth Southgate's squad for the upcoming European Qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>A week after being convincingly beaten 5-1 by Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern followed-up Wednesday's 2-0 European win over Olympiacos with a dominant display in their first league game since Hansi Flick took over as interim boss after Niko Kovac's sacking.</p>
      <p>Robert Lewandowski continued his stunning start to the season in front of goal, scoring twice to take his tally to 16 goals from his first 11 Bundesliga games.</p>

      <p>The Polish forward opened the scoring after 17 minutes at Allianz Arena to give his side a 1-0 lead at the break.</p>
      <p>And the defending champions took full control of the game after the break, with Serge Gnabry doubling the lead just two minutes after the restart.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski added his second with a quarter of an hour to go, and Dortmund defender Mats Hummels confirmed the three points for his former club by putting the ball into his own net four minutes later.</p>
      <p>The result leaves Bayern third in the table, one point behind leaders Monchengladbach and trailing RB Leipzig on goal difference, while Dortmund drip to fifth with 19 points.</p>
