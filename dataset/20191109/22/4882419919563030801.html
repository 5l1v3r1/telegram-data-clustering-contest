      <h1>Barcelona 4-1 Celta Vigo: Messi dead ball hat-trick wins it</h1>
      <h2>Barca moved back top of La Liga on 25 points with Real Madrid</h2>

      <p>Lionel Messi scored a hat-trick of set pieces as Barcelona thrashed Celta Vigo 4-1 on Saturday to level Real Madrid on 25 points at the top of La Liga.</p>
      <p>Sergio Busquets drilled in the fourth but it was Messi’s night as usual as he repeated a feat last managed in Spain in 2012 - by Messi himself.</p>
      <p>The No 10 broke the deadlock from the penalty spot after Junior Firpo’s cross was handled.</p>
      <p>Then Messi gave away Celta’s equaliser with a foul on the edge of his own box, with Lucas Olaza burying the free-kick.</p>
      <p>However Messi then notched two of his own, curling home just before and just after half-time with two nearly identical set pieces.</p>
      <p>That killed a game which Celta had started well and even though Barca won big in the end, when Busquets fired home the fourth, it was by no means a great display.</p>
      <p>“It’s clear that when it’s so close we have the advantage of having the best player in the world and the best free-kick taker in the world (Messi),&amp;rdquor; said Busquets.</p>
      <p>“He’s been improving and that’s an advantage, I hope he keeps scoring them.</p>
      <p>“We know where we are and if we don’t win it will create doubts, even more if you don’t play well.</p>
      <p>“Here the pressure is big because this is the best club in the world. You’re either flying or you’re in crisis. We know where we are and we have the same idea as always.&amp;rdquor;</p>
