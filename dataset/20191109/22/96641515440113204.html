      <h1>Production is finally starting on the 'Halo' TV series</h1>
      <h2>There are also three new cast members.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:15:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/microsoft-announces-halo-live-action-tv-series-created-by-343-an/">six long years</a>, filming for the <i>Halo</i> TV series is ready to start. Showtime has <a href="https://twitter.com/SHO_Halo/status/1192872157426180100">announced</a> that production on the game-based show is "about to begin," and has <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/halo-series-showtime-cast-1203398567/">revealed</a> three new cast members in the process. Danny Sapani (of <i>Doctor Who</i> and <i>The Last Jedi</i>) will play "dedicated military man" Jacob Keys, while Olive Gray (<i>Fleabag</i> and <i>Eastenders</i>) will play UNSC Commander Dr. Miranda Keyes. Charlie Murphy (of <i>Peaky Blinders</i> fame) will play Makee, an orphan raised by the Covenant that shares their hatred of humans.</p>
      <p>The production already has some top talent aboard, including <i>American Gods</i>' Pablo Schrieber <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/18/halo-tv-series-master-chief-actor/">as Master Chief</a> and <i>Ronin</i>'s Natascha McElhone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/04/halo-tv-series-casts-cortana/">as Cortana</a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Halo</i> series still isn't slated to hit screens until early 2021, and the inaugural season has been cut to nine episodes instead of ten. The Xbox One's entire lifecycle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/09/halo-infinite-arrives-holiday-2020-alongside-the-new-xbox/">will have passed</a> (plus two core <i>Halo</i> games) between the announcement and the moment you can sit down and watch. With that said, it's apparent that this is a serious attempt at translating the game franchise to TV -- albeit one that's coming far later than anticipated.</p>
