      <h1>Ian Wright urges Arsenal board to sack Unai Emery after Leicester defeat</h1>
      <h2>Two wins from 10 in the league has seen the pressure mount on Emery's position with "Emery Out" once again trending on Twitter in the immediate aftermath of the game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:14:15+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:14</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Ian Wright has slammed Arsenal for having "no definitive style or plan" and called for club chiefs to sack under-fire boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>The Gunners head into the international break with one win from seven in all competitions after losing at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>, this was another galling 90 minutes and they now sit eight points off the top four with Emery's remit to take the club back to the Champions League now looking further away than ever since his appointment last May.</p>
      <p>Two wins from 10 in the league has seen the pressure mount on Emery's position with "Emery Out" once again trending on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> in the immediate aftermath of the game.</p>
      <p>And Wright is seemingly of the opinion that Emirates boss should axe the beleaguered Spaniard.</p>

      <p>The Gunners legend wrote on Twitter: "One shot on target tonight!! Two wins in 10 in the league.</p>
      <p>"No definitive style or plan. Negative goal difference. No improvement in the defence. Not creating anything.</p>
      <p>"Why would Lacazette or Aubameyang renew? Can't blame them! We have to make the tough decision Arsenal! It's not getting better!"</p>
      <p>Despite the speculation surrounding his future, Emery has asked for patience as the international fixtures promise to give him a little respite from growing criticism.</p>
      <p>"For me, as a coach, it's about continuing stronger and improving with our players," he said.</p>

      <p>"I am speaking with the club to stay calm and to stay patient to improve and recover some confidence with some circumstances.</p>
      <p>"We are receiving criticism but I know that's my job. I've had lots of moments like that but I've recovered by working to get confidence, being together with the club and players.</p>
      <p>"I accept all (of the criticism). I accept the applause and I accept it when they criticise us. I know when we win, they are going to be happy and when we lose, they are going to be sad. It's normal.</p>
      <p>"We need to stay calm and also keep improving things. Today we got one step ahead by being together and being strong defensively. But we lost because we were playing a very strong team in a good moment."</p>
