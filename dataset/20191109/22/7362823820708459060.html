      <h1>John Legend pans Nikki Haley comparing impeachment to 'death penalty'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nikki-haley-trump-impeachment-death-penalty-cbs">Nikki Haley</a>, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, got some celebrity pushback on Friday after she likened <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> to "the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-capital-punishment-federal-death-penalty">death penalty</a> for a public official."</p>
      <p>"It's not the death penalty," singer <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dean-martins-daughter-deana-criticizes-john-legend-baby-its-cold-outside-remake">John Legend</a> tweeted. "It's firing him from the most important job in the country because he can't be trusted with it. Real people are actually sentenced to death. This is not that."</p>
      <p>Legend was responding to a tweet from Haley promoting an article about her comments. "This is a decision for the American people," she tweeted.</p>
      <p>Haley had told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">CBS anchor Norah O'Donnell</a> that there was nothing in the Ukraine transcript that "warrants the death penalty for the president."</p>

      <p>Haley spoke out as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">House Democrats</a> pursued an impeachment inquiry centered on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he urged to investigate <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">former Vice President Joe Biden.</a></p>

      <p>"You seem like a very bright person," he <a href="https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/1193018277716484096">said</a>. "You obviously know he's not morally or intellectually fit for office. I wish you would admit it for the sake of the nation and your own credibility."</p>
      <p>Legend had previously attacked Trump on Thursday, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnlegend/status/1060227524851056640">tweeting</a> that the president was a "f-----g embarrassment."</p>
