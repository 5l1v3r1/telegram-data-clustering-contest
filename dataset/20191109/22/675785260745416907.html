      <h1>Virgil van Dijk sends warning to Man City ahead of Liverpool title showdown</h1>
      <h2>Virgil van Dijk insists Liverpool will go into the Anfield clash with Manchester City with no fear</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk believes that ­Liverpool’s Champions League ­success healed the scars of their Premier League heartbreak.</p>
      <p>The £75million Dutch defender has warned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> that Jurgen Klopp’s Euro kings will go into the Anfield showdown against the reigning champions with no fear.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola beat Klopp to the ­Premier League crown by a single point last season – despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s massive 97-point haul.</p>
      <p>But Van Dijk believes that winning Europe’s top trophy proved the Reds can turn over ANY opposition.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk said: “We don’t need any extra motivation to win the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“You can’t have regrets in football. The fact is that City were just one point ­better than us last season and you have to respect that.</p>

      <p>“Obviously, there was a lot of ­disappointment here. We only lost once in the Premier League and did absolutely everything we could.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t quite good enough, but we still had an incredible season, winning the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“When we went away for the summer we knew that we had to recharge, take a lot of positivity from the season, and try to do it again this year – but be even ­better this time.</p>
      <p>“That’s exactly what we are doing.</p>
      <p>“We’re not looking too far ahead ­because we have only played 11 games and we know City are a fantastic team.</p>

      <p>“But there was no panic last season when we were challenging for the title.</p>
      <p>“I have no fear. You should not have any fear when you go out on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“Fear is not something we feel at ­Liverpool. And after what we have done, we know that we have the quality to win any game.”</p>
      <p>Last season the two Premier League games between Liverpool and City ­eventually proved to be decisive in the title race.</p>
      <p>The Blues took a point at Anfield, ­with Riyad Mahrez failing to score a <br/>last-gasp penalty in a 0-0. And they edged a dramatic game at the Etihad 2-1, as Sergio Aguero’s amazing scoring record in his home PL appearances against ­Liverpool stretched to seven on the trot.</p>

      <p>But City’s record goalscorer has not found the net in any of his 10 career ­appearances at Anfield – including two when a late substitute for former club Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>The Reds certainly won’t be dropping their guard against the little Argentine.</p>
      <p>Van Dijk said: “I think Aguero is one of the best strikers in the League – and he’s been doing it for many years. It’s a tough challenge and we will all have to be at our best to keep him quiet.</p>
      <p>“He won’t be worrying about not ­scoring at Anfield. He has enough ­experience not to think about those ­statistics.</p>
      <p>“It will be a good challenge. City are the champions, with quality throughout the whole pitch, a clear plan, a fantastic manager, fantastic players – and are very difficult to beat.”</p>

      <p>Unbeaten Liverpool have opened up a six-point lead at the top of the table after 11 games which included tough fixtures against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , ­ <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>But Van Dijk insists their only thought against City will be to stretch that gap, rather than just hang on to it.</p>
      <p>He added: “Drawing this game is something we are not going to even think about.</p>
      <p>“We want to win every game we play – and they will want to win as well, so we will see.</p>
      <p>“The situation is that we are six points above them at the moment, but it can change very quickly.</p>
      <p>“We can’t look too far ahead. We know how the fans feel but the only thing we can do is win the game ahead of us.”</p>
