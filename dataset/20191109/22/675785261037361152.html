      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who helped Lazio win the Coppa Italia last season, would offer Lampard more options in the midfield area</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Richardson</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has made £70million-rated Lazio midfield star Sergej Milinkovic-Savic a priority signing if the club’s transfer ban is lifted.</p>
      <p>Stamford Bridge officials are confident that the club’s two transfer window will be reduced to one when the court of arbitration for sport hears their appeal on November 20th.</p>
      <p>Having already been denied signing any players in the summer window, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> will be able to do business in January - if the ruling goes their way.</p>
      <p>The Blues were originally punished for breaking transfer regulations over academy players.</p>
      <p>Although a young side devoid of any new players has started the season brightly and find themselves in the top four, Lampard has hinted that owner Roman Abramovich’s cheque book will come out again in the next available window.</p>

      <p>And Serbian international Savic, who has also been on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ’s radar, is high up on Lampard’s wanted list, according to Chelsea sources.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old 6ft 3in player who helped Lazio win the Coppa Italia last season would offer Lampard more options in the midfield area in addition to greater experience to dove tail with some of the younger stars.</p>
      <p>It could be that the Blues boss will have to wait until the summer to get his man but, providing the transfer ban is lifted, a bid will be submitted in January.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Lampard felt his young side passed another stern test as they beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> 2-0 on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Second-half goals from Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic secured a sixth straight Premier League win for the Blues and lifted them, temporarily at least, up to second.</p>
      <p>They endured a frustrating first half against an obdurate, well-drilled Palace side but found a way through after the break with Abraham's 10th goal of the season and Pulisic's fifth in three games.</p>
      <p>"Every game in the Premier League is hard, particularly against a team as organised as Palace," said Lampard.</p>

      <p>"In the first half we started well, then allowed our tempo to drop, but when we came out in the second half with the intent that we did, we won the game relatively comfortably - a nice, solid win with a clean sheet.</p>
      <p>"We've had teams come here and be difficult to break down, it's a test of not only how you unlock the door, but can you switch on to make sure you don't get hit by the sucker punch?</p>
      <p>"I was really delighted with the game management in a game like today. I got as much joy out of Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori's performances in defence, and the midfielders shielding in front of them, as I did our attacking play."</p>
