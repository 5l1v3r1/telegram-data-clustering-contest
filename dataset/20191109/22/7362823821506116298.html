      <p>The <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20191108/police-edgewater-woman-found-submerging-cat">Daytona Beach News-Journal</a> reported that Goodwin and the cat were both wet and muddy, with the feline shaking and terrified.</p>
      <p>“She was shoving the cat's head in the culvert pipe and putting dirt on the cat,” <a href="https://www.fox35orlando.com/news/taking-it-to-jesus-police-say-florida-woman-nearly-drowns-cat">Fox 35 Orlando</a> quoted a witness as telling police. “I’ve never seen a cat pant like a dog. Its gums were white.”</p>
      <p>Goodwin told officers that her cat, "Hubble" was hot and she was just trying to give him some water after the pair were locked out of her house by her grandmother, the outlet reported.</p>

      <p>A witness who talked with Goodwin told officers that she wasn't making much sense.</p>
      <p>“I asked if she was okay and she told me she was taking the cat to Jesus,” he said, according to Fox 35.</p>
