      <h1>Steven Gerrard goes in depth on Alfredo Morelos’ Rangers future and why January exit is a non-starter</h1>
      <h2>Gerrard insists if he loses a key player in January it could set Gers back in their title bid.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has told Dave King and his board that they could cost Rangers the title if they sell <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> above his head.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox boss is adamant the Colombian striker won’t be allowed to leave in January as his side challenge <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> at the top of the Premiership. But Gerrard DOES accept that Morelos has his price and says he expects bids for the 23-year-old in the January window.</p>
      <p>He’s already informed chairman King and the board of his feelings on potential bids for ANY of his top stars.</p>
      <p>And Gerrard insists if he loses a key player in January, it could set Gers back in their bid to stop Celtic and get their hands on the league flag.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>’ new sporting director Ross Wilson took up his post on November 1 and will identify potential replacements for Morelos and others.</p>

      <p>And Gerrard said: “We never stop looking for replacements for all of our players, because when every window opens, every one of our players has a price. That’s what we’re dealing with.</p>
      <p>“But a decision like that wouldn’t have anything to do with me – because everyone knows what my answer would be – certainly with Morelos.</p>
      <p>“The same goes for every player I want to stay here.</p>
      <p>“I’d be as strong as I could be with my opinions, but I don’t own the club.</p>
      <p>“We expect bids to land, not just for Alfredo but for all the players who are flying at the moment.</p>
      <p>“Then that decision will be taken out of my hands.</p>
      <p>“But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dave-king">Dave King</a> and the board know – and they’d know again if a bid was to land – what my feelings would be towards it.</p>

      <p>“It’s okay saying that we have a list of replacements, but you can never predict whether a replacement would come in and do as well as the player already here.</p>
      <p>“It takes time to build a team, a style and a way of playing. If you take big pieces of that jigsaw away – sometimes where you want to get to can take an awful lot longer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"If we’re talking about Alfredo for example, let’s paint a picture of selling him in January.</p>
      <p>“What club out there is going to let you buy a player as good as Morelos? It’s impossible. So it’s not going to happen.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never had a suitable bid for him so there’s no point talking about it.</p>
      <p>“As far as I’m concerned he’s going nowhere and we’ll be watching him for Rangers against Livingston.”</p>
