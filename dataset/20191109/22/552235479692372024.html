      <p>Celtic defender <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hatem-abd-elhamed">Hatem Abd Elhamed</a> faces a race against time to be fit for the Betfred Cup Final against Rangers.</p>
      <p><i><b>MailSport</b> </i>understands the Israeli right-back - who has been a key man for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s side - faces at least three weeks out after picking up a groin injury.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s medics are waiting to discover the full extent of the strain which caused him to limp off in their sensational 2-1 Europa League victory over Lazio in midweek.</p>
      <p>But with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> Final at Hampden on December 8, the 28-year-old is now a doubt and will have to prove his fitness to Lennon.</p>
      <p>The Hoops ace took to Instagram to inform fans of the lay off and said: “Bad news this morning but I will be back stronger. Thank God always."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> paid a fee of £1.6million to sign him from Hapoel Be'er Sheva and Lennon waxed lyrical about him in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>He said: “For the money we bought him for he’s proving to be real value for money. But we looked and looked and looked at him.</p>
      <p>“Then we looked at him again and were always wondering: ‘What’s wrong with him? Where is the flaw?’</p>
      <p>“Every time, though, we went back to him, looked at the footage again and looked at other players.</p>
      <p>“And finally we thought: ‘We’ve got to trust our eyes, trust our instincts.’</p>
      <p>“I’ve a good relationship with his agent who was waxing lyrical about Hatem ... as agents do. But he has been true to his word so far – Hatem has been excellent."</p>
