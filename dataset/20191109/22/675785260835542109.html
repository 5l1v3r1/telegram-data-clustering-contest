      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lays down the law in message to Man Utd youngsters</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is taking a hard stance with his youngsters as they bid to become regulars at Old Trafford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Mullock, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-mullock/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has laid down the law to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> whizzkids – by threatening to boot them out of Old Trafford if they step out of line.</p>
      <p>In a blistering broadside aimed at keeping the Class of 2019 grounded, Solskjaer has outlined why he wants his players to become the most boring men in football every time they step off the pitch.</p>
      <p>The United boss has staked his future on youngsters like Marcus Rashford, Scott McTominay, Axel Tuanzebe, Mason Greenwood, James Garner, Brandon Williams, Tahith Chong and Angel Gomes.</p>
      <p>And he has established a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to demanding the highest professional standards as he strives to bring the glory days back to Old ­Trafford.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer said: “My message to all the boys is that if you don’t ­sacrifice yourself ­totally for Manchester United then you’re just passing through here.</p>

      <p>“Maybe you will stay for a couple of years – but that will be it.</p>
      <p>“I’m not just talking about what they do on the pitch. It’s about what is expected of them when they are away from the club.</p>
      <p>“And when you’re a footballer, you have to lead a boring life. I’m sorry, but you just have to get used to being bored.</p>
      <p>“I trust these boys – but they have to know that if they ever break that trust then I won’t be nice.</p>
      <p>“The most successful United players have all made sacrifices and have stayed for a long time.</p>
      <p>“I was boring as a player – but I made the most of my career. I want these boys to get the most out of their career as well – because when you are part of a winning team at Manchester United, it is the best feeling in the world.”</p>

      <p>Solskjaer insists he had no one in mind when he decided to crack the whip. But there have been concerns at Old Trafford that England ­internationals Rashford and Jesse Lingard have allowed themselves to become distracted by their ­commercial and social exploits.</p>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson used his ­contacts and informers to keep himself in the loop about his squad.</p>
      <p>And Solskjaer has warned his players that the power of social media gives him an insight into their lives 24 hours a day.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer added: “Sir Alex knew what was going on – and that was before social media!</p>

      <p>“Now it’s impossible for them to do something without me getting to know because that’s the way of the world now with social media.</p>
      <p>“I give the players freedom to make their own decisions – but they must always be the right ones. The boys must understand that we’re all role models.</p>
      <p>“For youngsters to see them doing stuff out on the pitch is ­brilliant. But all the other stuff? No.</p>
      <p>“We want to win trophies. To do that, the players have to make sure there are no other things on their minds. That means being proper boring. You go to bed, you rest and you get ready for the next game.</p>
      <p>“You can do all the other stuff after your career. That’s the culture we need to get to.”</p>
