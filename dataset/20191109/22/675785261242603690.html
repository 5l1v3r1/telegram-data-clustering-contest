      <p>It all kicks off as Bernie confronts her ex-partner, paedophile Kel, in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> next week.</p>
      <p>Kel, played by Joe Alesso, is caught stalking woodland and struggles with her as she tries to take his picture on her phone for evidence.</p>
      <p>Son Paul (Peter Ash), sexually abused by him, had been hiding with her in bushes and helped her pounce. And his twin Gemma (Dolly-Rose Campbell) turned up too as things got heated.</p>
      <p>Bernie (Jane Hazlegrove) is shocked to learn that a plastic bag Kel was carrying contained booze and condoms.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Lorraine, actor Joe Alesso admitted that he had "qualms" about playing the character.</p>

      <p>The dark sex abuse storyline has seen Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) come face to face with his childhood groomer Kel, who is back dating his mum Bernice (Jane Hazelgrove).</p>
      <p>Paul was only 14 when Kel sexually abused the teenager and manipulated him into thinking that they were in love.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Lorraine Kelly about the storyline, he said: "I have no idea [how long I have left], it is open-ended.</p>
      <p>"The character I’m playing is finite, I’ll never be a regular on Corrie that’s sure. My role will come to an end."</p>
      <p>Asked whether he had any qualms about playing the character, he said: "Yes of course. Talk about being thrown into the deep end. It's not just another acting job."</p>

      <p>Revealing he felt a "lot of pressure" to get it right, he said he researched the subject matter and found that 12,000 men were raped last year.</p>
      <p>He also said that it was important to not make Kel a 'caricature': "A lot of these people seem to be normal people; they’re not monsters – they’re not the child catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."</p>
