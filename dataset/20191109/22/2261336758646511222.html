      <p>The UFC Moscow main event was the setting where two ranked featherweights went at it. The company’s #5 ranked Zabit Magomedsharipov and the #11 ranked Calvin Kattar traded on the feet for the majority of 15-minutes. Zabit got ahead early, landing volume and using his footwork to stay out of range. Kattar came alive in the third though, landing big punches and chasing down the Russian. When it was all said and done, it was Magomedsharipov who took the unanimous decision. Zabit has not lost since 2013 and has won all six of his UFC bouts.</p>

      <p>The fighters exchanged leg kicks right out of the gate. Both men were landing fundamental combos with Zabit landing with a bit more frequency. Things picked up in the final ten seconds, with Zabit scoring a spinning backfist and Kattar returning with a punching flurry.</p>
      <p>Zabit came out throwing volume in the second act. He then switched to his grappling and started to hunt for takedowns. Kattar did a great job of staying on his feet. He tried to land his strikes, but the footwork of Zabit was making it challenging.</p>
      <p>An accidental low blow paused the third round before it even got started. Kattar brought some pressure upon the restart, trying to bomb away. He started connecting a lot more and Zabit started to low down. A flying knee attempt from Kattar resulted in Zabit taking top position. Kattar threw a ton from his back before the bell sounded.</p>
