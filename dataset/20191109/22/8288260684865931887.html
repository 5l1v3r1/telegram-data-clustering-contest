      <h1>'Animal' - The verdict on Fulham goal hero all Blues fans will agree with but for very different reasons</h1>
      <h2>Aleksandar Mitrovic scored once at St Andrews, had another goal disallowed and also angered Birmingham City fans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:15:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Wales</a></address>
      <p>Fulham manager Scott Parker branded Aleksandar Mitrovic an "animal" after the Serbian striker claimed the decisive goal in his side’s 1-0 victory at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> .</p>
      <p>Blues boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet</a> insisted Fulham’s winner should not have stood because of a foul by Mitrovic in the build-up.</p>
      <p>The big front man also had an effort disallowed and was booked for his part in a flare-up with Blues youngster <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/what-next-birmingham-city-starlet-16856408">Jude Bellingham</a> .</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, his 12th goal of the season silenced the Birmingham boo-boys and moved the Cottagers up to sixth in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>Mitrovic hooked home in the 52nd minute after Blues goalkeeper <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/lee-camp">Lee Camp</a> had dropped substitute Cyrus Christie's cross… and Parker was delighted with his forward’s contribution.</p>
      <p>He said: "He looks like an absolute animal, chasing things down, and if that is the base, the goals will come.</p>
      <p>"That's what we want from him; he is the talisman, the guy everyone looks to and the pressure is on him. He needs to understand what he gives to the team.</p>
      <p>"For all his goals, for everything that goes round him, all I ask of him is forget the goals, just go and turn up and be the Mitrovic he can be."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Parker was also delighted with the way his team bounced back from a 3-0 home defeat to Hull last week.</p>
      <p>"We came here and showed real character in tough conditions and were worthy winners," he added.</p>
      <p>"First and foremost you must show character, desire and passion and if you have that, you will be alright, because there's no doubt we have technical, gifted players."</p>
