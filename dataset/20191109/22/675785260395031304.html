      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Convicted murderer Ben Lacomba was stalking former lover Leanne Edwards, who describes her terrifying relationship with the callous control freak</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T22:06:21+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author">Scarlet Howes, Amir Razavi</a></address>
      <p>A woman who was a lover of evil Ben Lacomba was being stalked by him just days before ­he murdered a mum of five.</p>
      <p>Leanne Edwards spoke out after Lacomba was sentenced to 27 years for killing Sarah Wellgreen, the mother of three of his children.</p>
      <p>His disturbing behaviour included ­dragging her into a bizarre plot to try to scam the Judge Rinder TV show.</p>
      <p>Jailing him on Friday, Judge Christopher Kinch blasted the ­“callous” monster for refusing to ­reveal where he had hidden the body.</p>
      <p>Barmaid Leanne, 32, told the Sunday People: “I hope he rots in jail and never gets out.”</p>
      <p>She said Lacomba, 39, was a control freak who put her through hell during an abusive year-long relationship.</p>

      <p>Two years after they split his actions became more sinister as he started pestering her to see him again.</p>
      <p>Leanne said taxi driver Lacomba bombarded her with calls and ­messages and hung around her house at night.</p>
      <p>She recalled: “He tried to contact me only a few months before Sarah’s murder. I rang my neighbour and asked them to do me a favour and keep an eye out for me.</p>

      <p>“I had a weird feeling. As I walked home she rang me and described Ben’s car and what he looked like.</p>
      <p>“She said he had just pulled up ­outside my house. I didn’t go home that night.</p>
      <p>“My neighbour then told me he had been round a few times. This went on right before Sarah’s death.</p>
      <p>“She told me he kept turning up outside at night. It was terrifying. I could have been killed. I feel lucky to be alive.”</p>

      <p>Leanne got to know both Sarah and Lacomba when she lodged at their house in New Ash Green, Kent, in 2010.</p>
      <p>But ­after moving out three years later she lost touch with them – until Lacomba picked her up in his taxi one night.</p>
      <p>By that time he had split with 46-year-old beautician Sarah but was still living in the same house with her and their three children.</p>
      <p>Leanne said: “Ben would use his cab to hit on vulnerable women. I was vulnerable at the time as it was the tenth anniversary of my mum’s death.</p>

      <p>"He took advantage of that. I invited him in and one thing led to another.”</p>
      <p>She said of their relationship: “He would be really ­controlling and watch me to make sure I took my ­contraceptive pills.</p>
      <p>“He thought I wanted to get pregnant in case we broke up. He’d even get me to lift my tongue up so he could check.”</p>
      <p>Leanne said he made her ­appear on the Judge Rinder ­programme to try to con ITV out of some cash.</p>
      <p>Lacomba told the show in 2015 that she was a lodger who owed £4,550 in rent.</p>
      <p>He persuaded her to hide the fact she was his girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Judge Rinder’s TV judgments are not legally binding so the fines issued in the mock court battles are actually paid for by ITV.</p>
      <p>But Lacomba’s plan backfired when Judge Rinder sided with Leanne.</p>

      <p>She said: “He wanted the ­money for the custody battle against Sarah.</p>
      <p>“He started getting teary to me saying he needed the money to get a barrister and that he wanted the kids.</p>
      <p>“He knew I’d go along with it because I didn’t want to be blamed if he lost custody.</p>
      <p>“At first I saw it as a man trying to fight for his children but ­further down the line you could see he wasn’t doing it to make their lives better. It was for him.</p>
      <p>“He just wanted that control over her life. If he wants ­something, he’ll do whatever he can to get it. He thought he’d win the case so he was angry when he didn’t.”</p>
      <p>Leanne said he dumped her months later – and forced her to quit her job at a nursery by turning up there with a bag of sex toys in an act of spite.</p>
      <p>She said: “He broke up with me out of the blue and then said he was going to destroy my life.</p>
      <p>“When he came to the nursery in front of the children with a clear bag of sex toys claiming they were mine I was mortified.</p>
      <p>“He also sent the bosses a number of private messages. I felt forced to hand in my notice.”</p>
      <p>After the split Leanne became friends with Sarah, who she knew from the mum’s work at a hostel where she was living.</p>
      <p>"She wanted to see if I was OK,” she said. “I apologised for being with Ben. “She said she was angry at first that we had got together but was over it.</p>
      <p>“She told me she had wanted to warn me but I had to find out for myself what he was like.”</p>
      <p>Leanne saw Sarah just a week before she went missing in October last year – meeting for coffee near Leanne’s home in Dartford, Kent.</p>

      <p>“We were just talking about girly stuff,” she said. “Sarah told me she had been talking to a couple of guys but hadn’t met them yet.</p>
      <p>“She said, ‘Ben didn’t like the fact that I was doing well because his intentions were for me to lose everything’.</p>
      <p>“She quite liked rubbing it in that we were still pals.</p>
      <p>“And then she said he was a t**t.”</p>
      <p>Lacomba is suspected of using a ­gravedigger’s shovel to bury Sarah’s body after drowning her in the bath.</p>
      <p>Despite there being no body a jury took just three hours to convict him ­unanimously of murder last month.</p>
      <p>They were told how Sarah had landed a better-paid job shortly before her death.</p>
      <p>She wanted to buy him out of the home they shared and he ­apparently feared losing access to his children.</p>
      <p>Lacomba will serve 26 years in prison, taking into account time spent on remand.</p>

      <p>On Friday the judge who ­sentenced him at Woolwich crown court said hiding the body had caused the family an “agony of uncertainty”. Judge Kinch added: “This was a wicked plan, executed for your own selfish interests.</p>
      <p>“It’s difficult to imagine something more callous or chilling.</p>
      <p>“The position you have put your ­children in is completely unimaginable. As their father, you were one of two people they would look to for nurture and protection.</p>
      <p>“Instead you have taken their mother from them – a crime which is bound to resonate throughout their lives.</p>
      <p>“Sarah] was described as ­bubbly, kind and considerate. Someone who would step in if she thought anyone was being wronged or treated badly.</p>
      <p>“This murder was no crime of passion or momentary outburst of violence. It was, I am sure planned and calculated.”</p>
      <p>Leanne said: “He will never tell us where Sarah is as he’s a control freak and that’s the only bit of control over the situation he has left. He’s evil.</p>

      <p>"He reminds me of Ted Bundy. Charming on the outside but evil deep down.”</p>
      <p>Leanne swears she will never visit him in prison or write to him.</p>
      <p>But she sometimes wishes she HAD met him when he sent her a mysterious message shortly before Sarah vanished. <br/>It read: “I have to see you. Whatever I’ve got to say I can’t do over the phone.”</p>
      <p>Leanne said: “What if he was going to tell me what he was planning to do to Sarah? I could have saved her. Or he could have used me as an alibi.”</p>
      <p>Tearful Leanne added: “I miss her a lot.”</p>
      <p>Sarah’s family said in a ­statement: “We miss Sarah ­every day. Our priority from now is to give Sarah’s three youngest ­children every ­opportunity to be the best they can be.”</p>
