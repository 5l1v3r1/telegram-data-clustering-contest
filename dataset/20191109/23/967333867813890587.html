      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart, Erdogan, discussed in a phone call various international issues, including the launch of the much-anticipated TurkStream gas pipeline energy project , the Kremlin press service said Saturday.</p>
      <blockquote>"The sides positively assessed the steady development of multifaceted bilateral cooperation, in particular, the implementation of strategic projects in the energy sector and defense industry. They noted with satisfaction that the TurkStream gas pipeline would be put into operation by the end of December", the Kremlin said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <p>The leaders had also agreed on a schedule of upcoming high-level contacts, the statement added.</p>
      <p>TurkStream is envisaged as a 570-mile double pipeline with a combined transport capacity of 31.5 billion cubic meters, intended to deliver Russian gas to Turkey and further, including southern regions and southeast Europe.</p>
      <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that no exact date for Erdogan's visit had yet been set.</p>
      <p>TurkStream is expected to ensure gas supplies to Turkish and European consumers, bypassing unreliable national transit partners, including Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The two offshore parallel pipelines will run from Russia's Russkaya CS, near Anapa city, through the Black Sea to Turkey's receiving terminal of Luleburgaz near Kiyikoy city, at which point one of the petrochemical pipelines will continue to the Turkish-European border.</p>
