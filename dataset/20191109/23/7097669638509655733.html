      <p>India's top court handed a huge victory to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party on Saturday, awarding Hindus control of a bitterly disputed holy site that has sparked some of the country's worst sectarian bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Authorities stepped up security nationwide for the decision and Modi called for calm, fearing the final ruling on an issue that has been a focal point of Hindu-Muslim tensions for decades could again trigger unrest.</p>
      <p>By late Saturday no incidents had been reported.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the site in Ayodhya in northern India, where Hindu mobs destroyed a 460-year-old mosque in 1992, must be managed by a trust to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple.</p>
      <p>A separate piece of land in Ayodhya would be given over to a Muslim group to build a "prominent" new mosque, the court ruled in its hotly awaited 1,045-page verdict.</p>
      <p>As delighted Hindu activists chanted outside the Delhi court, Ayodhya itself was barricaded with thousands of extra security personnel, including riot police deployed, and all gatherings banned.</p>
      <p>Police were on alert across India while officials and volunteers scoured social media for inflammatory posts. Internet access was suspended in the city of Aligarh, home to a large Muslim minority.</p>
      <p>- Warrior god -</p>
      <p>Devout Hindus believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born in Ayodhya some 7,000 years ago but that a mosque was constructed on top of his birthplace in the 16th century.</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, as Hindu nationalism and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) began to strengthen, pressure grew for the mosque to be replaced by a glorious new Hindu temple at the 2.8-acre (1.1-hectare) site.</p>
      <p>In 1992, a Hindu mob estimated to number 200,000 reduced the mosque to rubble, unleashing some of the worst religious riots since independence, killing some 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.</p>
      <p>In 2002, after 59 Hindu activists died in a blaze on a train from Ayodhya, riots in Gujarat state -- when Modi was its chief minister -- saw upwards of 1,000 people perish, again largely Muslims.</p>
      <p>The verdict, it is hoped, will put an end to a decades-old legal wrangle.</p>
      <p>Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer representing one of the Muslim litigants, said however that it was "unjust" and was considering filing a review petition.</p>
      <p>"Now, finally, the talk around it and even the politics around it will stop," Shubham Maheshwar, 25, an Ayodhya resident whose family lives 400 metres (yards) from the site, told AFP.</p>
      <p>- Victory for Modi -</p>
      <p>Modi's BJP has campaigned for years for a temple at Ayodhya, and the verdict will delight the prime minister's supporters just months into his second term.</p>
      <p>But it will also send shudders through some in the 200-million-strong Muslim minority.</p>
      <p>The BJP owes its origins to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militaristic group that has long espoused "Hindutva", or Hindu hegemony in officially secular India.</p>
      <p>Under Modi, a former RSS cadre, Islamic-sounding names of several cities have been changed, while some school textbooks have been altered to downplay Muslims' contributions to India.</p>
      <p>There has been a string of lynchings of Muslims by Hindu mobs over cows, sacred for many Hindus, and other hate crimes including Muslims forced to perform Hindu chants.</p>
      <p>New Delhi also stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy, India's only Muslim-majority state, something Modi insisted was to foster development and end decades of violence.</p>
      <p>Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the verdict has "plunged the Muslims of India into uncertainty and exposed them to a lack of security and protection."</p>
      <p>India's foreign ministry responded that Pakistan's "pathological compulsion to comment on our internal affairs with the obvious intent of spreading hatred is condemnable."</p>
      <p>"The halls of justice have amicably concluded a matter going on for decades," Modi tweeted. "This verdict shouldn't be seen as a win or loss for anybody."</p>
