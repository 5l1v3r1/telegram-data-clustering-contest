      <p>GUILFORD COUNTY, N.C. -- A North Carolina boy who died may still have an impact, potentially a life-saving one, on other children.<br/><br/>The pain for Noah Chambers' family still lingers just days after his death. However, they're proud that Noah will be able to help other kids through the organs he'll donate.<br/><br/>Noah Chambers' father, Robert, says <a href="https://www.wxii12.com/article/hes-able-to-take-care-of-seven-other-kids-father-of-boy-killed-wants-son-to-live-on-in-others/29689569">the choice to donate Noah's organs </a>was easy.<br/><br/>"When they were talking about being a donor, me and his mother didn't hesitate. I would not want any parent to go through this. It is the worst pain."<br/><br/>Chambers, 11, <a href="https://abc11.com/nc-boy-killed-at-church-halloween-event/5670461/">was fatally hit by an SUV </a>while crossing the street at a 'trunk-or-treat' event at Bethel United Methodist Church in Oak Ridge. He went on life support at the hospital and passed away Sunday.<br/><br/>"Noah's personality was just amazing," said his father. "He'd make you laugh. He'd make you just cry. How could a boy be so beautiful, inside and out."<br/><br/>The family will get to meet the children whom Noah helps, the ultimate way to honor his legacy. His father said Noah's organs have already gone to seven children.<br/><br/>"To know that I can look at them and tell that I love them, they might know me, but there was a child that loved them unconditionally," Robert said.</p>
