      <h1>Don’t like a Twitter trend? You can now get rid of it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:56:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:56</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Twitter has been working to fight the toxicity which has been a major part of the platform for many years now.</p>
      <p>After being accused of not doing much to fight the rampant abuse on its platform, the company is now acting more decisively, including recently <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-decides-to-ban-all-political-ads-without-exception/">banning all forms of political advertising</a> for example.</p>
      <p>Today, in the latest news, the company has added the ability to report unsuitable trends from the home page.</p>

      <p>A drop-down menu has been added to the trends section which allows users to report a twitter trend under 4 categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This trend is spam</li>
        <li>This trend is abusive or harmful</li>
        <li>This trend is a duplicate</li>
        <li>This trend is low quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We assume an algorithm will take care of evaluating responses and get rid of the more toxic trends which are sometimes started against celebrities or other prominent people.</p>
      <p>The feature does not appear to be available for everyone yet and may require clearing your web cache to access.</p>
