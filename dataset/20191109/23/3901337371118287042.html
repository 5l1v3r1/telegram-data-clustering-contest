        <b>LaLiga</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Barcelona 4-1 Celta Vigo</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Camp Nou</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi stole the show after netting a hat-trick, which included two free-kicks, as FC Barcelona thumped Celta Vigo 4-1 on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde recalled Anssu Fati in place of Ousmane Dembele who dropped to the bench while Samuel Umtiti started alongside Gerard Pique in the heart of defence</p>
      <p>Barca hit the front at the midway point after Messi fired in from the penalty spot following a handball in the area after Junior Firpo handled Nelson Semedo’s cross on the byline.</p>
      <p>After spearheading the opener, Semedo pulled a hamstring after delivering the ball and was duly removed for Sergio Busquets who filled the Portuguese international’s void.</p>
      <p>Celta looked for a strong finish three minutes to halftime and found their just rewards after Lucas Olaza found the bottom corner with a well-taken free-kick caused by Messi.</p>
      <p>Barca restored the tally on the stroke of halftime when Messi nestled the far corner of the net with a similarly taken free-kick from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>The Catalans brought more speed up top following the halftime break, as Fati made way for Frenchman Dembele.</p>
      <p>Messi wasn’t done though and went on to complete his hat-trick with an identical top corner free-kick near the danger area two minutes from the interval.</p>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann closed in to give Barca a third following the 61st minute, but good goalkeeping from Ruben Blanco narrowed the forward’s angle and attempt as well.</p>
      <p>Barca stayed in charge following the final minutes despite a few danger signs in and around the final third from the visiting side.</p>
      <p>Busquets wrapped up the contest five minutes to the end when he collected a looping ball on the area to riffle into the bottom near corner.</p>
      <p>Barca returned to winning ways following two dismal results in their two last matches, as Celta drop to the bottom-three.</p>
