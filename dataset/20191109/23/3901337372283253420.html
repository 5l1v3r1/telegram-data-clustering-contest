      <p>Rulani Mokwena lashed out at Kaizer Chiefs and Ernst Middendorp after Orlando Pirates’ Soweto Derby defeat in an angry post-match interview, check it out…</p>

      </p>
      <p>For the first time in nearly five years, the Glamour Boys were victorious in an Absa Premiership game against their bitter rivals, and the three points could be huge for Ernst Middendorp’s side as it sent them 10 points clear at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>However Mokwena’s outburst may create more headlines than the game itself after he hit out at their ‘thuggish’ opponents, and fans of the club will be worried given the fact that they have now got just three wins in their last 15 games stretching back to August.</p>
      <p>The Pirates coach, undoubtedly feeling the pressure as Pirates tough run continues, was visibly angry when talking to SuperSport after the final whistle had gone, claiming that the late scuffle – which resulted in Erick Mathoho’s sending off – was condoned by his opposite number.</p>
      <p>In his outburst, the Bucs coach fumed, “I'm extremely disappointed as a football lover that such a great spectacle is ruined by such thuggish behaviour! It's okay to lose, OK let's lose but don't punch my players! I've got players that were kicked, punched in the face, I mean what do you say about these things. It's thuggish behaviour!”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Middendorp meanwhile, will be delighted with the result, after his side won six Absa Premiership games in a row for the first time since October 2014.</p>
