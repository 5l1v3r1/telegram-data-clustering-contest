      <p>Alex Fischer, nine, and her six-year-old sister Caroline, began their mission two years ago as a family service project.</p>
      <p>“We started this as a service project in 2017 for the family to do in the holidays,” the girls’ mom, Lisa Fischer, <a href="https://wtop.com/national/2019/11/two-sisters-raise-thousands-to-buy-108-thanksgiving-meals-and-turkeys-for-families-in-need/">told</a> CNN. “When I initially suggested we donate one box of food, Alex said that wasn’t enough and that we should do ten boxes.”</p>
      <p>Lisa Fischer told her daughter that ten boxes was a large undertaking and suggested she start a fundraiser. That year, the family made it a goal to support 10-20 families with a local charity.</p>
      <p>Alex was seven at the time, and the charity the family supported was the <a href="https://charlotterescuemission.org/">Charlotte Rescue Mission</a>—a nonprofit that provides transitional housing for 120 days in Christian settings for men and women who are dependent on drugs and/or alcohol and are mostly homeless.</p>
      <p>Several years later, ten boxes multiplied into 100 boxes.</p>
      <p>“Last year we decided to go even bigger and I thought our goal should be 101 boxes and we ended up donating 130 boxes,” Alex <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/life/heartwarming/charlotte-9-year-old-raises-enough-money-to-buy-108-thanksgiving-meals-and-turkeys-for-families-in-need/275-99dca96d-135f-4658-9727-724169af03f7?fbclid=IwAR11E9eYf-d_jPDIkZtM21pCR8Z1XWoX71Xt8lNbLPAn1Z0WDAH3o1b7Vds?fbclid=IwAR11E9eYf-d_jPDIkZtM21pCR8Z1XWoX71Xt8lNbLPAn1Z0WDAH3o1b7Vds">told</a> WCNC.</p>
      <p>This year, Alex — along with her younger sister Caroline — are hosting bake sales and lemonade stands to raise money for the mission, WSOC <a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/community/9-year-old-girl-raises-money-to-buy-thanksgiving-meals-for-those-in-need/1005690389">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>At last weekend’s lemonade stand, they sold out for the first time and have raised enough money to buy 108 turkeys and food boxes.</p>
      <p>Lisa Fischer said she never expected her family service project to grow, and hopes the kids continue to have an appetite for serving others.</p>
      <p>“It’s kind of humbling to see how many people want to help them and be a part of this. And we’re really excited to see where they go with this,”Lisa Fischer said.</p>
      <p>The Fischers usually start fundraising around the end of September, and have set up a GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-fischer-sisters-thanksgiving-mission?fbclid=IwAR1LIR2thILGvyN-47mRQkaGFNj_iKWW1RH0Oxl6YWtPI9pSTSjJ0blLxm0">page</a> for support in their Thanksgiving mission.</p>
