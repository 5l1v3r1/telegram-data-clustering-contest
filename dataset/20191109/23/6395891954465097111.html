      <p><b>SAN ANTONIO, Texas</b> - The Boston Celtics announced that forward Gordon Hayward fractured his left hand in Saturday's <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/sports/hayward-breaks-left-hand-in-celtics-135115-rout-of-spurs/1006879390">135-115 win</a> over the San Antonio Spurs, according to a tweet from the team just before 6:30 p.m.</p>

      <p>Hayward was playing in his eighth game of the season and had recorded 9 points in nearly 15 minutes against the Spurs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Marc_DAmico">Marc D'Amico</a>, the director of digital content for the Boston Celtics, tweeted out video of the play that led to Hayward's hand injury, which came in the second quarter.  </p>

      <p>ESPN basketball reporter Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted shortly after the Celtics' announcement that Hayward will see a specialist on Monday to determine if he will need surgery for the injury.</p>
      <p>Wojnarowski claims the information comes from Hayward's agent, Mark Bartelstein. </p>

      <p>The team confirmed Wojnarowski's report a short time later.</p>

      <p>Hayward has averaged 20.3 points per game, 7.9 rebounds and 4.6 assists -- all three of which were higher than his career averages. </p>
      <p>That early production from Hayward comes two years after the forward <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/sports/gordon-hayward-suffers-fractured-ankle-in-celtics-opener/626208732?fdg">broke his ankle</a> less than six minutes into his first game as a Celtic. Last year, after missing the entire previous season because of that ankle injury, Hayward averaged 11.5 points per game. </p>
