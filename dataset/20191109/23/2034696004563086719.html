      <p>Opening up for Del Rey at Chicago’s Aragon Ballroom, Dacus later joined the ‘Blue Jeans’ singer during her set to perform a duet of her song ‘Night Shift’.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the evening, Del Rey invited Best Coast’s Bethany Cosentino to join her on stage. Together the pair sang ‘When I’m With You’ before Cosentino was given the floor for a solo performance of ‘Up All Night’.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time that Del Rey has brought out a guest musician during her ‘The Norman Fucking Rockwell!’ tour.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-lana-del-reys-surprise-duet-with-joan-baez-2554622">she surprised fans by bringing out folk icon Joan Baez</a> to perform two tracks. Before that she performed a cover of <a href="http://nme.com/artists/leonard-cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>‘s ‘Chelsea Hotel #2’ <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-lana-del-rey-perform-leonard-cohens-chelsea-hotel-2-on-first-night-of-nfr-tour-2550344">with the late musician’s son, Adam Cohen.</a></p>
