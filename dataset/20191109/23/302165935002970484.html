      <p>NOVEMBER 10 — It is rush hour in Havana and the queue at the bus stop is longer than ever.</p>
      <p>Then a fleet of electric motorcycles appears, beeping their horns.</p>
      <p>Surprised and relieved, passengers jump on the backs of the 50 or so electric mopeds.</p>
      <p>It is a new solution for Cubans struggling with fuel shortages driven by US sanctions that have curbed oil imports.</p>
      <p>Cuba has long been known for the classic American cars that people here lovingly maintain decades after they stopped being built.</p>
      <p>But urban transport on the communist island is evolving.</p>
      <p>The bikes’ horns beep and some of the riders play reggaeton music — but, being electric, their motors make hardly any noise.</p>
      <p>A Chinese-made electric motorcycle costs between US$1,800 and US$2,300 in Cuba. A basic petrol-powered bike on the island can cost up to six times that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Volunteer riders</b>
      </p>
      <p>The electric bikes — with a maximum speed of about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour — were first licensed for import in 2013.</p>
      <p>They have multiplied in the streets since then — and have come into their own with the recent fuel shortages.</p>
      <p>“I really like this initiative, it helps a lot with the economy,” says passenger Yanet Figueroa, 42, sitting on the back of one of the bikes.</p>
      <p>“It really helps people who have great need of it.”</p>
      <p>Cuba plunged into a fuel crisis in September after Washington imposed restrictions on fuel shipments from Cuba’s top ally Venezuela.</p>
      <p>Cuba had to make do in September with just 30 per cent of its usual fuel supply and the level has still not recovered — it is forecast to reach no more than 80 per cent this month.</p>
      <p>With the public transport network badly hit, President Miguel Diaz-Canel has called on drivers to pick up passengers voluntarily.</p>
      <p>The owners of electric bikes known as “motorinas” answered the call.</p>
      <p>“We have volunteered to do this as a service to society,” says one of the drivers, Javier Capote, 33.</p>
      <p>“It is going very well. We are very happy about it.”</p>
      <p>The president himself during a televised address mentioned “those famous... what do you call them, the bikes? The ‘motorinas’, that have come out to help.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Electric bike era</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cuban authorities estimate there are 210,000 electric motorcycles currently in use on the island.</p>
      <p>That figure is expected to rise as the government in late October began to sell them with the price capped at US$1,700.</p>
      <p>Those who make a living servicing the bikes are pleased by that move as it will bring down costs.</p>
      <p>“It seems like a very good idea to us mechanics,” says one, Enrique Alfonso, 47, in his workshop.</p>
      <p>He recalls the economic crisis of the 1990s that followed the end of cheap imports from the Soviet Union.</p>
      <p>“That was the era of (affordable) Chinese bicycles. Now we are in the era of electric motorcycles,” he says.</p>
      <p>“With everything that is going on the country, they have become obtainable for a lot of people.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Accidents</b>
      </p>
      <p>The electric bikes had a mixed reception at first. Silent and often inexpertly ridden, they are often involved in accidents in a country that already suffers from thousands of crashes a year.</p>
      <p>Officials say that of the 7,000 road accidents recorded so far this year, a third have involved electric motorcycles.</p>
      <p>Authorities have responded by insisting riders have a license and register their vehicles.</p>
      <p>The flourishing of electric bikes follows several years of gradual opening-up of Cuba’s state-run economy. It has also coincided with a digital mini-revolution.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the availability of 3G-standard internet connections since last year, riders can network more easily.</p>
      <p>The 3G connections helped spawn the Electric Motorbikes of Cuba online group, a club with more than 80 members.</p>
      <p>It started out as a club for enthusiasts seeking to have “healthy fun and share the passion we all have for electric motorcycles and road safety,” says its president Osdany Fleites, a 37-year-old taxi driver.</p>
      <p>“The motorcycles do not pollute the environment, they do not make a noise,” he says.</p>
      <p>Now the club has evolved to have an environmental and “social purpose.”</p>
      <p>Along with another club, Eracing, its members take part in rescuing bus passengers stuck due to the fuel shortages.</p>
      <p>They have also taken part in environmental clean-up jobs, helping eradicate an infestation of troublesome giant snails in Havana, donated blood and visited children in a cancer ward. — AFP Relaxnews</p>
