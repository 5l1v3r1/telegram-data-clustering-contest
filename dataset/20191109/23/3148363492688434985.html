      <h1>Chad Wolf to Hand Over H-1B Visa Issues Due to Former Lobbyist Role</h1>
      <h2>Incoming Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chad Wolf will hand over the issue of H-1B visas to another administration official due to his prior role as an outsourcing lobbyist, Breitbart News has learned.</h2>

      <p>Last week, President Trump confirmed that he would be <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/report-trump-to-name-chad-wolf-acting-homeland-security-secretary/">temporarily appointing</a> Wolf to head DHS despite <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/02/08/dhs-staff-chief-recuses-himself-from-indian-outsourcing-issues/">his background</a> as a registered lobbyist for NASSCOM, a corporate leader in the outsourcing industry that lobbies for endless H-1B foreign visa workers to replace American workers.</p>
      <p>Wolf, though, will be delegating the issue of H-1B visas, according to a senior administration official. The official said the issue of H-1B visas will be put in the hands of a yet-to-be-determined Trump official.</p>
      <p>Should Wolf be put in a position where issues regarding H-1B visas fall on him as Acting DHS Secretary, he will delegate the issue, the official told Breitbart News.</p>
      <p>The decision by Wolf comes as the Trump administration has received pushback from pro-American worker groups who fear that the appointment will compromise the president’s “Buy American, Hire American” agenda.</p>
      <p>Sara Blackwell of Protect U.S. Workers — which represents American workers displaced by the H-1B visa program — asked Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/4US_Workers/status/1190359505219002368">not to appoint</a> Wolf to the job. Likewise, officials with the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775273534/white-house-to-name-chad-wolf-as-acting-homeland-security-secretary">asked</a> that Wolf recuse himself from not only handling the H-1B visa program, but all foreign worker visa issues.</p>
