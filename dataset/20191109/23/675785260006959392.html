      <h1>KSI vs Logan Paul rematch free live stream warning about unofficial boxing channels</h1>
      <h2>The highly-anticipated rematch between KSI and Logan Paul will be watched by millions of people around the world - and live streaming could become an issue</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Over one year has passed since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ksi">KSI</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/logan-paul">Logan Paul</a> last step into the ring - and now they can finally settle their grudge once and for all.</p>
      <p>The pair fought out a draw when they clashed in August 2018, leading to Saturday night's rematch, taking place in Los Angeles, California.</p>
      <p>Millions of people around the world have been showing an interest and are keen to catch the action.</p>
      <p>Those in the UK can see the fight on Sky Sports Box Office, with it purchasable for a price of £9.95, with the option to watch on either TV or live stream.</p>
      <p>In the USA, it can be watched and streamed on DAZN, with a monthly fee of $19.99 for their subscribers.</p>

      <p>However, fans are warned that they must not watch the action on illegal streaming sites - as the damage could be costly.</p>
      <p>Some streaming sites have even asked for small payments over PayPal to access the fights - but those streams risk being taken off air due to copyright infringement.</p>
      <p>There is also a worry that dodgy streaming websites create the risk of malware and other computer viruses, if adequate protection is not already in place.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the biggest warning is to fans who are looking to use the live streaming and recording services available on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to share the fight with their friends and followers.</p>

      <p>In 2017, Bristol-based Yusuf Mohammed was slapped with a £16,000 fine after he was found guilty of broadcasting Sky Sports content, filmed from a remote device, on his social media channels.</p>
      <p>One year later, Craig Foster from Scarborough was handed a staggering £85,000 fine after it was claimed that his friend broadcast the Anthony Joshua vs Wladimir Klitchsko fight.</p>
      <p>But Foster was the one guilty after it was found that he was the man who paid for the Sky Sports Box Office fight.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old claims that the friend illegally broadcast it via Facebook to 4,250 people via Foster's iPad.</p>

      <p>A watermark of his account number allowed Sky to track down Foster, and they hit him with the bill due to loss of earnings.</p>
      <p>"I’d paid for the boxing, it wasn’t like I was making any money," Foster told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/boxing-fan-hit-85000-bill-11808956">Mirror</a> exclusively at the time.</p>
      <p>"My iPad was signed in to my Facebook account and my friend just started streaming the fight.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think anything of it, then a few days later they cut my subscription.</p>
      <p>“They’re demanding the names and addresses of all my mates who were round that night but I’m not going to give them up. I said I'd take the rap.”</p>
