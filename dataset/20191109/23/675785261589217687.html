      <h1>Trent Alexander-Arnold tipped to leave Liverpool in summer transfer battle</h1>
      <h2>Legendary former Brazil right-back Cafu reckons Alexander-Arnold will be wanted by clubs across Europe this summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:48:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:48</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold could be the subject of a big-money transfer this summer, according to legendary Brazil right-back Cafu.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold has provided 28 assists in his 101 games for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> since making his top-flight debut three years ago, and already has three assists and one goal in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Last season he was the Premier League's joint-third highest provider with 12 assists, while Reds left-back Andy Robertson was just one behind on 11.</p>
      <p>Liverpool's attacking full-backs have been crucial in Liverpool's rise to the top, with the European champions and Premier League leaders hosting <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> today in a huge title-race showdown at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Former Brazil star Cafu played a similar attacking role to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/trent-alexander-arnold">Alexander-Arnold</a> , with Roberto Carlos providing similar impetus from left-back as the Selecao won the 2002 World Cup.</p>

      <p>And Cafu, who won 142 caps for Brazil and also won the World Cup in 1994, reckons 21-year-old Alexander-Arnold will be one of this summer's hottest transfer properties as big clubs across Europe bid to tempt Liverpool into letting him go.</p>
      <p>“Trent has been one of the better players in the league and he is one of the main reasons why Liverpool are where they are," Cafu told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10313950/liverpool-facing-battle-keep-alexander-arnold-says-cafu/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>“At the end of the season we could see a big trade with him, as he is not only a great defender but he can also help and move forward and sideways with and without the ball.</p>
      <p>“For that reason he has been great in scoring goals and is what I would call a ‘quarterback scorer’."</p>

      <p>Cafu, 49, has been impressed with Alexander-Arnold's commitment to the right-back position.</p>
      <p>Both Gary Lineker and Jamie Carragher have both recently said they would like to see the England international play further forward as a creative midfielder - but Alexander-Arnold's response was to tweet "One position at a time" along with a smirking emoji.</p>
      <p>Cafu said: “To any young player, the key word is always commitment.</p>
      <p>“Young players need to have a strong commitment to the position they take on.</p>

      <p>“This is my No 1 piece of advice. It’s what I teach to others.</p>
      <p>Alexander-Arnold's current transfer value is estimated at £72million by football stats website <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/trent-alexander-arnold/profil/spieler/314353">Transfermarkt</a>.</p>
      <p>However, given his importance to the team and the fact he is contracted to Liverpool until 2024, the Reds would most likely stand firm amid any interest and it would take a much greater offer to tempt them into selling.</p>
