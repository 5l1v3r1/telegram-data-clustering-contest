      <p>Tonight (Saturday, November 9th) is a bit of a special spectacle from Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Despite two championship bouts on the card, the main event is a six-round cruiserweight bout between two debuting professionals, but not just any newcomers.</p>
      <aside><b><a href="https://bit.ly/2VHPAdj">WATCH KSI vs. LOGAN PAUL 2 ON DAZN</a></b> YouTube sensations KSI and Logan Paul rematch in the boxing ring, this time under professional rules and without headgear.

      <p>YouTube stars KSI and Logan Paul are squaring off in the ring for a second time, only this time under professional rules. They fought in a special amateur bout in front of a packed crowd in Manchester, England, but the contest ended in an unsatisfying draw. Now they get to settle their score in the second go-round, and while boxing and fight fan purists may scoff at the attention this is getting, it’s a massive attention-getting bout that will light ups social media circles.</p>
      <p>Before they get into the ring, there’s a full undercard that features established boxers such as WBC lightweight champion Devin Haney and WBO super-middleweight champ Billy Joe Saunders in their respective (very lopsided) title defenses versus Alfredo Santiago and Marcelo Esteban Coceres.</p>
