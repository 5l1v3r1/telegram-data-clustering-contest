      <h1>X Factor: Celebrity viewers claim result is 'karma' as both Simon's acts in sing-off</h1>
      <h2>Fans claimed it was 'karma' as both of Simon Cowell's acts were in the sing-off of X Factor : Celebrity tonight after last week's deadlock</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T23:45:16+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Brogan-Leigh Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Both of Simon Cowell's acts were in the sing-off on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity tonight and viewers claimed it was 'karma' as he refused to vote a week earlier.</p>
      <p>He annoyed fans at home as he put the show into deadlock after saying he wasn't going to pick which of the acts would leave the show, and demanded to hear the public vote instead - after hos Dermot O'Leary insisting there would be no deadlock at the start of the series.</p>
      <p>And in tonight's show the judge had a taste of his own medicine as both of his acts ended up in the sing-off.</p>
      <p>Twitter users were loving the difficult situation he was eventually left in - which left him an act down as Love Island band No Lost Love were booted off.</p>
      <p>One <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user wrote: "Now Simon has to vote one of his acts out. Karma for that crap he pulled last week <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XFactorCelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#XFactorCelebrity</a> ".</p>

      <p>Another fan penned: "Bet Simon's wishing he'd goaded Nicole into saving one of his groups instead of fox murderer Vinnie right about now. Would have an easier time of it saving his own group. That's karma for you right there! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XFactorCelebrity?src=hashtag_click">#XFactorCelebrity</a> ".</p>
      <p>And a third angrily shared: "So Simon cheats and breaks the rules again to get what he wants. What is the point of a competition if the judge can cheat and put his favourite through? Time this prog is scrapped."</p>
      <p>As usual one act was dropped from the show by the public vote, but then two more acts had to face a sing-off before the decision came down to the three judges.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately it was Martin Bashir who was ditched in the first vote, immediately sending him home.</p>
      <p>He'd been in the bottom three for three weeks running, but said it was a "spectacular experience".</p>
      <p>Then, No Love Lost and V5 were left to compete in the dreaded sing-off that was brought back for this week after last weekend's deadlock controversy.</p>
      <p>The two acts took to the stage one more time, clearly emotional about what was ahead.</p>

      <p>As the performances came to an end, the judges had to choose who to send home.</p>
      <p>With Simon being mentor to both groups, Dermot handed it over to Louis first who said it was the "hardest decision ever".</p>
      <p>Louis saved V5, with Nicole saving V5 too meaning Simon did not have to make the decision.</p>
      <p>No Love Lost were devastated to be sent home, but vowed to stay together as a band and maybe even return.</p>
