      <p>Megan McKenna left the X Factor: Celebrity judges moved by the song she wrote and sang tonight as it referenced relationship heartbreak.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> star, 27, took to the stage and sang her heart out to Simon Cowell, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh as she hopes to win the singing show.</p>
      <p>Her original track Half of My Heart also wowed the stunned audience as she vowed to steal a vote before tonight's sing off and double elimination.</p>
      <p>Simon Cowell, 60, asked: "What was that song driven by, what was it about?"</p>
      <p>She responded: "That song for me I wrote literally a few weeks ago and I wanted to put in that... the message in that song is the next thing I go into just to not put my full heart in - just to keep a little back for myself."</p>

      <p>Then Simon quizzed: "Are you talking about relationships?" and she said: "It could be anything, but," before Simon repeated the question again.</p>
      <p>Megan laughed: "Maybe a little bit," before the music mogul replied: "Yeah, thought so!"</p>
      <p>It then went to Louis - Megan's mentor, who said: "Megan what a lot of people probably don't know is your dedication to music, your song-writing, your singing - you are so serious about this.</p>

      <p>"And when you sing, you touch people and everybody relates to the lyrics of your songs."</p>
      <p>He then confessed she ticks all the boxes and is fit for a recording career, stating "it has to be you".</p>
      <p>And Nicole Scherzinger, 41, who watched in awe, gushed: "I love the message of that song, I second you on that.</p>
