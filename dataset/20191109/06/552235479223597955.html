      <h1>Brendan Rodgers had Celtic fans brainwashed and 'old school' Neil Lennon has proven he's just as good - Chris Sutton</h1>
      <h2>Chris reckons the Hoops boss is proving his critics wrong after a stunning away win in Rome.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Sutton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-sutton/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Lennon surely shut up the last of his doubters in Rome.</p>
      <p>As I left the Stadio Olimpico after Celtic’s stunning win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a>, I couldn’t help but wonder what those who were whining about the club apparently going backwards when they appointed my old team-mate to replace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> were thinking.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I wondered what Rodgers himself was thinking.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s former manager is doing a terrific job at Leicester just as he did at Parkhead. But he must have watched that with a touch of envy.</p>
      <p>For all of Rodgers’ brilliance and dominance of the domestic silverware, that was the type of European performance he could not get the Hoops to achieve on the road.</p>
      <p>People can point to the likes of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and PSG in the Champions League and claim it’s not really comparable as the opposition was tougher than Lazio.</p>
      <p>But there’s two separate arguments to that. It’s true Rodgers had to deal with those super powers of the continental scene during his reign. However, he also presided over collapses against the likes of Salzburg, Zenit and Leipzig.</p>
      <p>There’s no way you can take away the fact he got to the group stage of the Champions League twice but there was a brittleness about Celtic away from home in the play-offs as they fell apart to Hapoel Beer Sheva and Astana and stumbled over the line after massive wins at home.</p>

      <p>Lazio are not a weak side. They are fourth in Serie A. They defeated AC Milan at the San Siro for the first time in 30 years just four days before they faced Celtic.</p>
      <p>They have Italy’s top scorer in the shape of Ciro Immobile and boast an experienced, streetwise squad.</p>
      <p>Yet Celtic ran them ragged. In the second half the Hoops were superb. They played on the front foot, imposed their game on Lazio. More importantly, they also showed backbone to fight back from adversity in doing so.</p>
      <p>It’s one thing turning a 1-0 deficit around at Celtic Park in front of 60,000 home supporters but it’s quite another doing it in the Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>That takes strength of mind. The type of backbone that Rodgers’ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> lacked so often on their travels.</p>
      <p>I could spend pages talking about the individual performances. From Fraser Forster pulling off big saves to Scott Brown’s <br/>marvellous show in the middle of the park and James Forrest’s usual brilliance.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>There wasn’t a failure. You could mention every one of them. But it wasn’t just their talent, it was their mental strength and guts.</p>
      <p>Lennon deserves enormous credit for what he’s instilled into his team and that’s before you talk about his tactical acumen.</p>
      <p>He’s old school, he’s not modern. That was the junk trotted out by some so-called experts and fans when Rodgers left in February and Lennon took his place. Brainwashed by Rodgers’ chat and talk.</p>
      <p>I’m not going to criticise Rodgers. He was a cracking manager for the club and did a superb job. But if anyone can’t see Lennon is just as capable, they don’t know football.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter how much ability you have, you also need some solidity and Celtic look to have more of it now under their current manager than they did with their old boss.</p>
      <p>They fought back from a goal behind to win in Sarajevo. They were trailing in Cluj and got a draw. They did the same in Rennes. Now they’ve turned it around in Rome against Lazio.</p>
      <p>It was seven years to the night since Lennon masterminded a 2-1 win over the mighty Barcelona, who were arguably in better shape then than they were four years later when they strolled past Rodgers’ Celtic in a 2-0 victory at Parkhead.</p>

      <p>Thursday was no fluke. Lennon has done it before. Even so, it was a joy to behold. What a great night for Scottish football as Rangers’ win over Porto at Ibrox was also impressive. It’s magnificent to see the Scottish game rise again with the top two clubs really clawing back the nation’s reputation on the continent.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>’s team can go through to the knockout stages but Celtic are already there and it’s now important they kick on and win the group.</p>
      <p>With such a gruelling domestic schedule, it would be understandable if Lennon chose to rest the odd key man for the next two games against Rennes and Cluj.</p>
      <p>It’s a taxing period and players need some down time.</p>
      <p>However, topping the group makes such a difference in terms of who you could play in the last 32.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Come second and it’s maybe one of the top sides who have dropped out of the Champions League. Win the section and you get a seeding, which might just be crucial in terms of reaching the last 16.</p>
      <p>That’s for later though. Of course Celtic have to get back down to business and take care of Motherwell tomorrow because the title race and the challenge from Ibrox means there can be no slip-ups for Lennon.</p>
      <p>But you cannot deny the squad a chance to wallow in their success of Rome.</p>
      <p>It was historic and it was brilliant to witness.</p>
      <p>The type of result and performance on foreign soil which Rodgers could never quite manage during his tenure in the hotseat.</p>
      <p>He must have watched it and wondered if he wished he was there despite his lofty position in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It was Lennon who got to take the acclaim. And at the same time proved he was not some poor, second-rate choice as Celtic boss.</p>
