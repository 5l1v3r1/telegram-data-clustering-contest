      <h1>Roman Polanski accused by a french actor of raping her when she was a teenager</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:48:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>In a recent turn of events, a french actor accused filmmaker Roman Polanski of allegedly raping her when she was a teenager. The woman, named Valentine Monnier, told the French newspaper <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/pourquoi-j-accuse-roman-polanski-aujourd-hui-08-11-2019-8189571.php"><i>LeParisien</i></a> that she had just turned 18 in 1975, when she was allegedly attacked.</p>
      <p>Monnier claims that she was not only raped, but beaten and abused by Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland. “I didn’t have any link with him – not personal, not professional, and I barely knew him,” she told the outlet.</p>

      <p>“This wasn’t during a party (no alcohol, no drugs). It was extremely violent, after skiing, in his cabin in Gstaad. He hit me, he beat me until I surrendered, then he raped me, inflicting upon me all the vicissitudes. I had just turned 18 and my first relationship had been just a few months ago. I thought I was dying.”</p>
      <p>However, Polanski’s lawyer, Hervé Temime, told <i>LeParisien</i> that his client “firmly contests” the allegation. The attorney “deplored” that the claim would be made public shortly before Polanski’s latest film, <i>J’Accuse</i>, is being released in France.</p>
      <p>According to the outlet, Monnier explained how the film triggered her decision to go public. The director has been a fugitive from the US for four decades since pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor in 1977.</p>
