      <h1>Rangers have Celtic to thank for setting standard that puts both on a different stratosphere - Gordon Parks</h1>
      <h2>Gordon reckons European success suggests the Glasgow duopoly is back, and here to stay.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Parks, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-parks/</a></address>
      <p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Charles Dickens couldn’t have summed up Scottish football’s last few days any better.</p>
      <p>As a winter of discontent swept over the rest of the country two sides of the coin were exposed by the Old Firm as they hit European heights in a fashion that many felt had long been consigned to another century.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s win over Lazio in Rome combined with a stunning success for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> against Porto at Ibrox raised the bar higher than it has been for at least a decade.</p>
      <p>Back jousting with the best, claiming some impressive scalps and showing up our own barren domestic landscape – bar the big two – as the rest struggle to pay the piper.</p>
      <p>A conversation with Brian Rice started it all a few months back. The Hamilton boss claimed the gulf between the Old Firm and the rest is the biggest it has been for almost half a century. Impossible to compete, he said, minutes after watching his side being destroyed 5-0 at Ibrox.</p>

      <p>Hibs and Hearts would surely testify in his corner after the capital clubs were left battered and splattered across the Hampden surface last weekend in League Cup semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Non-events, utter dominance, it was only a case of how many for Celtic and Rangers in both games. That swatting aside of an Edinburgh elite who have become little more than nuisance value should have been mortifying. Not enough was made of the capitulation. Hearts caretaker Austin MacPhee muttered something about needing to be better this weekend against St Mirren and Hibs had already decided to get rid of boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a>.</p>
      <p>Celtic booked a Europa League knockout stage place on Thursday and the Light Blues remain in with a shout of joining them after two massive results that moved Scotland to within one place of securing a second Champions League slot for season 2021-22.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>All something that should be celebrated and at last there’s a confidence shining out from our game we’ve become a force to be reckoned with again.</p>
      <p>But to use political election parlance, our provincial clubs will never find a way to defeat a status quo that meets the needs of the few instead of the many.</p>
      <p>Rangers have <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> to thank for setting the standard that puts both of them on a different stratosphere. Huge wages and a quality of player that is way beyond the rest is why drubbings will be dished out routinely.</p>
      <p>Motherwell currently hold the claim as best of the rest, sitting third in the table. Six points behind the leaders and achieving it on a relative shoestring.</p>
      <p>Here’s some context. Stephen Robinson squeezed the life out of the Fir Park coffers during the summer and enticed one of his top targets to sign on and become one of their top earners.</p>

      <p>Without breaching a confidence it was take home pay a few hundred pounds shy of £2000 a week.</p>
      <p>An income that is comparable to some of the Old Firm’s reserve squad.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen’s new state-of-the-art training facility may help attract a better standard of operator but they will be few and far between as the Old Firm continue to pull out of sight.</p>
      <p>There will be the odd show of defiance but trips to Pittodrie, Tynecastle, Easter Road and the rest have become a phoney war.</p>
      <p>The battle for the championship boils down to which of the Old Firm avoid the banana skins better.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It’s a duopoly that will only become more stable and stronger, especially if another Champions League place becomes available for the side finishing second.</p>
      <p>Wins against the likes of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> and Porto are stunning results for Scottish clubs in the grand scheme of things.</p>
      <p>They’re real statements of intent that Scottish football’s period of <br/>rehabilitation is almost over.</p>
      <p>It has taken Rangers time to get their act together but now the Old Firm are going toe to toe on these shores and beyond.</p>
      <p>Dickens wrote a phrase that summed up the part the Premiership’s also-rans are playing in making life so much easier for our big two in Europe. “No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.”</p>
