      <h1>IMF approves $450 mln loan tranche for Pakistan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:54:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:54</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - The IMF on Friday praised Pakistan s economic performance and agreed on next steps, paving the way for release of another portion of a $6 billion, three-year loan package.</p>
      <p>Once the International Monetary Fund board gives the go ahead, the Washington-based lender will provide $450 million to help right the South Asian nation s economy, on top of the $1 billion released in July.</p>
      <p>"Despite a difficult environment, program implementation has been good, and all performance criteria for end-September were met with comfortable margins," IMF mission chief Ernesto Ramirez Rigo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The official, who led a team that spent two weeks in the country, pointed to signs of improving economic stability, including the move to a flexible exchange rate, and slowing inflation that is projected to fall under 12 percent next year.</p>
      <p>But he said more work was needed to target money laundering and on terror finance controls.</p>
      <p>Approval of the first performance review of Pakistan s policy program will also help unlock "significant funding from bilateral and multilateral partners."</p>
      <p>Under the loan program, the government agreed to slash civil expenditure and freeze military spending while promising to substantially raise revenues to stem a yawning fiscal deficit, and pledging to collect 5.5 trillion rupees ($36 billion) in taxes.<br/> </p>
