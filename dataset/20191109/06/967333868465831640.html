      <p>Valentine Monnier, a former French model, accused Roman Polanski, whose movie on 19th century French artillery officer Alfred Dreyfus is set to premiere next week, of assaulting her at a Swiss ski resort in 1975, almost 45 years ago, Le Parisien <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/une-francaise-accuse-le-realisateur-roman-polanski-de-viol-08-11-2019-8189568.php">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The actress said the Oscar-winning director <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907271076379493-once-upon-a-time-in-pedowood-polanski-epstein-star-in-altered-billboard-for-tarantinos-film/">assaulted and raped</a> her when she stayed at Polanski’s chalet in Gstaad. She was 18 at the time of the alleged incident.</p>
      <blockquote>“I had no links with him, neither personal nor professional, and hardly knew him,” the ex-model told Le Parisien, claiming the incident was “extremely violent.”</blockquote>
      <p>“He beat me until I surrendered and then raped me, making me do all sorts of things,” she stated.</p>
      <p>The model said she later told two women about the incident; her best friend Isabelle and another who would become a long term Polanski girlfriend, The Times of Israel reported. Both women were contacted by Le Parisien and confirmed Monnier telling them about the event.</p>
      <p>Monnier’s story <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201710041057945777-polanski-teen-rape-allegations/">is yet another in a row of allegations</a> against the 86-year-old director. Polanski has been accused of rape on at least three occasions: in 2010, and twice in 2017. With each allegation, the date reaches further back, as they supposedly happened in the years 1983, 1973 and 1972, correspondingly.</p>
      <blockquote>Polanski’s s lawyer, Herve Temime, said the director “firmly denies all accusations of rape,” adding that the allegations “which date back 45 years have never been reported to judicial authorities.”</blockquote>
      <p>Polanski, creator of “Rosemary’s Baby” and “Chinatown,” <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201805031064128668-us-academy-oscar-polanski-cosby-expelled/">admitted statutory rape</a> in 1977 and spent 48 days in custody to undergo psychiatric evaluation before being released, according to The Times of Israel.  One year later, convinced that a judge was about to scrap his plea deal, Polanski fled to France and remained, evading repeated US attempts to have him extradited.</p>
      <p>Following the 2017 scandal which resulted in film producer Harvey Weinstein being charged with numerous rapes, many male celebrities were accused of rape, including actor Kevin Spacey, who became a pariah in entertainment industry, despite that all charges against him were dropped in July 2019. Polanski’s movie ‘J'accuse’, alternatively titled ‘An Officer and a Spy,’ is set to hit the theatres on 13 November in France and 21 November in Italy. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival on 30 August this year.</p>
