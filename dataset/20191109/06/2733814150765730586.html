      <p>Slashdot reader <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/~dryriver">dryriver</a> writes: <i>Using a compressed disk drive or hard drive has been possible for decades now. But when you do this in software or the operating system, the CPU does the compressing and decompressing. Are there any hard drives or SSDs that can work compressed using their <i>own</i> built in hardware for this? <br/><br/>I'm not talking about realtime video compression using a hardware CODEC chip -- this does exist and is used -- but rather a storage medium that compresses every possible type of file using its own compression and decompression realtime hardware without a significant speed hit.</i> <br/>Leave your best thoughts and suggestions in the comments. Are there storage devices with hardware compressiong built in?</p>
