      <h1>St Johnstone hero Jim Weir on the life-changing car-crash horror that led to his Forfar exit</h1>
      <h2>It takes a strong man to recognise his own vulnerabilities and Weir stepped down to focus on his physical and mental health.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Jim Weir is an ironman veteran who needed a brush with death to realise he is only made of skin and bone.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone </a>defender last weekend took the bravest decision of his career, maybe even his life, when he quit his job as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/forfar">Forfar </a>boss.</p>
      <p>It takes a strong man to recognise his own vulnerabilities and Weir stepped down to focus on his physical and mental health in the aftermath of a horrendous car accident in September.</p>
      <p>The strangest thing is he looks the picture of health as he walks in for coffee at the start of a busy day as a sales manager with Sheridan, a leading fabricator of kitchen granite and quartz. At the age of 50, he’s almost a stone lighter than in his playing days as a stalwart central defender with Saints, Hearts and Hamilton Accies.</p>

      <p>His features are as chiselled as the products he sells to builders’ merchants and DIY outlets, racking up 40,000 miles with his work and football commitments every year.</p>
      <p>He eats a vegan diet, has completed more than 30 triathlons and competes in ironman challenges, the most recent of which in Austria last year saw him run a marathon, cycle 112 miles and swim for 2.4 miles in 11 hours 29 minutes.</p>
      <p>He has raised more than £7500 for good causes in the process but, for now, charity begins at home as he focuses on his own well-being before returning to the game after his brush with death.</p>
      <p>A 79-year-old man has been reported for road traffic offences after Weir, with assistant Barry Sellars sitting alongside, allegedly ploughed headlong into him on the M9 near Stirling. Weir said: “I was passing a lorry at 70mph and someone hit me head on at 50mph and although I didn’t come out with broken bones or cuts there is still a lot of trauma.</p>

      <p>“I’m receiving physio for my back and shoulders, my alignment has been affected and so has my eyesight. It was probably at its worse about three or four days after the accident.</p>
      <p>“My family grew concerned as I was losing my memory, as well as weight, and I wasn’t sleeping.</p>
      <p>“There has been a fear of driving, an inability to run or even do a press up. In truth I should have taken a couple of months off at the time but I manage as I played and that means carrying on through injury when your side is struggling.</p>
      <p>“However, now it’s time to take a break and get physically and mentally back in shape.”</p>
      <p>Weir is the only man to manage all four Angus clubs and his impact at Forfar was significant as he saved them from the drop in his first year then took them into the play-offs in the next.</p>
      <p>They reached the knockout stages of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> for the first time this term but the accident changed everything, not least in Weir’s body and mind.</p>
      <p>They say your life can flash in front of your eyes at such moments and Weir, stoic and remarkably free of animosity towards the other driver, would not disagree.</p>

      <p>He said: “I remember passing the lorry and seeing his lights flashing and hearing his horn blaring.</p>
      <p>“I still remember the bang. It all went into slow motion, with the car hitting things and the airbags going off. It almost felt as if I was in space.</p>
      <p>“The impact and noise when the car is spinning is such you don’t expect to wake up. It happens so slowly and when the car stops you first think, ‘Am I still alive?’</p>
      <p>“No one knows what death is like so you don’t actually know if you’re dead and in another world. I <br/>sometimes wonder how I didn’t see the other car. I haven’t seen the police report yet.</p>
      <p>“I’ve admitted this to only one or two people. Sometimes, when I’ve been at a low ebb I wish I hadn’t come out of the accident.</p>
      <p>“I should never admit that but it’s almost like a guilt.</p>
      <p>“That’s when I knew I needed to take a rest and clear my head.”</p>

      <p>The football community has rallied round, especially in the lower leagues. Dick Campbell, a rival boss for whom Weir has utter respect, has demanded to buy him a beer in return for a coaching session at Arbroath.</p>
      <p>Stranraer boss Stevie Farrell has been on the phone, along with Elgin chairman Graham Tatters and a host of others, which Weir has found humbling.</p>
      <p>He added: “The support from the football community has been tremendous but I don’t want anyone to worry about me as this is not a life-or-death situation. I’m simply taking time away to recover fully and assess what’s out there because as much as I respect the people at Forfar, I also didn’t believe there was quite the long-term support for me as manager based on what I’d done before.</p>
      <p>“By taking a step back at this stage I would hope to be back in the game within maybe even six weeks or early in the new year. I know I will return refreshed and feeling the way I was before the accident.”</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Weir continues to work hard at the day job and will take in St Johnstone against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> today before watching a string of lower-league fixtures.</p>
      <p>Much more importantly, he’ll be using any spare time to his own advantage, putting fresh miles in his recovering legs and also hitting the gym as he gently toys with the idea of another ironman next summer.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, he hasn’t lost his sense of humour either as he picks up the car keys for his temporary vehicle and heads off for an appointment at Wickes.</p>
      <p>He said: “My VW Passat was written off in the accident and I’ve just been told my new company car will be arriving next week. I picked it myself – a Volvo. After all this I want the safest car on the road!”</p>
