      <h1>Steven Gerrard's Rangers have Walter Smith's spirit and something special is happening - Barry Ferguson</h1>
      <h2>Barry compared the win over Porto to the victory over Werder Bremen in the 2008 UEFA Cup run.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Ferguson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/barry-ferguson/</a></address>
      <p>Watching Rangers’ win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/porto">Porto</a> at Ibrox on Thursday night, my mind drifted back to a match on our run to the 2008 UEFA Cup Final.</p>
      <p>It was the home victory against Werder Bremen in the last-16 that season where both the 2-0 scoreline and one of the scorers was the same.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-davis">Steven Davis</a> scored the second against the Germans that night as he did when he put the seal on the win against the Portuguese after an unbelievable strike from Alfredo Morelos to open the scoring the other night.</p>
      <p>As I was watching the match my mind drifted back to the Bremen tie because I could see similarities in how the game panned out.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga outfit were a good side and we didn’t dominate. It was the same for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard’s</a> side against Porto in what was a fantastic result.</p>
      <p>The game was on a knife-edge and you felt that whoever took the lead would probably go on to win and Gers did that – just as we did against Werder Bremen thanks to Daniel Cousin.</p>

      <p>That’s what you need to do against good European teams, to ride your luck at times and take your opportunities when they come along.</p>
      <p>And when I look at this Rangers team I now see the spirit of Walter Smith’s 2008 team running through it which is the most pleasing thing.</p>
      <p>I’m not saying they are going to go all the way to Gdansk next May the way we got to Manchester – there is still work to be done just to reach the knockout stages – but the team I played in was so well drilled and tough to break down, even if we weren’t pleasing on the eye, and this side is similar.</p>
      <p>They know how to win games which breeds confidence and you can see it flowing through the team. Yes, you’ve got to ride your luck a bit at times and Glen Kamara was forced to clear one off the line against Porto.</p>
      <p>But that’s what happens when you play against quality European sides and the main thing is there’s a real togetherness and bond that we had 2008.</p>
      <p>We were a strong unit with big characters in the dressing room. We had Allan McGregor and Davis who are back at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and can pass on all of their experience to the current squad.</p>
      <p>We had good players but, crucially, we also had leaders like Lee McCulloch and Davie Weir and I can see that now with guys taking responsibility.</p>

      <p>I look at Davis, Ryan Jack coming onto a game, Ryan Kent a matchwinner and Alfredo Morelos in the form of his life, the never-say-die attitude and I see something special is happening.</p>
      <p>And of course you have the manager and assistant manager Gary McAllister who themselves have unbelievable experience from their top level playing careers.</p>
      <p>Those two deserve huge credit for bringing back nights like Thursday to Ibrox because that’s what Rangers is all about.</p>
      <p>With two games to go in Group G, a win in Feyenoord would take Rangers through to the last-32.</p>
      <p>And that tie in Rotterdam will bring around another familiar face in my old Rangers boss Dick Advocaat after he returned to the dug-out.</p>
      <p>He’s 72-years-old now and sometimes I wonder how long he can go on for.</p>
      <p>De Kuip is a terrific place to play football and I was lucky enough to score in both legs when we were edged out 4-3 on aggregate by them in the UEFA Cup last-16 in 2002.</p>
      <p>It’s a place where, as a player, you should go and embrace it. I loved it, the atmosphere was electric and that’s what you want to be involved in.</p>

      <p>This is what playing for Rangers is all about. I played in Porto myself, another fantastic stadium, but De Kuip is more hostile with the fans chanting non-stop and I loved it.</p>
      <p>Of course, my main concern is Rangers as a former player but Thursday was a good night for Scottish football with Celtic’s win against Lazio in Rome before Gerrard’s players even took to the pitch.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt everyone at Ibrox – fans and players – would have been aware of the result and that can be a factor in driving them on.</p>
      <p>I’m not saying that’s the only reason Rangers won but it’s something that’s in the back of your mind where you think to yourself ‘Right, we need to go and emulate them’</p>
      <p>The two Old Firm clubs are always measured against each other and in this case that can only be a good thing for Scottish football as a whole.</p>
      <p>You probably have to go back to 2007 to find a time when Rangers and Celtic managed victories over clubs of such stature as Porto and Lazio in the same midweek.</p>
      <p>I was involved in the Rangers side who won 3-0 in Lyon in the Champions League and just 24 hours later Celtic won against AC Milan at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>That same season was also the last time Scottish football had two clubs - we had three with Aberdeen also involved - in Europe beyond Christmas and it could be the same again.</p>
      <p>Celtic have secured their place in the knockout stage of the Europa League and I have every confidence Rangers can join them by getting big results and the points required from their final two fixtures against Young Boys and Feyenoord.</p>
