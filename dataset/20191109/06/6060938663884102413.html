      <p>NEW DELHI: Right-arm pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bhuvneshwar-kumar">Bhuvneshwar Kumar</a> might not be playing at present for India but he is keeping a tab on his teammates through social media.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, India registered an emphatic eight-wicket win over Bangladesh in the second T20I in Rajkot to level the series. After the victory, opener <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shikhar-dhawan">Shikhar Dhawan</a> took to Instagram to share a video where he, Yuzvendra Chahal and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Khaleel-Ahmed">Khaleel Ahmed</a> can be seen recreating a scene from recently released Bollywood movie '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Housefull">Housefull</a>' starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>.</p>
      <p>Soon after Dhawan posted the video along with the caption '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bala">Bala</a> ke side effects', Bhuvneshwar came up with a cheeky response. "Bhulne k acting k kya zarurt wo to natural talent hai (why pretending to be forgetful, that is your natural talent)" he wrote.</p>
