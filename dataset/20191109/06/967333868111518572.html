        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) – US State Secretary Mike Pompeo on Saturday said the recent United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) vote in support of a resolution calling on the United States to end its blockade against Cuba hurt the proud people of the Latin American country.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The UNGA has overwhelmingly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911051077225598-us-pressures-un-members-to-vote-against-cuba-anti-blockade-resolution---havana/">adopted the resolution against the United States</a>’ economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba. The document was supported by 187 countries, while Brazil and Israel voted against it and Colombia and Ukraine abstained.</blockquote>

      <p>​The state secretary said the United States was honored that Brazil and Israel joined Washington in supporting Cubans' rights.</p>
      <p>The potential of the island nation <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911011077195434-colombian-airline-avianca-announces-suspension-of-flight-sales-to-cuba-amid-us-sanctions/">would not be realized</a> "until the Castro regime stops mismanaging the economy and repressing the Cuban people", Pompeo argued.</p>
      <p>Cuba has been subject to a Cold War-era embargo imposed by the United States, which leaves the country's economy in crisis. The UNGA has adopted multiple resolutions calling on Washington to end its blockade against Havana.</p>
      <p>Still, the restrictions remain in place and have been tightened over the years.</p>
      <p>Washington and Havana saw rapprochement under former US President Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>However, the Trump administration <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201906041075623266-us-visa-trip-cuba/">announced a U-turn</a> in the policy toward Cuba, opting to retain the embargo on the Caribbean nation.</p>
