      <p><b>SAN FRANCISCOÂ (AP)</b> - Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg is staring down at pedestrians in the heart of San Francisco where an artist is painting a massive mural of the Nobel Peace Prize nominee.</p>
      <p>Argentine muralist Andres Iglesias, who signs his art with the pseudonym Cobre, is set to finish the artwork of the Swedish 16-year-old in Union Square by next week, SFGate reported Friday.</p>
      <p>Iglesias told SFGate that he's donating his time to complete the work and that he hopes the mural helps people realize "we have to take care of the world."</p>
      <p>He had also painted a mural of Robin Williams in downtown San Francisco that has since been demolished.</p>
      <p>Cobre said he was searching for a building for a new mural when environmental nonprofit oneatmosphere.org approached him about the project.</p>
      <p>Paul Scott, the nonprofit's executive director, said he believed the artist would be perfect to create the first of what his group hopes will be a series of works honoring climate-change activists.</p>
