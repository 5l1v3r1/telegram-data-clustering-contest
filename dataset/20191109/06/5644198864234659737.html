      <p>WASHINGTON: The IMF on Friday (Nov 8) praised Pakistan's economic performance and agreed on next steps, paving the way for release of another portion of a US$6 billion, three-year loan package.</p>
      <p>Once the International Monetary Fund board gives the go ahead, the Washington-based lender will provide US$450 million to help right the South Asian nation's economy, on top of the US$1 billion released in July.</p>

      <p>"Despite a difficult environment, program implementation has been good, and all performance criteria for end-September were met with comfortable margins," IMF mission chief Ernesto Ramirez Rigo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The official, who led a team that spent two weeks in the country, pointed to signs of improving economic stability, including the move to a flexible exchange rate, and slowing inflation that is projected to fall under 12 per cent next year.</p>
      <p>But he said more work was needed to target money laundering and on terror finance controls.</p>
      <p>Approval of the first performance review of Pakistan's policy program will also help unlock "significant funding from bilateral and multilateral partners."</p>
      <p>Under the loan program, the government agreed to slash civil expenditure and freeze military spending while promising to substantially raise revenues to stem a yawning fiscal deficit, and pledging to collect 5.5 trillion rupees (US$36 billion) in taxes.</p>
