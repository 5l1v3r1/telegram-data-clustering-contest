      <h1>Steve Bruce relieved to have avoided sack after Newcastle's start to Premier League season</h1>
      <h2>Bruce said he is always glad to get through first two international breaks as Newcastle target back-to-back wins today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T06:04:44+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 06:04</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Bird, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/simon-bird/</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce admits he is relieved to have dodged the sack so far this season.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> boss says his first aim is to survive through the October and November international breaks, when clubs often wield the axe if their side under-performs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> ’s Javi Gracia is the only top-flight coach to depart the managerial hot seat so far this season, with 17 bosses across all four divisions losing their jobs.</p>
      <p>Bruce’s men were in the bottom three last month but surprise wins against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> have lifted them out of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> says that has given him breathing space to push on with what he needs to do.</p>

      <p>Newcastle host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> today looking for back-to-back wins to lift them to a “solid” 15 points, and Bruce said: “Some of us look at October and November and think we have gone past that hurdle of getting the sack.</p>
      <p>“How often does it happen? It gives the clubs two weeks to get a new manager and it always seems to happen then.</p>
      <p>“So all of us say, ‘Let’s get through that first one in September’. You usually get away with that one.</p>
      <p>“October is a bad month, and this one was flaming awful! This time last year I was on a beach.</p>

      <p>“In management, you want a decent start – it helps everything you’re trying to do – and we can’t all have one.</p>
      <p>“For me this period has always been about getting an accumulation of points for that crucial month over the Christmas period.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he thought he was vulnerable after United lost 5-0 to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in September, Bruce said: “5-0? Pressure? You ask how can I get them to react? I think that’s when you earn your dough.”</p>
      <p>Bruce isn’t getting carried away with being above the drop zone, and needs to get his expensive strike force scoring regularly.</p>

      <p>The return of Jonjo Shelvey – who “posted massive physical stats” at West Ham after a “kick up the backside” in losing his place – will help creativity in midfield.</p>
      <p>Newcastle’s home crowd could be as low as 42,000 today and 800 fans have bought scarves to protest against owner Mike Ashley.</p>
      <p>But Bruce says he has his “dream job” and would love to fill the stadium. “We’ve taken small steps,” he added. “I take nothing for granted.”</p>
