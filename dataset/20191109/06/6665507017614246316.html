      <p>Soon after a five-judge <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-hindu-trust-gets-possession-of-babri-site-muslims-granted-alternative-site_in_5dc64178e4b0fcfb7f6696a8">delivered its verdict</a> on the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Ayodhya/">Ayodhya</a> case, reactions from the government and other political leaders started trickling in.  </p>
      <p>The top court on Saturday ruled that the disputed site will be given to the Hindu parties to construct a temple and directed that a five-acre alternative site will be allotted to Muslim litigants to construct a mosque.</p>
      <p>Union minister <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Nitin-Gadkari/">Nitin Gadkari</a> was the first from the government to react to the judgment. “Everyone must accept the Supreme Court judgment and maintain peace,” he said. </p>
