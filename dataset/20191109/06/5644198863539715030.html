      <p>REUTERS: The We Company, owner of office-space sharing company WeWork, disclosed on Friday (Nov 8) it will divest all non-core businesses and reduce headcount across its ventures as part of a 90-day plan.</p>
      <p>In an investor presentation dated OctÂ 11, but made public on Friday, the company said the non-core businesses being divested include Meetup, The Wing, and Space IQ.</p>

      <p>The company which said it had reached 580,000 memberships as of third quarter, excluding India, expects the job cuts to occur across its ventures, general &amp; administrative, and growth-related functions.</p>
      <p>WeWork in September withdrew its initial public offering after the SoftBank-backed startup ousted founder Adam Neumann as its chief executive officer.</p>
      <p>The company had failed to excite investors who raised concerns about its burgeoning losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term.</p>
      <p>The company said on Friday it would have "proven executives" in its membership-focused, subscription-based businesses.</p>
      <p>WeWork will now focus on its enterprise customers, instead of small and mid-sized businesses which include start-ups.</p>
