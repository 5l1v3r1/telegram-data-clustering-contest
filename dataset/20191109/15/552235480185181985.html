      <h1>Harry Kewell attends Hibs game but managerial candidate insists he's there as a 'friend of a friend'</h1>
      <h2>The former Liverpool and Leeds United player is in attendance for the St Johnstone game.</h2>

      <p>Harry Kewell has been spotted at McDiarmid Park after links to the vacant <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> manager post.</p>
      <p>The Easter Road club sacked <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> earlier this week after a nightmare run which saw Hibs go winless since the opening day of the Premiership season.</p>
      <p>Academy chief Eddie May is in charge for today's game as the hunt for a replacement goes on, and one of the contenders will be in the stands for the trip to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> .</p>
      <p>Harry Kewell was linked with the role this week, and the Australian has been spotted taking pictures with fans outside the ground.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Sky Sports caught up with him outside the ground and the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> man played down the speculation.</p>
      <p>Kewell said: "I'm just here as a friend of a friend, I'm just watching.</p>
      <p>"I think it's a fantastic club. There's a lot clubs up for new managers and being out of work there's always speculation but like I said I'm just here to enjoy the game."</p>
      <p>Kewell has previously managed Crawley Town and Notts County but has been out of work since leaving the latter after just 14 games.</p>
