      <h1>Man Utd and Liverpool transfer target Kai Havertz 'prefers Real Madrid move'</h1>
      <h2>The Bayer Leverkusen star is also reportedly a target for the likes or Bayern Munich and Barcelona</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:53:55+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United and Liverpool have been dealt a potential blow in their pursuit of Kai Havertz, with the Bayer Leverkusen star reportedly favouring a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>
      <p>Havertz, 20, has emerged as one of Europe's hottest properties and is attracting the interest from the continent's biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>Although United are believed to be weighing up an Â£80million move for the winger, he is also understood to be a target for the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> .</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/175381-sergio-ramos-tiene-nuevo-vecino-florentino-perez-se-lo-quita-al-barca-ed">El Desmarque</a> claims that the Germany international would prefer a move to Barca's domestic rivals Real and has already held advanced discussions over a switch to the Bernabeu.</p>

      <p>The Spanish publication suggests he would rather join Los Blancos because he feels there would be more chances to earn first-team minutes in Zidane's side.</p>
      <p>Havertz has previously admitted that international team-mate Toni Kroos has joked about a move to the Spanish capital by telling him "the weather is always good in Madrid."</p>
      <p>After scoring 20 goals in all competitions for Leverkusen last season, several clubs have been keeping a close eye on the 20-year-old during the current campaign.</p>
      <p>And it is understood that a number of scouts were at the BayArena on Wednesday to watch him in action during the Bundesliga club's 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>Despite insisting he is currently focused on Leverkusen, Havertz also increased speculation that he could move to either Spain or England next summer by stating that he is open to playing outside Germany.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/11/05/5dc0f115ca47418c028b45c5.html">Marca</a> , he said: "In the I think I've picked up enough international experience at Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>"I know the rhythm of these international matches and I'm confident that I can go abroad at any moment and play at clubs outside of Germany.</p>
      <p>"For the moment, I want to have a good season. Afterwards, we'll see."</p>
