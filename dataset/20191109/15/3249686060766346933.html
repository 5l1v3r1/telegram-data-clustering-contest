      <p>Netizens, whether or not they support disbanding<a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/x1"> X1</a>, are criticizing the press over their attitude toward the group. In the short video clip below, one of the pressmen shouts out <i>"Can you wave hands for us?"</i> As the group didn't respond to the request, his colleague made a comment <i>"Wow, no one waved." </i>in a sneering way. </p>
      <p>Some comments include: </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I'm sure they would have come up with another ridiculous article if they actually waved upon the request." </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The group should disband to suffer less from the negativity like this."</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The way they speak is just so demeaning."</i>
      </p>
      <p>After the flood of comments, the initial video uploaded on the official YouTube channel of the media with the said voices is now edited with the background music. </p>
      <p>What do you think?</p>
