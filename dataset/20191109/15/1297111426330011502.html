      <h1>Opinion: Remembering Arthur Sutton and the fickle fortunes of war</h1>
      <h2>Veteran Regina journalist Will Chabun reflects on Arthur Sutton, a Saskatchewan pilot whose act of heroism didn't earn a Victoria Cross.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:00:05+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/will-chabun" target="_blank">Will Chabun</a></address>
      <p>You don’t get bored during a presentation by Hugh Halliday. This retired military officer and professional historian speaks with a wonderfully dry wit punctuated by anecdotes that make his points.</p>
      <p>At a presentation I heard in 1996, one of his stories illustrated the factors at work when a service member is nominated for a Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery in the British Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>Halliday illustrated that with the story of a naval aviator from Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Halliday’s point was that senior officers reviewing a nomination for the VC had to assure themselves the nominee went into a situation with the knowledge it was dangerous — and went ahead anyway.</p>
      <p>Pressed for time, Halliday did not talk more about that aviator. Contacted by email, Halliday apologized for not having more information. It was not until the arrival of new Internet sources and electronic books that I could assemble a portrait of the young naval aviator.</p>
      <p>His name was Arthur Sutton. He was raised in Saskatoon, an only child and attended City Park Collegiate. He joined the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve around 1940 and qualified the next year for pilot training at Kingston, ON.</p>

      <p>The Royal Navy had ruled the waves for centuries, but by the late 1930s, its Fleet Air Arm was in bad shape. Its aircraft were slow and clumsy, a full generation behind naval aircraft used by the U.S. and Japan. What successes the FAA had early in the war — the attack on the Italian fleet at Taranto and crippling the German battleship Bismarck — owed more to good planning and brave crews than to good equipment.</p>
      <p>Faster, better, American-built naval aircraft began arriving in the British inventory, along with a new generation of war-trained aviators, like “Bud” Sutton. He appears frequently and positively in a memoir by his squadron commander as a fun-loving young guy, aggressive like any good fighter pilot, but not reckless. He was skilled enough to have been “mentioned in dispatches” for his combat flying over the Indian Ocean in 1944.</p>

It’s a vintage naval plane, a Goodyear FG-1D Corsair owned by Vintage Wings of Canada. It was given its name because it bears markings that honour Lt. Robert Hampton Gray, a volunteer reservist in the Royal Canadian Navy who was given a posthumous Victoria Cross in the Second World War.

      <p>On Jan. 24, 1945, when British naval aircraft were hitting a complex of oil refineries on the Japanese-occupied island of Sumatra, Sutton sought to protect the strike force by making a strafing run on a nearby Japanese airfield — always a dangerous thing. He went back for a second, and then a third run before his Corsair fighter was hit and flew into a Japanese hangar, killing him and destroying it and all the aircraft inside. The air strikes that day cut Japan’s production of aviation gasoline by 75 per cent — no small victory.</p>

      <p>A recommendation for a Victoria Cross followed, leaving FAA officers with a thorny decision: Did Sutton, knowing his aircraft was badly damaged, deliberately guide it into the hangar — or was he was dead at the controls when his aircraft, by sheer happenstance, hit it?</p>
      <p>Because they “could not be assured that the action was deliberate,” senior naval officers turned down the recommendation. Sutton received no acknowledgment at all for the action that day. He is buried in an Allied cemetery in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Seven months later, Sutton’s buddy from training at Kingston, Lt. Robert Hampton Gray, was stalking a Japanese warship that was shooting back. He kept his badly damaged Corsair on course until he could drop a bomb onto the vessel, sinking it. He was killed when his aircraft crashed.</p>
      <p>Gray was awarded a Victoria Cross and is remembered today on memorials ranging from cadet units to a school to a new navy patrol vessel. There is even a memorial to him and his bravery in Japan.</p>
      <p>But as far as I’ve been able to determine, Sutton is almost unknown, even in his hometown.</p>
      <p>The fortunes of war are fickle indeed.</p>
