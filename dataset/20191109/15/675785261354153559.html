      <h1>Girl, 10, hailed hero after recording herself being sexually abused by parish priest</h1>
      <h2>Father Michele Mottola was only arrested this week when the footage was broadcast on a current affairs show in Italy</h2>

      <p>An Italian priest has been arrested after an 11-year-old girl recorded herself being sexually abused.</p>
      <p>The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, used the voice recorder on her phone to obtain proof after parishioners refused to believe her.</p>
      <p>Father Michele Mottola, based in Trentola Ducenta, near Naples, has now been arrested by police.</p>
      <p>“Do you want a kiss?” the priest is heard saying.</p>
      <p>As the girl protests, he apparently says: “There is no one here. Are you afraid? Kiss me, hug me.”</p>
      <p>In a second recording, after the sound of heavy breathing and the girl’s protests, he says: “Take this to dry yourself.”</p>
      <p>The girl played the recordings to two parishioners because she was too ashamed to tell her mother.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/predator-priest-jailed-after-10-yr-old-records-abuse-on-phone">Church Militant</a> , after the girl told the priest she had reported the matter to other parishioners, he said: "You didn't have to do it, because now they will understand other things. Things will get very bad. I will come to your home to talk to your parents."</p>
      <p>The priest also accused the girl of lying to her mother.</p>
      <p> He said: "You can tell lies. Did you understand you can lie? You're like Islamic suicide bombers, throwing a bomb, killing people and leaving. The mud ends up also on your family and on you."</p>
      <p>The parishioners eventually intervened and Marina's mother finally reported the matter to the bishop.</p>
      <p>Mottola was suspended by the Catholic Church in May but only arrested this week when the phone recording was broadcast on <a href="https://www.iene.mediaset.it/2019/news/arrestato-prete-abusi-bambina_582170.shtml">Le Iene</a> , a current affairs show in Italy.</p>
      <p>“I am proud of my daughter, she was more cunning than the priest,” the mother said on Le Iene.</p>
