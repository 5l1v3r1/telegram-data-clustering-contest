        <b>We all remember <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> winning a Formula 3 race aged 16 in May of 2014, becoming the youngest driver ever to do so, but that record could be shattered in due time, as 13-year-old talent Juju Noda is set to compete in Danish Formula 4 next year!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The name Noda should ring a bell for F1 fans, as Juju is the daughter of former F1 driver Hideki Noda, who was active in the sport in 1994.</p>

      <p>Juju already has some experience driving a Formula 3 car, but the regulations state there is a minimum age to compete in the junior category, which is 15. This means she could participate in F3 in 2021, which makes Danish Formula 4 a good way to prepare for 2021.</p>
      <p>The Japanese prodigy already has experience competing in similar equipment to F3, as she took part in the Japanese under 17 championships. She drove in that championship for her dad's team: Noda Racing.</p>
