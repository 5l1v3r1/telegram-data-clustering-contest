      <p><b>LOWELL, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Officials in a northern Massachusetts city are warning about a spike in fatal drug overdoses.</p>
      <p>The Lowell Sun reports that Lowell officials say there have been four fatal overdoses in the last nine days.</p>
      <p>Lowell Fire Chief Jeffrey Winward said Friday that a lethal batch of illegal opioids is likely to blame.</p>
      <p>He urged those dealing with addiction to avoid using drugs alone and suggested residents check in often with family members battling addiction.</p>
      <p>The warning is the second issued by Lowell officials this year. In January, the city saw four fatal overdoses over five days.</p>
      <p>Opioid overdose deaths have continued to fall in the Lowell area.</p>
      <p>Middlesex County has had 156 overdose deaths this year, down from 195 in 2018, 222 in 2017, and 251 in 2016.</p>
