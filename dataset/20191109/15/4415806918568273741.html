      <p>Luas trams are running again with delays in the west of the city after being suspended for eight hours earlier today.</p>
      <p>Services were cancelled before 7am, with Luas operator Transdev saying it was due to a "technical problem".</p>
      <p>A replacement bus service served some stops, and passengers were told Dublin Bus would accept rail tickets.</p>
      <h3>Trams stopped on large part of Luas Red Line due to 'technical problem'</h3>
      <p>All trams are stopped on a large part of the Luas Red Line this morning because of a "technical problem".</p>
      <p>There are no services running from either Tallaght or Saggart as far as Blackhorse.</p>
      <p>Luas operator Transdev says "alternative buses" are serving the stops, and Dublin Bus is accepting tram tickets.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Red Line passengers were advised that "there is currently no Luas operating between Tallaght / Saggart - Blackhorse due to a technical fault.</p>
