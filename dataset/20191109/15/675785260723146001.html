      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> couldn't stop smiling as he ditched his healthy diet to sneak a cheeky beer and a cigarette on a night out in London.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> boss, 60, has lost an incredible 1.5 stone by becoming a vegan and embracing a new exercise regime.</p>
      <p>However, he couldn't hide his delight as he clenched a cigarette between his teeth and clutched a bottle of beer after a night out with partner Lauren Silverman.</p>
      <p>Simon flashed a huge grin in the car and continued puffing away in the back of his luxury ride.</p>
      <p>The couple had been attending the Shooting Star Ball in West London, and it looks like they had a fun evening.</p>
      <p>After deciding to overhaul his lifestyle, Simon was advised to give up booze along with sweet treats and bread.</p>

      <p>In an interview with Extra, he explained: "I went to see this guy who’s very well-known.</p>
      <p>"And he said to me, after doing some blood work, 'You can’t have red meat, dairy, sugar, bread or gluten.'</p>
      <p>"I’m thinking, 'What about alcohol?' And he said, 'Maybe not quite as much as you had before.' And I did it and I stuck to it and it’s easy."</p>

      <p>However, he hasn't given p booze completely as his Britain's Got Talen co-star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amanda-holden">Amanda Holden</a> revealed Simon had switched to low alcohol "skinny lager".</p>
      <p>During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, she said: "He’s drinking lightweight beers, that’s the secret.</p>
      <p>"And I tasted it because I thought it was gonna taste, like, naff. Actually it’s quite decent. You could take a tip from him!"</p>
