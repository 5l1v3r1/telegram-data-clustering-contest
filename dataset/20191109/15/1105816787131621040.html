      <p>Pakistani cueist Muhammad Asif won his second world title after beating Philippines player Jefrey Roda 8-5 in the final of IBSF World Snooker Championship 2019 played in Turkey’s Antalya on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He completed the best-of-15 frames triumph with scores of 68-35, 88-0, 69-17, 28-73, 5-118, 93-0, 69-1, 72-57, 10-93, 77-04, 21-65, 54-66 and 68-51.</p>
      <p>Asif, who hails from Faisalabad, had won his <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/474361/ibsf-world-championship-asif-clinches-world-snooker-crown/">first world title</a> in 2012 in Bulgaria. His rival Roda also secured any medal for his country after a gap of 27 years.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani cueist appeared on track to bag an easy victory after winning first three frames in a quick succession. However, the Philippines player made a strong comeback with a century break of 105 in the fourth frame, according to the <a href="http://www.ibsf.info/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=1040:asif-ng-on-yee-sukakree-are-world-champions-2019&amp;Itemid=180">match report</a> on IBSF’s official website.</p>

      <p>Both players then won four frames each to reach 7-5 before entering into the crucial 13th frame, in which Roda fought hard but Asif held his nerve to come on top of his opponent and won the match 8-5.</p>
      <p>Asif defeated Thailand’s Kritsanut Lertsattayathorn 7-0 in the semifinal on Friday. He completed the victory with a score of 88-41, 65-20, 86-35, 54-02, 73-17, 69-51 and 78-77.</p>
      <p>The Pakistani cueist, in a message, said he was dedicating his victory to the Pakistani nation and the Kashmiri brethren. “This wasn’t an easy event at all. But I remained focused as I was determined to win for my country,” he said.</p>
