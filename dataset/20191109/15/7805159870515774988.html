      <h1>ASUS recruits Android 10 beta testers for the ROG Phone II</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:39:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mishaalrahman/" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a></address>
      <p>Last week, ASUS started rolling out the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-6-android-10-update/">stable Android 10 update for the ZenFone 6/6Z</a>, making it the first ASUS smartphone to run Android 10 software. The ZenFone 6 isn’t ASUS’ latest flagship smartphone, though. The <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-rog-phone-ii-specs-features-pricing-availability/">ROG Phone II</a> is currently the cream of the crop in ASUS’ smartphone lineup, and like the ZenFone 6, it launched with ZenUI 6 on top of Android 9 Pie. Since the first generation ROG Phone has yet to get a single major Android OS update, ROG Phone II users were worried about the update prospects for their device. We have good news to share, though: ASUS is now recruiting users to beta test the Android 10 update for the ROG Phone II.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/rog-phone-2/how-to/android-10-beta-testers-required-t3999931">spotted</a> by users on our forums, an ASUS employee <a href="https://zentalk.asus.com/en/discussion/12751/rog-phone-2-beta-tester-join-to-experience-android-10">published a thread</a> on the ZenTalk Forums to recruit Android 10 beta testers for the ZS660KL model. That model name corresponds to the 12GB RAM/512GB storage model sold internationally and not the 8GB RAM/128GB storage Tencent model sold in China. The Tencent model receives updates separately from the international model, though the updates themselves bring most of the same features. Users on our forums figured out how to flash the international software onto the Tencent model, but we aren’t sure if a converted ROG Phone II will be able to flash the Android 10 beta update.</p>
      <p>Regardless, if you’re interested in participating in this beta program, you’ll have to be an active member of the ZenTalk Forums, provide ASUS your IMEI/Serial Number, and post regular feedback about bugs on a restricted forum for beta testers. You can sign up for the beta program <a href="https://www.asus.com/zentalk/plugin.php?id=ques&amp;op=viewques&amp;qid=4&amp;lrid=7">here</a>.</p>

      <p>ASUS <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/asus-zenfone-6-android-q-beta-testing/">first recruited beta testers</a> for the ZenFone 6’s Android 10 update on July 24th, 2019. They rolled out the stable Android 10 update for that device on November 3rd, 2019—about 3 months after recruiting beta testers. They also recruited Android 10 beta testers for the ZenFone 5Z on August 23rd, 2019 but have yet to roll out the stable update for that device. However, now that they’ve completed the Android 10 update for the ZenFone 6, it shouldn’t take them much longer to bring the update to the ZenFone 5Z or ROG Phone II. We’ll let you know when that happens, though.</p>
