      <h1>'What I said was accurate': Sen. Kennedy defends calling Pelosi 'dumb'</h1>

      <p>Sen. John Kennedy defended himself for having called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi "dumb" during a Wednesday night <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/it-must-suck-to-be-that-dumb-louisiana-sen-kennedy-savages-nancy-pelosi">rally with President Trump</a> in Louisiana.</p>
      <p>Joining the president on stage to urge state voters to support Republicans and Trump in upcoming elections, the Louisiana Republican said, "In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history. And do you know what our Democratic friends have done for him? Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him. I don’t mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb."</p>
      <p>During a Friday appearance on <i>America's Newsroom</i>, Kennedy reiterated that the effort to impeach the president by Pelosi-led House Democrats was "dumb."</p>
      <p>"Well, I didn't mean disrespect,” Kennedy said. "But I do think what I said was accurate." The outspoken, first-term senator has been a consistent supporter of Trump and joined him at the Wednesday rally to endorse Republican Eddie Rispone for governor.</p>
      <p>"Let me say it again: I think that what Speaker Pelosi is doing here is not only dumb, but it's dangerous," Kennedy continued on Friday. "It's a partisan impeachment, clearly. All impeachments, I guess, are political. But this one's 100% political, and it's going to establish a new norm for America that I think is bad for us."</p>
      <p>"Due process should matter," Kennedy said. "And I think Speaker Pelosi intends to give the president a fair and impartial firing squad, and she made up her mind before she saw the facts."</p>
