      <p>A PDF file is one of the most widely used document types. It can be shared across multiple platforms, compressed into a smaller size easily, and cannot be edited without leaving a digital footprint. These are some of the reasons that you’ll see PDFs used for legal documents like contracts and such. You can create your own PDFs straight from <a href="https://9to5google.com/guides/google-docs/">documents in Google Docs</a> a few different ways.</p>
      <h3>Download a document as a PDF</h3>
      <p>If you have a document that you are creating in Google Docs or one you’re uploading from your local drive, you can easily convert it to a PDF file and download it. This lets you save it and then do with it what you wish.</p>
      <p>Head to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs website</a> and sign in. Then just follow these simple steps to convert the document.</p>
