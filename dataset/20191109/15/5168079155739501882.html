      <h1>Chile: Protesters burn university, loot church</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T15:31:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">DW</a></address>
      <p>Around 75,000 people took to the streets in Santiago on Friday as part of ongoing anti-government protests in Chile. Local press reported the mostly peaceful demonstration as the second-largest since the protests broke out three weeks ago.<br/><br/>Hooded protesters also looted a Roman Catholic church in Santiago near the main site of the demonstration. They reportedly dragged statues of Jesus and furniture out onto the street and burned them.<br/><br/>Thousands gathered at Santiago's Plaza Italia square where they chanted and held banners. Smoke billowed from the campus of a nearby university, where protesters started a fire.<br/><br/>Police had previously set up barricades in front of the university to attempt to limit damage.</p>
      <p><b>Why are Chileans protesting?</b><br/><br/>Protests began in the Latin American country in a dispute over a hike in subway fares in October, but have since evolved into an outcry over a wide range of social issues from pensions to government corruption.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Police used water cannon and rubber bullets to disperse protesters on Friday. Recent attempts by President Sebastian Pinera to appease protesters and to threaten them with a clamp down on vandals and looters have apparently not been heeded.<br/><br/>Protesters have renamed the central square "Dignity Plaza."<br/><br/>At least 20 have died and 2,500 have been injured since the protests began.</p>
