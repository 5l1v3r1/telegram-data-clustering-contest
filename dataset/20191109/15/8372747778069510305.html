      <p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. â€” A Lee County resident received a call from a male who identified himself as a Lee County Sheriff's Office Deputy. During the call, the citizen questioned the caller as to his real identity, and the caller hung up.</p>
      <p>The citizen called back and was directed to an answering service claiming to be "The County Sheriff's Office." When the citizen selected the option to speak to investigations, the same male answered. After the citizen questioned the male caller about his intentions again, he hung up.</p>
      <p>During these calls, the male impersonating a deputy did not have the opportunity to request anything from the citizen. A member of the Lee County Sheriff's Office will never contact citizens over the telephone to request money or any compensation.</p>
      <p>If you receive a call like this, hang up immediately and call The Lee County Sheriff's Office to report it at (239) 477-1000.</p>
