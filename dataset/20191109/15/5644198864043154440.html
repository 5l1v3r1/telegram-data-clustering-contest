      <p>NEW DELHI: India's top court cleared the way on Saturday (Nov 9) for a Hindu temple to be constructed at a hotly disputed holy site, in a huge victory for Hindu nationalists under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the site in Ayodhya in northern India, where Hindu mobs destroyed a 460-year-old mosque in 1992, must be handed over to a trust to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple, subject to conditions.</p>

      <p>A separate piece of land in Ayodhya would be given over to Muslim groups to build a new mosque, the court ruled in a historic judgment aimed at ending a bitter and decades-old legal and sectarian battle.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the verdict, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/india-deploys-security--social-media-monitors-ahead-of-divisive-temple-verdict-12069086">Indian authorities ramped up security across the country</a> and Modi called for calm as police went on alert.</p>
      <p>Thousands of extra personnel deployed and schools closed in and around the northern city of Ayodhya, centre of the bitter dispute, and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Barricades were erected on roads leading to the Supreme Court building in New Delhi with officials and volunteers scouring social media for inflammatory posts in what is Facebook's biggest market.</p>
      <p>The verdict, it is hoped, will put an end to an angry and at times arcane legal wrangle that British colonial rulers and even the Dalai Lama tried to mediate.</p>
      <p>Hardliners among India's majority Hindus, including supporters of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), believe that Lord Ram, the warrior god, was born in Ayodhya.</p>
      <p>They say that in the 16th century, Babur, the first emperor of the Mughal Islamic dynasty, built a mosque on top of a temple at the 2.8-acre site.</p>

        <b>VICTORY FOR MODI</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the 1980s, as Hindu nationalism and the BJP began to strengthen, pressure grew for the mosque to be knocked down and replaced by a glorious Hindu temple.</p>
      <p>In 1992, a Hindu mob estimated to number 200,000 did just that, reducing the mosque to rubble.</p>
      <p>This unleashed some of the worst religious riots since India's bloody partition at the end of British colonial rule in 1947, leaving around 2,000 people dead, mainly Muslims.</p>
      <p>Ten years later in 2002, after 59 Hindu activists died in a blaze on a train from Ayodhya, riots in Gujarat state - when Modi was its chief minister - saw upwards of 1,000 people perish, again largely Muslims.</p>
      <p>In 2010, a High Court ruled that Muslims and Hindus should split it - albeit unevenly, with Hindus granted the lion's share.</p>
      <p>This left no one happy. Both Hindu and Muslim groups appealed and the Supreme Court in 2011 stayed the lower court's ruling, leaving the issue unresolved.</p>
      <p>The case also involves a nonagenarian lawyer representing a Hindu deity and has seen a high drama including a lawyer representing Muslim groups tearing a purported ancient map showing the temple.</p>
      <p>The BJP has campaigned for years for a temple to be built at Ayodhya, and the verdict is a major victory for the party, just months into Modi's second term.</p>
      <p>But it will also send shudders through many in the 200-million-strong Muslim minority who fear that the BJP is bent on turning India into a purely Hindu nation.</p>
      <p>Modi is nevertheless desperate to avoid bloodshed and ahead of the verdict, the BJP and the more hardline RSS organisation have told supporters to avoid any provocative celebrations.</p>
      <p>Muslim groups have also appealed for calm.</p>
      <p>"Whatever is the verdict by the Supreme Court, it won't be anybody's win or loss," Modi tweeted late Friday.</p>
      <p>"My appeal to the people of India is that our priority is to ensure the verdict strengthens the values of peace, equality and goodwill of our country."</p>
