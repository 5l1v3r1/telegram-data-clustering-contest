      <p><b>BROCKTON, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Massachusetts' last known Pearl Harbor survivor has died.</p>
      <p>The Brockton Enterprise reports George Hursey died Tuesday at a nursing home in Brockton from natural causes. He was 98.</p>
      <p>Hursey told The Enterprise in 2016 that he was among the army units that fired artillery guns at Japanese bombers as they decimated the American fleet.</p>
      <p>The North Carolina native served throughout the Pacific during World War II before being stationed at the U.S. Air Force base on Cape Cod.</p>
      <p>He later worked for the U.S. Postal Service and as a school bus driver in Brockton.</p>
      <p>In September, Massachusetts Pearl Harbor survivor William Kostanski, of Greenfield, died at the age of 101.</p>
      <p>Hursey is survived by his wife and two grown children. A memorial is scheduled for Thursday in Brockton.</p>
