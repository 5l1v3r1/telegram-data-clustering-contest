        <b>YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI, whose real name is Olajide Olatunji, are set to fight in an amateur boxing match in Los Angeles at the Staples Centre. Last year, the two already fought in Manchester, but the match resulted in a draw after six rounds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>YouTube star PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, has once again stirred his fanbase, this time asking his Twitter followers to pick him a Youtuber he should 'fight to the death'.</p>

      <p>The comment​ is apparently a response to a boxing rematch between fellow Youtubers Logan Paul and KSI that is set <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911091077258963-ksi-tells-logan-paul-i-am-going-to-break-you-as-youtubers-set-for-rematch-in-los-angeles/">to take place</a> in Los Angeles later this day.</p>
      <p>The Twitterians' reaction was not long in coming as they rolled out a whole list of potential candidates for a match with Pewds.</p>
      <p>Ksi and Logan Paul themselves were among the options for the world-renowned Swede to fight.</p>
