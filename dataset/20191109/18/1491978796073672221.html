        <i>• West Brom stay in front with 1-0 win over Hull <br/>• Preston beat Huddersfield, Leeds down Blackburn</i>
      </p>
      <p>Michael O’Neill, the new <b>Stoke</b> manager, had an instant impact as his side hammered <b>Barnsley</b> 4-2 at Oakwell in the bottom-of-the-table <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship">Championship</a> clash while the top three, West Brom, Preston and Leeds, won.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irishman was named as Nathan Jones’ successor at Stoke on Friday and the away team got off to a fine start after three successive defeats courtesy of Sam Clucas’ early goal and Lee Gregory’s penalty on the half hour.</p>
      <p>Cameron McGeehan gave Barnsley hope in the 47th minute but further goals from Joe Allen and Clucas left them without a win since the opening day of the season, although Patrick Schmidt grabbed a late consolation.</p>
      <p>Jake Livermore’s 28th-minute goal preserved <b>West Brom</b>’s position at the top with a 1-0 victory over <b>Hull</b>.</p>
      <p>Second-placed <b>Preston</b> ended <b>Huddersfield</b>’s seven-game unbeaten run with a 3-1 victory at Deepdale. Alex Neil’s side have now lost only once in their last 13 league games, as goals from Jayden Stockley, Alan Browne and Paul Gallagher ended Huddersfield’s seven-match unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>Huddersfield struggled to live with the attacking force of the hosts for the majority of the game as Danny Cowley’s side saw their seven-game unbeaten run come to an end in wet conditions in Lancashire.</p>
      <p>Patrick Bamford ended his goal drought in <b>Leeds</b>’ 2-1 win over <b>Blackburn</b> at Elland Road. The striker netted from the penalty spot in the 30th minute, his first goal for 11 games, and then set up Jack Harrison for a second. Derrick Williams’ 40th-minute header gave Rovers hope, but Leeds held on to stay third.</p>
      <p>Ben Wilmot scored at the death to deny the <b>Sheffield Wednesday</b> manager, Garry Monk, a win over his former side, <b>Swansea</b>, at Hillsborough. Late goals from Fernando Forestieri and Morgan Fox had looked to have given the Owls a dramatic victory, having gone behind to André Ayew, but Wilmot salvaged a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>Aleksandar Mitrovic’s 12th goal of the season ensured <b>Fulham</b> beat <b>Birmingham</b> 1-0 and move into sixth place, but the striker will be banned for next week’s clash with QPR after collecting a fifth yellow card.</p>
      <p>Britt Assombalonga scored twice to rescue a 2-2 draw for <b>Middlesbrough</b> at <b>QPR</b>. The striker headed Boro in front but after Nahki Wells’ ninth effort of the season and Jonny Howson’s own goal he was forced to salvage a point which left Boro without a win in nine.</p>
      <p>Matt Smith’s late header helped <b>Millwall</b> win the London derby 2-1 against <b>Charlton</b>. After Shaun Hutchinson’s sixth-minute effort was cancelled out by Jonathan Leko, Smith struck at the death.</p>
      <p><b>Reading</b> made it four games unbeaten under their new manager, Mark Bowen, after goals from Michael Morrison, Ovie Ejaria and Garath McCleary gave them a 3-0 triumph over <b>Luton</b>, who slipped to one point above the bottom three.</p>
      <p><b>Wigan</b> are only two points off the relegation zone after goals from Bryan Mbeumo, Kamohelo Mokotjo and Josh Dasilva gave<b> Brentford</b> a 3-0 victory. The Latics defender Cédric Kipré and Brentford’s Julian Jeanvier were sent off.</p>
