      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino makes worrying admission over poor Tottenham form</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino's side slipped to 12th in the Premier League following the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:17:59+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino admits he is still searching for a solution to Tottenham's poor form.</p>
      <p>Spurs were held by Sheffield United at home on Saturday and are now 12th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 1-1 draw makes it five league games without a win for Spurs, who are now well adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>Pochettino insists he will continue to work on turning things around but is unable to put a finger on why his side have started the season so poorly.</p>
      <p>"The reality is that for different reasons we are not showing the performances that we expect," he said.</p>

      <p>"We try to build confidence, the team is in a period where we are finding the best balance. I need to look forward and keep working and try to improve.</p>
      <p>"We are not in a good position in the table."</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min's strike was cancelled out by George Baldock, with the visitors also having a goal controversially ruled out by VAR.</p>
      <p>The Blades are three points and six places above Spurs ahead of the next international break.</p>

      <p>"It was an even game, difficult for us - they are a very good, organised team, it was difficult to play in the first half, second half we were better. Overall, it's a fair result," Pochettino added.</p>
      <p>"We knew very well how they play, they got a draw in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and they are playing so well. The most difficult thing for us was to match their energy.</p>
      <p>"In the second half we were much better and matched them. I think they deserve one point.</p>
