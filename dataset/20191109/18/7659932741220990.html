      <p>Egypt's inflation rate dropped to the lowest level in nearly a decade last month, official figures showed Saturday, as cheaper food offered respite to consumers squeezed by IMF-backed reforms.<br/><br/>The annual inflation rate was 2.4 percent in October, compared with 17.5 percent a year earlier, the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) said.<br/><br/>The state body said the decrease was due to a drop in the cost of household items such as food and drink.<br/><br/>"The increase in agricultural production led to a drop in prices of fruit and vegetables, which in turn affected food prices that make up about 40 percent of consumer costs," Cairo-based economist Iman Negm told AFP.<br/><br/>"The Egyptian pound's recovery against the US dollar has also contributed to the inflation rate slowing down," she added.<br/><br/>Negm expects the central bank to cut interest rates because of the weaker price pressures.<br/><br/>Inflation had skyrocketed to 33 percent in 2017 following subsidy cuts and the devaluation of the Egyptian pound.<br/><br/>Poor and middle-class Egyptians have been bearing the brunt of harsh austerity measures since 2016 when the government secured a $12-billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in exchange for implementing economic reforms.<br/><br/>Nearly one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line, according to official figures released in July.<br/><br/>CAPMAS said that other costs, such as transportation and health care, had risen.<br/><br/>Direct foreign investment has grown to record levels in recent years, but the national debt has ballooned since the pound was floated in November 2016, leading to a sharp depreciation.</p>
