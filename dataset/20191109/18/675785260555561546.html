      <h1>Tony Adams baffles Arsenal fans with assessment of Rob Holding</h1>
      <h2>Rob Holding was handed a start by Unai Emery in a back three for the clash with Leicester</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:00:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Tony Adams expressed his concerns over the Arsenal defence ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>Unai Emery reverted to a back three for the encounter at the King Power, with Sokratis making way.</p>
      <p>David Luiz, Calum Chambers and Rob Holding started against Leicester as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> attempted to keep out the high-flying Foxes.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Sky Sports ahead of the game, Adams suggested it was the right move - but highlighted Holding's inclusion as a concern.</p>
      <p>Adams said: "I like the team the way he’s set up today apart from Holding.</p>

      <p>"They’re playing a back three and hopefully the clouds will lift today and we’ll have a great defensive performance.</p>
      <p>"George Graham used to say if you haven’t got two good ones then play three.</p>
      <p>"This lot may need four or five to be honest but I think it suits these guys</p>
      <p>"They are having problems in that department but I think the two holding players, Torreira and Guendouzi, are good and it’s a better set-up today.</p>
      <p>"You always defend as a team but this system is best suited to this squad of players apart from Holding."</p>

      <p>His comments on Holding in particular baffled Arsenal fans, with many unsure of his point.</p>
      <p>The defender has struggled for form since recovering from a long-term injury but remains a favourite of supporters.</p>
      <p>Arsenal went into the clash with Leicester in a poor run of form, with the pressure increasing on boss Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>His side are already well adrift of the Foxes in the race to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
