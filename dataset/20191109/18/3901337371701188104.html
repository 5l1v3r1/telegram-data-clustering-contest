        <b>Bundesliga</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Borussia Dortmund v Bayern Munich</p>
      <p><b>Date</b>: 09 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Signal-Iduna Park</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich will be out restore some pride after last week's humiliating loss when they travel to Borussia Dortmund on Saturday evening - Here's how they line up.</p>
      <p>The match is scheduled to get underway at 19h30.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians were left embarassed seven days ago after suffering a 5-1 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt, which ultimately resulted in the sacking of manager Niko Kovac a day later.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions switched their focus to the UEFA Champions League this week after defeating Olympiakos 2-0 to advance to the round of 16.</p>
      <p>Dortmund, meanwhile, looked to have got their season back on track with three straight victroies in all competitions, the last of which was a come-from-behind 3-2 win over Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Thomas Tuchel's troops will have the chance move top for at least a day should they secure three points, while Bayern can only move as high as second.</p>
      <p>Bayern will be looking to Robert Lewandowski to lead them to victory, as the Polish strike has already bagged 21 goals across all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski does have an immpressive record against Dortmund since joining Bayern, having netted 16 goals in 18 matches against his former employers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Borussia Dortmund: </b>Bürki; Hakimi, Akanji, Hummels, Schulz; Witsel, Weigl; Sancho, Brandt, Hazard; Götze.</p>
      <p><b>Bayern Munich: </b>Neuer; Pavard, Javi Martínez, Alaba, Davies; Goretzka, Kimmich; Coman, Müller, Gnabry; Lewandowski.</p>
