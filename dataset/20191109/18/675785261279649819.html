      <h1>Strictly star Michelle Visage's secret health battle 'caused by her breast implants'</h1>
      <h2>The RugPaul's Drag Race judge has wowed judges and her fans on the dance floor but has battled a hidden disease for years</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, Will Twigger, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Strictly star Michelle Visage is very much the woman of the moment with her stunning dance floor moves.</p>
      <p>The judge on RuPaul's Drag Race was the first contestant to reach a lofty score of 39 with partner Giovanni Pernice when they performed the foxtrot on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/halloween">Halloween</a>.</p>
      <p>And in last weekend's BBC show the couple once again flew close to the top of the leaderboard when they netted 34 for their stunning Paso Doble.</p>
      <p>But the 51-year-old has battled secret a health problem for decades, which led to her hair falling out in clumps and her suffering with crippling panic attacks.</p>
      <p>Michelle was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, which is a thyroid problem that can cause serious health problems.</p>

      <p>Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain, depression and joint pain.</p>
      <p>And Michelle is convinced it was caused by the breast implants she had when she was just 21.</p>
      <p>She said: "My skin was crackly dry and my hair was falling out in clumps. I was also having hardcore panic attacks.</p>
      <p>"My journey goes back to me getting breast implants at the age of 21. My body couldn't fight off the attacker because it was there 24 hours a day, seven days a week."</p>
      <p>Her fears her implants had caused her disease were never confirmed by a doctor but Michelle carried out her own research.</p>

      <p>She has now had her breast implants removed and says she feels better than ever.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "After 30 years of having breast implants and 20 years of suffering with Hashimoto's, not one doctor told me what it could be.</p>
      <p>"So I found a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group where over 50,000 women who had the same symptoms from their breast implants and started a documentary on my journey with Breast Implant Illness, before getting them removed.</p>
      <p>"Since having them removed, the thyroid nodule is going down, which is amazing."</p>
      <p>Michelle has also been open about her daughter's battles with mental health.</p>

      <p>Heartbrekingly, 19-year-old Lillie, was struggling so much she had even contemplated taking her own life in the past.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "She had to deal with depression for so long that she lost a lot of her teenage years. I've told her I want her to date everything so she knows what she likes. she's really flourishing now."</p>
      <p>"Lillie was suicidal for a while. But she's been three years on the other side now. "</p>
      <p>The TV star, who also has daughter, Lola, 17, tried a hollistic approach to helping her daughter before turning to medication and therapy.</p>
      <p>She said: "With mental health, children are always forgotten, people tell them to man up and quit complaining.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> feeds into that. Lillie was log out for a month and Lola's now come to a place where she realises her self worth. I've taught her to love herself."</p>
