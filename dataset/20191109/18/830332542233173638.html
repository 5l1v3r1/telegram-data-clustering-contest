      <p>(CNN) - An American Airlines flight was diverted to Oklahoma after a man grabbed a passenger seated next to him "by the crotch," according to a federal criminal complaint filed Friday.</p>
      <p>James Clayton Cholewinski-Boy was charged with abusive sexual contact after Tuesday's reported assault aboard American Airlines Flight 807 from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Salt Lake City, Utah, the complaint said.</p>
      <p>It's unclear whether Cholewinski-Boy has an attorney.</p>
      <p>The alleged victim, identified as "E.J." in the complaint, was seated between Cholewinski-Boy and her daughter. Shortly after takeoff, he began touching the woman's arm and she repeatedly pushed his hands away, according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>Cholewinski-Boy then "forcibly grabbed her by the crotch," the complaint said. The woman again pushed his hand away and demanded that he stop.</p>
      <p>"Cholewinski-Boy threw up his hands and said 'sorry,'" according to the complaint.</p>
      <p>The woman notified the flight crew, who moved mother and daughter to another part of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>The pilot diverted the flight to Tulsa International Airport, where Cholewinski-Boy was arrested by airport police for public intoxication, the complaint said.</p>
      <p>He was released Wednesday on his own recognizance, the Tulsa Municipal Jail told CNN.</p>
      <p>"The public should know these allegations pertain to criminal sexual misconduct by Mr. Cholewinski-Boy against a female passenger, not a threat to the plane or air travel," <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndok/pr/passenger-charged-criminal-sexual-misconduct-actions-during-american-airlines-flight">U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma, Trent Shores, said in a statement.</a></p>
      <p>American Airlines, in a statement, said: "The quick actions of our crew ensured the safety and wellbeing of our customers on the flight."</p>
