      <h1>Strictly's Emma Barton's very famous ex-boyfriends as she keeps love life under wraps</h1>
      <h2>EastEnders star Emma reveals little about her romances but is believed to have had relationships with some big names</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:50:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p>EastEnders' star Emma Barton's adorable Strictly partnership with Anton Du Beke is one of the most endearing things on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>While the couple have struggled to reach the top of the leaderboard on the hit BBC One show, it hasn't stopped them winning over millions of new fans.</p>
      <p>And Emma's heartbreaking reaction to Sharley Ballas' harsh comments following her Rumba performance last Saturday prompted Anton to step in to defend her.</p>
      <p>Shirley said: "First of all I want to say that you're tall and elegant and you have everything it takes to do a Rumba before I say what I'm about to say."</p>
      <p>But desperate to protect his partner, Anton jumped in to say "there's no need to say any more", which left Shirley "fuming".</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The judge added: ""The only timing that I could read was the basic - the alemana and the sliding doors... the rest of it I have absolutely no idea on what count you were dancing for this dance."</p>
      <p>Emma was close to tears as the judges tore her and Anton's Rumba apart and the couple ended up at the bottom of the score board.</p>
      <p>The actress, who first appeared in EastEnders as Honey in 2005, has always made sure she keeps her love life close to her chest.</p>
      <p>But the 42-year-old has had some very famous ex-boyfriends.</p>
      <p>Currently believed to be single, she's had no shortage of admirers from among her co-stars.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She married lawyer Nigel Stoat in 2002 but the couple separated in 2005.</p>
      <p>Emma then dated hunky cop Harry Waddingham, who she met through his sister, who is also an actress.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders star had appeared in the West End musical Grease with Harry's sister and she is believed to have introduced the pair.</p>
      <p>A two year love affair with fellow EastEnders actor, Joel Beckett, followed in 2007, according the reports.</p>
      <p>The actor played Jake Moon from 2004 to 2006.</p>
      <p>Emma was linked to presenter Stephen Mulhern after they met in 2008.</p>
      <p>Emma and Stephen appeared in several pantos together although they're believed to have split for good in 2011.</p>
      <p>Then, in 2016, Jamie Borthwick, who plays Jay Brown in the soap, admitted he had a huge crush on Emma.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old claimed he had had a soft spot for Emma since he was 14 but she soon shut down rumours of a possible romance, insisting he was "more like a brother".</p>
