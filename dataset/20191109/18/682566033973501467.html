      <p>Cape Town - Plucky <b>Stellenbosch FC</b> were able to claim a valuable point against <b>Highlands Park</b> after holding them to a 0-0 draw at the Cape Town Stadium in the Absa Premiership on Saturday, despite playing the entire second half with a man disadvantage.</p>
      <p>Both sides made several changes after losing their league fixtures in midweek and the lack of cohesion was evident from the kick-off.</p>
      <p>It took a while for either team to really find their feet and the first real chance only materialised around the half-hour mark.</p>
      <p>Luckyboy Mokoena showed some fine skill to create the opportunity but was denied by s decent save by Boy de Jong.</p>
      <p>While neither side were creating many chances, it was clear that Highlands Park were on top as large portions of the first half were played inside the home side's half.</p>
      <p>A task that was already very difficult for Stellenbosch then seemed almost impossible when Morgan Gould was sent off on the stroke of half-time after receiving his second yellow card.</p>
      <p>The home side had been set on defending their way to a point before Gould's dismissal and they retreated even further in the second period.</p>
      <p>While it will not be remembered as a classic, nor will neutral fans have enjoyed the display, but Stellenbosch put in a colossal defensive effort to hold the Lions of the North at bay.</p>
      <p>They barely created a chance of their own but they frustrated Highlands Park time and again, to the point that it never really felt as if the visitors would be able to find a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Stellenbosch head coach Clive Barker will definitely see this result as a point gained, while his counterpart will be ruing two points lost.</p>
