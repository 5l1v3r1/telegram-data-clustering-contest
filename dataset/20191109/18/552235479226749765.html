      <h1>Dumbarton 2-4 East Fife - First-half fight back not enough for Sons</h1>
      <h2>Jim Duffy's side drew level after falling two goals behind early on - however slumped in the second-half as they fell to a second consecutive defeat.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:27:28+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:27</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>Sons manager Jim Duffy was left berating sloppy defending for a second consecutive week, as his side lost out to East Fife in an action packed game at the Rock.</p>
      <p>The visitors found themselves two goals up and cruising after half-an-hour, however the spirited Sons hit back with two goals in five minutes ensuring that they went in level at half-time.</p>
      <p>However Duffy’s side evidently hadn’t taken the warning sent out by the high-flying Fifers, who scored twice more in the second-half to leave with all three points.</p>
      <p>And the gaffer was once more left gutted at the manner of the goals conceded.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had managed back-to-back clean sheets and had started to look quite solid, but in the last couple of games old habits have crept back in and that’s something that we have to work hard to eliminate, because if you make the mistakes that we’re making then the opposition are going to capitalise on it.</p>
      <p>“At times our defensive play was really, really poor at key points.</p>
      <p>“The first 20 minutes we didn’t really start, the first goal gave us a bit of impetus to get back in, but we said to the players that we can’t have the same type of start to the second-half as we had to the first, and unfortunately we did.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We seem to switch off at crucial moments and we’re making too many basic errors defensively to give ourselves a chance.</p>
      <p>“To get back to 2-2 at half-time we should’ve been optimistic about the second half, but it looked like a new weight was on their shoulders.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we played at all in the second-half and East Fife thoroughly deserved the win.”</p>
      <p>Although they held out longer than the 27 seconds they had managed a week previous against Airdrieonians, Dumbarton still fell behind early on.</p>
      <p>Just eight minutes were on the clock when Steven Boyd’s clever pass sent Danny Denholm clean through on goal, and the part-time footballer, part-time BBC columnist made no mistake with a cool finish beyond Conor Brennan.</p>
      <p>Denholm was at the heart of everything for the visitors who looked threatening every time they crossed the halfway line.</p>
      <p>The former Arbroath man cut in from the left and had a shot bravely blocked by Ryan McGeever, before teeing up both Steven Boyd and Liam Watt - but neither could find a way to trouble Brennan.</p>
      <p>Boyd then did beat Brennan, but not the assistant’s flag, as he had the ball in the net only to be denied by a close offside call.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before Darren Young’s men finally added a deserved second however, and when it arrived it was as a result of high-quality move.</p>
      <p>Scott Agnew’s glorious crossfielder allowed Denholm to sneak in behind Reghan Tumilty and knock the ball across goal for Watt to tap into the empty net.</p>
      <p>That finally looked to spark Dumbarton into some form of life and Duffy’s men got themselves on the scoresheet with one of their first opportunities of the game.</p>
      <p>Joe McKee’s driven corner was perfect for Ryan McGeever, and the big defender duly bulleted home his third goal in five games.</p>
      <p>And incredibly Dumbarton drew level six minutes before half-time.</p>
      <p>PJ Crossan went on a trademark driving run, with his cross knocked into his own net by the unfortunate Craig Watson with Stefan McCluskey lurking at the far post.</p>
      <p>Crossan then had Hart scrambling for a low effort that trundled wide, before Joe McKee tried his luck from 50 yards but found his radar just off.</p>
      <p>It was very much the Sons who were in control at this stage, and McKee was only denied his first Dumbarton goal by a sensational Chris Higgins clearance from right under his own crossbar.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Half-time perhaps came at an unfortunate moment for the Sons, who failed to ever get going again in the second period.</p>
      <p>After losing possession cheaply in midfielder former Son Scott Agnew set Steven Boyd free, and the tricky forward found a way beyond Conor Brennan at the second attempt.</p>
      <p>And the points were secured soon after, when Liam Watt skipped away from a number of weak challenges and curled the ball beyond Brennan and into the net.</p>
      <p>Dumbarton tried to hit back, and really should’ve found a third in injury time - however top scorer Isaac Layne failed to hit the target from six yards out after good play from the ever dangerous Crossan.</p>
