        <b>Cliftonville defender Conor McDermott scored a brilliant effort from inside his own half as his side defeated Warrenpoint 4-1 in the Irish Premiership.</b>
      </p>
      <p>McDermott, who is on loan from League of Ireland outfit Derry City, found the net in his side’s impressive victory with a goal he will no doubt remember for a long long time.</p>
      <p>Clearly brimming with confidence after beautifully lifting the ball over an onrushing striker’s head, McDermott took one touch, had a look up, and fired a strike past the Warrenpoint keeper who had just drifted off his line.</p>

      <p>Cliftonville’s win kept them second in the table as they look to keep pace with league leaders Coleraine while it was another defeat for Warrenpoint who have lost 14 of their first 15 games in division this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialNIFL/status/1193216980993691650">Speaking after the game,</a> McDermott outlined what was going through his head when he attempted the outrageous effort.</p>
      <p>“The ball sat down nicely after I took a touch. I saw the keeper off his line and just had to go for it. You don’t get many of them opportunities.</p>

      <blockquote>“I’ve caught it really cleanly and had a feeling it was going to go in because the keeper reacted late. I don’t know how to celebrate because I don’t score many goals.”</blockquote>
