      <p>It might finally be happening.</p>

      <p>Q: “Whats the possibility of your next fight being in Moscow against Ferguson?”</p>
      <p>Khabib: “Possibility of Ferguson being my next opponent is i would say %95. Because the fans want it,I really want it and UFC wants it. But it being in Moscow is highly unlikely.”</p>
      <p>Khabib, 31, last fought earlier this year at UFC 242, where he submitted then-interim champ Dustin Poirier to unify the lightweight titles. Prior to that, the Dagestani man dominated and submitted Conor McGregor at UFC 229.</p>
      <p>As for Ferguson, The Ultimate Fighter 13 winner is on an impressive twelve-fight win streak and holds notable stoppage victories over the likes of Donald Cerrone, Anthony Pettis and Kevin Lee. The No. 9-ranked pound-for-pound fighter also holds a dominant unanimous decision win over former UFC lightweight champ Rafael dos Anjos.</p>
      <p>If Khabib’s estimations are correct, expect the UFC to make an official fight announcement in the coming weeks.</p>
