      <h1>Conor McGregor slams Khabib Nurmagomedov's cousin Abubakar after UFC Moscow loss</h1>
      <h2>Debutant Abubakar, who is related to McGregor's fierce rival Khabib, entered Saturday’s UFC Moscow event with a 15-2-1 record in MMA</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T18:43:03+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 18:43</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Conor McGregor has laid into Khabib Nurmagomedov's cousin Abubakar after the Russian suffered a devastating defeat just two minutes into his UFC debut.</p>
      <p>Debutant Abubakar, who is related to McGregor's fierce rival Khabib, entered Saturday’s UFC Moscow event with a 15-2-1 record in MMA.</p>
      <p>But the Russian fighter fell to a shock defeat in the Octagon after being submitted by David Zawada in the opening round of their preliminary welterweight contest.</p>
      <p>And McGregor, who was beaten by Khabib in UFC last October, was quick to poke fun at the Nurmagomedovs with a series of social media posts.</p>
      <p>The Irishman wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "Nurmagotaptap."</p>

      <p>A further three posts read: "Hahahah s****bags.</p>
      <p>"He tapped his forehead.  If you can tap his forehead. You can punch his forehead. He quit. 1 quitter exposed. Abubakar Nurmagotaptap. Forever a failure.</p>
      <p>"A 5 second triangle hahahah."</p>
      <p>McGregor then appeared to delete those tweets, before simply posting a fourth: "Console him. Then tell him he’s cut."</p>

      <p>The Irish star's outburst comes after Khabib told him what he needs to do to earn a rematch for his UFC title - and it's much more than McGregor might have anticipated.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">McGregor</a> is set to make his long-awaited return to the octagon on January 18, having not fought since being choked out by Nurmagomedov in October last year.</p>
      <p>It has not yet been revealed who McGregor's next opponent will be, although fellow lightweights Justin Gaethje and Donald Cerrone are the among the likely contenders.</p>
      <p>After that fight, former two-weight UFC champion McGregor wants to fight Jorge Masvidal after his win against Nate Diaz at UFC 244, before rounding off 2020 with a rematch against Nurmagomedov.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khabib-nurmagomedov">Nurmagomedov</a> has told McGregor he needs to win not two, but 10 straight bouts to earn the chance to face the Russian again.</p>
      <p>“As for a rematch, to fight for a belt in the UFC, I remember I had something like nine or 10 fights," Nurmagomedov said in quotes reported by <a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-khabib-nurmagomedov-rematch-conor-mcgregor-10-wins">MMA Junkie</a>.</p>
      <p>"If he wins 10 fights in a row, then that’s completely possible."</p>
