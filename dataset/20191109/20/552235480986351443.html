      <h1>Brendan Rodgers reacts to Leicester City win over Arsenal and explains Jamie Vardy's role</h1>
      <h2>The former Celtic manager watched his team go second in the Premier League with a big win over Arsenal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:39:17+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Leicester City boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> insists his side showed great patience to open up Arsenal during their 2-0 win at the King Power.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss masterminded another win that sees his side moving up to second place in the Premier League, a point ahead of Man City who have a game in hand against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>And Rodgers heaped praise on his players and singled out James Maddison for his goal that sealed the points.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> loanee provided a stunning finish and Rodgers is thrilled with how the players have responded since their last league defeat before the last international break.</p>
      <p>Liverpool were the winners that day and Rodgers said: "We had good control to the game, the subs came into the game, Demarai Gray was outstanding. James Maddison’s finish for the second goal. Ndidi breaks it up, shows his quality and then the finish from James was wonderful and from 2-0 we were able to control the game from there and a very good three points. A great reaction to losing the Liverpool game just before the last international break.</p>
      <p>"Since then we’ve won every game in this block and the players have been magnificent.</p>

      <p>"Whichever way you play, our idea is to impose ourselves on the game. There’s no right or wrong way. They have very fast players with Aubameyang and Lacazette and they split strikers and tried to let us come through the middle. Once we worked that out we showed the patience to open it up and we had some really good combinations.</p>
      <p>"Today, our players were brilliant with how they worked out the game and the finishing and another clean sheet which is very important."</p>
      <p>Jamie Vardy opened the scoring with a finish very typical of him and Rodgers admits he's tweaked his game to get even more out of him.</p>
      <p>When asked if Vardy was better than he realised, he added: "Yes.</p>
      <p>"I knew he was a top player, he’s played against my teams before and I’ve obviously watched him but it’s when you come in and work with him, he’s tactically so good in the game. He’s always thinking, he’s bright and all we’ve tried to do is put him more central so he’s working in the area he needs to.</p>
      <p>"You’ve seen him over the years he can press the whole back four, this team he doesn’t need to. Everyone has to press at the same time but they know they’ve got someone there who can stretch the game, open the game up and inside the box his finishing is phenomenal. He doesn’t need many chances, he’s so concentrated when they come he’s ready to take them."</p>
