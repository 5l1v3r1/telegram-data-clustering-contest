      <h1>Freed From Jail, Lula’s Ready to Fight in Latin America</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has pledged to travel around Latin America, offering support for leftist leaders at a moment when the region is engulfed by growing political turmoil.</p>
      <p>“I’m finally free and willing to fight,” Lula said in a video message that was broadcast at the Puebla Group’s meeting in Buenos Aires on Saturday. “I’m willing to walk across Brazil and travel around Latin America,” said the 74-year-old politician, who walked out of jail on Friday following a top court decision that reversed rules for imprisoning convicts.</p>
      <p>In a three-minute message, Lula bashed Latin America’s elite and defended focusing on jobs and income distribution in order to improve life quality in the region. Argentina’s President-elect Alberto Fernandez “can do that and be an example to other countries,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Puebla Group, which is a body created in July that brings together left-wing leaders from the region, is discussing priorities for Latin America during a meeting this weekend. Former presidents such as Brazil’s Dilma Rousseff, Uruguay’s Jose Mujica, Paraguay’s Fernando Lugo and Spain’s Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero are some of its higher-profile members.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Lula addressed a crowd of supporters gathered in front of a metalworkers union headquarters outside the city of Sao Paulo, criticizing the Carwash corruption probe and the market-friendly agenda that is being implemented by President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration.</p>
      <p>“They need to explain why they’re presenting an economic project that will impoverish the Brazilian society even more,” Lula said. “I can’t see them destroying the country we built.”</p>
