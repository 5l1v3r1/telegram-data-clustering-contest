      <h1>'Klopp out' - Liverpool fans fearing the worst ahead of Aston Villa Carabao Cup clash</h1>
      <h2>Villa face, what promises to be, a youthful Liverpool side in the Carabao Cup quarter finals, but their preparations aren't going well</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:14:03+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:14</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans will be feeling a little more confident after Liverpool's U18s were thrashed by West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's side will face what promises to be an inexperienced Liverpool team in the quarter final of the Carabao Cup in December.</p>
      <p>The European Champions will be forced to implement a number of their academy players, with the first team participating in the Club World Championships at the same time.</p>

      <p>Jurgen Klopp is set to give U23s boss Neil Critchley touchline duties vs <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> , with his attentions solely placed in Qatar.</p>
      <p>The Merseysiders have used a number of youngsters in previous rounds and may be forced to use even more on December 17.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool fans on social media are not looking forward to that proposition after the Anfield development squad were beaten 6-3 by Albion on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two of the players that were on the bench for their fourth round win over Arsenal played in the game, where the Baggies scored six goals in less than half an hour.</p>
