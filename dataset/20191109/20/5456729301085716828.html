      <h1>VIDEO: Bribe-taking Nigerian police officer caught on camera short-changing colleagues</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:20:44+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/361766-video-bribe-taking-nigerian-police-officer-caught-on-camera-short-changing-colleagues.html" target="_blank">Cletus Ukpong</a></address>
      <p>A yet-to-be-identified Nigerian police officer has been caught on camera demanding and collecting bribe from a motorist.</p>
      <p>The officer, as seen in the four-minute video, went on to lie to his colleagues about the amount he collected from the motorist.</p>
      <p>The video has been shared on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
      <p>The date and location where the video was filmed remained unknown as at the time of filing this report.</p>
      <p>“Out of the N15,000, if I remove N10,000, how much go come remain? N5,000? No, e no go work?” the man, wearing a police uniform and holding a rifle, is seen in the video arguing with the motorist, using Pidgin English.</p>
      <p>“Na wetin wey dey be dat!” the motorist responded, showing no sign he was willing to offer more than N15,000.</p>
      <p>The motorist is seen in the video holding out a wad of 1,000 naira notes for the officer who is on the passenger’s seat, besides the driver.</p>
      <p>The officer fiddled with a mobile phone and acted as though he was reluctant to collect the bribe. He momentarily placed the phone to his ear, as though he wanted to make a call.</p>
      <p>“You know wetin you go do eh?” the officer suddenly asked the man, sounding as if he was concerned and wanted to offer help.</p>
      <p>“This man wey I call, him money na N10,000. The N5,000, na him I go come tell my people? Complete that money N20k, so that….”</p>
      <p>The motorist cuts in “Oga, I can’t lie for you. Just consider me, please!”</p>
      <p>“Me, I don tell you wetin I suppose tell you,” the officer quipped.</p>

      <p>The officer at some point in the bargain instructed the motorist to slow down the car, he then began to negotiate a fresh ‘deal’ on how to outsmart his fellow cops who were apparently expecting the bribe.</p>
      <p>“This one, it is a secret I am trying to tell you,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You will bring N10,000 out of this money, give to that guy. You hear me? For there, you go tell them say na N5,000 you give me.”</p>
      <p>The motorist counted N10,000 from the money, gave it to the officer who went on to make a call, apparently to his superior and pleaded with him on behalf of the motorist. He lied in the phone conversation that the motorist gave him N5,000.</p>
      <p>“How we go do for this guy, e no even get money!” he said on the phone.</p>
