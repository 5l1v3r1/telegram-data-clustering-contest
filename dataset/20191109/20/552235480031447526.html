      <h1>Kilwinning Rangers 4 Shettleston 2: Buffs survive second half scare to progress in West of Scotland Cup</h1>
      <h2>The first round tie looked dead and buried with Kilwinning three-nil up at half time, but Shettleston rallied after the break.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:48:14+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:48</time> by <a rel="author">Eric McGowan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/eric-mcgowan/</a></address>
      <p>Carlo Monti and Ben Lewis bagged a brace each as Buffs booked a place in the second round of the West of Scotland Cup this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Monti's goals came inside the opening 10 minutes, both precise finishes, before Lewis' tap in gave Kilwinning a commanding lead at the break.</p>
      <p>The tie looked dead and buried but League One Shettleston rallied in the second half, scoring twice as they threatened a stunning comeback.</p>
      <p>Lewis calmed any home nerves by netting his second, and Buffs fourth, nine minutes from time to seal their passage to the next round.</p>
      <p>Shettleston arrived in Ayrshire still smarting from last weekend's surprise third round Scottish Junior Cup defeat against Kello Rovers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They found themselves under the cosh from the first whistle and fell behind with only seven minutes on the clock, Monti finding plenty of space 16 yards from goal to drill a low shot past helpless Town keeper Ryan Duvaney.</p>
      <p>Before the visitor's could catch their breath it was 2-0, Monti finishing a weaving run with another low shot that found the bottom right corner of the net.</p>
      <p>It was one-way traffic and David Syme almost it three with a header from a corner kick that clipped the top of the crossbar on the way over.</p>
      <p>A third goal eventually arrived in 23 minutes, Gary Fleming starting a sweeping counter attack with a great switch of play to Alex McWatters who fired a brilliant ball across the face of goal that Lewis tapped home with ease.</p>
      <p>Shettleston had offered virtually nothing going forward but they almost pulled a quick goal back, Syme getting his positioning spot on to header a curling effort from Stefan Graham off the goalline.</p>
      <p>Buffs should have added a fourth just before the break when Ben Lewis squandered a one-on-one with Duvaney and Alex McWatters blazed a follow-up attempt over the bar.</p>
      <p>There really looked to be no way back for Town but Buffs started the second half in very sloppy fashion and Jonathan Howat made them pay with a fine angled finish that gave Buffs keeper David Markey no chance.</p>
      <p>The goal gave the visitors renewed belief and they were the better side for the next 15 minutes before Samir Khan-Young reduced the deficit to one with another cool strike.</p>
      <p>Kilwinning manager Chris Strain made his unhappiness clear from the touchline and Buffs, while still sporadically sloppy in possession, started to regain control of the tie.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Monti went agonisingly close with a lob that dropped the wrong side of the post before forcing a good save out of Duvaney who got down well to keep out his low drive.</p>
      <p>The keeper then made a brilliant stop to bat away a fierce Ally McColm volley from close range and Monti was desperately unlucky to see his follow up shot smack back off the post.</p>
      <p>The pressure eventually told in 81 minutes when a ball into the box deflected off Monti into the path of Lewis who had the simple task of rolling the ball home from six yards.</p>
