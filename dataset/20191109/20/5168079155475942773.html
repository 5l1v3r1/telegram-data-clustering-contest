      <h1>Omani-Moroccan B2B meetings to begin on Tuesday</h1>

      <p>Muscat: Fifteen high-profile Omani exporters will be participating in a two-day 'Ithraa'-led trade delegation to Morocco.<br/><br/>A series of B2B meetings will be held on Tuesday in Casablanca with Moroccan importers, agents and manufacturers all in an effort to develop new business opportunities and strengthen existing trade and investment ties in food processing, plastics, marble, industrial lubricants and building materials.<br/><br/>'Ithraa’s' trade missions focus on specific sectors where Omani businesses have established expertise and where there is the greatest chance for success.<br/><br/>Morocco is a growing market for Omani exporters and its mission to Casablanca will help local firms take advantage of the many opportunities on offer in Africa. Given its economic assets, geostrategic position and political and economic stability, many business commentators see Morocco as an economic gateway to Africa, particularly markets in West Africa, territories of growing interest to many Omani exporters.</p>
      <p>The latest trade statistics indicate the Sultanate's total exports to Morocco amounted to more than OMR3.95 million in 2018 compared to OMR3.40 million in 2017, an increase of 18.5 per cent. Oman’s main exports to Morocco include aluminium wires, polypropylene, styrene polymer sheets, palm oil and aromatic products. Imports from Morocco to Oman amounted to OMR3.4 million in 2018.</p>
