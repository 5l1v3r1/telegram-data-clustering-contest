      <p><b>LINCOLN, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A Rhode Island Capitol Police Officer faces a larceny charge after picking up a wallet dropped at a casino.</p>
      <p>State Police say a person dropped a wallet containing $1,700 at a bar in Twin River Casino in Lincoln on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>They say 59-year-old David Bradley, of North Providence, was captured on surveillance video picking up the wallet and leaving the casino. Security stopped him in the parking lot.</p>
      <p>Bradley was arraigned Thursday in Kent County District Court in Warwick on a charge of larceny over $1,500. He was released pending a February court date.</p>
      <p>It's not immediately clear if Bradley has a lawyer.</p>
      <p>State Police say he's been an officer with the agency for about eight years. The Capitol Police provide security at the State House and other government buildings.</p>
