      <p>This isn’t the first time Insomnias (their fandom) responded with so much love. Their photobook last year collected over $111,000 USD, closing at 555% of their goal of $20,000!</p>
      <p>The crowdfunding for their 2019 tour photobook will close on December 8 at 6pm KST. The “producers” of their photobook will receive a copy of the book and an array of other exclusive goods, such as photocards, calendar, stickers, keychains and more!</p>
