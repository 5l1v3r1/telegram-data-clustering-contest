      <p>In August of this year, the once-bankrupt Chinese phone maker Gionee suddenly “resurrected”. According to reports, the two major shareholders of the company organized a roundtable with agents from several provinces across the country, hoping to start from scratch. The new slogan of “gold quality and the world” was also established at the conference.</p>

      <p>Subsequently, Gionee’s official website was back online and on September 25th the K3 was launched. The smartphone equipped a 6.2-inch notch screen, a MediaTek Helio P23 processor with 8-core A53 architecture, a 5000mAh battery a dual rear cameras. The Gionee K3 was available in a 4GB / 64GB variant for a starting price of 799 Yuan ($115).</p>

      <p>The Gionee A326 itself doesn’t appear to sport any special feature aside from the clamshell design. Its shape is very squarish, it has a small size screen inside with the keypad at the bottom. Meanwhile outside we find an even smaller display for quick notifications.</p>
      <p>The phone will be available in various color variants. These include: Twilight Black, Starry Blue, Elegant Red  and Walkin. Other details and prices haven’t been announced yet.</p>

      <p>Well, what can we say? We’re glad Gionee is back, even though with devices like the A326 that’s not probably be for long.</p>
