      <h1>Unai Emery risks becoming 'dud in a hood' after insipid Arsenal sink further at Leicester</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners are now five games without a win in all competitions after their 2-0 defeat at Leicester City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:51:35+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Dunn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-dunn/</a></address>
      <p>The hood covered his head for the entire game but there is no hiding place for Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>In the nagging rain of Leicester, this was an Arsenal team treading water.</p>
      <p>This is an Arsenal team going in no particular direction, with no discernible style, with little backbone, too often a soft touch.</p>
      <p>Emery has been given the benefit of the doubt by many, including myself, but this was a performance of startling insipidity, of carelessness, of impotency.</p>
      <p>And it was all underpinned by a bizarre lack of technique and application.</p>
      <p>The goals from Jamie Vardy and James Maddison were trademark modern Leicester City. Crisply created, crisply finished, as sparkly as Brendan Rodgers’ smile.</p>

      <p>But they were too easily allowed, too comfortable in their execution.</p>
      <p>And by the end of this entirely predictable contest and result, each and every Arsenal player was doing a passable impression of Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>Shoulders sloping towards the sodden turf, indifference pretending to be disappointment etched on their faces.</p>
      <p>Granit Xhaka was apparently in no state to play this game. There were a few others in the same boat but in the jersey all the same.</p>
      <p>Towards the end of proceedings, Leicester toyed with their opponents.</p>

      <p>The shouts of “Olé" must have been a painful siren call to the Arsenal bigwigs in the King Power stands.</p>
      <p>As the international break starts, they certainly have a decision to make - the old back him or sack him scenario.</p>
      <p>Their club lies sixth in the Premier League table but are nine points behind the team that vanquished them with some comfort here.</p>
      <p>Eight points from the top four, it feels as though - on their overall form - they are even a little lucky to be that close.</p>
      <p>And after their end to last season was so disappointing, it is no wonder Emery is under serious pressure right now.</p>
      <p>He really is.</p>

      <p>At least you have to tip your hat to his continuing insistence on playing it out from the back, particularly when his personnel are not particularly adept at it.</p>
      <p>Too many times, it is laborious, stilted and looks like passing by numbers.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, it as though this defensive unit enjoys seat-of-the-pants moments.</p>
      <p>Bernd Leno sends a thankless ball to Sead Kolasinac one moment, the wing-back returns the favour the next.</p>
      <p>It is nice having a philosophy, even nicer having practitioners who can carry it out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Leicester’s first half opportunities, for example, were almost exclusively created by Arsenal errors - Lucas Torreira getting caught in possession, Hector Bellerin sending a square ball to the opposition, and a whole variety of other mistakes.</p>
      <p>But despite his liking for short-passing out of defence, there is still a conservatism about a lot of Emery’s style that, quite simply, sits uneasily with the previous era.</p>
      <p>This is a team that does not impose itself on an opponent anywhere near often enough.</p>
      <p>Given Leicester’s decent start to the season and their obvious threat on the counter-attack, you could say Emery’s caution was semi-understandable.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When Arsenal did break, they looked threatening on occasions but the combination of Ozil, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang never really clicked, betraying the lack of conviction that courses through this Emery squad.</p>
      <p>And that is why, after the second half hits from Vardy and Maddison, a fightback never looked even the remotest of possibilities.</p>
      <p>All that was left was for Emery to shake Rodgers’ hand and turn on his heel and walk down the tunnel, his head still covered.</p>
      <p>Remember the 'wally with the brolly'?</p>
      <p>Emery is in danger of becoming the 'dud in a hood'.</p>
