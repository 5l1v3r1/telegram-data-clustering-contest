      <h1>Labour close gap on Tories in latest general election opinion poll</h1>
      <h2>Hope for Jeremy Corbyn's party after Scottish poll predicted a wipeout north of the border</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T20:33:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author">Gordon Robertson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gordon-robertson/</a></address>
      <p>Labour has closed the gap on the Tories according to the latest <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/time-show-bojo-door-20829109">general election</a> opinion poll on UK voting intentions.</p>
      <p>The gap between the top two parties has narrowed by four percentage points.</p>
      <p>The poll conducted by Opinium for the Observer newspaper put the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/former-chancellor-philip-hammond-announces-20817643">Conservatives</a> on 41%, down one percentage point on the previous poll a week ago, while Labour gained three percentage points to rise to 29%.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/jo-swinson-only-cared-herself-20820395">Liberal Democrats</a> , in third place, slipped to 15%.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/jeremy-corbyn-promises-probe-claim-20847226">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will take heart from the projections at the end of a week when one opinion poll predicted Labour's worst result in Scotland in over a century. A YouGov poll of UK regions put Labour in fourth place, a point behind the Lib Dems who are on 13 per cent.</p>
      <p>If the latest YouGov survey is correct the SNP will increase it share of the vote from 37 per cent in 2017 to 42 per cent at the general election on December 12. Tory support has fallen seven points to 22 per cent.</p>
      <p>But Labour’s backing was pegged at just 12 percent in Scotland which could mean a total wipeout in a country the party once dominated.</p>
