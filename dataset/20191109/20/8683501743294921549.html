      <p><i>Ghost Draft</i> is out, but <i>The Tomorrow War</i> is in for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478966/chris-pratt-sidesteps-questions-about-star-lords-next-marvel-appearance">Chris Pratt</a>. The Marvel and <i>Jurassic World</i> star just shared a first look at his new sci-fi movie, which also -- congrats! -- marks his first time as an executive producer. Apparently there were problems right out of the gate, since they had to change the title.</p>
      <p>Since Chris Pratt is Chris Pratt, he poked fun at the name change in a hilarious post sharing "other options" for the title, before revealing what they went with:</p>

      <p>I fully expect <i>Jurassic Draft</i> to end up a title in the Jurassic franchise at some point. Give them time.</p>
      <p>Chris Pratt is a lean, not-so-mean marketing machine. He will keep fans well-informed and very entertained throughout filming. Speaking of lean, though, back when we all thought this sci-fi movie would be called <i>Ghost Draft</i>, Chris Pratt updated fans on his weight loss routine to get in shape for the movie. He had already dropped 12 pounds by the time of his posting, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478978/how-chris-pratt-quickly-dropped-12-pounds-so-far-for-his-next-movie">and shared how he did it</a>.</p>
      <p><i>The Lego Batman Movie</i> director Chris McKay is directing what we're now calling <i>The Tomorrow War</i>. The movie reportedly co-stars Yvonne Strahovski. J.K. Simmons, Sam Richardson, and Betty Gilpin.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jk-simmons-talks-join-chris-pratt-ghost-draft-1232525">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the story is set in a future where humanity is losing a war against aliens. To turn the tide, scientists draft soldiers from the past to fight the war. J.K. Simmons may be playing Prattâ€™s father.</p>
      <p>Anyway, it's a good thing they didn't call it <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484260/will-edge-of-tomorrow-2-actually-happen-heres-what-doug-liman-says"><i>Edge of Tomorrow</i></a>, eh? Based on that photo, they <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476102/sylvester-stallone-just-got-new-inspiration-for-the-expendables-4">could've also called it <i>The Expendables</i></a>, if that title wasn't taken.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure who is with Chris Pratt in this photo, but they sure brought a lot of guns. I hope guns can kill aliens and it's not one of those movies where they keep shooting for no reason anyway.</p>
      <p>The artist currently known as <i>The Tomorrow War</i> was scheduled to start filming in September and film in Atlanta and Iceland. As far as we know, that's still the case and fans can now look forward to more updates from Chris Pratt. He should be everywhere pretty soon -- promoting <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481967/pixars-onward-trailer-tom-holland-and-chris-pratt-go-on-a-twisted-magical-journey">his 2020 Pixar movie <i>Onward</i></a> and starting <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484242/jurassic-world-3-will-bring-back-2-more-familiar-faces">filming for <i>Jurassic World 3</i></a>. Then Pratt should finally be able to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471081/when-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-may-finally-begin-filming">film <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i></a>, which was delayed after James Gunn was fired. Now Gunn is back, but he's busy with DC's <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, and everyone's schedules had to shuffle around.</p>
      <p>Long story short, Chris Pratt may not have much free time in the next few years, so it's good that he went out for <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483687/chris-pratt-had-the-best-reaction-to-father-in-law-arnold-schwarzenegger-in-terminator-dark-fate">that <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> movie date</a> with his wife while he could.</p>
      <p>Since Chris Pratt is always a savvy marketer, and usually pretty candid, I'm looking forward to hearing about his experience as a first-time executive producer. Instead of <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1636950/check-out-the-horrible-stuff-chris-pratt-is-eating-to-stay-in-shape-for-jurassic-world-2">What's My Snack?</a> maybe he can do What's My Production Schedule? Yeah, that does sound less interesting. But something like that.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more details on <i>The Tomorrow War</i>, including an official release date. And apparently he'll be auctioning off a set visit? I hope Chris Hemsworth wins and comes dressed <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471639/karen-gillan-hopes-drunk-thor-joins-the-guardians-of-the-galaxy">as Fat Thor</a>. I just do.</p>
