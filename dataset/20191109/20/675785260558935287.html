      <p>"For you, controlled aggression. You have to have a gameplan and stick to it.</p>
      <p>"If your creative tells you something, you have to follow that through.</p>
      <p>"You can't let your red mist get in the way and then it becomes a puncher's chance.</p>
      <p>"You have to stick to controlled aggression and show discipline."</p>

      <p>The YouTube stars both vowed to send their the other into boxing and social media retirement at the final weigh-in.</p>
      <p>“He’s been saying the same thing every time, that he’s going to end me," said Paul. “I told him [promoter] <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eddie-hearn">Eddie Hearn</a> is going to be in trouble because he’s going to get hurt.</p>
      <p>“I perform the best at my natural weight, watch me hit this man repeatedly on his giant forehead.”</p>
      <p>And after weighing in, KSI - real name Olajide William Olatunji - said: "He should have beat me in his last fight; that was his best opportunity, now I’m too good for him.</p>
      <p>“Once I get rid of the jab it’s over for him; he knows he’s finished, he knows nothing about boxing.”</p>
