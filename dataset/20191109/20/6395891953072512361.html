      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Keegan Shoemaker threw for two touchdowns, Lafayette recovered an onside kick with about two minutes to go and the Leopards defeated the last of the unbeaten Patriot League teams with a 23-20 win at Holy Cross on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Leopards (3-7, 3-1) have won three in a row, Holy Cross (5-5, 3-1) had won four of five.</p>
      <p>After the Crusaders took a 3-0 lead, Shoemaker and Julian Spigner hooked up for a 48-yard touchdown. A couple plays later, Ryan Dickens caused a fumble with Major Jordan recovering and the Leopards took over near midfield. On the second play, Shoemaker and Julius Young connected for a 34-yard score.</p>
      <p>The rest of Lafayette's points came courtesy of kicker Jeffrey Kordenbrock. Connor Degenhardt's second touchdown pass, with 2:10 remaining, pulled Holy Cross with three but Jake Liedtka recovered the onside kick.</p>
