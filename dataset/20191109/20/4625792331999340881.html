      <h1>De Niro supports Buttigieg and Bloomberg, calls Trump a 'genuine loser'</h1>

      <p>Robert De Niro expressed support for the potential presidencies of Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, contrasting them to President Trump, whom he described as a “genuine loser.”</p>
      <p>Appearing on MSNBC’s <i>AM Joy </i>on Saturday, the acclaimed actor and director said that if Trump fails to win reelection, the United States needs a president that can show the country is “growing up” and “repairing the damage that has been done.”</p>
      <p>“Personally, I think somebody like Buttigieg would be capable of doing that,” De Niro said of the 37-year-old South Bend, Indiana, mayor. “He’s young, but he’s got all the qualifications.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bloomberg-files-for-2020-democratic-primary-in-alabama">filed to have his name</a> on the Alabama ballot along with other Democratic contenders, although he hasn’t announced his candidacy for president.</p>
      <p>De Niro said that Bloomberg, 77, has the potential to be a good president, citing his experience running the city and his business acumen.</p>
      <p>“He’s a grown-up, and he’s run this city for three terms,” De Niro said. “He’s an executive. He hasn’t done everything perfectly, but he’s very, very good; he’ll get us out of this mess.”</p>
      <p>De Niro pointed out that Bloomberg has not reached out to him for his support, but he noted they have talked about the presidency in the past.</p>
      <p>“I think he sees right now that he has to jump in because he has to jump in,” he said.</p>
      <p>When asked if the country would benefit from another billionaire from New York as president, De Niro took shots at the president.</p>
      <p>“But Trump is not a billionaire. He is a fake president,” De Niro said. “Everything that he says negative about other things or other people is what he is saying about himself, so he is fake. He is a loser. He is a genuine loser.”</p>
      <p>“He’s just a total huckster, he’s a hustler,” De Niro added.</p>

      <p>De Niro was in the news recently after one of his former staffers <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/woman-accuses-de-niro-of-calling-her-bitch-and-brat-and-joking-about-viagra-in-12m-lawsuit">filed a $12 million lawsuit</a> for gender discrimination and wage violations. The accuser, Graham Chase Robinson, alleges that the actor fostered a hostile work environment that included bullying and sexually charged language.</p>
