      <h3>Ease demands, boost co-operation</h3>
      <p>As reported in the Nov. 1 edition of the Regina Leader-Post, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/moe-asks-pm-for-hiatus-on-carbon-tax-to-negotiate-climate-plan-with-feds">Premier Moe is “reaching out” to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in an effort to suspend the carbon tax and achieve a “new deal”</a>, including restructured equalization and pipeline expansion.</p>
      <p>I will leave the analysis of the proposed “new deal” to others, but would like to comment on the premier’s tactics.  If I interpret the premier correctly, his message seems to be: “Here are my demands. I am not willing to compromise, but I want to sit down and negotiate with the prime minister until he agrees with me.”</p>
      <p>I, for one, would like to see less rhetoric, more leadership and more statesmanship from our premier. In my view, ultimatums and threats of western separation will ultimately be detrimental to our province and to Canada. Working positively with the federal government to achieve a strong economy while addressing the threats of global warming will ultimately be beneficial to all Canadians — including the people of Saskatchewan, most of whom want to remain in Canada.</p>
      <p>Also required is the recognition that there are significant economic and social pressures in other parts of Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, and that these challenges must also be taken into account in considering a restructuring of the equalization regime.</p>
      <p>Resolving these matters will undoubtedly require the spirit of co-operation and compromise by all parties.</p>

      <h3>National ‘stress test’ is alienating</h3>
      <p>After the recent Bank of Canada (BofC) announcement to hold interest rates at 1.75 per cent, BofC Governor Stephen Poloz explained how the worsening global situation is the primary issue behind the decision.</p>
      <p>He described Canada’s outlook as complex and varied across Canada, with certain areas of growth offsetting negative effects coming from business outlook and exports. The BofC also discuss the “evolution of financial vulnerabilities in Canada”, namely how susceptible the housing market is to any kind of shock.</p>
      <p>It is odd how the BofC considers locking out tens of thousands of prospective first-time homebuyers as “normal” market behaviour. At the same time the Banks’ own analysis suggests that there is no rate shock in sight. They continue to celebrate the contribution of housing to Canada’s economy, but fail to acknowledge that the current stress test has negatively affected many Canadians’ access to homeownership, keeping those citizens locked into rental.</p>
      <p>The ‘four horsemen of the stress test apocalypse’ (OFSI, BofC, CMHC and Ministry of Finance) fail to recognize mortgage stress tests need to be sensitive to regional differences. For instance, after the implementation of the stress test, homebuyers in Regina required 18.4 per cent additional income to purchase a $400,000 home. Even though according to Statistics Canada, Canadian mortgage liabilities/assets is at 11.1 per cent, while Saskatchewan is at 8.3 per cent. Canadian debt to disposable income is 183.0 per cent, Saskatchewan is 154.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>What we need is a more responsive policy to address systemic risks, while balancing the aspirations of Canadians. Blanketing the nation with a pan-Canadian mortgage stress test is one more way the feds do create regional alienation.</p>
