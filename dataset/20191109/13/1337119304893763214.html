      <h1>Sam’s Club’s one-day sale is over, but more Black Friday deals are coming</h1>
      <h2>A breakdown of the deals you can get in-store and online</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:40:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p>Sam’s Club, like every other major retailer, will be taking part in Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019. It got started earlier than most, with a one-day sale that took place on Saturday, November 9th. If you missed out, don’t worry. We expect most, if not all, of those deals to make a reappearance at some point again this month.</p>
      <p>We’ll update this post with any noteworthy Black Friday deals from Sam’s Club that we stumble upon. Also, if there’s a markedly better deal happening at a different retailer, we’ll be sure to point you in the right direction.</p>
      <h3>The best Black Friday deals at Sam’s Club so far</h3>
      <p>Sam’s Club offered the <a href="https://fave.co/34INYRj">11-inch iPad Pro with 256GB of storage for $749</a>. We’ve seen it hit this price a few times before, but it’s rare, and other retailers charge $50 more at the moment. You can find this deal in-store only, though.</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/32zLQuE">Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum X 4K HDR TV</a> (pictured above) was $979 during its one-day event, a 30 percent price drop. I’m hopeful to see this deal pop up at other retailers because it’s the best price we’ve seen yet for this high-end model. This deal is available online, as well as in-store.</p>
      <p>If you’re shopping for a TV, Vizio’s P-Series will be of interest if excellent picture quality (enabled by its Quantum Dot LED tech that rivals OLED at a cheaper cost) and Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support are must-have features for you. This TV is also very bright: it can reach a maximum of 3000 nits, and it has 384 local dimming zones. (The more of these your TV has, the better; they make for a more realistically lit scene.)</p>

      <p>Other Vizio-branded 4K TVs are steeply discounted at Sam’s Club, including models from its M- and V-Series, which are more value-focused options compared to the flagship P-Series listed above. Across the board, they have fewer dimming zones and aren’t as bright. But if neither of those things matters all that much to you, they will probably be exactly what you’re looking for. And with AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support, even these cheaper models stand above other options if you’re looking for connectivity with the Apple ecosystem. You can read more about the differences between Vizio’s 2019 models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18633827/vizio-2019-4k-tv-p-series-quantum-m-series-v-series-pricing">right here</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://fave.co/2Byt1vK">Vizio 55-inch M-Series 4K TV was $399</a> (usually $429). If the more expensive P-Series TV is out of your budget, this is the one to get since as it also features the same Quantum Dot technology for more accurate colors and contrast.</li>
        <li><a href="https://fave.co/32DoXGE">Vizio 70-inch V-Series 4K TV was $549</a> (usually $689)</li>
        <li><a href="https://fave.co/2W05GMX">Vizio 50-inch V-Series 4K TV was $239</a> (usually $289)</li>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2PqQXtp">LG’s massive 75-inch 4K HDR TV (model 6970) was $749</a>, which is more than 20 percent off from its regular price. What’s better than this low price on a big TV is that this purchase includes <b>a $70 Sam’s Club gift card</b>. Generally, it’s tough to find a 75-inch 4K HDR TV under $1,000 (at least, one you should be looking to buy), and if you’re on the hunt, this could be the deal of the season for you.</p>
      <p>If you want to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 10, <a href="https://fave.co/2O05PfM">Sam’s Club will offer a big $450 gift card when you purchase one on an installment plan and activate it on AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, or U.S. Cellular</a>. Plus, it will give you up to $250 in gift cards for a trade-in. Keep in mind that the gift cards can’t be used at the time of buying the phone, so you’ll have to use them later on.</p>

      <p>A similar deal is going on for the latest iPhone, including the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. <a href="https://fave.co/2O05PfM">Instead, Sam’s Club will offer up to a $400 gift card</a> when you activate and agree to pay installments. The same details apply as above.</p>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2PrqY4Z">The HP Pavilion x360 laptop (15.6-inch display, Intel Core i5-8256U CPU, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD) was $499</a> today. It usually costs $899, and at nearly half-off, this is a great price for a 2-in-1 Windows 10 laptop with specs suitable for office work, casual browsing, and some very light gaming. You can find this deal online, as well as in-store.</p>

      <p>Sam’s Club is hosting a $100 discount on an appealing Xbox One S bundle that includes an extra first-party wireless controller. Normally $299, <a href="https://fave.co/366FOnk">it will cost $199</a>. This is a good value if you have two gamers in the house, or you just want a second controller to use on your PC, iOS 13, or Android 10 device. (Both operating systems recently gained native support for the controller.) This deal is exclusive to Sam’s Club’s online store.</p>
      <p>If the Apple Watch Series 5 with GPS and LTE capability are on your list, <a href="https://fave.co/2NxGj2H">Sam’s Club is knocking $40 off of this model in both sizes</a>. This is an online-only deal, and it’s cheaper than the cost at Amazon, so head over to its site to pick your size and color starting at $459.</p>

      <p><a href="https://fave.co/36fiW56">Netgear’s Nighthawk X6 wireless router with AC3000 support was $129.88</a> at Sam’s Club. This is a flat $50 discount, and with its array of six antennas, this model seems well-suited for pushing a fast, reliable Wi-Fi signal throughout your home, whether you’re gaming, streaming 4K video, or doing any other bandwidth-intensive activities.</p>
