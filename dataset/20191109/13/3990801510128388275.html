      <h1>CHEAP: Dance on the graves of your enemies with this $30 Razer mouse (58% off)</h1>
      <h2>Cracking skulls has never been cheaper</h2>

        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re no stranger to viciously gunning down opponents in <i>CS:GO</i>, <i>Call of Duty</i>, <i>Battlefield</i>, or simply sniping down pedestrians in <i>GTA</i>, you know the importance of a mouse you can rely on, a mouse that will perfectly mirror each and every little movement you make. That’s what gaming mice are for.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, they tend to be pretty steep. But not today, not with this killer deal on Razer’s DeathAdder Elite gaming mouse, which is currently 58 percent off its list price of $69.99. That’s right, <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FRazer-DeathAdder-Elite-Wired-Optical-Gaming-Mouse-with-Chroma-Lighting-Black%2F323972841355">you can grab one of these for just $29.99</a>. That’s a fucking license to steal.</p>
      <p>The mouse has a sensor with 16,000 DPI, programmable RGB lights (you’ll need Razer Synapse) for that, a bunch of customizable buttons, and a polling rate of 1,000Hz. All of that, according to Razer, guarantees a resolution accuracy of 99.4 percent. Pretty sweet.</p>

      <p>While I haven’t personally used the DeathAdder Elite, I recently tested Razer’s Viper Ultimate, which offers similar (although slightly better) specs, and I absolutely loved it. I’m confident the DeathAdder Elite won’t disappoint either, especially when you’re getting such a good bang for your buck.</p>
      <p>True, it’s not wireless, but you know what they say: you can’t always get what you want. What you can get, though, is a hell of a deal on the DeathAdder Elite right now. Really, I mean, Razer currently sells these for <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-elite">$69.99</a> on its own website. Let that sink in.</p>
      <p>I wouldn’t miss it, if I were you. You know what to do: <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;toolid=11800&amp;pub=5575402880&amp;campid=5338330150&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FRazer-DeathAdder-Elite-Wired-Optical-Gaming-Mouse-with-Chroma-Lighting-Black%2F323972841355">CLICK, CLICK, CLICK</a>.</p>
