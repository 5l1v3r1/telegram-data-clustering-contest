      <p>TOKYO, Nov 9 — Tens of thousands of people gathered on Saturday at a national festival to celebrate the enthronement of Japan's Emperor Naruhito with dancers and pop stars offering jubilant performances.</p>
      <p>Some 10,000 citizens who won hard-to-get tickets and 20,000 invited guests attended the evening festival at Tokyo's Imperial Palace Plaza, which was broadcast live across the nation.</p>
      <p>The festival came after Naruhito completed his ascension to the Chrysanthemum throne on October 22 in a ceremony steeped in the traditions and grandeur of a monarchy that claims 2,000 years of history.</p>
      <p>“I am grateful to you gathering here today for your congratulations,” Naruhito told a flag-waving crowd, standing on a stone bridge at the palace with Empress Masako following congratulatory speeches by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other notable figures.</p>
      <p>J-pop group Arashi performed a song composed for the event.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, another 30,000 people enjoyed local dancing performances at the venue.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the royal couple will parade in a convertible car along a 4.6-kilometre route from the palace to their residence in central Tokyo to mark the enthronement.</p>
      <p>The parade was originally scheduled for October 22 but postponed after more than 80 people were killed when Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan and caused widespread damage.</p>
      <p>In his brief speech, the emperor offered his condolences to the victims and voiced his “sincere hope” for an early recovery from the disaster. — AFP</p>
