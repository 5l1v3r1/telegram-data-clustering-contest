        <b>India U-19 football team were beaten 0-4 by Saudi Arabia at the Prince Saud bin Jalawi Stadium on Friday, thus, bowing out of the race for the 2020 AFC U-19 Championships qualification. India conceded four goals within the half an hour mark including an 18-minute hat-trick by Ahmad Albassas.</b>

      <p>India U-19 football team suffered a 0-4 defeat against Saudi Arabia in their second match of the 2020 AFC U-19 Championships qualifier at the Prince Saud bin Jalawi Stadium on Friday in Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia. This defeat means India have bowed out of the race for the 2020 AFC U-19 Championships qualification.</p>
      <p>The hosts opened the scoring as early as the second minute as forward Mohammad Khalil Marran latched on to a loose ball and put it past Indian goalkeeper Prabhsukhan Singh Gill. Midfielder Ahmad Albassas made it 2-0 for Saudi Arabia in the 10th minute as the midfielder got to the end of a cross from the left flank by Hazzaa Alghamdi.</p>
      <p>As India head coach Floyd Pinto's side pushed forward to reduce the deficit, Albassas netted his second of the game in the 18th minute. He completed a quick-fire hat-trick in the 28th minute, once again converting a low cross from the left flank as Saudi Arabia broke forward in numbers on the counter-attack. </p>
      <p>India’s 18-year-old winger Ninthoinganba Meetei posed problems for the hosts throughout the first half with his pace and guile, earning a number of free-kicks from attacking positions. He came closest to scoring two minutes before the half-time break but his powerful shot went just wide of the post.</p>
      <p>India made a change at the break with Rocky Shabong making way for Manvir Singh. Manvir almost made an instant impact as he raced towards the by-line down the right and put in a cross that just missed Vikram Partap on the far post just 2 minutes after the restart.  In their final group-stage match, which has been rendered inconsequential, India will face Afghanistan on Sunday.</p>
