      <p>Slaven Bilic has supported West Ham United manager Manuel Pellegrini’s sentiments as Grady Diangana’s future was thrust into the limelight this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Brom</a> loanee Diangana, who has been in scintillating form since joining on loan from the Premier League Irons in August, has been the subject of speculation that they might be set to recall him - as is their right - in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Diangana, who has been called up to the England U21s squad for their clashes with Albania and Holland next week, has scored four and assisted four further goals already this term.</p>

      <p>With the Londoners struggling for form of late, and with Diangana catching the eye week on week in a successful Albion side, many tipped Pellegrini to come calling for the winger.</p>
      <p>The Chilean on Thursday, however, indicated that he was pleased with Diangana’s progress as a player at The Hawthorns and was eager for him to continue his development for the entirety of the campaign.</p>
      <p>“I think that Grady is doing what we wanted for him, same as Josh Cullen. He’s a player without any doubt will be part of West Ham in the future,” he said at his press conference.</p>

      <p>“I trust a lot in Grady and I think it was better for him to go and play 40 games this season and be ready for next season, than to play here just some games. I think he must finish his season where he is.”</p>
      <p>Bilic, a former West Ham player and manager himself, agrees that Diangana is best off staying where he is.</p>
      <p>“Of course,” Bilic said. “Pellegrini is a great manager. He’s done everything, but I really think that for us, for West Ham and for Grady, it’ll best for him to stay and to grow up as a player.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Grady is nowhere near the finished article. He’s a young player who is enjoying it. It’s his first season where he’s an important part of the team that is fighting for something.</p>
      <p>“I’m not only talking about the pressure and everything, it’s also off the pitch. It’s great for him. He’s on a great path, he’s enjoying every game.</p>
      <p>“He’s raising his game, he’s growing and it would be for me not good for him and also for West Ham long term - and for us, of course - to stop that process.”</p>

      <p>Diangana and the rest of the Baggies squad are preparing to take on Hull City this weekend.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old will feature having come through another eye-catching display in the win at Stoke City on Monday - despite the heavy challenge from Potters defender Cameron Carter-Vickers that earned Albion a penalty.</p>
      <p>“He’s alright,” Bilic added. “It was not deliberate, but it was a reckless challenge. He was lucky, basically, that his foot was off the ground.</p>
      <p>“It was very dangerous, but he’s okay.”</p>
