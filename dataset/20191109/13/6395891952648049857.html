      <p>After all, reports of her death were greatly exaggerated.</p>
      <p>Sherry Ellis, 73, of Magnolia, said she discovered she was listed as dead by the Social Security Administration, which resulted in the suspension of her bank account and insurance, <a href="https://abc13.com/health/woman-labeled-deceased-is-alive-and-cannot-receive-medication/5684685/">KTRK</a> reported. Once Ellis was reported dead, her Medicare was discontinued.</p>
      <p>"As far as they're concerned, I am deceased," Ellis told the television station.</p>
      <p>Unraveling the paperwork has been an issue, and with her supply of medicine running low Ellis said she is becoming concerned.</p>
      <p>Ellis said she takes at least nine pills a day, not including vitamins, <a href="https://abc13.com/health/woman-labeled-deceased-is-alive-and-cannot-receive-medication/5684685/">KTRK</a> reported.<br/><br/>Ellis told the television station the pills for her heart and blood pressure cost $850 a month without insurance.</p>
      <p>Ellis said the Social Security Administration erroneously associated her Social Security number with a death certificate. She visited the bureau's office in Conroe on Monday and tried to straighten out the mistake, but she remains listed as deceased, <a href="https://abc13.com/health/woman-labeled-deceased-is-alive-and-cannot-receive-medication/5684685/">KTRK</a> reported.<br/><br/>"'You all used my Social Security number on a deceased person on their death certificate,'" Ellis said. "And I said, 'I am not deceased.'"</p>
      <p>Ellis said she returned to the Social Security Administration office Thursday, and officials gave her a letter explaining the situation to her pharmacy. It was not good enough, Ellis said.<br/><br/>"They said, 'I'm sorry, that letter is no good to us. It has to be in the system because that's your insurance in the system,'" Ellis told <a href="https://abc13.com/health/woman-labeled-deceased-is-alive-and-cannot-receive-medication/5684685/">KTRK</a><a href="https://abc13.com/health/woman-labeled-deceased-is-alive-and-cannot-receive-medication/5684685/">.</a><br/><br/>While she waits, Ellis said she only has six heart medication pills left, the television station reported. The cost to refill without insurance is $400, she said.</p>
