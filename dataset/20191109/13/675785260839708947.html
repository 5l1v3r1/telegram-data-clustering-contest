      <h2>KSI and Logan Paul are heading to LA for their highly-anticipated rematch - and this time the stakes are much higher</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, Martin Domin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul clash for a second time tonight - and this time it's professional.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars will bid to settle their rivalry once and for all and have come to Los Angeles for their eagerly-anticipated rematch.</p>
      <p>Having fought to a controversial draw in Manchester last year in a white-collar bout, this time the social media stars have dispensed with the head guards and pulled on 10oz gloves.</p>
      <p>They will star at the Staples Center in front of a 20,000 crowd after Eddie Hearn agreed to promote the sequel.</p>
      <p>And such is their pulling power that world champions Billy Joe Saunders and Devin Hane, as well as a host of up-and-coming stars, have agreed to box on the undercard.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about tonight's fights...</p>
