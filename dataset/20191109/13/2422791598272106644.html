      <p>TORONTO -- After nearly four decades of being co-host of the Wheel of Fortune, Vanna White has temporarily stepped into the role of host while Pat Sajak recovers from surgery.</p>
      <p>The show put out a tweet Friday afternoon explaining that taping had to be canceled on Thursday when Sajak was forced to undergo an emergency surgery to “correct a blocked intestine.”</p>
      <p>A photo attached to the tweet shows the iconic wall of letters spelling out “GET WELL SOON PAT!”</p>
      <p>“He is resting comfortably and looking forward to getting back to work,” the tweet reads.</p>
      <p>Sajak won a Guinness World Record for the longest career as a game show host of the same show <a href="https://twitter.com/WheelofFortune/status/1126275589818572800">earlier in 2019</a> for his role with the Wheel of Fortune.</p>
      <p>Taping <a href="https://twitter.com/WheelofFortune/status/1192962616051658754">resumed on Friday</a> with White as the host, joined by Disney characters Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy and Pluto as guests.</p>
