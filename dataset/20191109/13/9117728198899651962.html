        <b>2019 has been a very strong comeback season for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a>, with a new line-up as well as their new team principal, Andreas Seidl. However, the German, who has been crucial in the team's uptick in performance, credits his drivers <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lando-norris">Lando Norris</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> for McLaren's impressive season rather than himself.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's been the first time in half a decade McLaren have scored over 100 points again, with the team having accumulated 121 points after 19 races, 10 of which coming last time out in the United States.</p>
      <p>Sainz is also ahead of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> in the drivers' standings, despite the Frenchman having driven in a Red Bull for over half the season. Many think McLaren can now push ahead to challenge the top three teams next season, as Seidl reflects on 2019 to <i>Gazzetta dello Sport.</i></p>

        <i>"We confirmed both drivers for 2020 early in the year. That speaks volumes to how much we believe in them. They both have a beautiful future ahead of them, especially if we give them a good car.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"I'm impressed by their speed in both qualifying as well as the races," </i>the German continued.</p>
      <p><i>"Besides that, they work well with the engineers and the sponsors and media. Things are also good between them. They understand this isn't the time for personal battles, but that it's about </i>[helping] <i>the team."</i></p>
      <p>With Sainz and Norris typically being evenly matched during weekends, Seidl also expressed he prefers teammates to be battling rather than having a clear number one and number two within the team, as has been the case during the Fernando Alonso-Stoffel Vandoorne years.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"For me, it's always better to have two strong drivers. I'd rather have a quick and difficult driver than a slow and easy to manage driver."</i>
