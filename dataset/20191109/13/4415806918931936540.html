      <p>There are calls for increased Garda resources to clamp down on violent attacks and crime in Cork city.</p>
      <p>Armed gardaí as well as the force’s riot squad were deployed to Cork city centre last night after reports that a high-profile shop on St Patrick’s St <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/armed-gardai-and-riot-squad-deployed-in-cork-following-public-order-concerns-last-night-962781.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">was about to be robbed by a group of teenagers</a>.</p>
      <p>The Garda Public Order Unit, commonly known as the riot squad, along with a single armed support unit, were sent to patrol the streets of Cork City centre amid fears that a group of teenagers were about to go on the rampage.</p>
      <p>There were also a number of gardaí on foot patrol.</p>
      <p>Shortly after 6pm, a group of up to 100 teenagers with their faces covered could be seen running along St Patrick’s St after a notice was posted on Twitter by an unknown individual or group calling for a raid on JD Sports.</p>
      <p>The message was circulated on social media advising people to gather outside McDonald’s on Winthrop St, off St Patrick’s St, at 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>The message stated: “Dress code. You must wear all black with bally [balaclava] and gloves. You only have one minute to yam that shop. This is at your own risk. Don’t come if you can’t run.”</p>

      <p>Local councillor Ken O'Flynn said it is the latest in a series of worrying incidents in the city.</p>
      <p>"It's an extremely worrying development in the city," said Mr O Flynn.</p>
      <p>"As you know we've had a number of attacks in the city, violent attacks in the city in the recent past.</p>
      <p>"Cork city isn't used to that type of behaviour. Cork city is normally a safe environment with a good shopping environment.</p>
      <blockquote>It's shocking, it's disappointing, it's disgusting to see.</blockquote>
      <p>"This is down to the lack of garda resources."</p>
      <p>Local councillor Des Cahill says the incident was "truly shocking" and "bizarre".</p>
      <p>He said those involved should think about the people and the businesses they are affecting and of the potential knock-on effects</p>
      <p>Has added the people involved should also worry about themselves, saying they will get into trouble if caught.</p>
      <p>A garda spokesperson today said that there had been no arrests following the incident.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said last night they deployed additional resources to the area after being made aware of the potential for an incident.</p>
      <p>Speaking last night, Labour councillor John Maher called for all those involved in the suspected pre-planned incident in Cork to face the full weight of the law.</p>
      <p>It is believed the foiled incident may have been modelled on a gang raid of a JD Store in London on Halloween night last week which is being investigated by Scotland Yard.</p>
      <p>A gang of masked and hooded youths looted a JD Sports store in north London, grabbing handfuls of branded clothing before fleeing the scene.</p>
