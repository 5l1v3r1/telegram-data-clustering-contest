      <h1>Kamala Harris' proposal to extend school days is not healthy, Rachel Campos-Duffy says</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential candidate</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris">Sen. Kamala Harris'</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-school-days">proposal</a> to "align the school day with the workday" is not "healthy" and "certainly not pro-family," Fox News contributor and mother of nine <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/rachel-campos-duffy">Rachel Campos-Duffy</a> said Saturday.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Harris, D-Calif., introduced legislation that would incentivize <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education">school districts</a> to extend school days as a way of accommodating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/parents">parents'</a> work schedules.</p>
      <p>The Family Friends Schools Act would offer five-year, $5 million grants for schools to "develop high-quality, culturally relevant, linguistically accessible, developmentally appropriate academic, athletic or enrichment opportunities for students."</p>
      <p>“My mother raised my sister and me while working demanding, long hours,” <a href="https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-introduces-family-friendly-schools-act">said</a> Harris. “So, I know firsthand that, for many working parents, juggling between school schedules and work schedules is a common cause of stress and financial hardship. ... My bill provides an innovative solution that will help reduce the burden of childcare on working families."</p>
      <p>"It is time we modernize the school schedule to better meet the needs of our students and their families,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also tweeted that "Justice for students and working families is 'on the ballot.'"</p>

      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"Fox and Friends: Weekend"</a> with hosts Ed Henry, Pete Hegseth, and Jedidiah Bila, Campos-Duffy argues that Harris' legislation has been "put together by someone who didn't talk to parents."</p>
      <p>She said that what parents want is not to extend the workday or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/goldberg-harris-institutionalizing-school-hours">"institutionalize" their kids</a> but "what they want is options on maybe how do we make the workday shorter or more flexible?"</p>
      <p>"And, there are solutions to that. But, this doesn't address it. It just keeps kids in school way too long and I don't think it's healthy," she told the "Friends: Weekend" hosts.</p>
      <p>"It's pro-government. It's pro-union. No surprise they're backing this policy. It's not pro-child, and it's certainly not pro-family," she said.</p>
      <p>Henry responded that he had reached out to his high school-age daughter for comment but believes she'll be opposed to this proposal.</p>
