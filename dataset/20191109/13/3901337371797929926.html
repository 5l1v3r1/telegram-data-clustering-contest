      <p>Amakhosi have the momentum of winning five games in a row in the Absa Premiership and seven consecutive in all competitions, including two penalty shoot-out wins over Cape Town City and the Buccaneer in the Telkom Knockout.</p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp fielded a much-changed side in their midweek clash against Chippa United, which they managed to win 2-0 thanks to a brace from Dumisani Zuma.</p>
      <p>However, Chiefs are yet to beat Pirates in the league for a period stretching to five years, with their last victory in the Absa Premiership over the Buccaneers coming back in 2014.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Buccaneers are having a contrasting season to the Glamour Boysn, as they enter this afternoon's encounter not featuring in the top half of the table. Rhulani Mokwena’s charges are placed ninth on the table after playing to a goalless draw with Maritzburg United on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Pirates will be without defender Happy Jele after he was sent off in the stalemate with with Maritzburg, but they will welcome back star-man Thembinkosi Lorch from suspension.</p>
