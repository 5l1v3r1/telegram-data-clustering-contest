      <p><b>Porsche</b> has launched <b>online sales in Europe</b>, allowing owners to specify, order, and place a deposit on their vehicles remotely.</p>
      <p>Only the very last steps of buying a car – "customer authentication and final conclusion of the contract" – will take place at a dealership. Online sales will <b>only be offered in Germany</b> <b>initially</b>, before expanding throughout Europe in 2020.</p>
      <p>The brand will also offer online sales in the USA, where 25 dealerships currently sell new and certified pre-owned cars as part of a pilot project.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/porsche/">Porsche Australia</a> has no plans to introduce online sales locally. If it gets the green light, Porsche would join a growing list of carmakers looking at the digital space for car sales Down Under.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/">Holden</a> launched an <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/621295/holden-launches-online-sales-pilot/">online sales pilot</a> in 2018, while <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/subaru/">Subaru</a> was the first brand to offer online sales with the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/subaru/brz/">BRZ</a>. <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mercedes-benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> expects 25 per cent of customers to buy their cars online by 2025, and MB Australia is <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/791887/mercedes-benz-australia-preparing-to-sell-cars-online/">looking to bring digital sales Down Under</a>.</p>
      <p>"Today, customers move between the digital world and physical retail as a matter of course – our new digital marketplace meets this need and therefore makes the experience of purchasing a vehicle even easier and more convenient," said Detlev von Platen, member of the executive board for sales and marketing at Porsche AG.</p>
