      <h1>Dimitar Berbatov makes Leicester vs Arsenal prediction ahead of Premier League clash</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal travel to the King Power Stadium on Saturday evening looking to close the gap on the fourth-placed Foxes. Brendan Rodgers' men are six points clear of the Gunners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:05:45+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Dimitar Berbatov has backed in-form Leicester to inflict more misery on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Gunners travel to the King Power Stadium without a win in their last three Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery's men trail the Foxes by six points as the hosts go into the game after three wins on the spin.</p>
      <p>Betfair ambassador Berbatov believes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> will run out 2-1 winners and boost their top-four hopes.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/dimitar-berbatovs-premier-league-predictions-including-arsenal-chelsea-liverpool-man-utd-11068311/">Metro</a> : "What is Brendan Rodgers telling his players in training? What are they eating? Whatever it is, the results are there for all to see with Leicester flying in the Premier League this season.</p>

      <p>"That man Jamie Vardy scored against last weekend and I can see him getting amongst the goals against a struggling Arsenal team that played in the Europa League in midweek."</p>
      <p>With Leicester in fine form and sitting two places and six points clear of Arsenal in the Premier League table, a visit to the East Midlands would be one of the last places Emery would want to visit.</p>
      <p>Rodgers' side are brimming with confidence, while Arsenal have won just two of their last nine league games and have allowed leads to slip in their last four matches.</p>

      <p>With Arsenal fifth in the table as they chase a return to the Champions League, pressure has begun to mount on Emery's position and another poor showing at Leicester could do even more damage.</p>
      <p>"Must-win? Yes," he said. "We need to win and it's very important for us.</p>
      <p>"But our mentality is every time to play first, using our best structure and organisation to be strong and also our individual players to use their quality to win. But in our mind, for each match it is only to win."</p>
      <p>While a loss at Leicester and other results going against them could see Arsenal end the weekend ninth in the table, Emery insists he maintains the backing of the club's hierarchy.</p>
      <p>He added: "I know we are in one process and we are speaking with the club about the responsibility of the club, and they are supporting us, and the players are supporting me."</p>
