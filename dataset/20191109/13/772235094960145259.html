      <h2>The strike at Bowling Green has left GM with no C8 Corvettes to spare, production delayed until February 2020.</h2>

      <p><b>GM</b> has confirmed what we’d already been expecting: the 40-day United Auto Workers strike has indeed delayed the start of production for the new <b>Chevrolet C8 Corvette</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1125885_mid-engine-2020-chevrolet-corvette-officially-delayed-until-february-2020"><i>Motor Authority</i></a> reports production will start in February 2020 at <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/category/gm/">GM’s</a> Bowling Green Assembly instead of this December. According to the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/chevrolet/">Chevrolet</a> website, the first deliveries to customers will take place in “early 2020”.</p>
      <p>The factory is still filling orders for the outgoing C7 <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/chevrolet/corvette/">Corvette</a> and will then need to be re-tooled for the new car, a process which may take a few weeks.</p>

      <p>There’s been no official change to the C8 Corvette’s local launch timings, however Holden never locked in a particular date – when the C8 was officially revealed, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/777149/chevrolet-corvette-confirmed-for-australia/">we reported</a> the mid-engine supercar would arrive here in right-hand drive form in late 2020 or early 2021.</p>
      <p>We also haven't received official word on how much the Corvette will cost here, though we also reported Holden dealers had been briefed on a price somewhere in the range of $100-150,000.</p>
      <p>The C8 differs from the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/chevrolet/camaro/">Chevrolet Camaro</a> currently sold at HSV dealerships in that it'll be built in right-hand drive at the factory, a first for the venerable Corvette nameplate.</p>
      <p>The current <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/516466/2017-chevrolet-corvette-c7-review/">C7 Corvette</a> has a base price in the US market of $55,900 (A$81,038). In comparison, the cheapest <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/porsche/911/">Porsche 911</a> there, the Carrera, costs $91,100 (A$132,067).</p>

      <p>The C8 Corvette uses a <b>6.2-litre V8</b> with <b>370kW</b> and <b>637Nm</b>, mated exclusively to an <b>eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission</b>. This is a Corvette we're talking about here, though, so expect the engine range to expand quite quickly.</p>
      <p>The current C7 series, for example, is available in Z06 trim, using the LT4 supercharged 6.2-litre V8 also available in the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/763357/2019-chevrolet-camaro-zl1-review/">Camaro ZL1</a>, producing 485kW and 881Nm. There's also the even wilder ZR1, its LT5 supercharged 6.2-litre V8 producing 563kW and 969Nm.</p>
      <p>The new C8 Corvette – the first mid-engine Corvette generation – is rumoured to eventually offer a twin-turbo, double overhead cam V8 and potentially even an electrified variant. It's not as though the base Corvette is wanting for power, though – GM has confirmed a 0-60mph (0-97km/h) time of just 3 seconds.</p>
