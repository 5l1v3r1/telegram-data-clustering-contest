      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T13:02:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity 2019</a> star Roman Kemp was branded "racist" in an explosive Twitter row last year over comments he made about South Korean pop group BTS.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, Roman, 26, became embroiled in a social media showdown after calling BTS' music "noise" during his Capital breakfast show.</p>
      <p>Around 60 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom, and Roman was embroiled in a storm on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> as he was branded "racist" and "xenophobic" by furious listeners.</p>
      <p>At the time, Roman hit back at the haters who criticised him online but he has since deleted his responses.</p>
      <p>In an exchange with the star, one Twitter user wrote: "You mean to say, it’s alright to be racist towards other languages? I don’t think it’s 'normal'."</p>
      <p>Roman's responses to the user have now been wiped.</p>
      <p>Another BTS fan wrote: "This fandom has been professional! We are open for criticism of their music.</p>
      <p>"We understand that not all people will like BTS, but being xenophobic and racist is not acceptable in this society."</p>

      <p>Another furious listener took their complaint to Roman's famous dad martin Kemp, tweeting: "Hi sir, last year your son made a bunch of racist comments on air about the Korean language, comparing it to 'construction noises'.</p>
      <p>"I hope you've since taught him better because honestly it was embarrassing to hear that from a grown adult in 2018. Thanks xx</p>
      <p>The revelation comes as the radio presenter issued a public apology for "offensive" posts that had previously appeared on his social media.</p>
      <p>It is not known if the posts he is referring too were shared as part of the race row or if they were related to another subject.</p>
      <p>Despite not sharing details of his tweets, Roman insisted he was "shocked and appalled" by some of the "offensive" messages he'd posted in the past.</p>

      <p>He insisted he'd cleaned up his account and deleted the offending tweets, telling followers he was "ashamed" and "truly, deeply and utterly sorry".</p>
      <p>Roman's race row kicked off in September 2018 when he was talking about BTS' single IDOL - a collaboration with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicki-minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: "That was BTS and Nicki Minaj, that noise you were just hearing there...</p>
      <p>His co-host Sonny Jay then chipped in: "I thought there [were] construction workers outside.”</p>
      <p>It unfiriated fans of the band as well as many Capital listeners, and Roman had to issue an apology on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The statement, which has since been deleted, read: "The comments I have made have been widely twisted and labelled as something that they are not</p>
      <p>"I will accept 100% responsibility if some of the views I put across have been deemed offensive and to those I can only apologise. No offence was ever meant.</p>

      <p>“It’s never my intention to garner negative energy for anyone let alone within the world of music that I love so dearly.</p>
      <p>"However comments have started to now be aimed toward not only myself but my family and loved ones, I would please ask for this to stop.</p>
      <p>"I am sorry to anyone who may have been offended by any comment I have made toward BTS.</p>
      <p>"I ask all BTS fans to know in their hearts that I have never thought anything negative of the band nor would I wont to stop the joy of spreading music."</p>

      <p>Bosses at Ofcom assessed the comp[laints about Roman's comments, but declined to take any further action.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the organisation said at the time: "We considered complaints about the presenter’s description of a song by the Korean group BTS.</p>
      <p>“In our view, the presenter was expressing a personal opinion about the music, which was not racially motivated.”</p>
      <p>Roman is believed to be flying to Australia this weekend ahead of the I'm A Celebrity launch.</p>
      <p>He's not been officially confirmed by ITV, but was featured in a leaked line-up yesterday and his appearance on the show has been rumoured for weeks.</p>
      <p>The headline-grabbing apology Roman made today comes two years after another I'm A Celebrity star, Jack Maynard, was kicked off the show over his dark Twitter history.</p>
      <p>During his time on the show, Jack's historic tweets featuring racist and homophobic language reemerged, as well as messages sent from his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> account in which he allegedly begged a 14-year-old fan to send him nude pictrues.</p>
      <p>ITV bosses booted him off the show with immediate effect.</p>
