      <p>A NASA scientist has revealed the time scale of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201909131076789442-study-of-dinosaur-killers-crater-contains-lesson-for-today-on-rapid-atmospheric-changes/">dinosaurs, tracking their evolution and demise</a>, by assembling stunning animation showing Earth at the opposite side of the Milky Way during their lifetime, reports <i>Business Insider</i>.</p>
      <p>Tracing our solar system's movement through the Milky Way, Dr Jessie Christiansen shows mankind has been present on Earth for just five million years – less than nine per cent the time of the dinosaurs.</p>

      <p>​Christiansen says she conceived the idea to give an animated illustration of this timeline when she was leading a stargazing party at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. At the time she mentioned that our solar system was across the galaxy when dinosaurs roamed.</p>
      <blockquote>"That was the first time I realized that those time scales — archaeological, fossil-record time scales and astronomical time scales — actually kind of match along together," Christiansen was quoted by the outlet as saying.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Then I had this idea that I could map out dinosaur evolution through the galaxy's rotation."</blockquote>
      <p>According to Christiansen, it took her about four hours to make the film using timed animations in PowerPoint.</p>
      <p>As the Earth and the other planets orbit the Sun, our host star is actually travelling around the Milky Way galaxy at an average speed of 230 kilometres per second.</p>

      <p>It takes the solar system roughly 250 million years to make a complete trip and during that time the entire Milky Way is travelling through the universe.</p>
      <blockquote>“The animation kind of makes it seem like we’ve come back to the same spot, but in reality the whole galaxy has moved a very long way. It’s more like we’re doing a spiral through space. As the whole galaxy’s moving and we’re rotating around the centre, it kind of creates this spiral,” Christiansen explains.</blockquote>
      <p>So in the solar system's rotation around the galactic centre, we're not returning to a fixed point.</p>
      <p>Still, although the “neighbourhood” is different from the last time, Earth is not drastically different.</p>
      <p>It still supports complex life, in part thanks to the path of our sun's galactic orbit which does not approach the inhospitable centre of the galaxy.</p>
      <blockquote>"Our solar system doesn't travel to the centre of the galaxy and then back again. We always stay about this distance away," Christiansen said.</blockquote>
      <p>The dinosaurs roamed the Earth for roughly 177 million years before the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910071076980019-cataclysmic-blast-milky-way-impact/">deadly asteroid impact</a> that is believed to have led to their eventual extinction.</p>

      <p>The new animation from Christiansen shows that 66 million years ago, when the asteroid hit Earth, our planet was on the other side of the Milky Way.</p>
      <p>By comparison, mankind has been present on Earth for just five million years – less than nine per cent the time of the dinosaurs.</p>
      <p>It is still subject to debate as to exactly how long the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909101076769319-dinosaur-killer-asteroid-earth-revealed/">dinosaurs managed to survive</a> after the initial impact.</p>

      <p>Previous research from the University of Berkley, California, believes there is evidence to suggest non-avian dinosaurs survived around 30,000 years afterwards, and they eventually went extinct due to the 100,000 years of drastic climate change caused by the impact.</p>
      <p>Others however, believe the beasts died out in a matter of months, with palaeontologist Ken Lacovara previously saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“They died suddenly and were buried quickly."</blockquote>
