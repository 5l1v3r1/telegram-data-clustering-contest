      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ohio's capital city has announced the two finalists for its next police chief and set a date for a community forum to introduce them.</p>
      <p>Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, a Democrat, has said he wants a chief committed to increasing diversity among the ranks and lining up policing with community expectations of the department.</p>
      <p>The finalists are Thomas Quinlan, currently the interim Columbus police chief, and Perry Tarrant, former assistant police chief in Seattle. Both will appear at a Nov. 21 forum.</p>
      <p>The successful candidate will replace Kim Jacobs, who stepped down in February after nearly seven years. She was the division's first female chief.</p>
      <p>The department has been under scrutiny in recent months because of problems associated with its now-disbanded vice unit.</p>
