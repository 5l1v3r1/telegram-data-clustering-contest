      <p>Hollywood - Charlize Theron was honoured by Hollywood Friday for a "fearless" career in which she tackled themes including sexual harassment long before the #MeToo movement up-ended the industry.</p>
      <p>The 44-year-old South African Oscar-winner, who has often played down her flawless looks to win darker, more complex parts, collected the prestigious American Cinematheque Award at a Beverly Hills gala.</p>
      <p>"I'm overwhelmed - I need a cocktail!" she told AFP as stars including Kristen Stewart, Seth Rogen, and David Oyelowo gathered to honour her career.</p>
      <p>"These people who are here tonight have been with me through a lot of stuff."</p>
      <p>Theron won the best actress Academy Award in 2004 with her turn as prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos in <i>Monster</i>.</p>

      <p>She earned Hollywood's respect with a visceral performance which saw her pack on 30 pounds (14 kg) and render herself unrecognisable with makeup and prosthetics to play the unappealing murderer.</p>
      <p>"She is the most fearless actor I've ever worked with, and probably the most fearless human being I've ever met," said Jason Reitman, who directed Theron in <i>Young Adult</i> and <i>Tully</i>.</p>
      <p>Next month Theron appears in another transformative role - as former TV anchor Megyn Kelly in <i><b><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/watch-charlize-theron-looks-so-much-like-megyn-kelly-we-had-to-look-twice-20190822-2">Bombshell</a></b></i>, which depicts the downfall of Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes after a sexual harassment scandal.</p>

      <p>"When I read (the script) it felt like it was part of a conversation that was happening now. And that to me, felt really important," she said.</p>
      <p>In contrast, her 2005 turn as a miner who files the United States' first class-action sexual harassment lawsuit in <i>North Country</i> came at a time when Hollywood turned a blind eye to such issues.</p>
      <p>Back then there was a sense that sexual harassment "was in the past and that it's been dealt with," said Theron.</p>
      <p>The part earned her a second Oscar nod. A decade later, the #MeToo movement swept through Hollywood.</p>
