      <p>GOLETA, Calif. - Staff Sgt. Edmund "Eddie" Sternot of the 101st Airborne Division rushed his machine gunners to move in front of a surprise German breakthrough in January 1945, according to the US Army.</p>
      <p>Sternot's isolated men held their icy ground in the Belgian forest during the Battle of the Bulge, despite the fierce German attack that included tank rounds.</p>
      <p>Military documents show 60 German gunners lay dead in front of Sternot's machine gun station.</p>
      <p>Sternot received a Silver Star for his heroism, but the award never got pinned to his chest and no family member every received the five-pointed medal.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, with pomp and circumstance, one of Sternot's last living relatives will receive the Silver Star at a Veterans Day Ceremony in Santa Barbara at the Pierre Claeyssens Veterans Foundation.</p>
      <p>"Sternot's men beat back the Germans and he led his unit with calm and valor under fire," said Major Vonnie Wright of the 101st Airborne Division.</p>
      <p>Wright said Sternot died just days after his gallantry, during yet another German counterattack, when he was hit by a tank round.</p>
      <p>The medal will be given to 80-year-old DeloresSternot, the hero's first cousin, of Goleta, California.</p>
      <p>"I'm stunned," Delores said. "He is truly an American hero, along with so many other World War heroes killed. We are so proud of him. But why did it take so long?"</p>
      <p>Somehow after Sternot was killed and buried at the Henri-Chapelle American Cemetery in Hombourg, Belgium, the Silver Star never got officially awarded.</p>
      <p>Family members received his Purple Heart but no Silver Star.</p>
      <p>The plan to hand the Silver Star over to Delores Sternot might never have been if not for an encounter in a chapel in Foy, Belgium, in 2001.</p>
      <p>Retired Army Lt. Col. Bill Linn says he was attending mass after visiting the Bastogne battlefield when a woman handed over something her woodcutter father had come upon in the nearby forest.</p>
      <p>"She told me her father found a small prayer book," Linn said. "Inside was the name and home address of Edmund J. Sternot."</p>
      <p>Linn eventually found and contacted members of the Sternot family in Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>The collector said family members recalled all the Sternot boys received first communion prayer books, including Eddie seen holding one in a picture.</p>
      <p>Linn's search for Sternot's relatives eventually led to Delores, Eddie Sternot's self-described "little" cousin.</p>
      <p>She vividly remembers a visit when she was five years old living on the family farm in Vesper, Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>"Eddie came in from furlough through the front door and I was excited," Delores said. "He picked me up and threw me in the air and caught me."</p>
      <p>But those memory-making times with Eddie ended in the dying embers of World War II.</p>
      <p>The Army reports as the Battle of the Bulge wound down, Sgt. Sternot was killed when an advancing German tank round hit him.</p>
      <p>Sternot had stepped into the open and pulled the pin, ready to throw a hand grenade.</p>
      <p>"So we heard there were two explosions hitting Eddie, a double whammy," said Delores. "So at least he didn't suffer, he was killed instantly."</p>
      <p>The death in battle earned Sternot the Purple Heart.</p>
      <p>Delores wanted the Purple Heart kept in a safe place, so she gave it to Linn and his wife Courtney to keep at their Heritage Arsenal Collection in Colorado.</p>
      <p>Delores says she'll hand over the Silver Star to the Linns sometime after Sunday's ceremony, one she'll attend with four friends.</p>
      <p>Officials connected to the ceremony say Sternot's cousin will also be officially given a Bronze Star in his name because he fought at Normandy, Holland and Bastogn</p>
      <p>She said another honor should go to a Belgian man-- Michel Lorquet --and family for "adopting Eddie" and to this day, putting flowers on Plot H Row 13 Grave 48 in Hombourg.</p>
      <p>But conflicting emotion still stirs up in Delores, when she thinks about that gravesite.</p>
      <p>"He was robbed of the life filled with a lot potential and all of us relatives got robbed of spending time with him," Delores said.</p>
      <p>"But I'm happy he finally got that Silver Star."</p>
