        <b>Sean Abbott, who bagged two wickets on his international return, admitted that he had lost faith in making a comeback but also expressed his joy of being back in the mix. Abbott, who made his first appearance for Australia in over five years, was adjudged Man of the Match in the third T20I.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a memorable day for young <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/sean_abbott">Sean Abbott</a> who had a fairytale comeback in Perth. The young pacer, who returned to international cricket after five long years, picked up two wickets in the final T20I of the series which the Kangaroos went on to win very comfortably.</p>
      <p>He bowled economically, with a miserly economy of 3.5, and bagged two crucial wickets, that of Imam-ul-Haq and Imad Wasim, which earned him the Man of the Match award. Talking about his return, the speedster admitted that he had lost hope of playing for Australia ever again.</p>
      <p>"It's a bit of a cliche but I've dreamt about it for a long time," he said. "I lost belief there for a while but it’s good to run out with my mates tonight and get the series win against the world's best T20 team,” Abbott told cricket.com.au.</p>
      <p>Abbott also shared how his mother inspired him to try harder and realize his dream of playing for the nation. The youngster has been toughened by the off-field concerns he had, being away from international cricket for this long.</p>
      <p>"My mum said to me once – I was having a bit of a lean patch, and she said, 'the next ball is the first ball of the rest of your career'," Abbott explained. "I've been trying not to roll out too many cliches and one-liners, but that one has helped me."</p>
      <p>Aussie head coach Justin Langer was also quite impressed with the New South Wales lad as he shared that he perfectly moulds into the style of cricket the team plays.</p>
      <p>"We talk about playing a high-energy, high-octane style of play in white-ball cricket, fast between the wickets, agile in the field, good throwing, and he provides all that.</p>
      <p>"He’s a great athlete, he's got very, very good numbers and he's also a very, very nice young bloke. It's a pretty good combination and he fits nicely into our squad because of that,” Langer said of Abbott.</p>
