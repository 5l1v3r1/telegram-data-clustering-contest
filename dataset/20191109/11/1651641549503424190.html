        <b>This week’s free offerings on the Epic Games Store consist of brutal action shooter RUINER and post-apocalyptic roguelike Nuclear Throne.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All you need to claim the two games is an Epic Games account and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/epic-store-october-update-overhauls-storefront-and-adds-basic-features/">the Epic Games launcher</a>, both of which are also free. You also don’t need to give Epic any of your payment information, in case you’re worried about that.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>Nuclear Throne is a post-apocalyptic roguelike-like top-down shooter. Not ‘the final hope of humanity’ post-apocalyptic, but ‘humanity is extinct and mutants and monsters now roam the world’ post-apocalyptic. Fight your way through the wastelands with powerful weaponry, collecting radiation to mutate some new limbs and abilities. All these things and more you could do if only you were good at this game. Can you reach the Nuclear Throne?</i>
