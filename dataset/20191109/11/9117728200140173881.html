      <p>According to <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/09/grosjean-hard-to-maintain-motivation-at-end-of-tough-year/">RaceFans.net</a>, Grosjean said: <i>“We are all racers, we are all competitors, we all want to do the best. And you can feel in the team that it’s just hard.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s never good when you count down the races to the end of the year. There’s a certain amount you can do but we’re human beings, we’ve got feelings, We want to be competitive.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You hear Mercedes on Friday in Mexico saying it’s going to be a difficult weekend, it’s going to be terrible and so on. At the end they win and they’ve won by Friday. We’ve had three days difficult for a long time.”</i>
