      <h2>Phil Green said he hadn't drunk very much but yet could not stand up and kept falling over on the way home from his night in Beverley, east Yorkshire</h2>

      <p>A terrified dad was left unable to walk without falling over after he believes he had his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/alcohol">drink</a> spiked.</p>
      <p>Phil Green, 53, was out for a couple of drinks with a friend in Beverley, east Yorkshire, on Friday November 1.</p>
      <p>The pair went to four pubs between 7.30pm and 11pm and Mr Green says he had not drunk very much.</p>
      <p>But as Mr Green, of Woodmansey in Hull, was on his way home, he started to "feel funny" and says he completely lost the use of his legs.</p>
      <p>The dad says that every time he tried to walk he fell over - and by the time his partner picked him up he was covered in mud.</p>
      <p>Mr Green believes that someone slipped drugs into his drink, <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/mans-terrifying-trip-drink-spiked-3516127">Hull Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Green said: "I'd just gone out with a friend for a catch-up and had done the rounds in Beverley and then called it quits at about 11pm."</p>
      <p>He added: "I got as far as Toll Gavel and my legs started to give way. It wasn't drink that caused it. I started to feel really queasy and started to panic.</p>
      <p>"I tried to walk faster and every time I started to walk fast, or stand still, I fell.</p>
      <p>"I could kind of run as long though, as if I ran really fast I could keep balanced but as soon as I stopped, I fell over again.</p>
      <p>"I fell at some point and sprained my ankle. I kept going and got to Beckside and there were some lads in a small, black car who just asked, 'Are you alright mate?'. Everytime I tried to get up I fell."</p>

      <p>Mr Green said that he was eventually picked up by his partner Rachel Barnes, 46, where he was found "covered in mud."</p>
      <p>He said: "I couldn't stand up. I could grip with my hands but not my legs and feet. I remember trying to pull myself up on some railings and falling back down again."</p>
      <p>He said that there is part of his journey home that is completely blank and he cannot remember part of his route.</p>
      <p>He said: "When my partner picked me up on King Street I was nearly home. I was covered head to toe in mud. I remember trying to pull myself up and falling. All I could think was, 'get home'.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know what was happening but I was just determined to get home and that kept me going."</p>
      <p>Mr Green said when he arrived at A&amp;E he was told there would be a three and a half hour waiting list.</p>
      <p>The next morning he had his ankle checked out.</p>
      <p>But he says when he spoke to police "it couldn't be classed as a crime as I hadn't had a blood test so they had nothing to go on."</p>
      <p>Mr Green says he is not sure where he could have been spiked, and has checked <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cctv">CCTV</a> at one of the pubs he went to, which does not show anyone putting anything in his drink.</p>
      <p>He said: "I don't know what happened. I checked the CCTV there and it didn't show anything obvious to say I had been spiked there and I've not seen any CCTV anywhere else yet. I don't think I left my drink anywhere but it can take a second."</p>
      <p>Mr Green said he thinks there should be more awareness and a bigger campaign against spiking.</p>
      <p>He said: "I know a few people who it has happened to, one of them being male which I think a lot of people don't think is very common.</p>
      <p>"It is really bad that there is no protocol because it could be fatal. People have been assaulted and sexually assaulted when they've been spiked too and that's when the police can do something.</p>
      <p>"The only people I know that have had it followed through are those that have been assaulted.</p>
      <p>"It you make it home, it is like 'You're OK then' but there should be some huge campaign because a lot of people don't know where to go or what to do if they've been spiked, there should be more advice on it.</p>
      <p>"It can be so dangerous, it shouldn't be waiting for something else to happen before it is taken seriously."</p>
      <p>In July this year, Humberside Police issued some advice after seeing an increase in drink spiking reports in East Riding pubs.</p>
      <p>They said at the time there had been complaints received from Beverley, Driffield, Market Weighton and Kirkella.</p>
      <p>Here is some information from a community alert sent out.</p>
      <p>Some clubs give out drink stoppers for the top of your bottle to prevent someone dropping something in your drink.</p>
      <p>There are also testing kits with strips that detect certain drugs but these do not test for all types of drugs and often do not work.</p>
      <p>Don't forget that these won't detect extra alcohol in your drink.</p>
      <p>Drink spiking can happen in any situation. However, there are a few things you can do to protect yourself.</p>
      <p>Get into the habit of never leaving your drink unattended and don't accept a drink from someone you don't know. Keep an eye on your drink at all times - don't go off and dance then come back and drink the rest.</p>
      <p>Avoid drinking too much alcohol by sticking to the UK Chief Medical Officers' (CMO) low risk drinking guidelines of 14 units a week for both men and women. This will put you in the best position to be alert to anything suspicious and able to look out for your friends.</p>
