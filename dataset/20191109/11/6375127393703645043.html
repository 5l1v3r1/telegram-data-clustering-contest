      <h3>The Skateboarding and Roller Sports Association of the Philippines sent a shocker when it announced that it is eyeing a golden sweep in the 30th Southeast Asian Games.</h3>
      <p>But its president in Monty Mendigoria has an interesting explanation.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we’re looking at sweeping all of our eight events in the SEA Games,” said Mendigoria, who is looking forward to emerge as most bemadalled federation in the prestigious biennial meet that the country will host from 30 November to 11 December.</p>
      <p>“I am confident of my projection because when we decided on what events to play, I was told by (Philippine Olympic Committee president) Cong. Bambol (Tolentino) to put in those where we can surely win the gold medal.”</p>
      <p>“And I can say that we are unbeatable in all of the events that we have included.”</p>
      <p>Considered as powerhouse in the region, the Filipino skateboarders have what it takes to emerge victorious in the men and women’s categories of street, game of skate and downhill events.</p>
      <p>Margielyn Didal, the reigning champion in the women’s street event of the Asian Games, will banner the country together with Christiana Means, Jericho “Kiko” Francisco and other talented Filipino-foreign athletes from Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>Although Mendigoria refused to reveal the names of the rest of the team to avoid being scouted by countries like Thailand and Malaysia, he assured that they will definitely make the country proud.</p>
      <p>“We are very optimistic,” he said, adding that his players are al world-class, thanks to the all-out support given by the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC).</p>
      <p>“The PSC and chairman William Ramirez are behind us 150 percent. Although there are some delays, they still make sure to provide everything we need as far as our training and preparations for the Southeast Asian Games are concerned.”</p>
