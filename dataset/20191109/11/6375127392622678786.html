      <h3>THE Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) and other government agencies agreed with Church officials to forge a stronger partnership and cooperation in addressing the drug problem.</h3>
      <p>In a meeting with Manila Archbishop Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, DDB chairman Secretary Catalino Cuy discussed how the problem could be resolved.</p>
      <p>Also on hand were DILG Asst.Secretary Ricojudge Janvier Echiverri, Fr. Dan Vicente Cancino Jr., of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) and Fr. Roberto dela Cruz of Caritas Manila-Sanlakbay.</p>
      <p>The two sides agreed to forge stronger partnerships in the implementation of community-based treatment and rehabilitation programs and in encouraging Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to work with the government in information drives in both rural and urban settings.</p>
      <p>A drug summit to be conducted early next year was proposed to train point persons from different dioceses on community-based treatment, rehabilitation and interventions.</p>
      <p>As the DDB continues to rally the support and participation of different sectors in the implementation of the Philippine Anti-Illegal Drugs Strategy (PADS), the church is seen as an important ally in institutionalizing systems and programs in the communities.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Tagle emphasized that the domestic drug problem is a human concern, and that the partnership should be able to transcend administrations and paradigm shifts.Â </p>
