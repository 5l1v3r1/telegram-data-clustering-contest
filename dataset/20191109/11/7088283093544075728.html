        <b>Valentine Monnier, a French former model and actress has accused film director Roman Polanski of violently raping her in a Swiss ski resort when she was a teenager in 1975. </b>
      </p>
      <p>It is the latest accusation against 86-year-old film director Roman Polanski, who fled to France in 1978 from the US after having admitted to raping a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Valentine Monnier told <a href="http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/une-francaise-accuse-le-realisateur-roman-polanski-de-viol-08-11-2019-8189568.php"><i>Le Parisien</i></a> newspaper that the alleged rape occurred in 1975 when she was 18 at Polanski's chalet in Gstaad.</p>
      <p>"I had no links with him, neither personal nor professional, and hardly knew him," Monnier, a former model who worked in New York, said.</p>
      <p>She said the alleged rape was "extremely violent", adding: "He pummelled me until I gave in and then raped me, making me do all sorts of things."</p>
      <p>
        <b>LA police and France's first lady were contacted </b>
      </p>
      <p>That very night, Monnier confided to two people: her best friend, and a man who became Monnier's boyfriend for four years.</p>
      <p>Both were contacted by <i>Le Parisien</i> and confirmed Monnier's version.</p>
      <p>Monnier said she was moved to speak out now due to the release of Polanski’s latest film,<i> An Officer and a Spy</i> (<i>J’Accuse</i>), which hits theaters in France next week. The movie world premiered at the <a href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/2019">Venice Film Festival</a> where it won the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize and earned mostly positive reviews.</p>
      <p>Following the Harvey Weinstein scandal Monnier said she had written letters about the alleged rape to Los Angeles police and to French first lady Brigitte Macron.</p>
      <p>Polanski's lawyer Hervé Temime said the director "firmly denies all accusations of rape," adding that the allegations "which date back 45 years have never been reported to judicial authorities".</p>
      <p>Polanski <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/culture/20171030-polanski-face-protests-paris-after-metoo-demos-across-france">has also been accused of sexual assault by several other women</a>.</p>
      <p>French actress Adèle Haenel, while accusing director Christophe Ruggia of molesting her as a child, has said the Polanski was "emblematic" of the abuse that actresses face in the entertainment industry.</p>
