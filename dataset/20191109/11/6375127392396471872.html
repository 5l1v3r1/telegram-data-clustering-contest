      <h3>Cagayan under state of calamity as Typhoon Quiel exits leaving 4 dead, 2 missing; tidal wave destroys houses, boats</h3>
      <p>FOUR persons were killed while two others were missing as typhoon Quiel battered several areas in Region II including Cagayan province that was placed under a state of calamity due to flooding.</p>
      <p>The fatalities were identified as Eljhay Dallego, 10, who drowned in Barangay  Mapula-pula, Claveria, Cagayan;  Augusto  Jaman Atiagan, 36, who was hit by wall when their house collapsed due to landslide in Barangay Magdalena, Claveria, Cagayan; Jeremiah Saring, 14, who was electrocuted in Aparri, Cagayan and Ariel Agustin  Versola who drowned in  Imurong, Baggao, Cagayan.</p>
      <p>Identities of the persons missing after a landslide in Baguio City were not yet available as of press time.</p>
      <p>Update issued by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) showed that typhoon Quiel  maintains its strength  as it began to exit the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) at 2 a.m. today heading generally westward towards Vietnam.</p>
      <p>As of yesterday the NDRRMC recorded a total of 4,987 families or 21,060 persons affected by typhoon in  98 barangays  in Regions 1 and 2.</p>
      <p>Of the number of affected families, 770 or 2893 persons are currently in 29 designated evacuation centers, while 95 families or 427 persons are outside evacuation centers.</p>
      <p>CAGAYAN UNDER STATE OF CALAMITY</p>
      <p>Continuous heavy rains spawned by Typhoon Quiel and the tail end of a cold front the past few days flooded rice fields, residential and commercial areas in 11 towns of Cagayan prompting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan to declare Cagayan province under a state of calamity on Friday.</p>
      <p>Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba identified the flooded areas as the towns of Sta. Praxedes, Claveria, Sanchez Mira, Pamplona, Abulug, Ballesteros, Allacapan, Aparri, Gonzaga, Sta. Ana and Baggao.</p>
      <p>The towns of Allacapan and Claveria in the northern Luzon province of Cagayan were earlier placed under a state of calamity on Thursday due to flooding caused by constant rain.</p>
      <p>The Cagayan governor said they are still assessing the  damage to agriculture and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>TIDAL WAVE DESTROYS BOATS, HOUSES  </p>
      <p>A total of 58 boats and 26 houses were destroyed when a 5-meter tidal wave swamped the seashore of Paluan, Occidental, Mindoro.</p>
      <p>This was confirmed yesterday by Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office ( MDRRMO) officer Albert Dimaano.</p>
      <p>He said the tidal wave was triggered by Typhoon Quiel which battered several areas in Northern Luzon and  also hit seawaters surrounding  Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan or the MIMAROPA areas.</p>
      <p>“Malaking alon brought by Typhoon Quiel, siguro nasa 5- meters, yung seawall namin, four meters so lumampas siya, pumasok sa kabahayan,” Dimaano said.</p>
      <p>He said the tidal wave affected 10 to 12 villages in the area including  Barangays Harrison Uno, Dos, Cuatro, Cinco, Sais, Lumang Bayan, Marikit, Tubili and Alibayoy both located in the coastal areas of Puluan.</p>
      <p>Because of the incident, Dimaano said 600 persons were evacuated and temporarily staying in barangay halls and other school buildings.</p>
      <p>Puluan Mayor Carl Pangilinan said 11,962 persons were affected by the tidal wave.</p>
      <p>Most of the families in Puluan live by fishing which the tidal wave disrupted.</p>
      <p>INTENSIFIED RELIEF AND RESCUE OPERATIONS</p>
      <p>To help those affected by Typhoon Quiel, the Police Regional Office (PRO) 2 ordered the conduct of intensified relief and rescue operations in flooded areas in Cagayan.</p>
      <p>Police Brig.Gen. Angelito Casimiro ordered the Cagayan Police Provincial Office and Regional Mobile Force Battalion 2 to augment personnel and search and rescue equipment in flood affected areas of Cagayan.  </p>
      <p>Data from Regional Operations Management Division showed that a total 1,830 families or 4,535 individuals were moved to evacuation centers in different municipalities of Cagayan.</p>
      <p>Casimiro also instructed Cagayan PPO Officer-in-Charge Police Colonel Ariel N. Quilang to closely supervise all relief and rescue work until normal situation is restored.</p>
      <p>“We are maximizing the manpower of our police force assigned in Cagayan PPO to help in the relief and rescue program of the government for the people of Cagayan,” Casimiro said.</p>
      <p>He also directed all chiefs of police in the flood affected areas to closely coordinate with their respective Local Government Unit for the continuous relief and rescue operations.         </p>
