      <p>A young woman was brutally beaten and tortured for six hours by a man she met on a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dating">dating website</a></p>
      <p>Emily Harvey, 19, travelled 50 miles to meet the man she had been chatting with on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dating">dating app Badoo</a> .</p>
      <p>The pair laughed and joked in his flat in Loughborough before he subjected her to hours of torture.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old man on Emily, beat her with a baseball bat until it broke, hit her with a frying pan and a hoover pipe and strangled her.</p>

      <p>As Emily's attacker tightened his grip around her neck with both hands, she could feel herself about to lose consciousness,  <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/this-it-hes-going-kill-3506743">LeicestershireLive reports.</a></p>
      <p>"At that moment, I thought, ‘This is it. He’s going to kill me.’ Then it all went black," the teenager said.</p>
      <p>Emily regained consciousness on the bedroom floor of the flat of her attacker and knew she needed to get out of the flat or she might be killed.</p>
      <p>The brave teenager is now recalling the horrifying night and sharing her story.</p>
      <p>She said: "He had beaten me with a baseball bat, and when he broke that on me, he got a frying pan and hit me on the back of the head with it, then picked up a Hoover pipe and  <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">started to rain blows on me with that.</a></p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"Now, bizarrely, he was accusing me of stabbing him. He screamed at me for attacking him and told me to get out.</p>
      <p>"I managed to get to my feet and I ran as fast as I could out of the door.</p>
      <p>"As I tried to get out of the building I bumped into one of his neighbours. She took me in and called the police."</p>
      <p>That was the end of an ordeal that had lasted six hours.</p>
      <p>In that time, Emily’s date, a boy she had just met for the first time face-to-face after chatting online for a month, thought he had killed her.</p>
      <p>At one point during the prolonged and sadistic attack, the Loughborough teenager took photographs of Emily, terrified and cowering on his settee, and shared them with a friend and his half-brother.</p>

      <p>Despite her horrific ordeal, Emily found the courage to give a full statement to the police, and detectives praised her brave testimony which helped them build a successful case against the youth.</p>
      <p>The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on their date on August 24.</p>
      <p>He was given  <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">a nine-year extended sentence,</a>  with five years of detention and four years on licence, at Leicester Crown Court last month.</p>
      <h3>'He attacked me for no reason'</h3>
      <p>"I don’t think that is justice after what he did to me.</p>
      <p>"They should lock him away and never let him out.</p>
      <p>"One minute he was okay with me, then he just flipped.</p>
      <p>"He attacked me for no reason. I really thought he was going to kill me there in his flat."</p>
      <p>Emily said she had first made contact with the boy on a dating website.</p>
      <p>"We got chatting and he seemed really nice," she said. "He was funny and said he liked me.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"We chatted for about a month. We sent messages on Snapchat too.</p>
      <p>"He asked me to go over to meet him and said he would pay for the taxi.</p>
      <p>"I felt like I sort of knew him, so I agreed to go.</p>
      <p>"At first he was lovely. It was fun. Then he just changed.</p>
      <p>"He damaged my phone so I couldn't contact anyone. Then he attacked me."</p>
      <p>Today, Emily is slowly trying to find some normality in her life in the wake of the attack.</p>
      <p>"The biggest problem I've got physically is the ligament in my right hand," she said.</p>
      <p>"It got badly damaged as I tried to fend off the blows as he hit me, and kept on hitting me, with the baseball bat until it broke on me.</p>
      <p>"I can’t do much for another couple of months.</p>
      <p>"I hope  <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/health/">that it will heal</a>  and then I can start to look for a job."</p>
      <p>Emily has been offered counselling, but said she felt she did not need it.</p>
      <p>"I want to just get on with things," she said.</p>
      <p>"I haven’t had any nightmares about this, which is good.</p>
      <p>"I've been out a couple of times with friends and that helps."</p>
      <p>But she added: "I don’t feel like I can trust anyone I don’t know properly now."</p>
      <p>Emily said she should have told her parents where she was going, "but I just didn’t".</p>
      <p>She added: "I’m not sure how I might feel about meeting another man and going on a date – that’s so far off in the future I can’t even think about it."</p>
