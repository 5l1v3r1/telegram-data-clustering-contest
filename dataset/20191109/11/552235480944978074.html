      <h1>Alfredo Morelos has Marco Negri's Rangers scoring streak under threat - here's how he can match the 'moody blue'</h1>
      <h2>The Colombian has been in sensational goalscoring form at Ibrox and isn't far from matching an incredible run from the past.</h2>

      <p>Rangers fans of a certain age will have fond memories of the sensational scoring run of 'moody blue' <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/marco-negri">Marco Negri</a> in 1997 .</p>
      <p>His sullen, muted celebrations were a far cry from the joyous explosions that emanated from previous scorer par excellence Ally McCoist but while the two differed in personality, their ruthlessness in front of goal was similar.</p>
      <p>It's been a while since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> have had a player of a similar ilk, with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kris-boyd">Kris Boyd</a> and Nikica Jelavic probably the last truly deadly goalscorers - added to Kenny Miller's extraordinary 2009-10 campaign.</p>
      <p>Recent years saw the likes of Joe Garner and Martyn Waghorn failing to pick up the mantle but now there's no doubt <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> is the club's striking talisman.</p>

      <p>Negri blasted his name into folklore by grabbing an astonishing 33 goals before Christmas in the year he signed but Morelos, with 21 by early November, has that sensational tally in his sights.</p>
      <p>Rangers have eight league games before the turn of the year, two Europa League ties and the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> Final.</p>
      <p>That's 11 games in total for the Colombian to grab the 12 goals he requires to register the same impact as the £3.5m Italian.</p>
      <p>In terms of goals per game, Negri's tally looks unlikely to be matched any time soon given he notched at a rate of 1.3 times in a match and managed his incredible number over only 26 games.</p>

      <p>Morelos is scoring at a rate 0.84 times per game which means that he will need to continue his upward trajectory of form. </p>
      <p>Continuing to score at the current rate would leave El Bufalo on 30 goals by the turn of the year, matching his tally for the whole of last season.</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether or not he hits that 33 mark, Morelos will hope he can maintain his form unlike the mercurial Italian.</p>
      <p>After a New Year squash injury that seriously damaged his eye, the explosive striker was a muted figure scoring only three more goals before his career tailed off completely.</p>
      <p>Few would imagine the same fate lies in store for the effervescent 23-year-old.</p>
