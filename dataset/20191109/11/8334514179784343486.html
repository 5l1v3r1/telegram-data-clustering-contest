      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - French insurer AXA (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AXAF.PA">AXAF.PA</a>) said it expected to book net proceeds of $3.1 billion from the sale of a 29% stake in AXA Equitable Holdings (EQH) (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/EQH.N">EQH.N</a>) as it exits its U.S. life insurance business.</p>
      <p>AXA, the second-largest European insurer after Germany’s Allianz (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ALVG.DE">ALVG.DE</a>), has been gradually divesting from EQH to raise funds to pay for its $15 billion acquisition of Bermuda-based rival XL last year.</p>
      <p>AXA said in a statement on Friday it had sold 144 million EQH shares at $21.80 per share to Goldman Sachs (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GS.N">GS.N</a>), the sole underwriter in a secondary public share offering expected to close on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>EQH has agreed to repurchase 24 million shares at the same price.</p>
      <p>AXA said that proceeds from the deal would boost the group’s Solvency II capital requirements ratio by six points and that no significant net income impact was expected.</p>
      <p>After the deal, the French group will retain only a 9.6% stake it needs to redeem an AXA bond maturing in May 2021 that has to be exchangeable in EQH shares.</p>
