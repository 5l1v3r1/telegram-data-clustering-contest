      <h1>The Writing Was On The Wall? Yesterday’s Cash Inflow To BitMEX Could Predict The Bitcoin Drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:45:50+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin’s price finally made a move yesterday, losing around $800 of its value at one point. This came after a few days of consolidation and sideways trading, but could have it been expected? Interestingly enough, BitMEX, the most popular Bitcoin margin trading exchange, recorded an inflow of $28 million worth of BTC in the last 24 hours.</p>
      <h3>BitMEX BTC Inflow</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-exchange-beginners-guide-how-to-trade-video-tutorial/">BitMEX</a>, one of the most popular <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-and-crypto-margin-trading-exchanges-and-guide-for-beginners/">Bitcoin margin trading</a> exchanges, has recorded a serious inflow of $28 million in the last 24 hours, according to the popular monitor resource <a href="https://www.tokenanalyst.io/">TokenAnalyst</a>.</p>

      <p>In general, over the past seven days, BitMEX saw an inflow of around $92 million with $89 million worth of outflows, meaning that the exchange is on the positive.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, the surge in inflows coincides with the serious movement in Bitcoin’s price. However, this is not the first time that we see a correlation of the kind.</p>
      <p>For example, a month ago, Bitcoin’s price dropped from $8,800 to $8,300 in just a matter of hours, and the popular crypto exchange <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-huge-16m-inflow-in-bitmex-possible-cause-of-bitcoins-price-crash/">noted</a> another serious cash inflow of $26 million.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price Reaction</h3>
      <p>Just a few weeks ago, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-chart-analysis/">Bitcoin’s price</a> went through a surge that we hadn’t seen since 2011 – it <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-price-touches-10350-recording-its-highest-daily-increase-since-2011/">increased</a> with more than 40% in a day, touching $10,350. The retracement afterward took the price down to around $9,300, where it traded sideways for some time. It was this consolidation period that had a lot of people thinking that another move was on the way – and that’s exactly what happened.</p>

      <p>Yesterday’s high was around $9,270, and with a few violent hourly candles, it dropped to the lowest point of the day – $8,660, resulting in a 6.5% decrease. At the time of this writing, Bitcoin’s price has risen slightly to $8,800 level. Looking on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-where-is-bitcoin-heading-now-following-the-recent-price-breakdown/">technical side</a>, if the price is set to recover it needs to break the first resistance level at $8,883, and if it continues upwards, the next one is at around $9,100.</p>
      <p>However, if the bearish trend is not over, the support level can be found at the 50-days moving average – $8,600 and another one at $8,400.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s total market capitalization has dropped slightly under $160 billion, and its dominance sits at 66.4%.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to tell if Bitcoin’s price decreases and BitMEX’s inflows have serious correlations, but it’s undoubtedly noteworthy.</p>
