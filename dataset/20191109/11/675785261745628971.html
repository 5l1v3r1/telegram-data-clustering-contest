      <h2>Ernesto Valverde has endured a difficult week at Barcelona which has ended with him fighting for his job. Barca lost to Levante in La Liga before struggling to a home draw vs Slavia Prague in the Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:16:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde has confirmed he went out for dinner with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> chief Josep Maria Bartomeu amid mounting pressure on the Barca manager.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants have endured a horror week, in which they lost 3-1 to Levante in La Liga, which saw Real Sociedad overtake them at the top of the table, before they were held by at the Nou Camp by Slavia Prague in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>During that goalless draw on Tuesday night, Barca fans made their feelings known with jeers and boos which have led to calls for Valverde to depart the dugout.</p>
      <p>But Valverde has insisted that his dinner date with Bartomeu gave him confidence that the club are behind him but admits that he needs to mastermind a victory against Celta Vigo on Saturday.</p>

      <p>"I'm not worried about my future," Valverde said. "The other day I had dinner [with Bartomeu]. I feel supported and respected.</p>
      <p>"Whether you understand [the criticism] or not, it's how it is. I don't have much to say. If we'd scored a goal [against Slavia], everyone would be more calm. It's how it is. You have to accept things as they come.</p>

      <p>"A week ago, we were on the highway, we had seven wins in a row. Now, we'll see."</p>
      <p>"We need a win. We lost a game in six minutes [at Levante]. We need to get back on the path of taking three points because we need them and because we know what it means for this team to lose.</p>
      <p>"We're motivated and we know how difficult a game it will be.</p>
      <p>"We prepared for Slavia in two training sessions because we didn't have any more. It's normally like that for the whole season. There are two game days, four to prepare for the games – that seems normal to me."</p>
