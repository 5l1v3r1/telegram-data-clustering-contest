      <h3>A MILITANT solon has proposed a measure granting public school teachers sick leave benefits.</h3>
      <p>ACT Teachers Rep.  France Castro filed House Bill 5349, proposing sick leave of at least 30 days per year for public school teachers.</p>
      <p>“Public school teachers deserve sick leave benefits, especially in light of the heavy workload which they are made to bear, including various tasks not related to teaching,” Castro said.</p>
      <p>Under the current rules and regulations, public school teachers are not provided sick leave benefits.</p>
      <p>“Public school teachers have long been complaining of not being afforded sick leave benefits within the school year because they are allegedly already covered by the leave benefits granted to those on ‘teachers leave basis’ or the service credits and the Proportional Vacation Pay,” Castro said. </p>
      <p>“However, service credits are compensation for work done by the teacher beyond regular functions or regular work or days such as the Brigada Eskwela, election and census service,” she added.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker underscored the need to amend the law to provide public school teachers protection against health complications, considering that most of the health problems are the effects of the daily strain of teachers’ tasks in schools and overwork.</p>
      <p>“With the current laws, rules and regulations, it is as if public school teachers can choose to only get sick during the summer breaks and are expected to simply ‘bear it’ during the school year. Moreover, teachers suffer deductions in their salaries if they choose to absent themselves from class,” Castro said.</p>
      <p>“Service credits and the Proportional Vacation Pay have different nature and purpose compared to sick leave. House Bill 5349 provides public school teachers sick leave benefits of 30 days per year,” she added.</p>
      <p>Among the co-sponsors of the bill are Rep. Carlos Zarate, Rep. Ferdie Gaite and Rep. Eufemia Cullamat of Bayan Muna Party-list, Rep. Arlene Brosas of  Gabriela Women’s Party and Rep. Sarah Elago of the Kabataan Parry-list, all from the Makabayan bloc.</p>
      <p>The solons asked the House leadership to urgently hear and pass the measure.</p>
