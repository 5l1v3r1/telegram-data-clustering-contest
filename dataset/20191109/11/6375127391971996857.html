      <h3>A Grade 4 student caught the attention of Caloocan City Mayor Oscar “Oca” Malapitan after the boy was named “Batang Henyo ng Caloocan” due to his knowledge of existing laws.</h3>
      <p>“Nakakatuwa sapagkat sa murang edad ay nagpapamalas na siya ng kagalingan at interes pagdating sa batas,” Mayor Oca said when Dwight Albajeso was chosen the genius kid of Caloocan.</p>
      <p>Albajeso, together with his father Principe, went to the city hall on Friday to paid a courtesy call on the city chief executive.</p>
      <p>Principe told the Mayor that his son wanted to become a lawyer someday to help the oppressed and victims of violence.</p>
      <p>“Nawa’y isa lamang si Dwight sa mga bata sa ating lungsod na magiging matagumpay sa hinaharap. Asahan ninyo na tayo’y patuloy na magtatrabaho para bigyan ng magandang kinabukasan ang mga bata sa Caloocan,” Mayor Oca said.</p>
