      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:05:39+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/molly-mae-hague">Molly-Mae Hague</a> has predicted her boyfriend Tommy Fury is going to propose by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The Love Island stars have been together since meeting in the villa over the summer and their romance has been going from strength-to-strength since the end of the show.</p>
      <p>Now Molly-Mae, 20, has opened up about their future plans and she's convinced the boxer, also 20, is plotting to pop the question very soon.</p>
      <p>She thinks it'll happen by the end of 2019 on their planned trip to the Maldives over New Year.</p>
      <p>The influencer told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7664003/Love-Islands-Molly-Mae-Hague-predicts-Tommy-Fury-propose-YEAR.html">Mail Online</a> : "The thing is I wouldn't be surprised if he did pop the question when we're in the Maldives over New Year.</p>

      <p>"I don't waste my time, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone thinking "this is only short term".</p>
      <p>"I wasn't thinking 'when's the sell-by date on this one?'</p>
      <p>"We're going to be together forever. I'm looking forward to having a rock on my finger!"</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae and Tommy failed to win the show, coming second to Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea.</p>
      <p>However, the winners split within weeks of leaving the villa and Molly-Mae told Mirror Online she's feeling "smug" about still being with Tommy.</p>

      <p>She explained: "I think I'd be wrong if I said it didn't give me a bit of a smug feeling because it does.</p>
      <p>"It's nice to be able to show everyone they were all wrong because they didn't believe in us and it's so nice to show that we were the realest couple in there and I think that's really shown since we've come out.</p>
      <p>"And Maura and Curtis were a bit rocky and now everyone else has broken up and we're the only couples who've remained.</p>
      <p>"I could have told you that right from the start but no one would listen to me and wanted to say I was fake.</p>
      <p>"I saw Amber [Gill] the other day and it's sad what happened, but she would have told you herself that Tommy and I were the winners.</p>
      <p>"It's a hard one because everyone knows Tommy and I were the winners in a way but everything happens for a reason..</p>
      <p>"We didn't need to win the show to prove what we've got because everyone can see it now and we're so happy, but maybe we wouldn't have been if we'd won, you just never know."</p>
