      <h1>KSW 51: Croatia preview and weigh-ins - Pudzianowski fights fitness model Jun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Rodriguez</a></address>
      <p>Having made their way out to Ireland and the UK earlier this year, KSW once again raises anchor and heads to Zagreb for their first event in Croatia.</p>
      <p>As a “Balkans Vs The World” event, there’s a Croatian in almost every fight. As a new hotbed of surging talent, local fans will have legitimate talents to root for with some evolving fighters aiming to dazzle the home crowd.</p>
      <p>Mariusz Pudzianowski (12-7) continues to be the centerpiece of the musculeweight contingent for KSW, mostly fighting against fellow sculpted Chunguses (Chungii?). Good thing for him is that there’s never a shortage of brolic cohorts for him to fight, meaning we get some fun freakshow fights for events like this. Pudz walks into this one with back ot back losses to Szymon Kołecki and powerhouse Karol Bedorf. He’ll now have a major experience advantage over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erkojun/?hl=en">fitness Model Erko Jun</a> (3-0).</p>
      <p>Jun’s shown he’s more than just a pretty face, and has a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/7/20952368/ksw-51-headliner-erko-jun-mariusz-pudzianowski-clash-mma-interview">head full of confidence </a>heading into this bout.</p>

      <p>All <a href="https://youtu.be/LwHrx8Xrm-U?t=71">three of his bouts </a>have been <a href="https://youtu.be/jr5blKwY79U?t=56">stoppages</a>, and he’s pretty good about making sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5WD1O9RFkw">pounce on his opponent</a> like a lynx.</p>
      <p>Bantamweight is currently without a king, but aggressive wrestler Antun Racic 23-8, (1 draw) hopes to bring his experience, athleticism, and time at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3R4KPinc29/">Firas Zahabi’s Tristar Gym</a> to capture the vacant belt. With a<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/7/20952368/ksw-51-headliner-erko-jun-mariusz-pudzianowski-clash-mma-interview"> firm belief that he’s finally at his peak</a>, he’s looking to apply the same kind of pressure that led him to his current four-fight win streak. The man standing in his way is former UFC fighter Damian Stasiak (11-6), who just snapped a three fight skid with an arm triangle win over Nikolay Kondratuk at a Rocky Warriors Cartel event in April.</p>
      <p>Former KSW welterweight champion Borys Mankowski (19-8, 1 draw) has had a rough go of it as of late, with three consecutive defeats. But look closely and they’re not bad losses at all. Mamed Khalidov, current champ Roberto Soldić and a resurgent Norman Parke is a good run of fighters to lose to. His obstacle to end up in the win column again is Serbian “Psychopath“ Vaso Bakočević (39-18, 1 draw). That’s a busy record, and he hasn’t won a fight by decision since 2017. That’s thirteen wins over two years, and a loss to Bellator’s Andrey Koreshkov in July of 2018.</p>
      <p>Cezary Kęsik <a href="https://twitter.com/ksw_mma/status/1122199008838074369?lang=en">made an impression in his KSW debut</a>, solidifying his position as a hot prospect. His opponent Aleksandar Ilić is <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20948130/ksw-51-interview-aleksandar-ilic-joker-vs-cezary-kesik-european-mma-news">hungry for this fight</a>, with a five-fight win streak that included the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRhtEXbhGxw">absolute obliteration of freak superathlete Damian Janikowski</a>.</p>

      <p>British strongman Oli Thompson (20-11) bounced back from his last loss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phj-29Ux26Y">with a submission win</a> this past September, and he’s got some gumption to show upon this card as a late replacement against RIZIN and PFL vet Ante Delija. Brazilian 24-year-old Daniel Torres (8-4) makes his third KSW appearance, this time against Croatian UFC vet Filip Pejić (14-2, 2 draws). Pejić seems to have found a winning formula again <a href="https://youtu.be/0wF3rmLO8n0?t=517">with a grinding finish</a> over Fabiano Silva and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb72Sd_ZC9U">brutal ground knockout</a> against Filip Wolański.</p>
