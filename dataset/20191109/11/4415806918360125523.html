      <h1>David Clifford has potential 'to be the best ever', claim Kerry legends</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Kerry star David Clifford has the potential "to be the best player", Kingdom legends Mikey Sheehy and Colm Cooper have claimed.</p>
      <p>Mikey Sheehy, who won eight All-Ireland's as a player, praised the young East Kerry attacker saying it was "incredible" that Clifford has two All-Stars from his first two seasons.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Irish Examiner, Sheehy said: "David actually has the potential to be better than Gooch (Colm Cooper) and Maurice (Fitzgerald), and the reason I am saying that is that I’ve been watching him at close quarters.</p>
      <p>"He carries himself like Maurice, the same languid style. He has Gooch’s brain.</p>
      <blockquote>The potential is there to be the best ever but how much of that is down to Maurice and Gooch because they set such ridiculous standards?</blockquote>
      <p>"They are the mark for so many young lads in Kerry from year to year."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, speaking in the same piece, Colm Cooper has said Clifford has the potential to be the greatest Kerry player of all time.</p>
      <p>"Is he going to be the greatest Kerry player of all time? None of us know that," said Cooper.</p>
      <p>"It’s impossible because we have no idea how fit and healthy he’ll be, but he has the potential to be.</p>
      <p>"When you reflect on who’s gone before, that’s the biggest compliment I can pay him."</p>
