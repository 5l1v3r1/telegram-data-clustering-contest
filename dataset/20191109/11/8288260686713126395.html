      <p>We've all seen managers throw the biggest defender they have into the thick of attack in the dying moments of a game - but <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/tyrone-mings">Tyrone Mings</a> ' talent in front of goal may well be enough to earn him the number nine shirt for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> 's side next season from the get go.</p>
      <p>The England defender posted a training video on social media showing him taking part in shooting practice with the club's strikers at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> 's Bodymoor Heath Training Centre and his expert finishing has not gone unnoticed.</p>
      <p>And he has even asked his manager to throw him up front with Brazilian teammate Wesley in what would make one of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> 's most powerful strike partnerships.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mings has only scored twice in a Villa shirt, but you would not have been able to tell him apart from some of Smith's most talented strikers were you at Bodymoor Heath on Friday.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The video was captured as Villa continued their preparations ahead of their trip to face Wolves at Molineux on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Victory for Villa could see them extend their buffer to the bottom three to six points, results dependant, and could even climb as high as 10th - leapfrogging Manchester United.</p>
