      <h1>Chris Sutton makes Rangers and Celtic claim during heated debate as Paul Ince shows his Scottish football disdain</h1>
      <h2>The former Hoops striker was not going to let the Guv'nor's criticism of Scottish football lying down.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:28:18+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Graeme Young, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/graeme-young/</a></address>
      <p>Chris Sutton has told Paul Ince he's never represented a team as big as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> or Rangers, after the former midfielder had a dig at Scottish football.</p>
      <p>The Guv'nor turned out for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and Liverpool during his playing career, as well as Italian giants Inter, but got on the wrong side of Sutton on today's BT Sport's Early Kick-Off.</p>
      <p>A clip was played of the former Celtic striker going wild as his former team secured a dramatic last-gasp win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> , and Robbie Savage couldn't help winding up his fellow pundit for his reaction.</p>
      <p>Sutton insisted: "I'm a big fan of Scottish teams in Europe and if it had been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> I would have been the same.</p>

      <p>"I was excited. I was impartial, it's Scottish teams in Europe - like you back English teams in Europe."</p>
      <p>At that point Ince couldn't resist jumping in.</p>
      <p>"What are you talking about? They only got past the group stage. It wasn't a Cup Final, was it?"</p>
      <p>Sutton shot back: "It's a big deal, we saw the English team, Manchester City, they couldn't deal with Atalanta the night before with the millions they've spent, Celtic showed the way.</p>
      <p>"Away in Italy, where they hadn't won before, I thought the character they showed in the second half - they were better than a strong Lazio team.</p>
      <p>"Neil Lennon, there were a lot of doubts from the fans about his ability going back in as Celtic manager, but himself and Steven Gerrard in Europe this season have been phenomenal."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Ince's pop at Sutton was definitely of the playfaul variety, but the Guv'nor was in less jovial mood when he was told Scotland currently ranks fifth in the coefficient table after Celtic and Rangers' rousing start to the season.</p>
      <p>He claimed: "It's not better than the Championship, maybe even League One."</p>
      <p>Sutton snapped back: "You're embarrassing yourself. You've never played at a club as big as Celtic and Rangers."</p>
      <p>The exchange caused some nervous laughter in the studio as Michael Owen and Savage enjoyed the fireworks between their fellow panelists.</p>
