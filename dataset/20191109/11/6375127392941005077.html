      <h3>AN opposition solon has asked the Department of Health (DOH) to study carefully the proposed Asin Tax Law.</h3>
      <p>According to Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo, this tax bill will hit hard the poor  who are the ones consuming dried fish (daing) and other salted fish.</p>
      <p>“Kung ipapataw ang Asin Tax sa salted fish (tulad ng daing) at instant noodles, ang mahihirap ang matatamaan dito,” Quimbo said.</p>
      <p>Citing the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, Quimbo said 4.9 percent of total food expenditure of every poor family is spent on dried fish, instant noodles and sardines.</p>
      <p>Rich Filipinos are only spending 1.6 percent of their income on salted fish and the like, the lawmaker noted.</p>
      <p>The DOH is pushing for an Asin Tax Law pointing out that too much salt is causing non-communicable diseases (NCDs).</p>
      <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 68 percent of  Filipinos  suffer from NCDs due to unhealthy diet.</p>
      <p>But Quimbo said it is not right to impose higher tax on salted food.</p>
      <p>“Ang tanong: tama bang magpataw ng Asin Tax? Sa totoo lang, kakaunti lang ang bansang mayroong Asin Tax. Mayroong junk food tax sa Hungary at Mexico,” she said.</p>
