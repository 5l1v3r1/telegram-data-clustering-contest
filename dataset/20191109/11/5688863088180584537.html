      <p><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rishabh_pant">Rishabh </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a>, who has always been criticized for his immaturity while batting and poor shot selection, has been in unwanted limelight for his poor work behind the stumps. While in the first T20I he messed up a couple of DRS calls, in the second one, he botched an easy stumping as he collected the ball before the stumps lend Liton Das a life.</p>
      <p>The youngster has always been criticized heavily for his mistakes and has been the hot topic of discussion in Indian cricket and India’s stand-in captain <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> has voiced his disappointment over it and has urged the critics to leave the youngster alone.</p>
      <p>"You know there is a lot of talk happening about Rishabh Pant every day, every minute. I just feel that he needs to be allowed to do what he wants to do on the field. I would request everyone to keep their eyes away from Rishabh Pant for a while," Rohit said in the pre-match press conference, reported TOI.</p>
      <p>"He is a fearless cricketer and we (team management) want him to have that freedom. And if you guys take your eyes off him for sometime, it will allow him to perform even better," he added.</p>
      <p>Rishab’s poor glovework is also one the reasons why he lost his place in the Indian team in the longest format of the game as Wridhiman Saha was chosen over him for his superior technique when it comes to negotiating the spinners behind the wicket. Rohit didn't hesitate to express his feelings about the constant criticism of the young keeper-batsman. The Indian skipper also added that Pant’s good work should also be highlighted the way his failures are done.</p>
      <p>"He is a young guy, 22, trying to make his mark in international cricket. Every move he makes on the field, people start talking about him. It is not fair. I think we should allow him to play his cricket which actually he also wants to do," Rohit said.</p>
      <p>"Focus on him a lot more when he is doing good things also, not just bad things. He has been learning, there have been times he has kept well also. He is trying to do what the team management wants him to do."</p>
      <p>Talking about the young guns Pant and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/shreyas_iyer">Shreyas </a><a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/iyer">Iyer</a>, who are trying to make their own mark in international cricket, Rohit advised them to understand their game and be confident about it acknowledging the fact that both the players have the temperament to make a big impact.</p>
      <p>"Both of them are very talented, have great ability in whatever they do. Definitely the future of Indian cricket and they have proved that at all levels. Rishabh has been around for a year to two. Shreyas has been in and out but now he looks settled in ODIs, trying to make a mark in T20s.</p>
      <p>"All I would tell them is just understand your game which is very important in whatever format you play. Feeling confident about your game is very important. They are working hard towards their game so I don't see any reason why they can't get the results. They have everything to be successful at the international level. In a year or two you will see them batting differently," said Rohit.</p>
