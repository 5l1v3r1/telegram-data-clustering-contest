      <h1>'Amazing' Sinéad Burke praised following 'intelligent' and 'articulate' Late Late interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:03:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/steve-neville/" target="_blank">By Steve Neville</a></address>
      <p>Sinéad Burke has been praised following an appearance on The Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>The academic and influencer appeared on the show to discuss her new podcast, along with being on the cover of Vogue and her work as an activist.</p>
      <p>Speaking about bullying, she highlighted how <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/discover/sinead-burke-has-opened-up-about-being-leap-frogged-over-by-two-teenage-boys-on-oconnell-street-917385.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">a young boy leapfrogged over her</a> as his friend recorded it on the street in Dublin.</p>
      <p>She said she took it as an opportunity to make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else and she wanted to educate people, as "we just don't know what haven't been exposed to."</p>
      <p>She explained that people need to be educated on "what it is we don't know".</p>

      <p>Ms Burke said: "An example I give is that I'm in the aisle of a supermarket. And a child will see me.</p>
      <p>"And the first thing they will do is point me out and say 'look, there's a little woman'.</p>
      <p>"And in that instance the adult will ignore them, dismiss them, try to distract them, remove them from the place in which they are.</p>
      <p>"Only because they're embarrassed.</p>
      <p>"They're embarrassed that this has happened, and they feel that it's a negative impact on their parenting and how could it be so.</p>
      <p>"Instead of actually realising that's a child's natural curiosity.</p>
      <p>"And why don't they say to the child 'yeah, that is a little woman. Say hello'."</p>

      <p>Ms Burke added: "I say this with the premise and with the framework and understanding that it's also not my job to educate the world that I should get to exist.</p>
      <p>"But it's a balance of the two, and it's something I choose to do."</p>
      <p>Ms Burke also spoke about her advocacy work, saying: "The statement I hear most is 'we haven't thought about this before?'</p>
      <blockquote>And that's because we have lived in a world that was designed for many people like you and perhaps people who are living at home, who have never had to think about how they jaunt through the world differently.</blockquote>
      <p>"And whether that's a public bathroom or that's reaching something on a supermarket shelf, or the ATM.</p>
      <p>"The more we re-design our world and make our society safer for lots of people, the more people can just be themselves."</p>
      <p>Ms Burke also discussed <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/showbiz/our-very-own-sinead-burke-becomes-first-little-person-to-walk-met-gala-carpet-922489.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">attending the Met Gala</a> and being "one of the few physically disabled people to ever be invited."</p>
      <p>The Met Gala is an annual fundraiser in New York for the Met organised by US magazine Vogue.</p>
      <p>Ms Burke said she received an invitation after introducing herself to the magazine's editor, Anna Wintour.</p>

      <p>She said: "The whole symbol of the Met Gala is going up the 21 stairs of the Met.</p>
      <p>"When I was invited, which was such a thrill and an honour, I then had to have a conversation about accessibility.</p>
      <p>"And bring together Anna Wintour, Gucci, Vogue, and say how are we thinking about this space, that has almost existed for forever, for different types of people."</p>
      <p>Speaking about her family, she said she had an "incredible" support system.</p>
      <p>"I don't look like most people, and with that comes a real strength. It can be a challenge.</p>
      <p>"But I was told when I was very young, I had no hand, act or part in choosing to live in this body, but how others choose to act towards me, either kindly or negatively, is a decision.</p>
      <p>"And if they choose to go about their lives and try to make me feel small to make themselves feel big or to cause a joke, that says everything about them, and not me."</p>
      <p>Social media users hailed her as being "inspirational and amazing".</p>
