      <h1>Instagram to remove 'likes' on the app for millions of US users next week</h1>
      <h2>The move will "de-pressurise" the app for young people so it is less competitive</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T11:57:19+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Grace Witherden</a></address>
      <p>Instagram fans are in for a shock next week as they will no longer be able to see how many people have liked photos on their newsfeed.</p>
      <p>The social media platform will trial the change for millions of users in the United States and the change could be rolled out to the United Kingdom eventually.</p>
      <p>It means US users will no longer be able to see how many likes the new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> post got, but they will still be able to see how many likes their own posts get.</p>
      <p>Head of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> Adam Mosseri announced the trial on Friday at WIRED25 and said the aim is to "de-pressurise" the platform for young people.</p>
      <p>It comes after trials in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Ireland, Italy and Brazil.</p>

      <p>During an interview Mr Mosseri said: "It's about young people.</p>
      <p>“The idea is to try and de-pressurise Instagram, make it less of a competition, give people more space to focus on connections with people that they love, things that inspire them.</p>
      <p>“We have to see how it affects how people feel about the platform, how it affects how they use the platform.”</p>
      <p>But the move could make life difficult for influencers who rely on millions of likes on their posts to make money.</p>
      <p>When the tests hit Australia, influencer Tammy Hembrow was asked: “What happens when Instagram gets rid of the likes?”</p>
      <p>Hembrow responded: “Then we’ll delete Instagram from my life! F*** Instagram!”</p>
      <p>A number of changes have been made to the Facebook-owned platform this year to make it safer for users.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year the app rolled out an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/instagram-launches-anti-bullying-tool-20387641">anti-bullying tool</a> which lets you hide comments and block bullying accounts.</p>
      <p>Instagram began testing the tool as a way of tackling what it said was a complex issue - where many users do not want to report or block those bullying them for fear of further abuse.</p>
      <p>It also removed the following tab which shows the photos and videos that your friends have liked, followed and commented on.</p>
