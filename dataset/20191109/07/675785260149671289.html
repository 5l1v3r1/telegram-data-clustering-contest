      <p>The Daily Mail has reported that friends and family are questioning whether bosses at the BBC show are doing enough to safeguard Lottie as the race allegations are having an impact.</p>
      <p>Lottie's mother, Stephanie Blackmore, has spoken about her fears to a friend who has said she is worried about her daughter's sanity.</p>
      <p>The friend revealed: "It was awful. Charlotte was on the phone in floods of tears on several occasions.</p>
      <p>"I was very worried about the effect of the attacks on her by other candidates.</p>

      <p>"Since the show has aired it is a constant barrage of vile comment on social media. It is very debilitating for her."</p>
      <p>Lottie's mother has said that she was not initially supportive of her daughter being involved on the show.</p>
      <p>She said that she feared Lottie taking part in the Apprentice as it wouldn't be a "positive experience".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for The Apprentice said:<i> </i>“The wellbeing of the candidates that take part in The Apprentice is of paramount importance, and we have a thorough and robust duty of care protocol in place which includes an experienced network of support for all candidates before, during and after filming.”</p>

      <p>The librarian allegedly abused 33-year-old Lubna Farhan in a WhatsApp conversation, in which she said "shut up Gandhi" and "I'll f*** you up".</p>
      <p>The West Country resident is also alleged to have said that the area of Somerset where she lives, had a low crime rate "because not many black people live there".</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the BBC has said that Lottie's comments "were wholly unacceptable," as it was revealed that the teen also hit out at trans women, claiming they 'would not be allowed into the ladies club she belongs to'.</p>
      <p>The Apprentice has come under fire this series as five of the first six candidates to have been fired were of black and minority ethnic.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the show has insisted that their performance in the tasks is the only driving factor as to whether Lord Sugar keeps them in the process.</p>
