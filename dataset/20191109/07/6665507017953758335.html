      <p>Reacting to the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a> verdict on Saturday, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/Congress/">Congress</a> said it respects the judgment and is in favour of Ram temple construction.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-hindu-trust-gets-possession-of-babri-site-muslims-granted-alternative-site_in_5dc64178e4b0fcfb7f6696a8">top court granted</a> the disputed site to the Hindu parties and ordered that the Muslim litigants be given a five-acre alternative site to construct a mosque.</p>
      <p>Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said that the judgment “has not only opened the doors for the temple’s construction, but also closed the doors of the BJP and others to politicise it.”</p>
