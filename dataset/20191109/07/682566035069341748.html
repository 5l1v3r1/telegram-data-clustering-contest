      <p>Perth - <b>Nic Maddinson</b> on Saturday pulled out of <b>Australia 'A's</b> clash against <b>Pakistan</b> in Perth on mental health grounds, all-but ruling him out of contention for a berth in the Test squad.</p>
      <p>The middle-order batsman's decision comes barely a week after Glenn Maxwell withdrew from Australia's Twenty20 team to deal with similar issues.</p>
      <p>Cameron Bancroft will replace Maddinson for the three-day match against Pakistan at Perth Stadium from Monday.</p>
      <p>"Nic has made the right decision and we are all behind him," said Australia 'A' coach Graeme Hick.</p>
      <p>"It is braver to speak up than to suffer in silence and I applaud Nic for having the courage to put his health first."</p>
      <p>His withdrawal almost certainly rules him out of the opening Test against Pakistan in Brisbane later this month, with the Australia 'A' game widely seen as a final chance to impress selectors.</p>
      <p>It opens the door to Travis Head or rising star Will Pucovski, who has also struggled with mental health issues in the past, to stake their case.</p>
      <p>Maddinson's decision followed Maxwell, one of the world's best short-format batsman, late last month opting to take a "short" break from cricket to deal with similar challenges.</p>
      <p>Alex Kountouris, Cricket Australia's head of sports science and medicine, said the governing body was committed to better understanding mental health and supporting those needing help.</p>
      <p>"Mental health is a challenge faced by Australian communities and elite sporting organisations and cricket is no different," he said.</p>
      <p>"Like other professional sports we are working very hard to better understand the challenges faced by our players and staff so we can support them."</p>
