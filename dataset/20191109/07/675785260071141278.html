      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Logan Paul has revealed his life-long ambition to be famous - and how his class-mates ridiculed him for it.</p>
      <p>The social media influencer has been in the public eye since he was a teenager when he first started creating six-second videos on Vine.</p>
      <p>He then migrated to YouTube where he attracted a following of almost 20million to establish himself as one of the most popular influencers in the world.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday night Paul will take his earnings and perhaps his reputation into the stratosphere when he takes on KSI in their long-awaited rematch.</p>
      <p>And the Ohio native is confident he will emerge victorious because he's been proving people wrong his whole life.</p>
      <p>"In high school I wanted to be famous and everyone laughed," he said.</p>
      <p>"But everything has seemed in reach for me as long as I grab for it. This is not a one-off; it cannot be. I am too good at it to not use this skill set more."</p>

        <b>Trainers almost come to blows</b>
      </p>
      <p>KSI and Logan Paul took a back seat as their trainers almost came to blows in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>The YouTube stars came together for the penultimate time before the first bell of their rematch on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But it was former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs who stole the limelight.</p>
      <p>Briggs will be in Paul's corner for the sequel at the Staples Center while KSI has been trained by professional fighter Viddal Riley.</p>
      <p>And it was the coaches who traded insults across the stage.</p>
      <p>Briggs said: "This is great for boxing, it's going to introduce new boxing fans to the sport.</p>
      <p>"I had to be part of it, I've been connected to Logan for 25 years through a guy I met on the street, Paulo, who is now his manager.</p>
      <p>"This is a great opportunity but my man has the ability and I know he can be the champ because I did it twice</p>
      <p>"This is the pro ranks and you came to this fight with a butter knife of a trainer.</p>
      <p>"This is war, you're going to get beat up real bad. I said to Logan you better put this guy in hospital."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paul admits to breaking self-imposed sex ban</b>
      </p>
      <p>Logan Paul has admitted he broke his own sex ban in the build up to his rematch with KSI.</p>
      <p>The American YouTube star will settle his feud with his fellow social media sensation when the pair clash in Los Angeles on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Paul has been training with former heavyweight world champion Shannon Briggs after turning professional for the sequel which will be held 14 months after the first fight ended in a draw.</p>
      <p>Paul had previously claimed that he was abstaining from sex for the duration of this training camp and that he had banned girls from his 'Maverick Mansion'.</p>
      <p>But he has now conceded: "There were no girlfriends, just tunnel vision, no sex all camp but just one issue a month ago... so we did four weeks.</p>
      <p>"In this camp I have never been more calm focused and confident. I truly feel like the best version of myself and better than I have ever felt and boxing is the vehicle for that."</p>
