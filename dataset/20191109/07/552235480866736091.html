      <p>St Mirren skipper Stephen McGinn knows just how good the atmosphere in the away end will be at Tynecastle today.</p>
      <p>That’s because the experienced midfielder was in the stands in Gorgie last season watching the Buddies draw 1-1 with Craig Levein’s Hearts.</p>
      <p>And he revealed he can’t wait to be back on the pitch for one of the “best away days” in Scotland.</p>
      <p>He told Express Sport: “It’s a place that we’re excited to go to. It’s one of the best away days.</p>
      <p>“I missed the game last year so I sat in the away end supporting the boys. The atmosphere was brilliant in the away end.</p>
      <p>“It’s a difficult game but one we’re looking forward to. As a player the home fans are so close to you. Everything about going there is great.</p>
      <p>“Obviously that comes with getting a result as well.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>You get a sense from Stephen McGinn that he just loves playing football.</p>
      <p>You can tell from how much he hated the international break, especially as his main focus is on helping lift St Mirren back up the table, which he knows could start with a win today in the capital.</p>
      <p>He said: “I hate the international breaks with a passion. It totally disrupts the first period of the season.</p>
      <p>“Probably with the semi-final weekend as well. You miss another game and it makes the Christmas schedule a bit manic.</p>
      <p>“As a footballer, you want to get in the habit of playing every Saturday. But it’s something we can’t control and we’re itching to get out at Tynecastle.</p>
      <p>“The bottom six is so tightly grouped, you only need to look at St Johnstone. After we beat them, the panic was expected to set in and they followed it up with back-to-back wins and you see where it takes them in the league.</p>
      <p>“So we take inspiration from that. We know how close we are to being a really good team and putting results together. It can quickly take you up the table.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinn does have happy memories at Tynecastle on the pitch, scoring the winner there on Boxing Day in 2007 when he was just 19.</p>
      <p>Now he insists his side can be heartbreakers once again, as long as they keep their performance levels at the standard they have set in recent weeks.</p>

      <p>He added: “I scored there early in my career. That was on Boxing Day a long time ago.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you see teams get a bounce when they’ve changed their manager. I think Austin MacPhee wants the job as well so there’s a lot of elements that will make it a really challenging day for us. But we want to go there and make it as hard for them as we can.</p>
      <p>“I feel like we’re in a good place at the moment performance wise. If we keep those standards I have no doubt that we can to Tynecastle and cause real problems.</p>
