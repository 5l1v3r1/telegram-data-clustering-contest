      <h1>Barcelona boss sheds light on new arrival’s snub</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T07:44:21+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Valverde wants new Barcelona arrival Junior Firpo to be more daring as the former Betis defender has failed to perform for the Catalans.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona spent €18 million along with €12 million in variables for Firpo, but the youngster has been struggling to appear on the team sheet even when the team was in desperate need of a natural left-back after Jordi Alba’s hamstring injury.</p>
      <p><a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/lionel-messi-furiously-asks-barcelona-sign-three-players/"><b>Alba</b></a> who sustained an injury during the Champions match against Slavia Prague was left in the dressing room at half time. With Junior still available on the Bench, Valverde opted to bring Sergi Roberto on the right instead and subsequently moved Semedo across to the left.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time the Dominican born youngster has been forced to watch from the sidelines and the exclusion of the Spaniard has puzzled fans across the world.</p>
      <p>Valverde has finally brought some light in the matter as he claims to be unhappy with the player’s level of training.</p>
      <p>The coach desires a more ‘Daring’ nature from the teenager, recalling his days with Real Betis, where Firpo had a more attacking style to his play. Valverde believes that currently, Junior has an over-cautious approach to the game with the teenager not ready to take any risks.</p>
      <p>The youngster’s debut was a disaster where he made a costly mistake in the first two minutes of the match that resulted in the Spanish giants conceding and later saw him getting subbed out at half time.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard’s next appearance was against Getafe, where he played the whole match and even scored a goal.</p>
      <p>Junior, however, has failed to appear since and the reason for that is his poor training performances.</p>
      <p>With Jordi Alba injured with Hamstring issues, the Spanish teen will surely look to win his place back in Barca’s defense. Firpo will seek Valverde’s approval to place him back in his natural left-back position, instead of forcing Nelson Semedo away from his preferred position on the right.</p>
      <p>Do you think Valverde will give the youngster a chance in the upcoming fixtures?</p>
