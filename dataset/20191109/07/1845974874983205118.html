      <h1>Chelsea vs Crystal Palace: Odds point to a win, but don’t count on clean sheet</h1>

      <h3>Chelsea can go into the international break with an eight-game Premier League win streak. The odds for the match make it seem likely and on familiar terms.</h3>
      <p>After such a roller coaster midweek versus Ajax in Champions League, we can hope for a much calmer match against Crystal Palace. Even with the return of Gary “The Bandage” Cahill, the chaos shouldn’t reach midweek levels.</p>
      <p>Cahill and Crystal Palace this season haven’t been poor, but they haven’t been good, either. They have stayed somewhere around middle of the table, currently keeping Manchester United company. On the road, their goal differential is -3, which bodes well for Chelsea, who are still struggling at Stamford Bridge to take control and shut down matches. The Blues’ differential on the road is the same as at home.</p>
      <p>The odds from The Action Network are pretty indicative of the Blues going out and dominating Crystal Palace. I know what you’re thinking: that’s a pretty bold statement to make with a Crystal Palace back line built of Gary Cahill and James Tomkins. But the money line is a cool -290, which means there is absolutely no money to be made on a straight up bet to win.</p>
      <p>So let’s move onto the spread, which is currently sitting at -1.5. That may be a bit inflated due to early betting, but I’d be willing to bet that falls and ends up around -1 at match time.</p>
      <p>But with that being said, I would still currently give the points and bet the -1.5. Chelsea are coming off a second half that likely gave them a bit of confidence, and with the international break coming after this match, the Blues won’t slip up.</p>
      <p>The only advantage Crystal Palace bettors or fans can point to would be the significantly larger chunks of time off. The Blues’ fixtures have been coming what seems like every other day. Thank goodness the team is filled with youth and Frank Lampard is not shy about using them.</p>
      <p>Action Network has the <a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/soccer/public-betting?utm_source=fansided&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fansidedliveodds"><b>total goals scored sitting at three</b></a>, with more action on the over than under. Based on the lines and the current odds, bettors are pushing for a 3-1 finish for the Blues.</p>
      <p>Blues fans will be hoping for a clean sheet, but of Crystal Palace’s five away matches, they have been held scoreless twice: against Sheffield United and Tottenham, the latter being the most recent on September 14.</p>

      <p>Look for Chelsea to start fast and dominate early, and for a bit of sloppiness to set in late allowing Crystal Palace to net one and cover the total goals scored.</p>
