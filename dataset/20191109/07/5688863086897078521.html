        <b>Chinki Yadav secured India's 11th Tokyo Olympic quota in shooting with a career-best qualification score of 588 at the 14th Asian Championship in Doha on Friday. India had already bagged Olympic quota places in 10m air rifle, three positions in 50m rifle, 10m air pistol and 25m air pistol.</b>

      <p>Since making it into the senior national team this year, Chinki has appeared in four <a href="https://sportscafe.in/shooting/tournament/issf_world_cup">ISSF World Cup</a>s in her maiden year, with 584 being her best score in the qualifications, which she shot in Rio. Going into the event, which offered four quotas, at the Lusail Shooting Range, she only needed to qualify for the finals to bag an Olympic quota as four of the eight finalists had already secured their quotas. Chinki shot her best qualification score and finished in a creditable second position, but only managed a sixth-place finish in the final with a score of 116.</p>
      <p>"I cannot explain how happy I am. This has been my best ever performance. I would like to credit my coaches, especially Jaspal sir for this as well as all those who have supported me including everyone in the Bhopal academy and the NRAI," Chinki told PTI after the event.</p>
      <p>Chinki joins Rahi Sarnobat, who won the first at the World Cup in Munich earlier this year, as the country's second quota spot in 25m pistol.</p>
