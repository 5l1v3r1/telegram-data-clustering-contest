      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T07:58:09+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> kept her rumoured fling with Drake secret because she reportedly didn't want family to find out.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star, 22, is said to have romanced the music star earlier this year, despite both of them denying they were ever an item.</p>
      <p>However, a new report suggests they got involved months ago and decided to keep it under the radar because of Drake's previous feud with her brother-in-law <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> reports Kylie "wanted to keep the news from her sister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> " who is married to West.</p>
      <p>The publication goes on to state that Kylie wanted a more serious relationship, but Drake is more of a "free spirit" and didn't want to be tied down.</p>
      <p>However, there's no suggestion that there was any overlap with Kylie's ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, the father of her daughter Stormi, who she split from this year.</p>
      <p>Rumours of the couple first ignited when Kylie recently attended the pop icon's 33rd birthday bash in Hollywood and it was reported that the pair "had an attraction".</p>

      <p>Insiders claimed the pair regularly see each other and it sparked speculation that they are dating.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-romantic-time-together/">People</a> : "He and Kylie have been spending time together recently.</p>
      <p>"Theyâ€™ve been friends for a long time and Drake is very close to the family."</p>
      <p>Although some sources attempted to shut down rumours and insisted to the publication that Kylie and Drake's relationship is just "friendly", another insider told People the pair have been hanging out "romantically".</p>
      <p>Before being reportedly attached at the hip at Drake's party, multiple sources have suggested a connection between the two stars.</p>

      <p>Reports of Kylie and Drake's suspected romance has also reportedly upset the TV star's famous ex, Travis Scott.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/">Hollywood Life</a> claimed Travis would "feel betrayed" if Kylie and Drake's relationship actually became something more romantic.</p>
      <p>There has been no official word as to why Kylie and Travis originally split up but it was thought that his career taking off and Kylie's desire for him to be around more for daughter Stormi Webster, were conflicting with each other.</p>
