      <p>BEIJING, Nov 9 — A Sino-US trade war could ease somewhat but wider conflicts between the world’s two largest economies will continue, Lou Jiwei, a former Chinese finance minister, said today.</p>
      <p>“Look at the next development, there could be compromises in the trade war at a certain stage, and we have seen signs of compromising,” Lou, now an official with a body that advises China’s parliament, told an economic forum in Beijing.</p>
      <p>Officials from both countries on Thursday said China and the United States had agreed to roll back tariffs already put in place on each others’ goods if a “phase one” deal was concluded, but the idea has been met with opposition from some quarters of the administration US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump himself, in comments that hit stock prices and the dollar, said yesterday he had not agreed to a tariff rollback.</p>
      <p>Washington has adopted a strategy to contain China’s economic rise by preventing the country from climbing up the global value chain, Lou said.</p>
      <p>“Containment and counter-containment are inevitable and that will be a long-term issue,” he said.</p>
      <p>But Lou also said it would be difficult for the United States to decouple from China, given the potential disruption to global supply chains and the impact on businesses.</p>
      <p>The US tariffs on Chinese exports will not fundamentally resolve its trade deficit, which is caused by the high US government debt ratio and a low household savings rate, he said. China should open up its economy wider to foreign investors, but it should not rush to relax its capital controls, Lou said. — Reuters</p>
