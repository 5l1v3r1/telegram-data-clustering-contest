      <p>John Legend and Kelly Clarkson's rendition of the controversial Christmas classic "Baby It's Cold Outside" dropped Thursday night, and it's already receiving some icy reactions.</p>
      <p>The popular 1959 version of the song was placed under a microscope in the #MeToo era, with critics saying its lyrics are suggestive of sexual harassment.</p>
      <p>Yet this 2019 redo is also getting pushback-this time, for being too politically correct.</p>
      <p>In the original, the playful banter implies that a man is trying to convince a woman to stay with him, though she repeatedly says that she wants to leave:</p>
      <p>"I ought to say, no, no, no sir (mind if I move in closer?) / At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)"</p>
      <p>The Legend-Clarkson duet reimagines theses lyrics:</p>
      <p>"I ought to say, no, no, no sir (Then you really ought to go,go,go) / At least I'm gonna say that I tried (Well Murray he just pulled up outside)"</p>
      <p>The #MeToo-friendly duet also takes out the line "Say what's in this drink?" and adds "It's your body and your choice."</p>
      <p>Critics are calling such adjustments "absurd." Deana Martin, daughter of Dean Martin, who popularized the song, said she did not like the change.</p>
      <p>"I don't think John Legend should have changed the lyrics. I mean, leave a tender moment as it was," she said.</p>
