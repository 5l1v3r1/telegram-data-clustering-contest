      <h1>BA passenger told he couldn't check vegetarian meal "due to data protection rules"</h1>
      <h2>Nigel Tozer was not allowed to see what's in his vegetarian meal for privacy reasons when he checked in online</h2>

      <p>A British Airways passenger was told he could breach data protection rules by checking his choice of in-flight meal.</p>
      <p>Nigel Tozer, from Birmingham, went online to confirm his choice of vegetarian meal for the flight but was shocked to find out the airline could not provide the information for 'privacy' reasons.</p>
      <p>Nigel, a marketing director with a data protection firm, was given a message that read: "We can confirm that you have a special meal choice on order but, for privacy reasons, we are unable to show you the type of meal.</p>
      <p>"If you're not sure of the type of meal you ordered please choose your meal again."</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>He screengrabbed the message and decided to take it <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , telling the national carrier: "Hey at British_Airways I just logged in to my own flight to check my vegetarian meal had been ordered, but for privacy reason, you can't show me?</p>
      <p>"So my food choice is so private, even I'm not allowed to see it?"</p>
      <p>He added: "Your DPO [data protection officer] needs a good talking to."</p>
      <p>Referencing the General Data Protection Regulation, a law that came in last year, he added the hashtag "GDPRgonemad".</p>
      <p>He later added: "Wait. I've had an idea. To bolster my food choice privacy even further, why not have the cabin crew wear blindfolds when they serve it?"</p>
      <p>One user suggested: "Can you log a free of information request for your meal preference?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "I think data protection gone mad may well become the new political correctness gone mad."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for British Airways said: ""We pride ourselves on offering up to 14 different meal options for a wide range of dietary and religious needs.</p>

      <p>"We're currently investigating what caused our website to show this message on the 'Manage my Booking' page and apologise for any inconvenience."</p>
      <p>The Information Commissioner's office warned companies to not use the Data Protection Act as a smokescreen for not giving out information.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner David Smith made the remarks in 2008 after identifying that organisations had been too often refusing to release information under false cover the Data Protection Act.</p>
      <p>He said at the time: "The Data Protection Act does not impose a blanket ban on the release of personal information".</p>
