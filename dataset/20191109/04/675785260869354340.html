      <h1>Man Utd 'hold talks' with Christian Eriksen over £42m January transfer</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham midfielder is fed up waiting for Real Madrid and instead reportedly held talks with United last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:19:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have reportedly held talks with Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen over a January transfer.</p>
      <p>Eriksen is in the final year of his contract with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and so could leave for free in the summer.</p>
      <p>He has been linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , but according to latest reports from Spain the attacking midfielder has grown tired of waiting for the La Liga giants and has instead begun talks with United.</p>
      <p>Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs to strengthen his midfield and attack, and 27-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christian-eriksen">Eriksen</a> could fit the bill after impressing during his six years with Tottenham.</p>
      <p>And United are preparing to make a £42million bid for the Danish international after holding talks with him last month, according to Spanish publication <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/actualidad/">El Desmarque</a> .</p>

      <p>Having been a key figure for Spurs since joining from Ajax for £12m in 2013, Eriksen has been less of a fixture in the team this season, with some observers pointing out that summer speculation over a move to Real Madrid may have unsettled him.</p>
      <p>However, earlier this week boss Mauricio Pochettino said Eriksen was still the same player he had always been since joining Tottenham.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think the performance of Christian is any different than when we signed him five-and-a-half years ago," said Pochettino.</p>

      <p>"His commitment is the same, sometimes we maybe look too much at whether a player has a one-year contract or a four-year contract.</p>
      <p>"In the end it is about commitment, maybe players in the last year of their contract show more commitment than a player with four more years on their contract.</p>
      <p>"But when you see Christian and you compare him to different seasons, he is the same player."</p>
