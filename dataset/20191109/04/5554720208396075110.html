      <p>Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan on Friday said that he was embarrassed by a question which had a reference to ‘wife’ in a popular song that he had lent his voice to in  the film <i>Laawaris. </i>He also went on to praise the 1981 film <i>Umrao Jaan, </i>which had earned Rekha the National Award for Best Actress.</p>

      <p>The question with a reference to wife was, “What kind of wife is being described in this part of the song?” Hey Bhagwan, one audio will be played here for you.”</p>
      <p>Soon after completing his question, Bachchan said, “please play the song. I am very scared now.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “Hey Bhagwan. Why are you embarrassing me? You don’t have manners!”</p>
      <p>The options were Moti, Chhoti, Lambi and Gori with the correct word being ‘Moti’ which had featured in the song <i>Mere Angne Me Tumhara Kya Kaam Hai </i>from <i>Laawaris</i><i> </i>starring none other than Bachchan. The song was also sung by the Bollywood megastar himself.</p>
      <p>Bachchan clarified that he had not been intimated about the song. Explaining the background of the song, Bachchan informed that it was from film the <i>Laawaris</i><i> </i>which had Zeenat Aman, Amjad Khan, Ranjit amongst others. “I don’t know who the hero of the film was. Alka Yagnik and one more person who I don’t know had sung the song,” said Bachchan evoking laughter from his guests and the audience.</p>
      <p>Bachchan said that filmmaker Prakash Mehra had once heard him perform the <i>Mere Angne </i>song at a Holi party at his house. He insisted to include this otherwise folk song from Uttar Pradesh in his next film and also requested Bachchan to sing it.</p>
      <p>“Which of these films won four National Film Awards- Best Music Director, Best Female Playback Singer, Best Actress and Best Art Direction.” The options were <i>Umrao Jaan</i>, <i>Mother India</i>, <i>Arth</i> and <i>Paakeezah.</i></p>
      <p>Bachchan informed that the correct answer was <i>Umrao Jaan, </i>which was directed by Muzaffar Ali in 1981. He said that Rekha had won the Best Actress award, while Khayyam had won the Best Music award. “It was a beautiful film,” said Bachchan.</p>
