      <h1>Lionel Messi furiously asks Barcelona to sign three expensive players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:04:47+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:04</time> by <a rel="author">Atharva Khadilkar</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona have been put under pressure to sign three players by Lionel Messi and all of them will come at a really exorbitant price.</h3>
      <p>Lionel Messi has over 500 goals to his name with Barcelona and the mercurial genius has made an impact single-handedly on a large number of the club’s matches. Over the last few years and especially since Neymar’s departure, the Blaugrana have been heavily dependent on the Argentina international and that was something which wasn’t paid much heed to.</p>
      <p>Barca would win a good number of matches, but Messi’s sole work went unseen in those and now that the winger is 32 years old, he is slowing down and his deteriorating work rate and form have showed on the club’s performances. Only 11 matches into the league, the Blaugrana have lost three matches already.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi is anyway livid at Barcelona for their embarrassing transfer business over the last couple of years, but Ernesto Valverde being incompetent and unable to use his resources to their best have all impacted the Catalans in an adverse manner. <a href="https://www.diariogol.com/fcbarcelona/messi-amenaza-al-barca-tres-fichajes-o-se-larga-y-uno-es-una-bomba-contra-florentino-perez_20008685_102.html"><b>Diario GOL</b></a> now claims that Messi wants the club to sign three players and is furious with the board.</p>
      <p>Neymar is the first name on the list forwarded to the board by Messi. The Paris Saint-Germain winger was close to returning to the Camp Nou this summer, but tight finances meant that the club was not able to pursue a move for the Brazil international. Messi wants Neymar back at the club at all costs in the next summer.</p>
      <p>Joshua Kimmich is another player that has been suggested by Messi. The right back position is a weak link in the Barca squad and the club has never gotten a reliable player since Dani Alves left. Messi believes that Kimmich would be the ideal full back for them but Bayern Munich will certainly set a high price for the Germany international.</p>
      <p>Finally, Messi has urged the Barca board to go for Inter Milan centre back Milan Skriniar. The Slovak was one of the most demanded defenders in the summer, but he stayed put with Antonio Conte’s side. However, if Barca come knocking after missing out on de Ligt, Skriniar could consider leaving but will certainly cost a bomb.</p>
      <p>Do you think Barca would be able to afford all three of Messi’s target in one go?</p>
