        <b>Hard-hitting batsman Liam Livingstone has signed up with Western Australian franchise Perth Scorchers for the upcoming season of the Big Bash League.

      <p>After having already announced the signings of the likes of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ab_de_villiers">AB de Villiers</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/dale_steyn">Dale Steyn</a> and James Vince, yet another T20 superstar, Liam Livingstone, will be turning up in the forthcoming season of the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/tournament/big_bash_league">Big Bash League</a> after signing up with the Perth Scorchers. Livingstone is a modern-day superstar in T20 cricket and has already showcased his talent in both the IPL and PSL, playing for <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/rajasthan_royals">Rajasthan Royals</a> and Karachi Kings respectively.</p>
      <p>"It's a tournament I've always wanted to play in so I can't wait to get to Perth. I've spent a winter in Perth, I know the place well and I'm looking forward to getting back there," Livingstone said in an official statement, reported Cricbuzz.</p>
      <p>"I can't wait to see everyone at The Furnace this summer and hopefully I can provide some entertainment for the members and fans," the Englishman added.</p>
      <p>Livingstone, who has scored close to 1800 T20 runs at a strike rate of 141, is one of the many Englishmen who will feature in the upcoming season of the BBL, after Tom Banton, Pat Brown, Phil Salt and James Vince also signed up with other franchises earlier this year. </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old will join a strong Perth Scorchers team that already possesses the likes of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mitchell_marsh">Mitchell Marsh</a>, Ashton Turner, Jhye Richardson and Ashton Agar. Head coach Adam Voges also expressed his excitement over Livingstone's signing and believes that the swashbuckling batsman will become a fan favourite in no time.</p>
      <p>"We're very pleased to have secured Liam for the upcoming season. He has performed really well in T20 cricket all around the world over the past 12 months.</p>
      <p>"Liam's a great all-round package, he'll give us some aggression at the top of the order, he's a handy spinner and a fantastic fielder. We're excited about what Liam can bring to the Scorchers this season and I'm sure he'll become a fan favourite very quickly."</p>
