      <h1>Glasgow councillor 'offered to join Lib Dems' before jumping ship to SNP</h1>
      <h2>Anne McTaggart contacted the pro-Union party before declaring her support for independence.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>A Glasgow councillor who switched sides to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeons-advisors-horror-struck-20814581">the SNP</a> last week held defection talks with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-liberal-democrats">Lib Dems</a> before joining the Nationalists.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/new-snp-councillor-glasgow-criticised-20818025">Anne McTaggart </a>contacted pro-Union Willie Rennie’s party before coming out in support of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/indyref2">independence</a>.</p>
      <p>McTaggart was a Glasgow Labour MSP before party members effectively deselected her in 2016.</p>
      <p>She returned to elected politics twelve months later when she became a Labour councillor for the Anniesland and Drumchapel ward.</p>
      <p>In a high profile announcement on Friday, she publicly quit Labour and defected to the SNP, which runs a minority administration in Glasgow. Nicola Sturgeon hailed the new recruit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McTaggart said at the time: “I really want to be part of something positive. Labour hasn’t done anything positive of note for a long time in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“It’s now clear that independence is the only way forward for the people and the communities I’ve represented for over 10 years. It offers them the security and opportunity being eroded by Westminster.”</p>
      <p>However, before jumping ship to the SNP, McTaggart was in touch with the Liberal Democrats about joining them.</p>
      <p>It is understood discussions took place with Rennie, but the Lib Dems were put off by previous media coverage about McTaggart’s political career.</p>
      <p>A Lib Dem source confirmed “preliminary talks” had taken place but said McTaggart “cut off contact” after questions were asked about past articles, adding: “The next thing we knew it had been announced she’d joined the SNP.”</p>
      <p>McTaggart was criticised this week after it emerged she incurred an ICT/telephone bill of over £600 as a councillor.</p>
      <p>Over 80 of the 85 councillors claimed less than £50 in this category, with most claiming less than £42, but McTaggart’s figure was around fifteen times higher than some colleagues.</p>
      <p>She did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
