      <h1>Shock Real Madrid transfer link as Aston Villa receive double Wolves message</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers | All the latest WWFC news from BirminghamLive including Adama Traore, James Rodriguez and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <h3>Adama Traore interview</h3>
      <p>Adama Traore was doomed from the very start at Aston Villa. </p>
      <p>A 19-year-old boy with limited English was plucked from Barcelona - the only club he’d ever known - and expected to hit the ground running alongside 10 other new signings. </p>
      <p>He didn’t and a perception of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/adama-traore">Traore</a> was created which the winger has been unable to shake. Until now.  </p>
      <p>A rip-roaring six months at Middlesbrough led Traore to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and his career is taking off under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo.</a></p>

      <p>That decisive cross for Raul Jimenez’s winner against Slovan Bratislava on Thursday was Traore’s ninth direct goal contribution (two goals, seven assists) of what’s been an electric season so far. </p>
      <p>Villa fans aren’t familiar with this souped-up version of Traore. Many of the 3,000 Villans at Molineux on Sunday will remember a novice with raw speed and power that he couldn’t control. </p>
      <p>But Traore, now a man and captivating a room full of journalists, isn’t fussed about proving them wrong.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think I have to prove anything to anyone,” says the 23-year-old. “I’m not thinking about anything outside of our team or what other people think. </p>
      <p>“I have to prove it to the manager, Nuno, who has trusted me, and the team and myself.”</p>

      <h3>A surprise transfer link</h3>
      <p>James Rodriguez is reportedly on the trade block with Real Madrid eyeing Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Ruben Neves.</p>
      <p>Reports <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/175379-hay-acuerdo-con-james-rodriguez-florentino-perez-lo-cierra-se-va-del-real-madrid-ed">in the Spanish press</a> say Manchester United's Paul Pogba and Tottenham Hotspur's Christian Eriksen are also of interest to Zinedine Zidane's side.</p>
      <p>Rodriguez, who spent last season on loan at Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, has started just five matches in all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>He hasn't featured at all since October 22, the 2014 summer signing out of the picture under Zidane who is in his second spell in charge at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>He was brought to the club from AS Monaco on the back of an excellent World Cup campaign with Colombia, for a fee reported to be in the region of £63 million.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ruben-neves">Neves</a> is a key cog in Nuno Espirito Santo's <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> machine, making 101 appearances since his £15.8m move from FC Porto in 2017.</p>
      <h3>Nuno's Villa promise</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo</a> has promised Wolverhampton Wanderers’ supporters that his players understand the meaning of Sunday’s derby clash with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>A section of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> fans were frustrated with Nuno’s team selection in the 2-1 Carabao Cup defeat to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> last week and are keen for revenge this weekend.</p>
      <p>And Nuno will go all out at Molineux with Premier League points the order of the day after Wolves edged closer to the Europa League knockout stages on Thursday.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>“We’re going to work and start thinking about Villa,” Nuno said. “It’s a big game, here at Molineux, a big derby. We are going to be ready for it.</p>
      <p>“We played (Villa) already - we know about it already. We are the same people, we know what it means.”</p>
      <p>Prior to this season Nuno and Villa head coach Dean Smith faced each other twice in 2017/18 when the latter was in charge of Brentford. Smith’s Bees team held Wolves to a point at Griffin Park before being walloped 3-0 at Molineux.</p>
      <p>And Nuno is full of admiration for the job Smith has done since taking charge at Villa Park last October.</p>
      <p>“Fantastic - he’s done an amazing job. We played against Dean in the Championship and he’s a very good manager.”</p>
