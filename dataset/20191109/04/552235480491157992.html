      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/world-war-2">World War II</a> veteran who appealed to be reunited with his fellow prisoners of war has met the son of one of his former comrades.</p>
      <p>Jimmy Johnstone, 98, launched the appeal in August and was overwhelmed by the worldwide response.</p>
      <p>He was looking for survivors of his ordeal. He was captured in France at the battle for Saint-Valery-en-Caux and witnessed men die as the PoWs were taken to camps in Nazi-occupied Poland in cattle trucks after marching hundreds of miles.</p>
      <p>He endured five years in the camps, ending with an escape bid on a death march in temperatures of minus 28C, where prisoners who collapsed were shot, as camp commanders retreated into Germany.</p>

      <p>The son of one of the four men with whom he tried to escape got in contact after hearing his appeal, and the men had an emotional meeting in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, where they both live, organised by Scottish War Blinded.</p>
      <p>Sandy Petrie, 73, spoke of his father Bert Petrie, who died 10 years ago aged 86.</p>
      <p>Jimmy said: “Meeting Sandy was very emotional as I didn’t think I’d get any response to my appeal.</p>
      <p>“We talked about Bert and life in the PoW camps. I told Sandy what a brave man his dad was. He stood up to the German guards and refused to work until they got more food.”</p>
      <p>Bert served with the Gordon Highlanders in the 51st Highland Division at St Valery, alongside Jimmy, who served with the Royal Engineers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sandy said: “When I heard about the appeal, I quickly recognised it was my father being referred to and I was very, very interested to hear the story.</p>
      <p>“They were some of the same stories my father had told me. I felt I’d like to meet this chap, and to meet him for my father’s sake too, as I know he would have wanted to meet Jimmy.</p>
      <p>“It was very touching to hear him refer to my father. I have the greatest respect for Jimmy and the men and women of his generation, sadly a dwindling group. They saved our civilisation and way of life. It was a privilege to have met him.”</p>
      <p>Jimmy thanked those who responded to the appeal and plans to write to as many as he can.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is really important that as we approach <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Day</a>, we remember all men who fought in all battles, those that survived and those who died.”</p>
