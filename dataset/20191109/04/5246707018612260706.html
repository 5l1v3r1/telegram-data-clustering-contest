      <p>New listings on Nintendo of America's website have revealed the first three <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/five_nights_at_freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></b> games will receive individual releases on the Switch eShop on 29th November. Each game will be priced at $7.99.</p>
      <p>This release takes place roughly a year after the creator Scott Cawthon <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/11/five_nights_at_freddys_creator_is_bringing_the_original_scares_to_switch">announced</a> his point-and-click-survival horror series would be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms. As previously revealed, he's been working closely with the talented French software development company Clickteam to create these improved HD ports.</p>
      <p>Here's the rundown of each one via Nintendo's website:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Five Nights at Freddy's</b><br/>Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</b><br/>In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike! As the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</b><br/>Thirty years after Freddy Fazbear's Pizza closed it's doors, the events that took place there have become nothing more than a rumor and a childhood memory, but the owners of "Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction" are determined to revive the legend and make the experience as authentic as possible for patrons, going to great lengths to find anything that might have survived decades of neglect and ruin. At first there were only empty shells, a hand, a hook, an old paper-plate doll, but then a remarkable discovery was made...The attraction now has one animatronic.</blockquote>

      <p>The FNaF games have become insanely popular with video game streamers since the first game's release in 2014. The series essentially plays on fears of worn out and murderous toys coming to life.</p>
