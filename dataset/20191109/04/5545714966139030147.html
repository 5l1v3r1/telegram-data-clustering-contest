      <p>Hi folks and welcome to another wonderful weekend. I hope that November has started well for you, and that you're not feeling the fall chill too much in your neck of the woods. My sincere thanks for your <i>delightful</i> birthday messages that I received in the Qposts this week. The day was lowkey, but the huge outpouring of love from so many made it very special. Thank you, it goes without saying I love all y'all.<br/><br/>This week has been unfortunately slim on games for me. What little time I've had has been dedicated to rounding off Night School Studios'<i> Afterparty,</i> so you can expect a review <i>very</i> soon. Other than that, I've not really found time to play anything at all. I'm hoping to finally get my Untitled Goose on this week. Very much looking forward to that. Honk.<br/><br/>How about you? There's so much out there right now, include the long-awaited <i>Death Stranding,</i> which will be spinning in many a hard drive as we speak. But we also have <i>Luigi's Mansion 3, The Outer Worlds, Modern Warfare, MediEvil, Ring Fit Adventure</i>, and many other great new games. So drop us a line below and fill us in on what's stealing all o' your time, if you will.<br/><br/>Have a wonderful weekend, from all of us at Destructoid.</p>
