      <h1>UK weather: Heavy rain gives way to freezing cold as temperatures drop to -6C</h1>
      <h2>'Near biblical' downpours in the last few days saw parts of the country under water, with one woman reportedly swept away to her death</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T04:56:52+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Rkaina, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-rkaina/</a></address>
      <p>Heavy rain that flooded parts of the country is set to give way to sub zero temperatures as the mercury drops as low as -6C.</p>
      <p>The parts of Britain which have been battered by floods are set to avoid further downpours as rapid temperature drops threaten a frosty start to Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> meteorologist Steven Keates described it as "quite a messy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> picture" with a mix of low temperatures, frost, rain and even the potential of snow in some parts places.</p>
      <p>But he added: "I think the most important thing is that the areas which have been affected by floods should avoid rain and get some respite."</p>
      <p>A yellow weather warning, which states that "heavy rain may cause disruption from flooding", is also in place for the east of Northern Ireland from Saturday at 5am.</p>

      <p>It comes as a heavy band of rain is set to spread east across Northern Ireland into Saturday before drying out in the evening.</p>
      <p>County Down in Northern Ireland could see up to 50mm, although most areas in the region could get 20-30mm.</p>
      <p>Mr Keates said that some snow is possible in parts of Wales and the first snow of the autumn could hit the mountain tops of Snowdonia.</p>
      <p>It is also likely that overnight into Saturday or into Sunday could bring the coldest temperatures of meteorological autumn, which covers the months of September to November.</p>

      <p>Mr Keates said: "In the coldest temperatures in Scotland, it could be -6C while parts of southern England could see -2C."</p>
      <p>During a visit to the flood-hit town of Matlock in Derbyshire on Friday, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> said the widespread flooding across the UK "is not looking like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency".</p>
      <p>His visit came after the death of a woman who was reportedly swept away by floodwater as parts of the Midlands and northern England were battered by a month's worth of rain in one day.</p>
      <p>The body of the woman, who has not been identified, was recovered in Darley Dale, near Matlock, at about 10.40am on Friday, Derbyshire Police said.</p>

      <p>She was reported to have been swept away by floodwater in Rowsley in the early hours.</p>
      <p>Yorkshire and the Midlands were among the worst-affected areas. The Environment Agency had issued six severe flood warnings suggesting there is a "danger to life" by Friday at 11.20pm.</p>
      <p>At this time there were also 63 warnings telling people to take immediate action in light of expected flooding, along with 99 alerts which urged residents to be prepared.</p>
