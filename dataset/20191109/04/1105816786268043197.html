      <p><b>ISLAMABAD.: </b>As fears of data leakage escalate in the country, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) led government has decided to develop an indigenous application called “Govt-APP” for all official communication and is likely to quit the use of over-the-top (OTT) service like WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>According to a decision taken during the cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, “An indigenous application [called] Govt-APP may be developed. All communication related to government if required may be undertaken using the said APP instead of other OTT services such as WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook messenger. The data will be stored in Pakistan.”<br/>It was also decided in the meeting that under the programme of launching public interest initiatives, a national professional networking portal would be designed for the Pakistani market. It could possibly have back-end capability with some of the leading professional networking websites. However, its distinctive feature as national service and grouping of members would be its original, which would help connect with the professions of their respective domains. In addition, a portal would also maintain a comprehensive roster of Pakistani professionals all over the globe.</p>

        <b>Aviation Division</b>
      </p>
      <p>E-complaint management system for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would also be launched, while gates would be installed at Islamabad airport to facilitate and expedite immigration process for the passengers.</p>
      <p>A ‘Meet and Greet’ project for fast track movement of passengers would be launched for those who opt for same on payment basis. A fast track counter would be introduced to facilitate the senior citizens and special persons.</p>
      <p>Provisions of adequate number of immigration counters at Lahore and Karachi airports would be made through adjustment as per requirement of domestic and international passengers.<br/>Passengers of the PIA would avail the facility of pick and drop at about 50 per cent discount as the result of partnership with Careem.</p>
      <p>Airport Security Force personnel would ensure maximum courtesy to the passengers without compromising standard operating procedures of security. No display of weapons by the ASF personnel deployed in the terminal building would be made and implementation of fast track clearance at checkpoints would be ensured. In addition to these measures, Weather Studio (Media Centre) at Pakistan Meteorological Department Office, Lahore would also be inaugurated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Overseas Pakistanis</b>
      </p>
      <p>An allocation of 3% quota would be made for Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) educational institutions for admission of disabled children. Wheelchairs would be provided to facilitate the disabled students of the OPF educational institutions. Strict observance of prescribed quota for disabled would be followed for all future recruitment at the OPF educational institutions. Provision of fee discount for children of disabled persons at the OPF educational institutions would also be ensured.</p>
