      <h1>Share of Cryptocurrency Jobs Grew 1,457% In 4 Years</h1>

      <p>The share of cryptocurrency jobs per million <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/07/indeed-share-of-cryptocurrency-jobs-grew-1457-in-4-years/">has risen 1,457% over the past four years</a>, according to a study by job site <a href="https://www.beseen.com/blog/talent/bitcoin-job-market-2019-beyond/">Indeed.com</a>. VentureBeat reports: <i>Indeed analyzed millions of job postings on Indeed.com to unpack how Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain trends have affected the job market. Searches for Bitcoin, blockchain, and cryptocurrency roles are going down -- yet employer demand has skyrocketed. According to Indeed, in the four-year period between September 2015 and September 2019, the share of these jobs per million grew by 1,457%. In that same time period, the share of searches per million increased by 469%. <br/><br/>In the past year, the share of cryptocurrency job postings per million on Indeed.com has increased by 26%, while the share of searches per million for jobs has decreased by 53%. Bitcoin's volatility seems to correlate with job seeker interest, and the change in Bitcoin price this year might be why job searches have declined. Employers, however, are doubling down on the technology, which uses decentralized ledgers to produce secure and transparent transactions. </i>The report says that if you want a better chance at getting a job in this field you should be a programmer familiar with basic cryptography, P2P networks, and a language like C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript (along with certain soft crypto skills). To stand out, you should learn new blockchain development languages, like Hyperledger, Bitcoin Script, Ethereum's Solidity, the Ripple protocol, or even languages currently in development -- like Rholang. <br/><br/>The top hirers are as follows: Deloitte, IBM, Accenture, Cisco, Collins Aerospace, Ernst &amp; Young, Coinbase, Overstock, Ripple, Verizon, Circle, Kraken, ConsenSys, JP Morgan Chase, and Signature Bank.</p>
