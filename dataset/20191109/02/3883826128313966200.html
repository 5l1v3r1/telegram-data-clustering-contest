      <h1>The Chinese suicides prevented by AI from afar</h1>

        <b>Li Fan, a 21-year-old student, attempted suicide after posting a brief message on the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo just after Valentine's Day.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I can't go on anymore. I'm going to give up," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Soon after, he lost consciousness.</p>
      <p>He was in debt, had fallen out with his mother and was suffering from severe depression.</p>
      <p>Some 8,000km (5,000 miles) away from his university in Nanjing, his post was detected by a program running on a computer in Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>It flagged the message, prompting volunteers from different parts of China into action.</p>
      <p>When they were unable to rouse Mr Li from afar, they reported their concerns to local police, who eventually saved him.</p>
      <p>It might sound extraordinary but this was just one of many such success for the Tree Hole Rescue team.</p>
      <p>The initiative's founder is Huang Zhisheng, a senior artificial intelligence (AI) researcher at the Free University Amsterdam.</p>

      <p>In the past 18 months, his program has been used by 600 volunteers across China, who in turn say they have rescued nearly 700 people.</p>
      <p>"If you hesitate for a second, a lot of life will be lost," Mr Huang told BBC News.</p>
      <p>"Every week, we can save around 10 people."</p>
      <p>The first rescue operation was on 29 April 2018.</p>
      <p>A 22-year-old college student, Tao Yue, in northern China's Shandong province, wrote on Weibo she planned to kill herself two days later.</p>
      <p>Peng Ling, a volunteer from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and several others reacted.</p>
      <p>Ms Peng told BBC News they had found a phone number for one of student's friends via an earlier post and passed the information to the college.</p>
      <p>"I tried to message her before sleep and told her that I could pick her up," she said.</p>
      <p>"She added me as a friend on [Chinese app] WeChat and gradually calmed down.</p>
      <p>"Since then, I have kept check on her to see if she is eating. We also buy her a bunch of flowers through the internet once a week."</p>
      <p>After this success, the team rescued a man who had tried to jump off a bridge and saved a woman who had tried to kill herself after being sexually abused.</p>
      <p>"Rescues need both luck and experience," said Li Hong, a Beijing psychologist who has been involved for about a year.</p>

      <p>She recalled how she and her colleagues had visited eight hotels in Chengdu, in order to locate a suicidal woman they had known had booked a room in the city.</p>
      <p>"All the receptionists said they didn't know the woman," Ms Li said.</p>
      <p>"But one of them hesitated for a moment. We assumed it must be that hotel - and it was."</p>
      <p>So how does the system work?</p>
      <p>The Java-based program monitors several "tree holes" on Weibo and analyses the messages posted there.</p>
      <p>A "tree hole" is the Chinese name for places on the net where people post secrets for others to read.</p>
      <p>The name is inspired by an Irish tale about a man who confided his secrets to a tree.</p>
      <p>One example is a post by Zou Fan, a 23-year old Chinese student who wrote a message on Weibo before killing herself, in 2012.</p>

        <figcaption>Huang Zhisheng's software proactively searches Weibo for certain keywords</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>After her death, tens of thousands of other users added comments to her post, writing about their own troubles, thus turning the original message into a "tree hole".</p>
      <p>The AI program automatically ranks the posts it finds from one to 10.</p>
      <p>A nine means there is a strong belief a suicide attempt will be made shortly. A 10 means it is likely to be already under way.</p>
      <p>In these cases, volunteers try to call the police directly and/or contact the person involved's relatives and friends.</p>
      <p>But if the ranking is below six - meaning only negative words have been detected - the volunteers normally do not intervene.</p>
      <p>One of the issues commonly encountered by the team is a belief among older relatives that depression is not a "big deal."</p>
      <p>"I knew I had depression when I was in high school but my mother told me that it was 'absolutely impossible - don't think about it anymore'," Mr Li told BBC News.</p>
      <p>The AI program also found a post from a young woman, saying: "I will kill myself when New Year comes."</p>
      <p>But when the volunteers contacted her mother, they said she had sneered and said: "My daughter was very happy just now. How dare you say she is planning suicide."</p>
      <p>Even after the volunteers showed evidence of her daughter's depression, the mother did not take the matter seriously.</p>
      <p>It was only after an incident in which the police had to stop the youngster jumping off a rooftop that the mother changed her mind.</p>
      <h3>Long journey</h3>
      <p>Despite its successes, Mr Huang acknowledges the limits of his project.</p>
      <p>"Because Weibo limits the use of web crawlers, we can only gather around 3,000 entries every day," he said.</p>
      <p>"So we can only save one or two a day on average and we choose to focus on the most urgent cases."</p>
      <p>Another issue is that some of those rescued require a long-term commitment.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Volunteers sometimes find themselves checking up on rescued contacts over the course of weeks and months</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Most of my life now is occupied by these rescued people," Ms Li said.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I get very tired."</p>
      <p>She said she was currently in contact with eight people who had been rescued.</p>
      <p>"I have to reply [to] them soon after they send me a message," she said.</p>
      <p>Some team members also try to provide help offline.</p>
      <p>For example, one AI professor is said to have found a data-labelling job for one person found to have a social-anxiety disorder.</p>
      <p>There is also the issue that suicidal thoughts can return.</p>
      <p>Ms Peng gave the example of one youngster who had "looked better each day" after being rescued but then killed herself.</p>
      <p>"She was talking to me about getting a new photo portrait on Friday," Ms Peng said, adding that two days later the woman was dead.</p>
      <p>"It's a big shock to me that a person you got along with over a long time suddenly isn't there."</p>
      <p>By contrast, Mr Li remains healthy and now works at a hotel.</p>
      <p>"I like this job because I can communicate with many different people," he said.</p>
      <p>He added while he was very appreciative of the rescue team's efforts, ultimately it was up to each individual to achieve a long-term solution.</p>
      <p>"Different people's joys and sorrows are not completely interlinked," he said.</p>
      <p>"You must redeem yourself."</p>
