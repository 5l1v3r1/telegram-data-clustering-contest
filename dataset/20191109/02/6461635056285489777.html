      <h3>Didier Deschamps believes Antoine Griezmann needs time to make his mark on the Catalans despite a slow start to the season.</h3>
      <p>Antoine Griezmann has failed to impress the Barcelona fans with four goals in ten appearances across all competitions this season.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old left Atletico Madrid over the summer, after an initial saga, but has failed to live up to his quality.</p>
      <p>Many point the reason for this as being Ernesto Valverde’s preference to play the Frenchman out wide instead of his usual central position, in order to accommodate other attacking players.</p>
      <p>However, French coach  Deschamps has no fear that Griezmann’s top form will return, confirming that the forward simply needs more time to adapt to the high expectations of the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>when asked about the player’s concerning form in a recent <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-cm/news/griezmann-needs-time-to-match-huge-expectations-at-barcelona/201d62y42hoz1dh1teed7g97w"><b>news conferenc</b></a>e, the coach said,</p>
      <blockquote>“Not at all. Even if you have great players at Barcelona, it doesn’t happen in a day. It depends on how they play, how they work with each other,”</blockquote>
      <p>The issue with France’s central forward playing out as winger for Barcelona was also addressed by the coach,</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s put in different positions than the ones he has with France, even though he played [wide] a long time ago.</blockquote>
      <p>but supported the choices of Valverde and insisted that the players must fit in the Club, regardless of what is demanded of them,</p>
      <blockquote>“He must fit in, the other players as well. He didn’t choose the easiest solution and it’s a big club, so the expectations are huge. He’s always part of a team, but he’s not used to it yet.</blockquote>
      <p>The World Cup-winning manager did suggest that he would prefer the player in a central role but also praised Griezmann’s ability to shine regardless of his position.</p>
      <blockquote>“Even when he’s not as good, he’s always positive for the team. With us, it’s a different situation, different position, he can play at his best position where I’ve put him a long time ago. Of course, he has a very important role in how we play.”</blockquote>
      <p>The €120 million forward will look to make his mark on the Barca attack and with Suarez injured with calf issues, we might finally see the World Cup winner back in his preferred cental position.</p>
      <p>Will Greizmann deliver for Barcelona in their upcoming fixtures?</p>
