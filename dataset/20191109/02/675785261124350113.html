      <h1>Freddie Mercury's guilty pleasures 'included Countdown and Carol Vorderman'</h1>
      <h2>Freddie Mercury's best friend Peter Freestone has spoken about how the Queen singer relaxed at home where he 'loved Countdown' and fine art</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T02:40:46+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 02:40</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Freddie Mercury was far removed from the rock icon persona he had, when he was relaxing at home.</p>
      <p>The Queen front man would relish the surrounds of Garden Lodge in the heart of London, when he was at the height of his fame.</p>
      <p>Peter Freestone was Freddie's best friend during the singer's more infamous years but he said behind closed doors, he liked nothing more than 'Countdown and Carol Vorderman'.</p>
      <p>Peter said that Freddie was often trying to be every man to all people, which meant that he loved the moment when he could close the front door on the world.</p>
      <p>Despite the feeling of wanting to walk away from the fame, Peter said that Freddie always had time for the fans that gathered outside his mansion.</p>

      <p>Peter told Express Online: "He would go outside the gate at Garden Lodge, knowing the fans would be there.</p>
      <p>"He would always strike a pose for the pictures, knowing they would run straight to get them developed and how much it meant to them.</p>
      <p>"He had such respect for the fans because he knew everything he had came from them."</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the most flamboyant performers on stage, Peter said that Freddie was almost devoid of ego away from that arena.</p>

      <p>He continued: "He knew not to take himself too seriously. He left the grand person on stage. He was so down to earth."</p>
      <p>This was echoed by how Freddie lived behind closed doors, with partner Jim Hutton and Peter, who was the singer's PA.</p>
      <p>Peter revealed: "Freddie at home alone with us would be sitting in a mismatched tracksuit on the sofa watching Countdown.</p>
      <p>"He loved that show more than any other. It was all about words. He loved words all his life. His whole career was built around those beautiful words he crafted and created in his songs."</p>

      <p>The Channel 4 show was hosted by Richard Whitely and while Freddie liked Carol Vorderman, he didn't have much time for the maths segment of the show.</p>
      <p>Peter continued: "He hated numbers, he wasn't a fan of that part. He always said, ‘Darling other people can worry about them.’"</p>
      <p>Peter said that Freddie's personality had many layers and depending upon who was visiting, the type of Freddie Mercury that received them would change.</p>

      <p>Peter admitted: "There were many layers. Friends would come to lunch and a slightly different Freddie Mercury would appear.</p>
      <p>"It was more real and playful than you would see with the fans outside the door but still different, slightly dialled up and switched on."</p>
      <p>Being the perfect host was one of the pleasures in life that Freddie enjoyed.</p>
      <p>Peter added: "He loved entertaining friends. He would put on a matching tracksuit. I remember he used to check the dining room table which was set up, of course, by someone else but he might move a glass or fork an inch and then when guests arrived say, ‘Darling, I Iaid the table, isn't it fabulous?’"</p>

      <p>Freddie was very loyal to those he cherished and would refuse to hear tittle-tattle about people he knew and loved.</p>
      <p>Peter said: "He was never cruel, even when he was gossiping or bitching. He was so protective about his friends.</p>
      <p>"If he heard someone say something about his friends he would jump on them saying, ‘How dare you repeat third-hand gossip? You weren’t there.’</p>
      <p>"Someone was talking about his former manager John Reid in the mid-80s and Freddie just leapt on them. They weren’t in constant contact or best friends but Freddie wouldn’t have it."</p>
