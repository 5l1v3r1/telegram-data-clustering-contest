        <b>BERLIN (Sputnik) - The European Union can no longer rely on "soft power" to assert its values globally and needs to learn the "language of power", European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen said Friday.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>In her "State of Europe" address in Berlin, the former German defence chief <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910041076965419-italian-farmers-confederation-asks-conte-to-discuss-us-tariffs-with-eu-avoid-trade-war/">reminded the audience</a> that "soft power" was a way of spreading a nation’s influence through culture, something she said was a "costly" project.</blockquote>
      <p>"Soft power alone is now not enough. If we Europeans <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910271077158878-us-envoy-to-eu-tells-lawmakers-trump-zelensky-relations-constitute-quid-pro-quo--report/">want to assert ourselves</a> in the world Europe must also learn the language of power".</p>
      <blockquote>Von der Leyen said Europe needed to "grow our own muscle where we have long relied on others, for example in security policy."</blockquote>
      <p>Secondly, Europe needs to use the force it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910181077079049-us-slaps-eu-with-record-75-billion-tariffs---reports/">had for "targeted engagement"</a> where it best served European interests. She cited China as a country where the EU was in a position to influence bilateral trade.</p>
      <p>Von der Leyen — a Brussels-born German politician and a mother of seven — was expected to assume office on 1 November, but the start date was pushed back by a month after the European Parliament rejected several of her nominees.</p>
