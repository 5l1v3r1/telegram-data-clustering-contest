      <p><b>CINCINNATIÂ (AP)</b> - Tyrique Jones and Naji Marshall each scored 20 points and No. 19 Xavier beat Siena 81-63 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Jason Carter just missed reaching double figures in his first career start for Xavier (2-0). He finished with a career-high nine points.</p>
      <p>The Musketeers led by as many as 27 points in the second half.</p>
      <p>Elijah Burns scored 19 points and Jalen Pickett added 18 to lead Siena (1-1).</p>
      <p>Jones needed just 20 minutes to score his 20 points, two short of matching his career high. He had 12 in the first half, eight on four crowd-pleasing dunks. He ran downcourt celebrating with the "raise the roof" gesture after the third dunk.</p>
      <p>After committing turnovers on their first three possessions, the Musketeers capitalized on Siena's poor shooting. Siena went 1 for 11 from the field in one stretch, while Xavier put together a 14-1 run and took a 26-16 lead with 6:03 left in the first half.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Siena has lost its last 10 games against Big East teams since beating Villanova, 74-59, on March 18, 2003, in the NIT.</p>
      <p>Xavier has won its last four games against Siena to improve to 4-1 in the series.</p>
