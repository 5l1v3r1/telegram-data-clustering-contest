      <p>An accomplice, 26-year-old Jordan Northover, had also admitted involvement in the attack and was awaiting sentencing.</p>
      <p>Judge Ian Bourne described Smith as a "career criminal" who was well known to police.</p>
      <p>Former Germany midfielder Ozil was driving his black Mercedes in North London when the car was boxed in by motorbike riders wearing helmets on July 25.</p>
      <p>Video images showed Bosnian defender Kolasinac, who was a passenger, getting out of the vehicle and confronting the attackers.</p>
