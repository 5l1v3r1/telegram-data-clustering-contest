      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 9 — President Donald Trump said yesterday he has not agreed to roll back tariffs on Chinese imports, dampening recent optimism for a major de-escalation in the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Amid a steady stream of conflicting reports, Trump’s remarks appeared to push back against Beijing’s claims that the two sides had agreed to remove tariffs in stages as part of a partial deal announced last month.</p>
      <p>Hopes for progress in defusing trade tensions have driven global stocks higher this month, since an agreement would remove a major source of uncertainty in the world economy that is undercutting growth.</p>
      <p>But Trump again portrayed the dispute as a boon for the United States despite the tariffs paid by American companies and consumers.</p>
      <p>“They would like to have a rollback. I haven’t agreed to anything,” Trump told reporters at the White House.</p>
      <p>“China would like to get somewhat of a rollback, not a complete rollback, because they know I won’t do it.”</p>
      <p>Beijing, however, said this week the two sides had already agreed to mutual tariff reductions.</p>
      <p>Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng announced Thursday that negotiators “agreed to roll back the additional tariffs in stages, as progress is made towards a (final) agreement.”</p>
      <p>The United States and China have imposed steep tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in two-way trade, and another round of US duties are set to hit on December 15 on US$160 billion (RM661.2 billion) in Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>Trump again said Beijing is eager for a deal because their economy is hurting, although observers say China has more leverage as the US president prepares to compete for reelection.</p>
      <p>Economic data show the conflict has hit US businesses and the uncertainty created by the dispute between the economic powers is undermining global growth.</p>
      <p>“Frankly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I do,” Trump said, adding that the initial agreement will be signed “in our country,” possibly in Iowa.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conflicting signals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Investors worldwide have been cheered in recent days by reports quoting sources in Washington and Beijing saying duties already imposed could be removed in a proportional way.</p>
      <p>But markets also have been buffeted by conflicting comments from White House officials, including China hardliner Peter Navarro, who earlier yesterday cast doubt on any plans to remove punitive duties.</p>
      <p>“What is on the table is tariffs coming in December, December 15,” Peter Navarro told NPR radio. “We would be willing I think—it’s up to the president—to postpone those tariffs.”</p>
      <p>“But not roll back any existing tariffs. That’s the fine distinction here.”</p>
      <p>White House economic aide Larry Kudlow was less categorical, telling Bloomberg on Thursday that if the sides reach a phase one trade deal, “there are going to be tariff agreements and concessions.”</p>
      <p>China expert Derek Scissors, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said Beijing is playing one faction against the other to get a better deal.</p>
      <p>“There is a group within the administration that essentially wants to unconditionally roll back tariffs. This gives the Chinese an opportunity to get more without offering more,” Scissors told AFP.</p>
      <p>“On the economic side, phase 1 is not a big win for the US no matter what. If we roll back tariffs, it’s a big win for China.”</p>
      <p>The International Monetary Fund has cut its global growth forecast and warned that implementing all the announced tariffs would cut US$700 billion out of the world economy next year.</p>
      <p>Greg Daco of Oxford Economics warned against excessive optimism since the agreement between Washington and Beijing is far from final but said rolling back tariffs could boost the US economy.</p>
      <p>“However, the benefits from easing trade tensions could be much smaller if the rollback appeared temporary as uncertainty would keep businesses cautious,” Daco said in a research note. ­— AFP</p>
