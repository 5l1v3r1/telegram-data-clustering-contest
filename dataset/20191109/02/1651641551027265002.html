      <p>Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S11 early next year. According to the rumours, we could see the device at MWC 2020 in Barcelona. However, we have already started seeing leaks around the device and what’s expected from Samsung’s next flagship.</p>
      <p>After multiple leaks from Samsung <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/first-details-of-the-camera-of-the-samsung-galaxy-s11-leaked-online/">Insider Ice Universe</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/battery-details-of-the-galaxy-s11-and-galaxy-s11e-leaked-online/">others</a>, veteran smartphone insider <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1192975629148475393">Evleaks</a> has jumped on the hype train with a new set of leaks. According to his recent tweet, Galaxy S11 will come in three screen sizes: 6.4″, 6.7″, 6.9″ and will have curved screens. He also mentioned that the 6.4-inch and 6.7-inch devices will have LTE and 5G while the biggest 6.9-inch will come only with 5G.</p>

      <p>Personally, with 6.9-inch, Galaxy S11 can no longer be called a smartphone. While people usually like big screen devices, they are harder to carry. That said, Samsung’s Galaxy S11 is expected to carry a lot of <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-might-come-with-advance-zoom-features/">changes</a> over the current device so Samsung might be able to justify the behemoth display.</p>
