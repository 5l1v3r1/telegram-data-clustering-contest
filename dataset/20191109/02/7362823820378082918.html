      <p>This <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/maryland">Maryland</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/teachers">teacher</a> knows how to pick 'em.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old Mount Airy resident recently <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/good-news">won</a> her second $50,000 prize from a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/lottery">lottery</a> scratch-off in as many months, <a href="https://www.mdlottery.com/50000-scratch-off-win-makes-mt-airy-teacher-a-two-time-winner/">according</a> to the state lottery.</p>
      <p>“Because it was a newly launched ticket, I knew most of the prizes were still available in the game,” the as-of-yet unidentified woman said. “I bought two tickets and sat in the car and scratched them. The first one was a non-winner, but the second one made me shout for joy.”</p>

      <p>The 22-year special education teacher is known as "the Advocate" in her community, according to the Maryland Lottery.</p>
      <p>“I plan on using this money to continue taking care of my 90-year-old family members and start a business with a focus on elder care for seniors with impairments,” she said. “It’s going to be needed in the near future.”</p>
