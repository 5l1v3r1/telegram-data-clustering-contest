      <p>INTERNATIONALLY renowned astronomer Sir Thomas Maclear will be honoured in Co Tyrone today for his "remarkable contribution to science".</p>
      <p>His life will be celebrated with the unveiling of an Ulster History Circle blue plaque in his home-town of Newtownstewart by Paul Maclear, his great-great-great-grandson.</p>
      <p>Born at Moyle Glebe in 1794, the son of a minister, he was destined to become an Anglican cleric but instead trained for the medical profession.</p>
      <p>He attended the Royal College of Surgeons in England and worked as a house surgeon in the Bedford Infirmary. He developed a keen interest in astronomy and began a long association with the Royal Astronomical Society becoming a Fellow in 1828.</p>
      <p>Maclear was named His Majestyâ€™s Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and worked closely with Sir John Herschel, who was carrying out surveys of the southern sky.</p>
      <p>Between 1841 and 1848, Maclear performed a geodesic survey to recalculate the dimensions and shape of the earth, covering an area from Namaqualand to Cape Agulhas.</p>
      <p>A beacon was erected on top of Table Mountain, which was used as a triangulation station to check calculations.</p>
      <p>Maclear was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and knighted for his outstanding scientific work as an astronomer.</p>
      <p>Close friends with explorer David Livingstone, they shared an interest in African exploration and through Maclear's work, Livingstone was able to plan his expeditions carefully.</p>
      <p>Maclear died in Cape Town in 1879 and is buried in the grounds of the Royal Observatory.</p>
      <p>The town of Maclear in the Eastern Cape and Cape Maclear are named after him. The Maclear beacon is at the highest point on Table Mountain, and there is also a beach and a moon crater named in his honour.</p>
      <p>Paul Clements from the Ulster History Circle said the plaque will be unveiled at the Newtownstewart Centre 2000 dedicated to a man who "made a remarkable contribution to science".</p>
      <p>"The Ulster History Circle is pleased to honour his name and acknowledge his importance and significance to Newtownstewart, the place of his birth," he said.</p>
      <p>"Sir Thomas Maclear played an active part in numerous scientific and cultural activities and it is gratifying that his name lives on in South Africa and will continue to be remembered in his native Newtownstewart."</p>
