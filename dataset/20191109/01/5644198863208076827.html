      <p>PARIS: Edinson Cavani is set to make his first start for Paris Saint-Germain since August against Brest on Saturday (Nov 9) after recovering from a hip injury, coach Thomas Tuchel said on Friday.</p>
      <p>"He should play tomorrow, we need him to start playing," Tuchel said ahead of the weekend's clash.</p>

      <p>Cavani has been absent from the French champions' starting line-up thanks to a combination of the persistent injury and the hot form of new arrival Mauro Icardi.</p>
      <p>He has made substitute appearances in PSG's last two Ligue 1 matches against Marseille and at Dijon, as well as their midweek Champions League win over Club Brugge.</p>
      <p>Tuchel added that the Uruguayan, who is PSG's all-time leading scorer with 195 goals, is "disappointed" to have slipped back in the attacking hierarchy, but is in a "good state of mind".</p>
      <p>The German said that he was unsure whether in-form Icardi would take part after picking up a knock to his left foot after scoring the winner in the 1-0 victory over Brugge.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has stolen the show in recent weeks with eight goals in his last seven appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>"I don't know about Mauro yet, he was in a lot of pain after the match," said Tuchel. "We need to see if he will be able to play."</p>
      <p>Tuchel also confirmed Neymar's continued absence on Saturday following the hamstring injury he suffered playing for Brazil last month.</p>
      <p>Thilo Kehrer, Ander Herrera and Thomas Meunier are also all out.</p>
      <p>PSG have a six-point lead at the top of Ligue 1 despite losing 2-1 at Dijon last time out.</p>
