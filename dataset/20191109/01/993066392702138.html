      <p>JET2.COM and EasyJet have bought all of collapsed tour operator Thomas Cook's landing slots at in the UK, the company's liquidators have said.</p>
      <p>EasyJet snapped up 27 pairs of slots, at Gatwick and Bristol Airports, for £36 million.</p>
      <p>Rival budget airline Jet2.com bought the remaining slots at Stansted, Birmingham and Manchester Airports, for an undisclosed amount, the Official Receiver said.</p>
      <p>EasyJet said it will release more information later this month.</p>
      <p>"This outcome has been facilitated by the collaborative approach of Thomas Cook's commercial partners at UK airports and the support of both internal and external slot co-ordinators," the Official Receiver said.</p>
      <p>It comes less than two months since Thomas Cook entered administration.</p>
      <p>Administrators have since been trying to recoup as much money as possible from the business to help pay back its debts.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, they sold off the Thomas Cook brand name to Chinese company Fosun for £11 million. Fosun said it still believes in the brand value of Thomas Cook.</p>
      <p>And in October, Sunderland-based Hays Travel paid £6 million to buy Thomas Cook's 555 high street stores, promising to keep many of the jobs.</p>
      <p>The collapse has caused politicians to call for changes.</p>
      <p>Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom pledged to take action to help customers who face losing out on injury compensation claims.</p>
      <p>"Thomas Cook only took out insurance cover for the very largest personal injury claims," she said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"For agreed claims below this figure up to a high-aggregate amount, they decided to self-insure through a provision in their accounts."</p>
