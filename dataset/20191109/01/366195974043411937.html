      <p>Songstress Sevyn Streeter has been grinding for years. The 33-year-old singer stepped into the spotlight as Chris Brown's protegé, but the songwriter has penned lyrics for artists like <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/FantasiaBarrino/profile">Fantasia</a>, K. Michelle, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Brandy/profile">Brandy</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Usher/profile">Usher</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/TamarBraxton/profile">Tamar Braxton</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/arianagrande/profile">Ariana Grande</a>, and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/KellyRowland/profile">Kelly Rowland</a>. Fans haven't received a new album from Sevyn since she dropped her debut studio project <i>Girl Interrupted</i>, and the only new music the singer has shared in recent years has been her 2018 release "Yernin'."</p>
      <p>Sevyn has returned with her new single "Whatchusay," an R&amp;B jam that was delivered with an accompanying visual. The singer turns up the heat in the sexy video where she straps her lover up to a polygraph machine and grills him about the lies he's told. As steamy as the video is, the track itself is about a love grown cold, so check it out and let us know what you think.</p>

          <b>Quotable Lyrics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>You such a bad liar, why you try?<br/>You tell them whenever you know I'm<br/>Not the type to lose composure over love<br/>But n*gga you coulda just told me what it was</p>
