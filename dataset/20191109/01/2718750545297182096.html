      <h1>Vanna White Steps in to Host <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> as Pat Sajak Undergoes Emergency Surgery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T01:24:06+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 01:24</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>First <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/alex-trebek/">poor Alex Trebek</a>, now this? When you host a show for almost four decades, you’re bound to grapple with some sort of calamity at some point. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/pat-sajak/">Pat Sajak</a> has hosted the most recent iteration of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/wheel-of-fortune/"><i>Wheel of Fortune</i></a> for over 35 years, and fortunately he’s worked alongside a very skilled hostess almost the entire time, which came in handy this week when Sajak had to undergo emergency intestinal surgery.</p>
      <p>“Our taping on Thursday was canceled because host Pat Sajak underwent successful emergency surgery to correct a blocked intestine,” the official <i>Wheel of Fortune </i>Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/WheelofFortune/status/1192930873303130112">tweeted Friday afternoon</a>. “He is resting comfortably and looking forward to getting back to work. Taping resumed today as scheduled and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/vanna-white/">Vanna White</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/WheelofFortune/status/1192962616051658754">stepped in as host.</a>” <a href="https://people.com/tv/wheel-of-fortune-pat-sajak-emergency-surgery/">According to <i>People</i></a>, Sajak is reportedly “expected to be fine.” Notably, in May, Sajak <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-qZwS1n_wk">became the Guinness World Record holder</a> for longest career as a game-show host for the same show, so at this point, he’s just beating a world record with every episode he hosts.</p>
