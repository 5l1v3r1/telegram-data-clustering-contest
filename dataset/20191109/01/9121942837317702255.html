          <figcaption>Police in riot gear ask a woman to take off her mask outside a train station in Hong Kong, Sunday, Nov. 3, 2019. The protests were sparked by a now-shelved bill allowing extradition to mainland China that many saw as creeping interference by Beijing in legal and other rights. The city’s embattled leader, Carrie Lam, provoked more anger last month by invoking emergency powers to ban the wearing of facial coverings at rallies. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)</figcaption>
