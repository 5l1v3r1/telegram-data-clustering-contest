      <h1>Rejoice: We Finally Know The Premiere Date For The New Series of ‘Brooklyn Nine-Nine’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T01:10:30+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine"><i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i></a> is one of the most subtly subversive shows on television.</p>
      <p>On the face of it, it’s just one more American sitcom — a comedy about a motley crew of alternately grumpy, hopeful, and zany characters trying to navigate their way through a confusing world. But unlike most other sitcoms, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i> is defined by its genuine warmth. This is a show that cares about its characters; that really wants them to succeed. Their desires are taken seriously, and their hopes and dreams treated with respect.</p>

      <p>That certainly goes a long way to explaining why the show has been so warmly received. When it was briefly cancelled, the internet took up their arms as though someone had slurred all of our parents. It wasn’t just some TV show going off the air. It was personal.</p>
      <p>Well, longtime fans will be delighted to know that <i>Brooklyn Nine Nine</i> is coming back to our screens really soon. The seventh season of the show will hit American television on February 6, 2020. Better still, the first episode will be a bumper one — it’ll run for a whole hour.</p>
      <p>Of course, as usual, the Australian release date hasn’t been confirmed yet. But <a href="https://junkee.com/brooklyn-nine-nine-backstreet-boys/200001">given how popular the show is Down Under</a>, it’d be sensible to assume it’ll be hitting streaming services sometime around then.</p>
