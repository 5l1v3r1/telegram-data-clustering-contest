      <p>FORMER Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP Tom Elliott will again be the Ulster Unionist candidate in the constituency for the forthcoming Westminster election.</p>
      <p>The former UUP leader previously held the seat for little over two years from May 2015.</p>
      <p>He lost out in the last general election to Sinn Féin's Michelle Gildernew, by a majority of 875.</p>
      <p>The DUP has already stated that it will not run in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, which is home to its leader Arlene Foster.</p>
      <p>"This will be the most important general election in generations – the MPs elected on December 12 will have a decisive role in shaping the UK's future international and domestic direction for many decades to come," Mr Elliott said.</p>
      <p>"Brexit is the defining issue of the period. I believe a bad Brexit deal would be just as damaging, both economically and constitutionally, as a no deal."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the TUV has said it will not be fielding any candidates in the Westminster election in what the party has described as a "one-off stance".</p>
      <p>The Jim Allister-led party has been sporadic in its participation in previous general elections, tending to stand only in safe unionist seats.</p>
      <p>The party received 62,021 first preference votes in May's European Parliament election, ultimately outpolling both the SDLP and Ulster Unionists.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said first-past-the-post elections had "always evoked a different and more selective response from TUV than PR (proportional representation) elections, where maximising the choice for unionist voters is an advantage".</p>
      <p>“This is a unique election in which we intend to take a one-off stance – TUV will sit out this single issue election," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"The pan-republican, pro-Remain assault on unionist seats calls for a country before party response."</p>
