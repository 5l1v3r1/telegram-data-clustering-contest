      <p>LONDON, Nov 9 — A man who tried to rob Arsenal players Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac at knifepoint in a failed North London carjacking last July was sentenced to 10 years in jail yesterday.</p>
      <p>The BBC reported that Ashley Smith, 30, was sentenced at Harrow Crown Court after admitting trying to steal watches worth £200,000 (RM1.06 million) from the Premier League players.</p>
      <p>An accomplice, 26-year-old Jordan Northover, had also admitted involvement in the attack and was awaiting sentencing.</p>
      <p>Judge Ian Bourne described Smith as a “career criminal” who was well known to police.</p>
      <p>Former Germany midfielder Ozil was driving his black Mercedes in North London when the car was boxed in by motorbike riders wearing helmets on July 25.</p>
      <p>Video images showed Bosnian defender Kolasinac, who was a passenger, getting out of the vehicle and confronting the attackers.</p>
      <p>Both players were then left out of Arsenal’s team for the season-opening game. — Reuters</p>
