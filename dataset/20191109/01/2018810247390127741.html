      <p>A new Nintendo published game, <i>The Stretchers</i>, is just came out on the Nintendo eShop in Europe and Japan. It’s a co-op game where you and a friend load people onto an ambulance and take them to a hospital, and it looks very silly.</p>
      <p><i>The Stretchers</i> comes from the same people that made <i>Little Nightmares</i>, Tarsier Studios, and it manages to make being an EMT seem very wacky. Residents of a town are suddenly struck by dizziness and need your help getting to the hospital. You and a friend will have to manoeuvre a stretcher through obstacles to pick up people and then drive the ambulance to the hospital, careening through fences and people’s backyards as you go.</p>

      <p>This game isn’t yet out in North America, but I hope it comes here soon. This seems like the perfect kind of game to throw on at a party, if only because any game where you have to coordinate movement with another player is a recipe for hijinks. While you wait for its release in the States, you can check out more information and screenshots <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/The-Stretchers-1655738.html?&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=TheStretchers%7CLaunchTrailer%7Co3PUR%7Cm_id_c6m6DYcw33%7C1655738%7Cw45#">in the European eShop</a>. </p>
