      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 9 — The seventh member of the ID family, the ID Space Vizzion concept, will make its world debut at the LA Auto Show later this month.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Volkswagen announced that its electric ID line will soon be gaining another member: The ID Space Vizzion. The wagon will make its world debut on November 19, a few days before this year’s LA Auto Show opens to the public on November 22. </p>
      <p>VW states that the Space Vizzion will be the defining model of a “totally new, fully electric car segment.” It will be the first station wagon of the ID line.</p>
      <p>Thanks to openings in the front and roof that allow air to pass through, the model can reach a range up to 300 miles (EPA) or 590 km (WLTP) on the company’s MEB platform.</p>
      <p>The completely digitised cockpit is complemented by materials that have been made, at least in part, with sustainable raw materials. Leather-like components are actually made of what the brand calls AppleSkin, a leather lookalike with “a proportion of residual matter from apple juice production.”</p>
      <p>Though the Space Vizzion that will be displayed at the show is a concept model; the company plans to release a production version in 2021.</p>
      <p>The ID Space Vizzion will make its debut on November 19 and will then be on display for public viewing from November 22 to December 2 at the LA Auto Show. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
