      <p>DETECTIVES investigating allegations of abuse at Muckamore Abbey Hospital have revealed they have uncovered an offence of "non-contact sexual behaviour" by a staff member.</p>
      <p>The Irish News has learned that relatives of patients were contacted yesterday by specialist PSNI officers to reassure them their loved ones had not been harmed by the suspect.</p>
      <p>The offence came to light through police viewing of CCTV footage from the Co Antrim hospital's Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU), covering a six-month period between April and September 2017.</p>
      <p>A male member of staff at the Co Antrim hospital is captured in the images reportedly committing the act.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Jill Duffie, who is heading up the massive PSNI probe into the regional facility for adults with severe learning disabilities, last night confirmed her team are "investigating an offence of non-contact sexual behaviour" which "has been viewed as part of the ongoing review of over 300,000 hours of CCTV footage".</p>
      <p>The senior PSNI officer added: "We have spoken with the families to advise them of this offence and reassure them that no patients were physically involved in this incident.</p>
      <p>"I am very conscious of the trauma and impact upon the families whose loved ones are at the centre of this investigation. From the outset we have been committed to working closely with them, with the aim of keeping them as informed as much as we possibly can and we will continue to do so."</p>
      <p>In August, Ms Duffie confirmed that a total of 1,500 suspected crimes had been identified in the PICU, which is a six-bedded secure unit for seriously ill patients. It closed last December due to a staffing crisis.</p>
      <p>The chief inspector described Muckamore as the "largest adult safeguarding case" of its kind within the Northern Ireland police service.</p>
      <p>To date, 36 staff linked to alleged physical assaults and neglect of patients have been suspended from the hospital.</p>
      <p>One staff member was arrested by police last month but was released on police bail.</p>
      <p>The Irish News has learned that viewing of the PICU images by the PSNI team is now complete - with more arrests expected over coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Fears are mounting about the future of the hospital, with more suspensions expected.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week The Irish News reported how the Department of Health has proposed a 15 per cent pay rise as an incentive for nurses from other health trusts to temporarily work at Muckamore.</p>
      <p>However, sources say the uptake to the offer has been "poor".</p>
