      <h2>A timeline explaining the centuries-long Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid land dispute in Ayodhya and events leading up to today's historic judgment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T01:42:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 01:42</time> by <a rel="author">Surbhi Gloria Singh</a></address>
      <p>On December 6, 1992, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babri-masjid">Babri Masjid </a>in Ayodhya was demolished, changing India's political fabric forever. After almost 27 years, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>will deliver its verdict on the Ram Janmabhoomi-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/babri-masjid">Babri Masjid </a>title dispute today.</p>
      <p>A five-judge Constitution Bench will pronounce its judgment on petitions challenging the 2010 Allahabad High Court verdict that had divided the disputed 2.77-acre plot in Ayodhya among the Nirmohi Akhara, a religious denomination, the Sunni Central Waqf Board, and representatives of Ram Lalla, the child deity. Arguments in the case ended on October 16 after a marathon hearing of 40 days.</p>
      <p>Historical evidence shows that in 1528 a commander in first Mughal emperor Babur's army, Mir Baqi, had constructed the mosque in Ayodhya which had come to be known as Babri Mosque. Let's take a look at the timeline of events as they unfolded in the case over the decades leading up to today.</p>
      <p><b>1885:</b> One Mahant Raghubar Das files a suit seeking permission to construct a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ram-temple">Ram Temple </a>at the disputed site. A trial court rejects the petition fearing such a permission would lead to riots. Appeals are also rejected.</p>
      <p><b>1934</b>: A mob damages parts of the disputed structure. The British repair it. Muslims continue to offer prayers at the mosque and Hindus worship at Ram-Chabutra and Kaushalya Rasoi.</p>

      <p><b>November 9, 1989:</b> VHP lays the foundation of a <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ram-temple">Ram temple </a>on the land next to the Babri Masjid after receiving permission to do so from the Rajiv Gandhi government of the day.</p>
