      <p>The Heat, second in the Eastern Conference at 6-2, lost one of their top playmakers ahead of Friday's game at the Los Angeles Lakers, who share the NBA's best record with Boston at 6-1.</p>
      <p>Winslow, 23, is averaging 13.8 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists in five games for the Heat, who have also been without standout Jimmy Butler for part of the early season campaign.</p>
      <p>Winslow, the 10th overall selection of the 2015 NBA Draft, helped Duke University win the 2015 US college championship. He averaged career highs of 12.6 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.2 assists a game last season.</p>
