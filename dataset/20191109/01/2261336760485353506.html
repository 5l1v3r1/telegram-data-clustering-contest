      <h1>KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 purses: YouTube stars each guaranteed $900,000</h1>

      <p>With KSI vs. Logan Paul 2 being held in the state of California, we actually get to see their official purses for their respective pro boxing debuts.</p>
      <p>Guess what? They are getting a lot of money!</p>

      <p>The California State Athletic Commission has put down $900,000 each for both headliners for this six-round cruiserweight bout. If we’re being completely realistic, they’re making a lot more money than that through their personal sponsorships and (at least from KSI’s side) perhaps a cut of the pay-per-view from Sky Box Office in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>When these two fought in an amateur bout last year, they reportedly sold over a million pay-per-views and <a href="https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/416017/ksi-logan-paul-sold-over-1000000-pay-per-views/">made millions of dollars</a>. One can only assume history will repeat itself for Saturday.</p>
      <p>As for the actual established boxers on the undercard, WBC lightweight champion Devin Haney is getting a $1 million purse, which is one hell of a feat at just 20 years old. His opponent, the unheralded Alfredo Santiago, is getting a decidedly paltry $90,000, although it might be more than what’s listed given how often foreign fighters have underreported payouts for tax reasons.</p>
      <p>WBO super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders’ Matchroom Boxing debut sees him get an official purse of $750,000 against substantial underdog Marcelo Esteban Coceres, whose purse is just $80,000, but much like Santiago, it could be higher (but not much higher) than what’s been listed.</p>
      <p>Ronny Rios aside, basically everyone else on the undercard is not even top-50 in their respective weight class. It’s a bunch of prospects and opponents brought in to lose to those prospects, so there’s a big gap in pay for the top and the bottom.</p>
      <p>The full payouts are below:</p>
