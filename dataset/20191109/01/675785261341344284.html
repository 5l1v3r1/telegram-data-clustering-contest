      <h1>Kylie Jenner shows off her curves in sultry footage after being 'dumped by Drake'</h1>
      <h2>Kylie Jenner showcased her killer curves on her Instagram stories after reports that singer and Kardashian wanted different things</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T01:53:28+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 01:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Kylie Jenner has been flaunting her amazing figure on social media after reports that the Kardashian bombshell's romance with musician Drake did not progress as he 'doesn't like to be tied down.'</p>
      <p>It is claimed that the American rapper, 33, and the mother-of-one, 22, 'hooked up' a number of months ago but as the Hotline Bling star is a 'free spirit' the pair wanted different things.</p>
      <p>Make-up mogul Kylie, who is sure to have a number of admirers, appeared unbothered in clips she uploaded onto her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> stories on Friday after sources close to her told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> that she would be interested in something more serious with Drake but knows it’s unlikely as he doesn’t like to be tied down in a relationship.</p>
      <p>Ooozing confidence in the videos, she zoomed the camera across her physique as she struggled to contain her ample assets in a skimpy black vest.</p>

      <p>She could be seen lip-syncing to a number of songs as she posed on her bed and tried out a number of filters.</p>
      <p>Rumours of the couple first ignited when Kylie recently attended the pop icon's 33rd birthday bash in Hollywood and it was reported that the pair "had an attraction".</p>
      <p>Insiders claim the pair regularly see each other and have sparked speculation that they are dating.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/tv/kylie-jenner-drake-spending-romantic-time-together/">People</a> : "He and Kylie have been spending time together recently.</p>
      <p>"They’ve been friends for a long time and Drake is very close to the family."</p>
      <p>Although some sources attempted to shut down rumours and insisted to the publication that Kylie and Drake's relationship is just "friendly", another insider told People the pair have been hanging out "romantically".</p>
      <p>Before being reportedly 'attached at the hip' at Drake's party, multiple sources have suggested a connection between the two stars.</p>
      <p>Reports of Kylie and Drake's suspected blossoming romance has also reportedly upset the TV star's famous ex, Travis Scott.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/">Hollywood Life</a> claimed Travis would "feel betrayed" if Kylie and Drake's relationship actually became something more romantic.</p>
      <p>There has been no official word as to why Kylie and Travis originally split up but it was thought that his career taking off and Kylie's desire for him to be around more for daughter Stormi Webster, were conflicting with each other.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "Travis and I are on great terms. Our main focus right now is Stormi. Our friendship and our daughter is priority."</p>
      <p>Kylie and Travis were in a relationship for nearly three years and share one-year-old daughter Stormi.</p>
