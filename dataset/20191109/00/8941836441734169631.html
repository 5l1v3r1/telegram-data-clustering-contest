      <h1>AP sources: Former Trump adviser John Bolton has a book deal</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Former national security adviser <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">John Bolton</a> has a book deal, The Associated Press has learned.</p>
      <p>The hawkish <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> departed in September because of numerous foreign policy disagreements with President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>. He reached a deal over the past few weeks with Simon &amp; Schuster, according to three publishing officials with knowledge of negotiations. The officials were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Two of the officials said the deal was worth about $2 million. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> was represented by the Javelin literary agency, whose clients include former FBI Director James Comey and the anonymous <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> administration official whose book, “A Warning,” comes out Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>The publishing officials did not know the title or release date. Simon &amp; Schuster declined comment Saturday and Javelin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a>’s 2007 book, “Surrender is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad,” was published by the conservative Simon &amp; Schuster imprint Threshold Editions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a>’s name has come up often recently during the House impeachment inquiry , which has focused on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s pressure on Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden, the former vice president.</p>

      <p>In a transcript of a closed-door interview released Friday, a former national security official described how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> had “immediately stiffened” as Ambassador Gordon Sondland “blurted out” that he had worked out a trade - Ukrainians’ probe for an Oval Office welcome for Ukraine’s new president - with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney.</p>
      <p>Fiona Hill said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> later told her that “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up” and asked her to relay that message to a White House lawyer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a letter from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a>’s attorney to the top lawyer for the House alleges that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> was “part of many relevant meetings and conversations” pertaining to the House impeachment inquiry of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> that are not yet public.</p>
      <p>The attorney, Charles Cooper, suggests <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> will appear before Congress only if a judge orders him to do so.</p>

        <p>Appointed in April 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s third national security adviser and is known for advocating military action abroad, a viewpoint <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> has resisted. In a speech in late September to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, given after he left the administration, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> offered a far more aggressive approach to North Korea’s nuclear program than the one advocated by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>, who has spoken warmly about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>
        <p>“Every day that goes by makes North Korea a more dangerous country,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-r-bolton/">Bolton</a> said. “You don’t like their behavior today, what do you think it will be when they have nuclear weapons that can be delivered to American cities?”</p>
