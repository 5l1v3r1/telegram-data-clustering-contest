      <p>Selena Gomez surprised many in the music industry (and outside of it) by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/04/selena-gomez-hits-no-1-for-the-first-time-with-new-single-lose-you-to-love-me/">landing a No. 1 smash with a song</a> that hadn’t previously appeared inside the top 10. That’s a fairly rare sight, and something she had never accomplished before. Her new release is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/05/kanye-west-and-lizzo-score-new-top-10-hits-while-selena-gomez-dominates/">one of three titles</a> that find their way into the uppermost area for the first time, mixing things up...but not kicking out one of 2019’s most beloved tracks.Here’s a look at five of the most important moves on this week’s Hot 100 singles chart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 1 - Selena Gomez - “Lose You to Love Me”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, Selena Gomez’s “Lose You to Love Me” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/02/bts-selena-gomez-jonas-brothers-and-frank-ocean-5-important-moves-on-this-weeks-hot-100/">debuted at No. 15 on the Hot 100</a>, and this frame it rockets straight to No. 1, giving the pop singer her first chart-topper. As that tune rules the roost in just its second frame on the tally, another song released just one day after the first titled "Look at Her Now" debuts at No. 27. That track, assumed to be another single from the star’s upcoming album (though perhaps it’s just a promotional cut), is Gomez’s twenty-third top 40 hit.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 6 - Lizzo - “Good as Hell”</b>
      </p>
      <p>As her recent chart champion “Truth Hurts” begins what could be a slow descent on the Hot 100, Lizzo collects a second top 10 with “Good as Hell,” which jumps into the highest tier on the tally thanks to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/10/28/can-ariana-grande-help-lizzo-score-another-top-10-hit/">a new version that features vocals by Ariana Grande</a>. </p>
      <p>“Good as Hell” is currently up to No. 6, though Grande isn’t credited alongside the original artist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 7 - Kanye West - “Follow God”</b>
      </p>
      <p>As his new album <i>Jesus Is King</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/03/kanye-west-charts-his-ninth-no-1-with-religious-new-album-jesus-is-king/">launches atop the Billboard 200</a>, giving him his ninth consecutive leader, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/07/kanye-west-charts-his-entire-new-album-on-the-hot-100/">every song featured on the project appears on the Hot 100</a>, making Kanye West one of only a few musicians who have managed that incredible show of popularity more than once. </p>
      <p>Leading the way among the rapper’s new placements is “Follow God,” which starts its time on the list at No. 7. Thanks to the immediate success of the songs from <i>Jesus Is King</i>, West is now one of only seven artists who have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/06/kanye-west-makes-history-as-the-latest-musician-to-chart-100-hot-100-hits/">racked up triple digit Hot 100 appearances</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 10 - Billie Eilish - “Bad Guy”</b>
      </p>
      <p>It may only have ruled the Hot 100 for a single frame earlier this year, but Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” has spent an astounding amount of time close to the top. The alternative track has now <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/05/billie-eilishs-bad-guy-is-tied-as-the-fourth-longest-running-top-10-hit-ever/">lived inside the top 10 for 30 weeks</a>, a lengthy stay fewer than 10 songs have mustered...and it might not be done yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 44 - Michael Jackson - “Thriller”</b>
      </p>
      <p>As things got spooky and Americans celebrated Halloween, millions of people pressed play or chose to purchase Michael Jackson’s classic single “Thriller,” which has become one of the most successful tunes centered around that specific holiday. The tune, which now regularly returns to the Hot 100 when October closes, reappears on this week’s chart at No. 44, and it will probably be gone next time around.</p>
