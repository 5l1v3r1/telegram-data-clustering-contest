      <p>I just finished clearing out <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/05/a-warning-about-destiny-2-iron-banner-pinnacle-drops-before-you-play-today/#405d17a2657f">most of my Iron Banner bounties</a> across my characters this week, except for the one that’s impossible because it takes 20x longer than the others (skill kills!). I already did all the armor quests last time, meaning I could get a bunch of random drops of armor this time around, and yet again, I found a number of 60+ stat offerings, including a 63, which ties my old record for a legendary.This has reminded me just how odd the current stat rolls system is in the game. Namely that there are essentially only two tiers of stats rolls in the game. Good, and garbage, and the good list is very, very short.</p>
      <p>From my (extensive) playtime in the Shadowkeep era, it seems clear to me that pretty much all legendary drops from nearly every activity drop in the 45-55 total stat range, with <i>maybe</i> a few inching higher with like a 58 or so. That is a <i>huge</i> number of sets, probably 95% of all available sets in the game, which do not seem to even have a <i>chance</i> at rolling above a 60.</p>
      <p>What can?</p>
      <p>Raid armor, though you can’t run raids infinitely to farm for armor due to the per week limits.</p>
      <p>Iron Banner armor, which is probably the best 60+ stat farm in the game given how much you can get in a given week when playing, though Iron Banner may only be around for 3 weeks out of a 3 month season.</p>
      <p>Exotics, which can actually get as high as 68 or 69, but only through random drops. Xur sells sub 50 exotic every week that mirror the trash you extract from collections. The only place you can really farm exotics is through random world drops or Master Nightfalls. And half the time you’ll get duplicate weapons which are pointless.</p>

      <p>So what we have is just a…really weird system. The best armor sets on all my characters are my Iron Banner sets, because I’ve gotten enough drops on there where I have low 60s rolls on almost every slot on every character. But it’s <i>literally impossible</i> to get rolls that high on pretty much every other set of gear past an extremely lucky raid set, so if I pick anything else, I’m doing it because of style points, but really for no other reason.</p>
      <p>This is all outside of the elemental affinity system, which I’ve already talked about extensively, but I think the rolls thing is a problem too. What’s the point of re-running Escalation Protocol for five weeks if I know every drop is going to be 10 stat points under my best gear in that slot? What’s the point of any other drop outside of these select few sets, really?</p>
      <p>What’s persistently weird about this is that it doesn’t matter <i>where</i> you get the gear from, only <i>what</i> the gear is. You might think that pinnacle drops would have a higher chance at getting better stat rolls. I have not seen that to be true. I have seen fully masterworked armor drops from the end of the dungeon be the Dreambane set with 51 stat points. And I have gotten some random IB armor from token turn-in that is a 63. Pinnacle drops have no impact on making the stat values better on armor from what I can tell.</p>

      <p>In short, I think every set of armor needs to at least have a <i>chance</i> to get high rolls, and certainly more so than what we’re seeing now. It seems goofy that I can grind out IB and have 50% of my drops be 5+ points higher than the highest drop I have across 95% of my other sets. Maybe it’s more rare for world drop or vanguard or gambit or whatever sets to have high rolls, but it’s not literally impossible.</p>
      <p>I also think the current system necessitates more exotic armor drops, because I shouldn’t play for 150 hours and see like, four total exotic armor drops. If they’re going to have these big rolls and affinity issues, we need to see more drops from them in general in order to get what we want. Collections and Xur are utterly useless in this regard as they’re given garbage rolls on purpose.</p>
      <p>I like the addition of armor stats overall in armor 2.0. But the current system favors literally only two activities more than anything else you can do in the game, making 95% of sets inferior to IB and raid gear, and even most pinnacle drops. Something is off, and needs to change.</p>
