      <p><i>Death Stranding</i> is officially out so you can play the divisive Kojima game for yourself at long last. It’s either a perfect metaphor for our time that deserves a 10/10 or a horrific slog that people can’t bring themselves to put more than a few hours into, depending on who you ask.I have no opinions, because I have not played it, and will probably not play it because I have never been a big Kojima guy and I have to play things like Google Stadia and <i>Jedi Fallen Order</i> this coming week. But if you <i>are</i> a big Kojima fan, Sony has a free gift for you if you want to claim it in a hurry.</p>
      <p>Sony is offering free “BB” avatars for your PS4 PSN profile that you can redeem through this code:</p>
      <p>47XM-C3N8-GTFN</p>
      <p>For some reason, these expire tomorrow, November 10, so you literally only have the rest of today to claim them.</p>
      <p>They feature the “BB” baby in the tank which detects evil or something (again, I haven’t played it) in a few different poses including being scared and giving a thumbs up. There are actually six of these in total, but four of them <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1192827232319705088">are exclusive to Japan PSN</a> and their code will not work in the US. If for some reason you are in Japan reading this, that code is:</p>
      <p>N3JM-BLNN-H6HR</p>
      <p>How many of you westerners just tried that code anyway? Be honest. If it worked somehow let me know, but it’s really not supposed to.</p>

      <p>I have not changed my PSN avatar in several years, as it remains Geralt from <i>The Witcher</i> and before that was Ezio from <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> for many years before that. Every game that comes out should arrive with at least a few avatars, but that never happens, and the PSN avatar “store” is kind of a mess and full of a lot of utter garbage. But these BB ones are cute, so if you do think it’s time to freshen up your avatar, here you go.</p>
      <p>I may play <i>Death Stranding</i> someday so I can figure out why exactly you need to carry a bottle baby around the country, but for now, I am content to be ignorant and let everyone else have their fun. Happy trails.</p>
