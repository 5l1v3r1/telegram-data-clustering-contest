      <p>LONDON, Nov 9 — All 39 bodies found in a refrigerated truck outside London last month have now been identified as citizens of Vietnam, British police and Vietnamese officials said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Vietnamese embassy in London said it was “in deep sorrow” over the confirmation that the 31 men and eight women discovered dead in the back of a truck on October 23 were from the south-east Asian country.</p>
      <p>“Once again, we would like to convey our profound condolences and sympathy to the bereaved families,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It added that its staff and a Vietnamese government delegation would “provide consular protection and support for the bereaved families in order to bring their loved ones home at the earliest time”.</p>
      <p>Essex Police, the local force investigating the gruesome discovery, confirmed that the victims’ families had been informed, without making further comment.</p>
      <p>The victims were found in the early hours of October 23 on a truck that had entered Britain on a ferry from Belgium.</p>
      <p>Essex Police had initially said the victims were believed to be Chinese nationals, until several Vietnamese families came forward to say they feared their relatives were on board.</p>
      <p>Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security also confirmed Thursday that all 39 were from the country, noting they hailed from six provinces.</p>
      <p>Police in Britain have charged the 25-year-old driver of the refrigerated lorry, from Northern Ireland, with manslaughter, money laundering and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>They are also in the process of extraditing another suspect from Ireland and searching for others potentially involved.</p>
      <p>Vietnam has held 11 people in connection with the deaths for helping people travel abroad with the intention of staying overseas illegally. None have been formally charged. — AFP</p>
