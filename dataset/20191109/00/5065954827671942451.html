      <p>LOS ANGELES—The National Basketball Association (NBA) fined the Los Angeles Clippers $50,000 on Thursday for statements made by Coach Doc Rivers and others that were “inconsistent” about Kawhi Leonard’s health status.</p>
      <p>Leonard sat out the Clippers’ 129-124 home loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night, the second time he’s missed the nationally televised front end of a back-to-back this season. He was in the lineup against Portland on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>The NBA initially confirmed the Clippers were compliant with league rules in deciding to rest Leonard because of a knee injury. It was what Rivers said before the game that triggered the fine.</p>
      <p>“He feels great,” Rivers said Wednesday. “But he feels great because of what we’ve been doing, and we’re just going to continue to do it. There’s no concern here.”</p>
      <p>Rivers cited “a lot of minutes” that Leonard racked up last season while leading Toronto to its first NBA championship.</p>
      <p>“I think Kawhi made a statement that he’s never felt better,” Rivers said. “It’s our job to make sure he stays that way.”</p>
      <p>Less than 24 hours later, the NBA fined the Clippers for statements, including those by Rivers, that were inconsistent with Leonard’s health while also detailing his knee injury. At the same time, the league reaffirmed the team was in line with NBA rules in sitting Leonard.</p>
      <p>“The team has reasonably determined that Leonard is suffering from an ongoing injury to the patella tendon in his left knee and has been placed by the team at this time on an injury protocol for back-to-back games,” the league’s statement said.</p>
      <p>Rivers indicated he was disappointed by the fine.</p>
      <p>“I think we said it all,” he said Thursday. “I’m not getting into it. What we said, we said.”</p>
      <p>Thursday’s game was also set to be broadcast nationally.</p>
      <p>Leonard is averaging career highs in points (29.3), rebounds (7.3), assists (5.7), steals (2.3) and blocks (1.0). He’s averaging 30.5 minutes.</p>
      <p>Lou Williams, meanwhile, made a go-ahead jumper with 58 seconds left, then added a three-pointer and finished with 26 points to lift the Clippers over the Portland Trail Blazers, 107-101, on Thursday night for Rivers’ 900th career victory.</p>
      <p>Leonard had 27 points, 13 rebounds and six turnovers after missing a nationally televised loss to Milwaukee the previous night as part of load management for his knee.</p>
      <p>Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum led Portland with 22 points apiece, but both got blanked in the fourth quarter of the Blazers’ third straight loss.</p>
      <p>That’s when Anfernee Simons scored 16 of his 17 points, including Portland’s first 12.</p>
      <p>Leonard sealed the win with four straight free throws as fans chanted “MVP! MVP!”</p>
      <p>The Clippers rallied from eight points down early in the fourth, taking their first lead on Leonard’s basket.</p>
      <p>The Blazers tied it 98-all on a three-point play by Hassan Whiteside.</p>
      <p>Williams’ jumper put the Clippers ahead for good and he followed it up with a 3.</p>
      <p>Rivers became the 13th coach in NBA history to reach 900 wins. Los Angeles improved to 5-1 at home.</p>
