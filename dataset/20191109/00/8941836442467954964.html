      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - After four decades as a college coach, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">John Beilein</a> is eight games into his first NBA season with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, and on Friday night, he recorded his first win on the road.</p>
      <p>Tristan Thompson had 21 points and 12 rebounds, Kevin Love added 16 points and 12 boards, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Washington Wizards</a> 113-100 to end a three-game skid.</p>
      <p>Seven <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> scored at least 10 points as Cleveland improved to 3-5.</p>
      <p>“It’s always great to get a road win,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> said. “I don’t care what type of team you have. They guys needed it. When you win somewhere else, it’s always special.”</p>
      <p>Thomas Bryant led Washington with 23 points. Rui Hachimura scored 21 and Bradley Beal had 20 while the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> fell to 2-6.</p>

      <p>“We didn’t defend,” Beal said. “That’s what happened.”</p>
      <p>Collin Sexton also had 16 points for Cleveland, and rookies Darius Garland and Kevin Porter Jr. had career highs with 15 and 13, respectively.</p>
      <p>Cleveland led throughout and used an 11-0 run to take a 41-28 lead with 9:19 remaining in the second quarter. The lead grew to 20, but thanks to Hachimura’s 15 points on 7 for 7 from the field, Washington cut the lead to 67-52 at the half.</p>
      <p>Cleveland’s 10-0 run put them ahead 77-56 early in the third, but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> outscored them 28-11 and trailed by just 88-84 entering the fourth quarter</p>

        <p>Washington closed to 91-90 on Moe Wagner’s layup with 9:39 to play, but Cleveland outscored Washington 22-10 the rest of the way. Thompson had three key baskets in the last two minutes.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a> coach Scott Brooks, who was assessed a technical foul for the second straight game, felt the key to the game was Cleveland’s attempting 29 free throws to Washington’s six.</p>
        <p>“It’s hard to overcome,” Brooks said.</p>
        <p>Brooks wouldn’t explicitly criticize the officiating.</p>
        <p>“Every time I’ve complained, they say they have the call right,” Brooks said.</p>
        <p>TIP INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a>: G Jordan Clarkson was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter, but Beal missed the free throw.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/washington-wizards/">Wizards</a>: F Troy Brown started for the first time this season. He scored three points in 19 minutes. Isaac Bonga started the first seven games of the season but didn’t play Friday. … G Justin Robinson and F Admiral Schofield were recalled from the G League. … Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo was introduced to the crowd and got an ovation nine days after his team won the World Series.</p>
        <p>BACK TO SCHOOL</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> coached Wagner at Michigan. Wagner, who played for the Los Angeles Lakers last season, said it was “weird” playing against his college coach.</p>
        <p>“Moe is special to me,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> said. “There’s no doubt about it. It’s hard to play against him. I hoped he missed every shot tonight. The other games are fine.”</p>
        <p>Wagner had eight points and committed four fouls in 14 minutes.</p>
        <p>“I hope I get another chance to go against him,” Wagner said.</p>
