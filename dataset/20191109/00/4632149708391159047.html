      <p><b><u>Aatish Taseer’s OCI status revoked<br/></u><br/>Shashi Tharoor, Arundhati Roy, Amitav Ghosh, Ramchandra Guha, others come out in support of British-born writer<br/><br/>NEW DELHI</b> Arundhati Roy and Jeet Thayil were among the host of writers and academics who came forward on Friday to back their British-born colleague Aatish Ali Taseer after the Indian government’s decision to revoke his Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status. <br/><br/>Taseer, the son of Indian journalist Tavleen Singh and the late Pakistani politician Salman Taseer, has become ineligible for an OCI card as it is not issued to any person whose parents or grandparents are Pakistanis and he hid this fact, a Union Home Ministry spokesperson has said. <br/><br/>The move had the literary world abuzz, both on social media and outside. While writer-activist Roy termed the move “outrageous and dangerous”, poet Thayil called it “a vindictive and unfortunate tactic”. Politicianauthor Shashi Tharoor took a dig at the Indian government asking if it was “so weak that it feels threatened by a journalist”. <br/><br/>The decision comes seven months after Taseer wrote an article titled ‘Divider-in-Chief’ in TIME magazine on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. <br/><br/>Responding to the MHA spokesperson, the writer shared screenshots of an email interaction with the deputy consul general of India, and said he was barely given 24 hours to respond instead of the customary 21days.</p>
      <p>It is painful to see an official spokesperson of our government making a false claim... Is our Govt so weak that it feels threatened by a journalist?”</p>
      <p>Shashi Tharoor, Author-Politician<br/><br/><br/>Expressing his solidarity for the ‘The Temple-Goers’ author, awardwinning US-based writer Amitav Ghosh retweeted a post by Ashok Swain, a professor of international studies at Sweden's Uppasal University that said, “You write against Modi, you cease to be an Indian!” Historian and writer Ramchandra Guha was also critical of the government’s move. <br/><br/>When BJP’s foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale attacked Taseer and his mother, calling the former a “rabid islamist”, Guha tweeted in support of the author. <br/><br/>“A person who thinks that @AatishTaseer is a 'rabid Islamist' either (a) cannot read; (b) has not read a single word that Aatish Taseer has written; (c) believes that only a ‘rabid Islamist’ could ever be critical in any way of anything that Narendra Modi says or does,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The govt is using this threat as well as the threat of denying visas to foreign correspondents... independent scholars and journalists</p>
      <p>Arundhati Roy, Author<br/><br/>Writer and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik also came out in Taseer's support with a couple of sarcastic tweets. “I hope all Bharat Mata Tyagis who gave up Indian passport for $$$$ have documents to prove their fathers were Indians ....nahi to OCI chala jayega .... BMKJ,” wrote. <br/><br/>Journalist-writer Manu Joseph tweeted, “This is very silly of chowkidars most of whom will actually enjoy @AatishTaseer’s ‘The Twice-Born’, particularly the part where he suggests even the poor may have started searching for their Hindu identity.”</p>
