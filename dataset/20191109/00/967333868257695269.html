        <b>The Russian lightweight Ultimate fighting championship (UFC) fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov, 31, has reportedly hinted at a possible return to the professional octagon next spring, revealing that he is currently in talks with UFC representatives.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The sports organization must apologize and reimburse hundreds of thousands of dollars before a possible fight on the US soil, according to Nurmagomedov, cited by Russian-based media outlets.</p>
      <blockquote>"I can fight in April in New York or Las Vegas. But then, one <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201911081077258844-khabib-nurmagomedov-holds-press-conference-ahead-of-ufc-fight-night-163---video/">must bring me apologies</a> and return almost half of a million-dollar back", the Russian athlete said, adding that he was "unfairly fined" after a brawl at the UFC 229 tournament in Las Vegas last year.</blockquote>
      <p>The Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) disqualified Russian MMA fighter Nurmagomedov and his opponent, Ireland's Conor McGregor, for a brawl after their 6 October 2018 fight.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909181076831938-peta-attacks-khabib-nurmagomedov-for-sharing-video-of-his-fights-with-bear---video/">defeated McGregor</a> in the main event of the UFC 229 tournament, defending his UFC lightweight championship. Immediately after the end of the fight, the Russian athlete engaged in a verbal altercation, allegedly provoked by a member of McGregor's team, and then jumped over the fence into the fans, prompting a brief brawl.</p>
      <p>According to the commission's decision, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201904041073809878-nurmagomedov-hits-back-mcgregor-rapist/">McGregor was disqualified</a> for six months and fined $50,000, while Nurmagomedov faced a nine-month disqualification and a $500,000 fine.</p>
