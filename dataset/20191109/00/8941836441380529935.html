      <p>PETAL, Miss. (AP) - A probation officer for the Mississippi Department of Corrections has been arrested on one count of child pornography.</p>
      <p>Officials say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-knight/">Jeff Knight</a> turned himself in at the Petal Police Department on Thursday.</p>
      <p>WDAM-TV reports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-knight/">Knight</a>’s initial appearance in Petal Municipal Court was on Friday, where his bond was set at $100,000.
