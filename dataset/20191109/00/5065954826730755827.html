      <p>THE rich colonial past of the Philippines makes it an ideal destination for World War II veterans and their families, as well as history buffs.</p>
      <p>“We have been helping promote our war memorials and historical shrines to special interest groups,” said Undersecretary for Tourism Development Benito C. Bengzon Jr. of the Department of Tourism (DOT) in an interview with the BusinessMirror.</p>
      <p>Battlefield or war tourism, which involves visits to war memorials and similar historical sites,  is a segment of heritage tourism. Several research studies indicate the value of heritage tourism at over $1 billion, with the Asia-Pacific region accounting for $327 million, said researcher Carolyn Childs in her paper, “How Culture and Heritage Tourism Boosts More Than A Visitor Economy.”</p>

        <figcaption>Experiencing Philippine history and seeing the battle ground of Filipino veterans during World War II is now more compelling and exciting at the Mount Samat Shrine of Valor in Bataan with the introduction of the augmented reality technology in its Underground Museum. By scanning museum QR codes using Eastmart tablets and phones installed with AR mobile app, tourists can view animations and short videos excerpts from the World War II studies. The Eastmart tablets can be rented by tourists before they enter the museum.</figcaption>

      <p>Aside from the Philippines, countries in Asia-Pacific which attract battlefield tourists include Hawaii (Pearl Harbor), Vietnam (Vietnam War), Japan (Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings), Guam and Saipan, among others. There are no exact data on how many tourists primarily visit these World War II-era historical sites.</p>
      <p>“There are a number of Japanese travel agencies that specialize in such packages and regularly bring in tour groups to these destinations [in the Philippines],” said Bengzon.</p>
      <p>Locally, tour operators providing historical/memorial tours include Friendship Tours and Resorts Corp., Baron Travel Corp., and Attic Tours Philippines Inc.</p>
      <p>From November 9 to 15, for instance, Friendship Tours will be bringing a group of elderly Japanese on the Nihon Izoku-kai Memorial Tour. The group will be going to Clark, Laguna, Pampanga, Cebu, Leyte, Baguio and Iloilo to pay homage to their loved ones who died during World War II. Nihon Izoku-kai  is the Bereaved Family Association of Japan, and represents the interests of relatives of Japanese veterans of World War II.</p>
      <p>“As the World War II veterans market is dwindling, we have had to expand the target market base to include their relatives and friends, and history buffs,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>In 2018, some 200 Japanese visitors arrived in the Philippines for these memorial tours. “Many of them are descendants of Japanese soldiers,” said the tourism official. “The tours are usually very solemn in nature, and heart-warming, with surviving relatives often performing prayer rites on the actual sites where their loved ones are believed to have perished,” Bengzon noted.</p>
      <p>Aside from Japanese veterans, soldiers who had served in the United States and Australian military during World War II have been coming to the Philippines as well to visit historical sites, shrines and war markers.</p>
      <p>Most recently they visited the newly inaugurated Battle of Surigao Strait Memorial and Museum in Surigao City, which was unveiled during the 75th commemoration of the battle. The battle has been described as the US Navy’s greatest single triumph in its history.</p>
      <p>The historical landmark, perched on a ridge with a breathtaking view of Surigao Strait in Punta Bilar, Surigao City, will serve as a major tourist attraction, as well as a special educational destination for the younger generations, said Tourism Assistant Secretary for Minda­nao Myra Paz V. Abubakar.</p>
      <p>“The erection of the Battle of Surigao Strait Memorial and Museum will certainly serve as a beacon to the world to come get a glimpse of the acclaimed greatest sea battle of all time and now a monumental symbol of peace, a truly meaningful tour experience for visitors,” she said in a news statement.</p>
      <p>The Battle of Surigao Strait is noted for its distinct place in world history as the US naval forces, including ships from the Royal Australian Navy, helped sink Japanese battle ships, paving the way for Gen. Douglas MacArthur and American forces to retake the Philippines by landing in Leyte. The strait, now a protected area, serves as a watery grave for the  Japanese battleships <i>Yamashiro</i> and <i>Fuso</i>.</p>
      <p>In solemn ceremonies, dignitaries and veterans from the US, Australia, Japan and Manila joined local officials and residents in renewing their commitment to world peace.</p>
      <p>World War II veterans retired Rear Admiral Guy Griffiths and David Mattiske, both 94, from Australia, were recognized during the ceremonies organized by Surigao City Mayor Ernesto Matugas Jr. It was the fifth time Mattiske’s group visited the Philippines to attend the annual rites in Surigao City and Palo, Leyte.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to returning to the Philippines with a bigger group and visit the Battle of Surigao Strait Memorial to pay homage to over 4,000 fallen soldiers, mostly Japanese. It is our prayer that there would never be another world war,” said Mattiske.</p>
      <p>For his part, US Embassy Naval Attaché Col. Brian J. Clark, Commander of the US Navy, said, “The greatest battles in this region serve as the tapestry of naval service. The events that took place in the pristine waters of Surigao Strait remain as relevant as ever as the partnership of nations must face the challenges of keeping open lines of navigation for international trade and uphold the rule of law of the sea.”</p>
      <p>Other dignitaries who attended the battle’s anniversary were Cmdr. Michinori Fukuda, Assistant Defense Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, and Australia’s Ambassador to the Philippines Steven Robinson.</p>
      <p>The DOT is beefing up a number of historical sites such as Corregidor Island, Mount Samat Shrine of Valor, and Intramuros in Manila in a bid to attract more visitors from abroad.</p>
      <p>Its attached agency, the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (Tieza), for one, is eyeing the development of Corregidor Island as a flagship tourism enterprise zone (TEZ). “Tieza shall be responsible for the development of the island’s potential as an international and local tourist destination, as well as the maintenance and preservation of war relics on the island,” said the agency in a news statement.</p>
      <p>The 546-hectare island is under the management of the Corregidor Foundation Inc., an agency under the Department of National Defense, but its Board of Trustees includes the DOT Secretary and the Tieza COO.</p>
      <p>The Mount Samat Shrine of Valor in Pilar, Bataan, was erected in memory of Filipino and American soldiers who fought in World War II.</p>
      <p>Corregidor Island, located 48 km from Manila, played a crucial role during the invasion, and later liberation, of the Philippines from the Japanese military forces. Its ruins serve as a memorial to the Filipino, American and Japanese soldiers who lost their lives during World War II.</p>
      <p>Tieza will also be introducing an augmented reality (AR) app for the Mount Samat Shrine of Valor by next year, changing the historical tour experience at the site by making the exhibits interactive, and allowing maximum involvement of the visitors.</p>
      <p>The AR system is being developed by Tieza’s Mount Samat Flagship Tourism Enterprise Zone in partnership with the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office and technology-based solution company Eastmart Reality Innovators.</p>
      <p>“The introduction of the 3D Augmented Reality feature in the Underground Museum made Mount Samat the first historical site and war museum in the country with the AR technology,” said Mount Samat FTEZ Administrator Francis Theodore B. Initorio in a news statement.</p>
