      <p><i>One blackmailed PU student for video. Others harassed father for money</i> <br/><br/>Four of the five students accused in the nude video blackmail case have been released on bail by the High Court. The investigation by the Konanakunte <br/>Police Station revealed the blackmail of a PU student by the five boys seeking nude videos from her and then demanding a ransom from her. <br/><br/>The five students were booked under the Indian Penal Code, POCSO and the Information Technology Act. The victim was a I PU student and the first accused who was in love with her used to stalk her. When the girl was speaking to another boy, he took photographs of the two and threatened to show it to her father. <br/><br/>Using the photograph, he threatened to spread rumours about her and the boy. He demanded that she send him her nude videos if she wanted the photographs with the other boy deleted. The girl sent him her nude videos which he shared with four of his friends. One of the other four boys demanded Rs 4 lakh from the father of the victim, Rs 1 lakh for each of them, for deleting the video. <br/><br/>The HC granted bail to the four accused as it felt that the allegation that the girl sent the nude video to get another photo deleted had to be decided during trial. “On perusal of the allegation it could be seen that when accused had no photograph or video graph of the complainant, except the photograph in which she was talking with one, whether at this stage, it could be believed that for the purpose of deleting the said photograph she could have sent the nude photo or nude video to accused No .1 and on the basis of that the accused persons have demanded Rs 1 Lakh each from the father of the complainant,” the court noted. <br/><br/>In the case of the third accused, the court said, “The said aspect has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before the Trial Court during the course of full-dressed trial. Similar allegations were made against other accused persons who are already released on bail. Therefore, on facts and also on the ground of parity, the petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on bail.” <br/><br/>The accused were released on bail on a personal bond or Rs 1 lakh with one surety for the like sum and on conditions of not tampering with evidence or witnesses. The accused cannot leave the jurisdiction of the court without permission of the court till the case was disposed.</p>
