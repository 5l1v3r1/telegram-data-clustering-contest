      <p><b>Five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court , headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, will pronounce verdict in the title dispute case at 10.30 am<br/><br/>NEW DELHI</b> The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce its verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case in Ayodhya, at 10.30 am today. <br/><br/>Anotice regarding the pronouncement of judgement by a Constitution bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, was uploaded on the official website of the Supreme Court on Friday evening. Other members of the bench are Justices S A Bobde, D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer. <br/><br/>Hours before the notice, the CJI held a meeting with Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari and DGP Om Prakash Singh who apprised him about the security arrangements made to maintain law and order in the state. <br/><br/>Fourteen appeals have been filed in the apex court against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgment, delivered in four civil suits, that the 2.77-acre land in Ayodhya be partitioned equally among the three parties - the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla. <br/><br/>Initially, as many as five lawsuits were filed in the lower court. The first one was filed by Gopal Singh Visharad, adevotee of 'Ram Lalla', in 1950 to seek enforcement of the right to worship of Hindus at the disputed site. <br/><br/>In the same year, the Paramahansa Ramachandra Das had also filed the lawsuit for continuation of worship and keeping the idols under the central dome of the now-demolished disputed structure.The plea was later withdrawn. <br/><br/>Later, the Nirmohi Akahara also moved the trial court in 1959 seeking management and ‘shebaiti’ (devotee) rights over the 2.77 acre disputed land. <br/><br/>Then came the lawsuit of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board which moved the court in 1961, claiming title right over the property. <br/><br/>The deity, ‘Ram Lalla Virajman’, through next friend and former Allahabad High Court judge Deoki Nandan Agrawal, and the Janmbhoomi (the birthplace) moved the lawsuit in 1989, seeking title right over the entire disputed property on the key ground that the land itself has the character of the deity and of a ‘Juristic entity’. <br/><br/>Later, all the lawsuits were transferred to the Allahabad High Court for adjudication following the demolition of the structure on December 6, 1992, sparking communal riots in the country.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya will not be a matter of victory or loss for anyone. I appeal to countrymen that it should be our priority to strengthen our tradition of maintaining peace and harmony after Ayodhya verdict</p>
      <p>-PM Narendra Modi<br/><br/><br/><b><u>Security measures<br/></u></b><br/>► All educational institutions in Uttar Pradesh to remain closed from Saturday to Monday as precautionary measure <br/><br/>► Sixty companies (90-125 personnel each) of the PAC and paramilitary forces deployed in Ayodhya <br/><br/><br/>► Six companies of State Reserve Police Force have been deployed in Vadodara in Gujarat</p>
