      <p>Luis Suarez has made a shock return to FC Barcelona’s first team squad and has been deemed fit to face Celta Vigo at the Camp Nou on Saturday. The Uruguayan was originally believed to be out for a period of up to three weeks when coming off with a knock in the first half of Barça’s 3-1 defeat to Levante last weekend. In light of the Blaugrana’s need to make a statement and keep their lead in La Liga prior to the international break however, El Pistolero has been rushed back into action by under-fire coach Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>It is unknown whether he will start, or the same trio of Antoine Griezmann, Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembélé from left to right - which slumped to a miserable 0-0 draw in the Champions League with Slavia Prague midweek - will be put out. In any event. Griezmann has fired nine goals past Celta over the course of his career, and MARCA believes their meeting at 15.00 ET could be the ‘perfect tonic’ for him to convince fans, plus Suarez and Messi, of his worth.</p>
      <p>Seventeen-year-old wonderkid Ansu Fati, who Valverde currently sees ‘better at entering when the game has already started than at the beginning’ is likely to warm the bench.</p>
      <p>Brazilian Arthur is destined for a return to the first XI however, and form part of a three-man midfield completed by regular partner Frenkie de Jong and Sergio Busquets.</p>
      <p>On the back line, Jordi Alba is crocked again. Whereas before Valverde had opted to put Nelson Semedo at left back, though, he will this time confide in Junior Firpo while the Portuguese assumes his usual right-back spot. In the centre, Gerard Pique and Clement Lenglet will try to help Marc-Andre Ter Stegen keep his second consecutive clean sheet.</p>
      <p>At his press conferece on Friday, Valverde stressed the importance of ‘keeping the pulse’ and getting the three points. In La Liga at least, Barça have reacted well to their three defeats on the road when picking up the pieces at the Camp Nou. In response, they achieved mostly-thumping victories over Real Betis (5-2), Valencia (5-2), Villarreal (2-1), Sevilla (4-0 ) and Valladolid (5-1).</p>
      <p>It is hoped that relegation-threatened Celta Vigo will join this list and that new coach Oscar García will be given a baptism of fire in his new post. Coming into this one, the Galicians have won just two of their 12 league games in 2019/2020 and must contain a figure in Messi that Garcia says is ‘the best footballer I have ever seen’. ‘[He’s] an exceptional player,’ Garcia added, ‘capable of deciding a game at any time.’</p>
      <p>Valverde however, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2019/11/08/fc-barcelonas-ernesto-valverde-on-future-messi-griezmann-and-bad-form-prior-to-celta-vigo-clash/#3f7108476591">expects the opposition to turn a corner</a> soon. ‘They’re in a difficult situation, due to the unexpected,’ he explained. ‘They have fallen. In the last matches they have been hurt by goals at the last minute [like that scored by] Betis. Against Getafe they showed nervousness. Celta have good players and it’s not normal for them to have so few goals with the players they have. It’s a team that will get out of the bottom part of the standings. They have talent and they’ll show it.’</p>
      <p>Booed off last time at home, it is hoped that the Culés will be given something to cheer about on this occasion before a two week pause when FIFA takes over the footballing calendar.</p>
      <p>No pressure from the Catalan media as per usual, SPORT says the pride and joy of their province is ‘prohibited to fail’ here.</p>
