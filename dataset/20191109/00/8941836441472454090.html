      <p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Wesley Dugger ran for 118 yards to become Davidson’s all-time leading rusher and scored two touchdowns as the Wildcats used a big second quarter to roll past Butler 52-10 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Dugger, a junior, increased his career yardage to 3,247 to pass John Leverett (2001-04), who had 3,165. Dugger also rushed for over 100 yards for the 14th time.</p>
      <p>One of Dugger’s touchdowns, an 18-yarder, capped a 33-point second quarter with just over a minute left in the half. He added a 3-yard score in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Three Davidson quarterbacks combined to complete only three of 10 passes but two tosses went for touchdowns, including a 69-yard play from Louis Colosimo to Jayden Waddell. The Wildcats rushed for 458 of their 549 total yards.</p>
      <p>The victory gave Davidson (7-3, 4-2 Pioneer Football League) seven wins for the first time since 2002 and four league victories for the first time since 2007.</p>
