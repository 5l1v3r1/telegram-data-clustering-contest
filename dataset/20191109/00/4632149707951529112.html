      <h1>Friday’s rains caused water logging in many areas. Residents blame choked waterways</h1>

      <p>Heavy rain lashed Bengaluru on Friday morning causing many roads to overflow with rain water. The water-logged roads have once again exposed the apathy and negligence of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) authorities in ensuring tertiary drains free from debris and silt. <br/><br/>The road that connects Maruthinagar, Byrasandra, G M Palya and Malleshpalya, Vignananagar and other areas with Suranjan Das Road turned into a mini water pond thus affecting the movement of vehicles. <br/><br/>“I commute on this road every day and was shocked to see this road full of water. I want the BBMP authorities to drain the water as early as possible to enable smooth vehicular movement,’’ said S Sundareshan, a commuter. <br/><br/>One can see heaps of debris on the tertiary drain blocking water entering into the drain. It is an offence to dump construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste on the road or on the footpath. <br/><br/>“The BBMP authorities have to penalize those dumping C&amp;D waste at vacant places. I don’t remember the last time the silt from the drain was removed. <br/><br/>The authorities have to remove the silt from the drain to facilitate it to carry rain water to the nearest secondary or primary drain,’’ said Jagadeesh R, a resident of G M Palya. <br/><br/>On Friday morning, low-lying areas and roads were full of water at BHEL Layout and Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Nayandahalli. <br/><br/><br/>In 3rd sector, HSR Layout residents were shocked to see rain water overflowing from a manhole that the cover was displaced. “The force of the water was so high that the manhole cover got displaced. Many areas at HSR Layout are prone to flooding,’’ said a resident of HSR Layout 3rd Sector on a condition of anonymity. <br/><br/>Complaints of bad roads seem to be ubiquitous in the city. Residents on 3rd Main of Ashwini Layout have a similar beef with the authorities about the negligence towards the drains. “A few weeks ago, the BBMP assigned a contractor to remove the silt from the drain but nothing has been done to shift the silt from the road. The other problem is the open drain is above the road leading to water stagnation. We have been complaining to the authorities but nothing has been done till date,’’ said Satish, a resident of Ashwini Layout. <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ejipura ward corporator T Ramachandra was not available for comment.</p>
