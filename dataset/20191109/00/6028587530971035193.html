      <h1>‘007: The Daniel Craig Collection’ 4K Blu-ray Review - Licensed To Thrill</h1>

      <p><b>The Films</b>Although he’s not everyone’s cup of Earl Grey, for me Daniel Craig has been a great 007. The gritty, steely, darker shade of Bond he’s brought to the table, together with his proper acting chops, has been pivotal in shifting the franchise in just the right direction to compete with the <i>Bournes</i> and <i>Mission: Impossibles</i> of this world without losing the heart of the Bond character and mythos.</p>
      <p>All four films included in this <i>Daniel Craig</i> 4K Blu-ray collection are strong. Especially <i>Casino Royale</i> and <i>Skyfall</i> (despite the latter’s slightly clumsy climax). Even <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> holds up better to repeat viewings than I’d expected - right up until its last half hour or so, anyway. </p>

      <p>The only things that rankle with Craig’s winning run, especially seeing all four films one right after the other, are the cumbersome attempts to try and give Bond a backstory. Tying Bond to <i>Spectre</i>’s villain, in particular, is a seriously awkward - and unnecessary - stretch. Hopefully the next and final Craig outing as Bond will resist the urge to head much further down the same sort of contrived character road. </p>
      <p>Overall, though, the entertainment value of this four-film package is beyond reproach - especially for die-hard Bond fans. But does the new 4K Blu-ray release also offer plenty for AV fans to sink their teeth into?  </p>

        <b>The Picture</b>
      </p>
      <p>While I’m not quite as ecstatic about the the picture quality of this 4K Blu-ray boxset as many other reviewers seem to be, all four films do enjoy an improvement over their HD Blu-ray releases. </p>
      <p><i>Casino Royale</i> sets the tone by delivering a solid (though I wouldn’t say inspiring) increase in detail and filmic feel over its HD Blu-ray, and adding a mild but pleasing taste of HDR.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc71e4ee0af7b0006b0f893/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>The actual casino sequences in Casino Royale look lovely on 4K Blu-ray.<cite>Casino Royale, Fox/MGM</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Looking more closely at the detail work, the transfer’s bitrates are very up and down, regularly jumping between sub-30Mbps levels to just above 70Mbps. Even the highest rates, however, don’t to me lift the picture out of good and into truly excellent, reference level territory. Though of course, even a ‘good’ 4K Blu-ray detail effort always outguns any HD Blu-ray.</p>
      <p>I was initially a bit disappointed by the fairly muted take on HDR (especially given the gloriously aggressive efforts we’ve seen with other catalogue titles such as <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>Black Hawk Down</i>). I gradually warmed to it, though; its black levels are excellent, and being fairly conservative with the brightness enhancements seems to enable the new master to substantially enrich colors without changing their fundamental tone.</p>
      <p>The combination of rich black levels and enhanced color is particularly effective during the poker game sequences. And the whole transfer benefits greatly from the disc’s Dolby Vision master, which delivers an enhanced dynamic range and colors that look consistently more refined and balanced. If you’re a Bond fan with a 4K Blu-ray player and TV capable of handling Dolby Vision, you can feel pretty happy with yourself right now. </p>
      <p>As well as being welcome from a performance perspective, the presence of the Dolby Vision ‘premium’ dynamic version of HDR on all of the Craig/Bond 4K discs is interesting from an industry politics perspective, as Fox typically prefers the alternative HDR10+ dynamic HDR format.  </p>

        <figcaption>Daniel Craig's Bond is still cool even when he's hanging upside down from a bell rope.<cite>Quantum Of Solace, Fox/MGM</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The <i>Quantum of Solace</i> 4K Blu-ray picture chiefly differs from <i>Casino Royale</i>’s courtesy of its slightly more aggressive HDR. Outdoor scenes look brighter, and inky blacks are now joined by punchier highlights - especially during the film’s many night-time Bolivian exteriors. </p>
      <p>There still isn’t enough sharpness, detail, consistency or HDR aggression to make <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> a reference-level 4K Blu-ray transfer. But it is still the best way there’s probably ever going to be of watching Daniel Craig’s second Bond outing. </p>
      <p>The star of the package in picture quality terms is <i>Skyfall</i>. Unlike the other three films, <i>Skyfall</i> was shot digitally at (chiefly) 2.8K, and granted a 4K Digital Intermediate for its cinema run.  And the advantages of this provenance can instantly be seen in both the picture’s stunningly clean, noiseless finish, and the sometimes exceptional level of detail and depth the 4K image provides over the HD one. </p>
      <p>The HDR grade is mostly pretty sweet, too. Artificial light sources tend to look really punchy (check out the shots of Shanghai at night, for instance). Color work feels much more natural, especially where skin tones are concerned. Director Sam Mendes is quite a fan of fairly muted, dark, dour tones (as established with his excellent <i>Road To Perdition</i>), and the HDR does a great job of enhancing <i>Skyfall</i>’s sometimes very moody look. </p>
      <p>A few sequences - especially dark ones - look a little softer than the film generally does, though. Also, during the final night-time showdown on the Skyfall estate, some of the dark backgrounds (such as the moors as Silva walks towards the chapel, and the background walls of the chapel’s interior) take on a very rough, compressed look. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Gemma Arterton is criminally underused in Quantum Of Solace.<cite>Quantum Of Solace, Fox/MGM</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s possible, I guess, that this is caused by low-light limitations in the digital cameras used to shoot the film rather than some issue with the 4K mastering process. But whatever the cause, the rough finish at the back of these shots stands out like a sore thumb against the quality of the rest of the image. Despite the data rate sometimes peaking as high as 85Mbps during <i>Skyfall</i>’s dark interiors, and regardless of whether you’re using an OLED or LCD TV (I tried it on both), or watching in HDR10 or Dolby Vision.</p>
      <p>While Dolby Vision can’t remove these rare moments of roughness, though, it does make <i>Skyfall</i>’s relentlessly dark climax look much better generally. The scene inside the floating Shanghai casino, too, looks much more dynamic and authentically toned and shaded in Dolby Vision than it does in HDR10.</p>
      <p>Moving straight on to <i>Spectre</i>, despite it joining <i>Skyfall</i> in getting a 4K Digital Intermediate for its cinema release for some reason it consistently looks softer. This is evident right from the opening shot at the Festival of the Dead - a sequence which also wears a slightly over-prominent beige tone. </p>
      <p><i>Skyfall</i> director Mendes returns for <i>Spectre</i>, bringing with him plenty more very dark, moodily lit sequences - which again prove a challenge for the 4K Blu-ray master. The Spectre meeting that Bond infiltrates in Austria, for instance, looks consistently rather murky. </p>
      <p>The HDR work is mild but effective (it’s at its most potent during the scenes in the new CNS building). As with all the releases in this package, though, it’s actually the enhanced, expanded color work that has the most impact, making Bond’s world feel more immediate and Mendes’ direction look more stylish. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>One strange thing about <i>Spectre</i> is that its black levels look a bit washed out at times. Such as where Bond and Madeleine meet Blofeld in the meteor showcase room, and with some shots during Blofeld’s tour of his desert facility. These raised black levels are evident in both the Dolby Vision and HDR10 masters, too - though once again the Dolby Vision master is clearly superior. Especially in this case when it comes to managing the film’s at times quite difficult low-lit skin tones.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Sound</b>
      </p>
      <p>The audio news is mixed here. On the downside, none of the four films get a Dolby Atmos or DTS:X object-based audio mix. The first three films get DTS 5.1 HD mixes, while <i>Spectre</i> steps up to DTS 7.1. </p>
      <p>This really does seem pretty disappointing given that even some much older catalogue titles these days are being released with lovingly recrafted object-based soundtracks. Especially when you’re talking about films as action-packed as the Craig Bond franchise. </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Judi Dench makes a typically powerful mark as 'M' in Skyfall.<cite>Skyfall, MGM/Fox</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Certainly coming to these DTS mixes after hearing so many Dolby Atmos soundtracks recently, I was immediately struck by how flat (in the sense of horizontal) they sound without any height channels. It’s genuinely noticeable, too, how much more the sound effects seem to come from your speakers rather than populating the space between your speakers. </p>
      <p>The good news is that the DTS mixes are nonetheless really good - especially for the three most recent films.  </p>
      <p><i>Casino Royale</i> gets the ball rolling with a powerful, dynamic and lively mix that makes consistent and strong use of all the 5.1 channels available to it. It’s not as detailed sounding as the other three films, though, and while its bass channel certainly has plenty of meat, it feels a little baggy and uncontrolled at times.</p>
      <p><i>Quantum Of Solace</i> tightens up the bass without diminishing its impact, and delivers a generally slightly livelier, more detailed and more dynamic mix.</p>
      <p><i>Skyfall</i> scores pretty similarly to <i>Quantum of Solace</i>. There’s a bit more richness and scale to the soundstage and the strong score is expertly interwoven. But in any case, sounding pretty much on a par with <i>Quantum Of Solace</i> is no bad thing.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc71f7f2c886a0007ebc8ee/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"/>
        <figcaption>Sadly the image of the Festival of the Dead sequence on the Spectre 4K Blu-ray looks both softer and ... [+] beiger (that's a word, right?) than it does in this still.<cite>Spectre, Fox/MGM</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>Spectre</i> is comfortably the best sounding mix of the bunch. Its extra two channels are liberally used and work wonders in building a more immersive and compelling sense of space. Bass continues to impress, hitting extreme depths at times (especially when Blofeld’s desert base blows up), and the mid-range sounds more open and lively.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Extra features</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not going to go in detail through all the features on every disc (they’re listed in the release details early on). Life’s too short and you’d probably be bored senseless. So I’ll just point out a few highlights.</p>
      <p>First, the best extras across the discs are the audio commentary tracks. <i>Casino Royale</i> gets one, by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, while <i>Skyfall</i> gets two, one by Barbara Broccoli/Michael G Wilson/Dennis Gassner, and one particularly good one by Sam Mendes. Note that these commentary tracks are the only features found on the 4K Blu-rays; everything else is found on the Blu-rays you get included with the 4K discs.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><i>Casino Royale</i> gets the best collection of extra features generally, with some deleted scenes and a number of substantial documentaries alongside the commentary. That said, a few features found on <i>Casino Royale</i>’s previous Blu-ray release (which came via Sony, not Fox) have gone missing; notably a selection of filmmaker profiles; a deconstruction of the airport chase sequence; a Bond trivia quiz; a featurette on Bond girls; a featurette and storyboard breakdown of the early freerunning sequence; and in the biggest loss of all, a picture in picture commentary featuring Martin Campbell and Michael G Wilson. </p>
      <p>The hour-long Shooting Bond documentary on the <i>Skyfall</i> Blu-ray is one other highlight worth devoting your time to.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict</b>
      </p>
      <p>Although the picture quality across this package is a little inconsistent, all four films look better - sometimes much better - than they’ve ever looked before. Similarly, while it’s a pity MGM/Fox haven’t bothered sourcing Dolby Atmos soundtracks for any of the films, the mixture of DTS 5.1 and DTS 7.1 mixes provided are all actually very good. </p>
      <p>Add in the fact that the package can be bought for what works out at only a fraction over $10 a movie, and there are plenty of reasons for Bond fans to take the plunge. Unless you want to hold out for the five-film boxset that will likely emerge once 2020’s <i>No Time To Die</i> has finished its cinema run, of course.</p>
