      <p>The leading planner behind the revitalization of Calgary’s East Village and a key player in redevelopment plans for the Victoria Park area is leaving his post for a new role in the private sector.</p>
      <p>Michael Brown, the president and CEO of the Calgary Municipal Land Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the City of Calgary, will depart in January to become president of Calgary home builder Trico Homes.</p>
      <p>Brown, who has headed CMLC since 2011, was the driving force behind many of the projects that have stemmed from the city’s East Village Master Plan. During his tenure, the neighbourhood has seen the rise of new residential condo towers as well as the completion of the new Central Library and the National Music Centre.</p>
      <p>More recently, Brown has also led CMLC’s planning and development work related to the city’s <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/braid-council-must-not-torpedo-the-visionary-rivers-plan">Rivers District Master Plan,</a> a revitalization plan for the Victoria Park area that includes a new $550-million arena and the $500-million expansion of the BMO Centre.</p>
      <p>Coun. Jeff Davison, chair of the city’s event centre committee, said Brown was “instrumental” in the work that has been done on both those mega-projects thus far. However, he said Brown’s departure will not impede progress.</p>

      <p>“We’re really moving now with the Rivers District from more of a strategic place to more of an execution of that strategy. We’re moving into build phase,” Davison said. “So I think now is the right time, if he was looking to move, to hand that over and let that take place.”</p>
      <p>Coun. Druh Farrell, whose ward encompasses the East Village, said one of Brown’s biggest legacies will be the “kindness and heart” that CMLC incorporated into development planning under his guidance.</p>
      <p>“East Village had the lowest median average income in the city at the time, but CMLC took it to heart that their responsibility was not just to put in new condos, but to ensure existing residents felt welcome and a part of the neighbourhood going around them,” she said. “Under Michael’s leadership, they never forgot that they had a bigger responsibility than just project management.”</p>
      <p>In a news release, CMLC board chair Randy Magnussen said the organization is actively seeking a replacement for Brown.</p>
      <p>“(Michael) built a powerhouse team that is nimble, responsive, forward-thinking and innovative — and he inspired them to do great things,” Magnussen said. “CMLC’s board remains committed to our strategic plan and to ensure we continue to have the right team in place to realize our vision … We look forward to continuing our transformation of downtown’s east end.”</p>
