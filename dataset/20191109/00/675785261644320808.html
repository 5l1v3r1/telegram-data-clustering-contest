      <h2>Chloe Ferry has moved on from her ex Sam Gowland but Geordie Shore bosses are not happy with her allegedly kissing new cast member Louis Shaw</h2>

      <p>Chloe Ferry has wasted no time in getting herself acquainted with the new cast members on Geordie Shore.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old reality star has put her former boyfriend Sam Gowland well and truly in the past by allegedly locking lips with Louis Shaw.</p>
      <p>Chloe snogging Louis has infuriated the MTV show's bosses as they are wary of the tears that accompanied the on/off relationship she had with Sam.</p>
      <p>Producers are doing what they can to keep Chloe and Louis apart but they are struggling to deny their attraction for each other.</p>

      <p>A source told The Sun: "Chloe and Louis have been getting on like a house on fire and she's been all over him.</p>
      <p>"He's exactly her type and they've been snogging each other's faces off in clubs all over town. Producers are trying to keep them apart as they can't take another romance gone wrong in the cast.</p>
      <p>"The problem is that Chloe's keen and when she's had a drink, you can't keep her hands off him!"</p>

      <p>Filming for season 21 of Geordie Shore is currently underway, with season 20 airing its first episode last Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Louis, who comes from Barnsley, won MTV's True Love or True Lies and is expected to make quite an impact.</p>
      <p>Chloe decided to return to the current series without boyfriend Sam, after their relationship came to an end.</p>
      <p>It became complicated after Chloe accused 24-year-old Sam of sleeping with Love Island co-star Amber, the day after they allegedly split.</p>

      <p>They both denied anything happened in May but it was enough to bring the curtain down on their coupling.</p>
      <p>Sources have said that she wanted to go into the show 'with a clean slate' and urged MTV bosses to give Sam the boot.</p>
      <p>The source said: "Chloe has completely wiped her hands of Sam and she wants him out of her life for good.</p>
      <p>"During the last series Sam kept chopping in and out of the show and it left Chloe in a really bad place.</p>
      <p>"They had blazing rows which overtook the series and it became really stressful.</p>
      <p>"In the end Sam was given the shove because of the chaos. He was removed then allowed back and then removed again all in one series earlier this year - he was out of control."</p>
