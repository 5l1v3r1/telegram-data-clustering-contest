      <h1>Notes from the 560: What’s Hackening?</h1>

      <p><i>By Aditya Magal</i> <br/><br/>If you’ve seen the English television show ‘Mr. Robot’ starring this year’s Best Actor Oscar winner Rami Malek , then you would be aware of the fact that the show currently in its fourth and final season deals with a very serious and socially conscious issue – Hacking. The show gave him the platform to showcase his acting skills and was the catalyst behind him landing the role of late singer Freddie Mercury in ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’. Before he won the Oscar for playing Mercury, Malek won the Emmy for his work in the first season of Mr. Robot. <br/><br/>What makes Mr. Robot so engrossing is the depth in which it explores the world of cyber surveillance. While other shows and films have also featured hackers, this one takes it several steps ahead because it examines all of it from its core level. It’s not just about a bunch of geeks tapping away on their laptops and thumbing their smartphones, it’s about the motivation and ideological commitment of people who choose to take up hacking. There is a deeper social context to the show – how hacking in today’s technologically dependent landscape is more than an underground subculture, it’s actually a weapon in the hands of the wrong people. <br/><br/>While hackers are the technical hands and executives, it is the corporates, governments and resistance movements that are actually the brains and drivers of the phenomenon. Until a few days ago we could dismiss all of this as just fantasy and scripted television but when news broke that several people across the country had their WhatsApp conversations monitored and tracked, the premise became all too real and the worst kept secret was out. <br/><br/>WhatsApp has constantly been under criticism because its parent company Facebook actively tracks user data, browser and usage patterns to sell to advertisers. This data is personalised to a frighteningly customised extent for each user and is employed whenever the person uses the platform again. Your phone knows more about you than your spouse, doctor, lawyer and accountant combined! It even knows more about you than you know about yourself. <br/><br/>This type of hacking has now become so intrusive and prevalent that it often gets clubbed under the category of ‘privacy and data protection’. These are ultimately bureaucratic terms that fail to inform people that their phones and laptops make them slaves to corporate hacking, government hacking and surveillance. In the case of the WhatsApp hacks the situation is much more serious because an Israeli firm that specializes in cyber espionage is reportedly involved in literally logging messages of each targeted user. <br/><br/><br/>The tracking and analytics business has a home in Bengaluru too where many coders are paid to work on applications and projects that survey user data. Corporate overlords don’t reveal the end use of such tech and get rich off these inventions while both coders and users are exploited due to their ignorance. The government’s data protection laws are also now being tinkered with to ensure that it is now legal and ok to have your data used this way. <br/><br/>Schemes like Aadhaar and telecom law amendments have pretty much ensured this. Much of the population are unaware simply because the phone is a utility tool and our technical knowledge is not much. The average man is not aware that while he is browsing on Facebook, his data is being sold. Not everyone can be an Edward Snowden but the next time you browse and download an app, do make sure that your privacy is not exploited. Protect your data! <br/><br/><br/><b>Follow Aditya Magal on twitter @jhunjhunwala</b></p>
