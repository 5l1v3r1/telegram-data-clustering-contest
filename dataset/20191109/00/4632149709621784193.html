      <p><b>Earlier, Pakistan PM Imran Khan had announced fee waiver for pilgrims from the Indian side<br/><br/>NEW DELHI</b> In another U-turn, Pakistan has decided to charge $20 each from Indian pilgrims using the Kartarpur corridor on the inauguration day on Saturday, despite Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan having announced a fee waiver on November 1. <br/><br/>According to sources, Pakistan has conveyed the decision to India. The decision to charge the $20 fee from the 550 pilgrims using the corridor on the day of the inauguration is another in a line of U-turns by Pakistan on the Kartarpur modalities. <br/><br/>On November 1, Imran Khan had said that Sikhs coming to Kartarpur from India need not carry passports but just need a valid ID card, and that no fee would be charged on the day of the inauguration of the corridor to the Kartarpur gurdwara. <br/><br/>However, on Thursday, Pakistan said that passports are a must. <br/><br/>On Friday, it conveyed that it would be charging the $20 fee. <br/><br/>On Saturday, among the 550 pilgrims using the corridor will be former PM Manmohan Singh, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh as well as Union ministers Hardeep Puri and Harsimrat Kaur. <br/><br/>The money earned through Saturday’s pilgrimage collection from the 550 pilgrims will amount to a tidy $11,000 for Pakistan. <br/><br/>India has been protesting the $20 fee, with many calling it a jaziya tax. <br/><br/><b><u>Delhi set to fund the pilgrimage<br/></u><br/>NEW DELHI:</b> The Delhi Cabinet on Friday took an in-principle decision to offer free pilgrimage to Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan’s Kartarpur under its flagship ‘Mukhyamantri Tirath Yatra Yojana’. <br/><br/>The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. <br/><br/>The government will bear all expenses of pilgrimage to Kartarpur, Kejriwal said. <br/><br/>Under its fully funded scheme launched in July, the AAP government is currently sending senior citizens on pilgrimage to 12 destinations.</p>
