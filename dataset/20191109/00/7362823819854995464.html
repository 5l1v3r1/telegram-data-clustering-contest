      <p>Within hours, the couple was identified by KFC as Hector and Nonhlanhla.</p>
      <p>Kateka Malobola, who posted the original video, <a href="https://twitter.com/Kmalobola/status/1192728372029382656">said </a>on Friday that the responses to the couple’s viral proposal have been overwhelming.</p>
      <p>“It’s not even about the video, it’s about love,” he said. “The man ... I’m not as brave as he is. He went down on one knee in front of everybody at KFC. Everybody came running from outside that heard the screams from the cashiers and the patrons ... it’s genuine love.”</p>
      <p>While some social media commentary poked fun at the man’s decision to choose KFC as the venue to pop the question, most reactions were positive.</p>

      <p>“That's why we don't find happiness, we focus on material things,” another person wrote.</p>
      <p>The fanfare surrounding their unorthodox proposal garnered more than likes and retweets, however, as businesses and generous South Africans offered to help pay for the couple’s wedding, honeymoon and gifts.</p>
