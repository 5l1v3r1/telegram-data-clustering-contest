      <p>BAGHDAD (AP) - Iraqi medical officials say security forces have cleared a flashpoint bridge in Baghdad of anti-government protesters using stun grenades and tear gas, in clashes that are among the heaviest since the unrest began last month.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s confrontations at Sinak bridge pushed the demonstrators back to the nearby Khilani square where clashes wounded 35 people.</p>
      <p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.</p>
      <p>Protesters appeared to be regrouping to try forcing their way again across the bridge, which has seen daily clashes with security forces.</p>
      <p>The bridge spans the Tigris and gives access to the heavily fortified Green Zone, the seat of government.</p>
