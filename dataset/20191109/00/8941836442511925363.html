      <p>LONDON (AP) - American midfielder Christian Pulisic scored his fifth goal in three Premier League games as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-chelsea/">Chelsea</a> beat Crystal Palace 2-0 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Palace’s defense survived a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-chelsea/">Chelsea</a> onslaught at Stamford Bridge in the first half - the Blues recording 11 shots to zero for Palace at the break.</p>
      <p>“At halftime the manager said we need to stay focused and the chances will come,” said Tammy Abraham. He broke the deadlock soon after.</p>
      <p>Abraham read the game well to beat Palace’s offside trap in the 52nd minute and met a backheel pass from Willian before shooting low for his 10th league goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Pulisic ensured <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-chelsea/">Chelsea</a>’s sixth consecutive league win in the 79th with a header when Michy Batshuayi’s shot was deflected and looped into the air.</p>

      <p>“I think we deserved it in the end. We had a lot of chances,” Pulisic said. “We want to be right up there at the top so we’re just going to keep going.”</p>
      <p>Pulisic didn’t get a Premier League start from August until Oct. 26, when he took full advantage with a hat trick against Burnley. He followed up a week later with a goal against Watford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-chelsea/">Chelsea</a> manager Frank Lampard handed midfielder N’Golo Kanté his first league start since Oct. 6 in place of Jorginho, who was suspended. Kanté had injured his groin on international duty with France last month.</p>
      <p>There was a first Premier League start for 19-year-old right-back Reece James, dropping captain César Azpilicueta to the bench. James put in a solid performance, especially against Palace winger Wilfried Zaha.</p>

        <p>“It was a really good individual performance from Reece because Zaha is a big threat on the flanks and one-on-one,” Lampard said. “It gives me more options.”</p>
        <p>Palace had to wait until the 86th for its only shot on target all game. Kepa Arrizabalaga in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-chelsea/">the Chelsea</a> goal reacted well to get low and hold the slippery ball in heavy rain.</p>
        <p>It was the 300th Premier League game as coach for Palace’s Roy Hodgson, whose team showed good early-season league form but is now on a four-game winless run.</p>
