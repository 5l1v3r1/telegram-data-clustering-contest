      <p>COLOGNE, Germany (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bundesliga/">Bundesliga</a> team <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cologne/">Cologne</a> fired coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/achim-beierlorzer/">Achim Beierlorzer</a> on Saturday following its last-gasp defeat to Hoffenheim the day before.</p>
      <p>The German club says André Pawlak and Manfred Schmid will take over “in the interim.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cologne/">Cologne</a>’s 2-1 defeat on Friday was its eighth loss in 11 league games. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cologne/">Cologne</a> is in the relegation zone and in danger of a swift return to the second division after being promoted as second-division champion last season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cologne/">Cologne</a>’s new sporting director Frank Aehlig says, “I regret that we’ve had to take this step, because we value <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/achim-beierlorzer/">Achim Beierlorzer</a> very highly. However, the hoped for sporting success hasn’t been achieved so far.”</p>
      <p>Aehlig only took over as sporting director from Armin Veh on Friday. The club said Veh’s departure was agreed by mutual consent.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/achim-beierlorzer/">Beierlorzer</a> was appointed in the summer after two successful years at Jahn Regensburg. His last game at Regensburg was a 5-3 win over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cologne/">Cologne</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/achim-beierlorzer/">Beierlorzer</a> is the second coach to lose his job in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bundesliga/">Bundesliga</a> this season. Bayern Munich fired Niko Kovac last weekend.</p>
