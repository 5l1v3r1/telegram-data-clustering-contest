      <h1>Saturday horse racing tips: Why 7/2 Grand Sancy is the one to back at Wincanton</h1>
      <h2>Follow this advice for the weekend's biggest races and you could be a winner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Masters, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/dave-masters/</a></address>
      <p>With Town Moor resembling the local swimming pool and Doncaster being abandoned, Wincanton becomes Saturday’s main fixture with a couple of Grade 2 events in the <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/wincanton/1m7f-grd2-hrd-2019-11-09/29573046.1500">Elite Hurdle</a> (3pm) and "Rising Stars" Novices' Chase 35 minutes’ earlier.</p>
      <p>The former has attracted a mere six combatants and all eyes will be on Nicky Henderson’s Fusil Raffles (1/2) who was forced to miss the Triumph Hurdle after sustaining a cut when winning one of the major trials for that heat and then justifying favouritism at Punchestown in May.</p>
      <p>However, prohibitive odds don’t make him a too attractive betting proposition and Grand Sancy (7/2), trained by Paul Nicholls whose string is in excellent fettle, is preferred.</p>
      <p>These two horses are actually officially rated the same, although ‘Fusil’ has the benefit of a 3lb weight allowance but that could be negated by the selection having the benefit of a recent outing 20 days’ ago when hopefully there are no ill effects after a tired last hurdle tumble.</p>
      <p>Certainly, Fusil Raffles owners Simon Munir and Isaac Souede will be concerned at the presence of Grand Sancy in the field as he turned over another of their string and favourite Sceau Royal over course and distance in February’s Kingwell Hurdle and history might just repeat itself.</p>
      <p>The Rising Stars also features a Punchestown scorer in Reserve Tank (4/5), who is also an odds-on poke, but this fellow looks a good thing after running second on his seasonal and chasing debut at Chepstow behind a good horse in Jarveys Plate.</p>
      <p>The winner earned rave reviews from his trainer Fergal O’Brien when prevailing at Cheltenham on New Year’s Day and although he was well beaten in the Ballymore Novices’ Hurdle at The Festival, always looked like he would take high order when sent over the bigger obstacles.</p>
      <p>The fancy is a similar type who probably just caught a tartar in Jarveys Plate at the Welsh sweat bowl and it will be very interesting to see if Reserve Tank can reverse that form later on should, if as expected, he can take the honours this Saturday.</p>
      <p>ITV4 cameras are also at Aintree for three races and the 2m 4f <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/aintree/2m4f-hcap-chs-2019-11-09/29573045.1405">handicap chase</a> (2.05pm) can go the way of Irish raider Edward O’Grady’s The West’s Awake (16/1) who has been running well during the summer winning at Punchestown and placed on his last two starts.</p>
      <p>A second last time featured a number of mistakes and shrewd O’Grady fits a pair of blinkers on his charge for the first occasion and they might just assist him to concentrate a bit better at the fences and regain his place in the winner’s enclosure.</p>
      <p>Back at Wincanton there will be thrills aplenty in the <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/horse-racing/wincanton/2m4f-nov-chs-2019-11-09/29573046.1425">Badger Beers Silver Trophy Handicap Chase</a> (3.35pm), a trial for the Ladbrokes Trophy, and Give Me A Copper (11/2) could hit the back of the net for a group of owners which include former Manchester United supremo Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
      <p>This lad was a creditable fourth last time in the bet365 Gold Cup.</p>
