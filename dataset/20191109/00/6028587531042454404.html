      <p>Far too much of the workforce spends an inordinate amount of time inside working in front of computers, on social media devices or in stuffy meeting rooms. While this is often necessary, scientists insist that getting outdoors is your ticket to reduce stress and revitalize your health. Spending deliberate time in a natural setting or “nature bathing” during your workday gives you more clarity and energy to take back to your workstation.<b>Scientific Research </b></p>
      <p>A growing body of research indicates that spending more time in natural green spaces such as parks, woodlands, mountains and beaches has healing properties and underscores the importance of nature on your mental and physical health and well-being. Previous studies showed that living in greener urban areas is linked to lower incidences of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, asthma, mental distress and mortality rates. The decades-old Japanese practice of forest bathing or shinrin-yoku (which means “taking in the forest”) is believed to provide stress reduction, relaxation and deeper insights into life. This back-to-nature movement is catching on in the U.S. where certified guides take groups into green spaces that amplify the scents of soil or flowers, the sounds of birds, insects and rustling leaves, or colors and textures of grasses and plants. Scientists have discovered that forest bathing lowers cortisol and depression in adults and boosts the activity of killer cells that fight off infection and cancer.</p>
      <p>A groundbreaking study last month in Scientific Reports found that spending a minimum of two hours a week in nature (such as parks, woodlands or beaches) promotes physical and mental health and well-being and gives you a bigger perspective of your life circumstances. In the study, those who spent 120 minutes per week had better health and higher psychological well-being than the ones who didn’t spend any weekly time in nature or those who spent less than 120 minutes per week. The lead author, Dr. Mathew White, said it doesn’t matter how the 120 minutes are achieved. It can be done in one block or spread out over the entire week to get the benefit. It doesn’t seem to matter what activity you’re involved in, either, as long as you’re outdoors: sailing, biking, kayaking, walking or tennis.</p>

        <b>Get Outdoors During Your Workday</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re stumped for a solution at work, stressed out or overwhelmed with a project or hit a wall, spending time with Mother Nature gives you a creativity surge or ah-ha moments for a workable problem. Studies show that taking a brisk ten-minute walk raises and sustains your energy level and re-calibrates a fatigued brain. And you perform better after a walk in the woods than after a walk along a noisy, city street. Exposure to green space reduces anxiety and rumination and improves depression. So instead of eating lunch at your desk, find a park, arboretum or natural setting to eat. Be mindful of the breeze, notice the colors and smells of leaves and flowers, pay attention to the sounds of insects in the bushes, rushing water or warbling birds. If you have time on a break, take a jog around the block or a stroll in a green space, and you will go back to your desk with batteries recharged, energy renewed and head cleared.</p>

        <b>When You Can’t Get Outside, Bring It Indoors</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the days get shorter and colder and you can’t get outside during winter months, don’t fret. Studies show that simply viewing an aspect of nature from an office window is restorative. So find a window and watch a squirrel scamper up a tree, birds nesting or a magenta-bruised sunset. According to scientists, bringing the natural world inside reduces work stress and promotes calm and clarity. Breathe as much natural life into your personal space as possible by arranging your workstation to face scenes of wooded areas, water, sunset, landscapes or wildlife. If you don’t have a view, nature photos or paintings are good substitutes. An opened window with a soft breeze and nature sounds adds a natural touch. If you live in an urban area, you can bring in potted green plants, fresh flowers or a terrarium. Plus, a tabletop trickling waterfall, an aquarium, fish bowl or a CD with nature sounds have stress-relieving and restorative properties. Breathe natural life into your workspace to optimize your productivity and capture the surprising twists and turns that bubble up from your creative depths.  </p>
      <p>Studies show that even watching a nature documentary can raise your mood. Make sure you capture as much natural sunlight as you can. Artificial lighting such as fluorescent lights increase cortisol stress hormone levels. Natural lighting will  turn your workstation into a more restful, stress-free zone which lowers stress levels. Full-spectrum lights give you the benefits of natural lighting and elevate your mood. Keep your blinds or shutters open to create a sunny atmosphere. Remove window treatments, furniture or objects that block daylight. Wash the inside and outside of windows regularly to let light in. </p>
      <p>Whatever you do, you can find many ways to “nature bathe” and let it transport you out of the artificial world of social media and technology and calm and relax you—let it infuse you with mental clarity to replace the stress this time of year that drops off like autumn leaves.</p>
