      <p>NORWICH, Vt. (AP) - A Vermont town will recoup nearly $250,000 lost in an email scam.</p>
      <p>Norwich Town Manager Herb Durfee says the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, the town’s insurer, will cover nearly $169,000.</p>
      <p>The Valley News reports that in addition to the insured money, Comerica Bank returned nearly $80,000, which leaves Norwich out $1,000, the cost of its insurance deductible.</p>
      <p>A report released by Norwich says the money was lost when former Finance Director Donna Flies ignored instructions to stop unauthorized payments from municipal accounts.</p>
      <p>Dufree says Flies no longer works for Norwich. Flies has said she make “stupid mistakes.”</p>
