      <h2>Katie Ross said she had to 'scoop up' the body of her ten-month-old kitten, Ru, from the pavement in Bristol with her pet's head was 'nowhere to be seen'</h2>

      <p>A cat owner was horrified to discover her pet decapitated near her home.</p>
      <p>Owner Katie Ross said her 10-month-old Main Coon kitten, Ru, went missing overnight from home in the St Anne's Park area of Bristol on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She appealed on local social media in her neighbourhood and went out searching - but was soon told the headless body of a cat was lying on the pavement near her home in the Wyatt’s View area.</p>
      <p>She described the horrific scene to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/cat-owners-horror-discovers-missing-3518424">Bristol Live</a>: "Instantly I went out to see and as I walked up I knew it was him, even with the head gone, it was nowhere to be seen.</p>

      <p>"I scooped him up and waited for my partner to get home.</p>
      <p>We took him to the vets, praying it was an animal attack, as it is more digestible than thinking a human could do something so vile."</p>
      <p>She said the vet confirmed the worst - that Ru had been killed and decapitated with a sharp instrument or blade, and had also had an area of fur on his tail shaved off.</p>
      <p>Katie said Ru lived with his brother Morty - who is now being kept in.</p>
      <p>"He's lost without him," she added.</p>
      <p>Police has launched an investigation into what happened, and have been conducting door-to-door inquiries.</p>

      <p>The attack must have happened at some point after 3pm on Thursday, November 7, when Ru first went out, although probably after 7pm when a search of the area found no sign of him, Katie said.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for  <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset police</a>  said: "We're investigating after the mutilated body of a cat was found in the St Anne's Park area earlier today, Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p>"The incident is being treated as a criminal offence and our inquiries are continuing."</p>
      <p>If anyone has any information about what happened to Ru, in St Anne's Park overnight on Thursday November 7, they should call the police on 101 and quote reference number:  0165 of today's date, 8/11/19.</p>
