      <p>TORONTO — Companies in Japan reportedly banning female employees from wearing glasses is sparking fresh outrage and debate on social media over the country’s stringent workplace dress-code practices that specifically target women.</p>
      <p>Nippon TV reported that various companies banned eyewear for females for various reasons, including airlines that cited safety in emergency situations, retailers who said glasses made a “cold impression,” and traditional restaurants who felt the eyewear did not look good with kimonos.</p>
      <p>Many social media users reacted with disbelief. “Wait....WHAT?!? Hang on while I check the article's date for the year... and the century,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Raychaser42/status/1192906904453799936">one Twitter user said</a>.</p>
      <p>“Japanese companies making a spectacle of themselves,” <a href="https://twitter.com/marjayhan/status/1192856730834743296">another user tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>In South Korea, where women wearing glasses at work is relatively uncommon in many industries, a <a href="https://qz.com/1266600/the-rare-sight-of-women-wearing-glasses-in-korea-speaks-to-its-unjust-beauty-norms/">similar discussion erupted last year</a> after a female news anchor decided one day to wear glasses on air.</p>
      <p>The latest workplace controversy in Japan follows backlash earlier this year over corporate dress codes that included requiring women to wear makeup and <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/japanese-women-kick-back-at-high-heels-at-work-1.4449089">high heels to work</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time, then-Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Takumi Nemoto defended the policies, <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/06/f9a4e96e5ca8-labor-minister-opposes-banning-female-dress-codes-with-high-heels.html">according to Kyodo News</a>: "It's generally accepted by society that (wearing high heels) is necessary and reasonable in workplaces."</p>
      <p>The Japanese hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%AC%E3%83%8D%E7%A6%81%E6%AD%A2?src=hashtag_click">#メガネ禁止</a> or “glasses ban” began trending on Wednesday as Japanese women fought back, while foreign media pick-up of the hot-button issue drew fresh international reaction.</p>
      <p>“So now the women must wear dresses/skirts, heels, makeup, hose AND be blind without glasses. All so the men have someone more appealing (to them) to look at??” <a href="https://twitter.com/junoakliberal/status/1192854261098409986">one Twitter user asked</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nooon_noz/status/1191865262363955200">One woman claimed</a> she had to wear contact lenses for work while recovering from conjunctivitis, while another shared an anecdote where she brought a pair of sample glasses specially made for a bridal kimono to a clothing rental company for promotion and was told “no glasses allowed for wedding kimono.”</p>

      <p>A Twitter post that showed a set of photos too blurry to identify had more than 42.9K likes and 25K retweets, with the poster saying they could not live without glasses and called it a life-protecting medical instrument.</p>

      <p>Another comment that garnered at least 2,500 likes and 1,500 retweets said: “There are those who are not able to wear contact lenses for health reasons, so they are not able to get these jobs? Why just women? That is discrimination. And a violation of human rights.”</p>
