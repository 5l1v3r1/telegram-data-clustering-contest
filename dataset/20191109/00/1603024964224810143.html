      <p>Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) was imposed in Mumbai on November 9 as the Supreme Court delivered its verdict on the sensitive Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid suit.</p>
      <p>The prohibitory order came into effect from 11 am and will remain in force for the next 24 hours, reported news agency PTI quoting a Mumbai Police spokesperson. However, noÂ restriction on internet services has been imposed as yet, the spokesperson added.</p>
      <p>The order bars holding of public meetings or assembly of more than five persons or processions.</p>

      <p>It also prohibits entry of all types of vehicles carrying persons intending to participate in such unlawful gatherings.</p>
      <p>Heavy security is put in place across the financial capital which had witnessed communal riots after the disputed structure was demolished in Ayodhya in 1993.</p>
      <p>In one of the most important and most anticipated judgements in India's history, a 5-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to the more than a century old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.</p>
      <p>In an unanimous verdict, the bench paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
