      <h1>Virgin Atlantic’s ‘Flying Lady’ Logo Creator Isn’t Loving ‘Inclusive’ Redesigns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Mikelle Leow</a></address>
      <p><b>Back in April,</b> Virgin Atlantic unveiled <a href="https://designtaxi.com/news/404152/Virgin-Atlantic-Changes-Up-White-Flying-Lady-Logo-To-Embrace-Diversity/">five new updates</a> to its famous Flying Lady logo. The British airline hopes the additional variations would reflect modern Britain and its diverse residents. <br/><b>While the revamped</b> visual identity aims to receive acceptance from all walks of life, one man isn’t too happy about the change: the logo’s own originator. <br/><b>Ken White,</b> who modeled the Flying Lady 35 years ago after pinup girls from the 30s and 40s, is indignant about the reimaginations. <br/><b>“I read that</b> they were changing it to a gay person and a black woman,” the 72-year-old described in a statement via <i><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/artists-anger-virgins-flying-lady-logo-replaced-black-woman-11067334/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Metro.co.uk</a></i>, adding that he couldn’t fathom “what was wrong” with the Flying Lady image. <br/><b>“It was an icon</b> and people knew the airline for it.” <br/><b>White was tasked</b> to be Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson’s artist between 1978 and 1990, and had been briefed to create a character reminiscent of art found on World War II aircraft and the work of Peruvian pinup painter Albero Vargas. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>“With the diversifying</b> of the image you wonder where it will all end,” expressed a disappointed White. <br/><b>Virgin Atlantic debuted</b> the overhaul on a Airbus A35-1000 plane in August, and is projected to perform a full rollout of the new icons on 12 aircraft by the end of 2021.</p>
