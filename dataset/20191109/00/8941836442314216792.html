      <p>LONDON (AP) - Photographer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Robert Freeman</a>, who helped define the image of The Beatles with some of the band’s best-known album covers, has died aged 82.</p>
      <p>A statement on The Beatles’ official website announced <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Freeman</a>’s death Friday but didn’t give a cause.</p>
      <p>Born in 1936, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Freeman</a> began his career as a photojournalist for London’s Sunday Times and captured portraits of leading jazz musicians before working with The Beatles. He shot the black-and-white cover for the 1963 album “With The Beatles,” picturing the Fab Four’s faces in part-shadow. It became a defining image of the group and was used for the 1964 U.S. album “Meet The Beatles!”</p>
      <p>In an online tribute, Paul McCartney said “people often think that the cover shot for ‘Meet The Beatles’ of our foreheads in half shadow was a carefully arranged studio shot.”</p>
      <p>“In fact it was taken quite quickly by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Robert</a> in the corridor of a hotel we were staying in where natural light came from the windows at the end of the corridor,” McCartney wrote.</p>

      <p>McCartney said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Freeman</a> “was one of our favorite photographers during the Beatles years who came up with some of our most iconic album covers.”</p>
      <p>He called him “imaginative and a true original thinker.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Freeman</a> went on to photograph the covers of “Beatles For Sale,” ”Help!” - with its image of the band members holding semaphore-style flags - and “Rubber Soul.” For that 1965 album <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/robert-freeman/">Freeman</a> subtly stretched The Beatles’ faces, subtly suggesting the psychedelic experiments to come.</p>
