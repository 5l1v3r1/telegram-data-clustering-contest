      <h1>All work and no pay has hindered ops in Indira Canteens</h1>

      <p><i>Marshals, contractors have not been paid for four months, dues of over Rs 12 crore are pending</i> <br/><br/>Marshals and contractors of Indira Canteens have not been paid for months, which has led to several issues in its operations. <br/><br/>They have complained about the difficulties they are facing because of not being paid for four months. <br/><br/>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) said that the government has not sanctioned any funds. <br/><br/>There are uncleared dues amounting to Rs 12 crore. The civic body spends about Rs 3 to 4 crore on the Indira Canteens every month. <br/><br/>The BBMP had finalised two caterers - ChefTalk Food &amp; Hospitality Services Private Limited and NGO Rewards - to serve 125 Indira Canteens across the city.</p>
      <p>We had a meeting, recently, to let the service providers and marshals know that we will be clearing the payments soon</p>
      <p>­–Captain Ranbir Singh, Chief Marshal<br/><br/>ChefTalk will operate in 15 constituencies and Rewards in 12. A spokesperson from ChefTalk said they have not been paid for four months and are finding it difficult to source the materials on time. “The suppliers are delaying the materials but we are somehow managing to pay the staff on time,” he said, adding that the civic authority has to clear over Rs 12 crore to the suppliers. <br/><br/>The marshals said that they have to pay the rent and the fees of their school children with the pension that they receive. <br/><br/>JCO (Junior Commissioned Officer) and marshal supervisor NS Hukkeri manages eight canteens in the Hebbal constituency. He said, “I live in a rented house. Half of the pension I receive is spent on the rent. It is difficult to manage all the expenses such as food and water. The cost of living in Bengaluru is high.”</p>

      <p>The marshal, who has two children, supervises the quantity and quality of food that is served in the canteens. He said, “We send the food from the kitchen to the canteens after weighing it. There are two marshals in each canteen to ensure that the right amount of food is served and a cordial relation is maintained between the servers and the people.” The marshals, who are mostly ex-servicemen, have been posted at the canteens to ensure proper maintenance and security. <br/><br/>They are paid between Rs 25,000 and Rs 35,000 a month. <br/><br/>However, health insurance and PF are deducted from the salaries, which lessens the in-hand salary by Es 5,000. Another marshal, Ramesh M, said he also somehow manages to run his household with his pension. “I eat at the canteen itself” he said. <br/><br/>Captain Rajbir Singh, chief marshal, said the operations in the canteens have been affected due to delay in payments. “We recently had a meeting to let the service providers and marshals know that we will be clearing the payments soon. Meanwhile, they need to ensure that quality food is served in the canteens,” he said.</p>
