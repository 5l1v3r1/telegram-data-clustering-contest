      <p>The world celebrates <i>Stranger Things</i> Day, <i>Live in Front of a Studio Audience</i> lives again, network Pope-off lies ahead, and more of the week’s top TV news, trailers, and castings.</p>

      <p><i>Stranger Things</i> fans know, of course, what November 6 is: it’s <i>Stranger Things</i> Day, because it’s the anniversary of when Will Byers disappeared into the Upside Down. To mark the occasion, the show’s writers did something perfectly not strange, and very welcome, for fans, when they revealed the title of the first new episode of the show’s upcoming fourth season. Like the headline said, it’s “Chapter One: the Hellfire Club.”</p>
      <p>Need visual proof? Here’s the tweet from the official Twitter of the series’ writers, which includes the message, “looking for new members … are you in?”</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/strangerwriters/status/1192245731127521281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The account also shared multiple blooper reels from seasons <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toigWGqZ-3w">1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mykIlHtldg">2</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao5-Zbv09qA">3</a> and even a happy birthday shout-out to one fan who nicely requested it. Sadly, other than that script title page, no other hints about the next season were proffered by the writers.</p>
      <p>So let the wild fan speculation begin about what Hellfire Club will mean for the Hawkins townsfolk in the season ahead, whenever that season will drop (Netflix has not yet announced a season 4 premiere date).</p>

      <h3>HOLIDAYS WITH THE BUNKER AND EVANS FAMILIES</h3>

      <p>Will they actually recreate holiday episodes, though? Will the cast remain the same for the <i>All in the Family</i> part — that is, will Marisa Tomei return to steal every scene as Edith? Those are the big questions surrounding <i>Live in Front of a Studio Audience</i>, the hit concept producers Norman Lear and Jimmy Kimmel produced and co-hosted earlier this year, and which they’re revisiting for a Dec. 18 special that will feature live re-enactments of <i>All in the Family</i> and <i>Good Times</i> episodes. No castings or episode titles have been announced, but Kerry Washington has joined the lineup of executive producers for the project, which also includes Will Ferrell and Justin Theroux.</p>
      <p>Last spring’s premiere of <i>Live in Front of a Studio Audience</i> features live, all-star recreations of <i>All in the Family</i> and <i>The Jeffersons</i> episodes, and won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special (Live).</p>

      <h3>SEE COLDPLAY LIVE, IN CONCERT, FROM JORDAN, ON YOUTUBE</h3>

      <p>Coldplay’s upcoming double album <i>Everyday Life</i> features “Sunrise” and “Sunset” halves, and the band will celebrate that theme with a pair of livestreamed concerts on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHHUH7RvYeU">YouTube</a>; one will take place at sunrise, and the other at sunset, in Amman, Jordan.</p>
      <p>The sunrise performance will begin just before midnight ET on Nov. 22, with the second half of the show debuting on the livestream at 9 a.m. ET. <i>Coldplay: Everyday Life – Live in Jordan</i> will be the band’s first-ever performance in Jordan, and will reflect the middle eastern influences found throughout the album’s music and artwork.</p>
      <p>Everyday Life, Coldplay’s eighth album, will be released on Nov. 22.</p>

      <p><i>The Office</i> may have the best Christmas-themed episodes, but <i>Friends</i> owns Thanksgiving. From “The One with All the Thanksgivings” (the one where Monica puts the turkey on her head) to “The One Where Ross Got High” (the one where Rachel made a trifle that, according to Ross, tasted like feet), the Central Perk gang shined at the November holiday. As part of the celebration of the show’s 25th anniversary, <a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/events/friendsgiving?utm_source=fathom&amp;utm_medium=press+releases&amp;utm_campaign=friendsgiving">Fathom Events</a> is putting eight of the show’s Turkey Day episodes on the big screen, in a two-night event on Nov. 24 and 25. Tickets are on sale now for the showings, which will also include “The One Where Underdog Gets Away,” “The One with the List,” and “The One with the Football,” though curiously, another gem – “The One with the Rumor,” in which Brad Pitt plays a character who hates Rachel – is MIA from the roster.</p>

      <h3>SO, IT’S LIKE THE LATE SHOW MEETS DAYS OF OUR LIVES MEETS THE OFFICE?</h3>
      <p><i>Wet Hot American Summer </i>creator and <i>Children’s Hospital</i> co-creator David Wain and A.D. Miles, former head writer of <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, are teaming up for an ambitious daily comedy called <i>Today’s Special</i>. Set in a 24-hour diner, the series would feature the topicality of a late-night show, the format of a daily soap opera, and the tone of a single-camera workplace comedy, as the employees and customers of the diner co-mingle and comment on daily events inside and outside the eatery. WarnerMedia has ordered four episodes of the series, with no specific plans yet for which network (including TBS or TruTV) or platform (HBO Max) would host <i>Today’s Special</i>.</p>

      <h3>REBOOTS WITH FEMALE POWER</h3>

      <p>Queen Latifah will have some serious skills, and she’ll use them to help people with nowhere else to turn in CBS’s remake of <i>The Equalizer</i>. The network has given a pilot production commitment to the reboot, which will feature Queen Latifah as star and executive produce.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The CW is developing a remake of <i>Kung Fu</i>, with a female lead. The new series would revolve around a Chinese-American woman who drops out of college to go on a soul-searching adventure to an isolated monastery in China. When she returns to her hometown, she uses her new martial arts skills to help protect her community from crime.</p>
      <p>And NBC is developing a new <i>Zorro</i> series that would also reimagine the series with a female lead. The modern-day heroine is a descendant of the famous Zorro, and makes it her mission to defend those who can’t defend themselves in her community.</p>
