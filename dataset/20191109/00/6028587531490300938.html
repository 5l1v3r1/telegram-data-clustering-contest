      <p>Everyone in the welterweight division seems to want a shot at WBA welterweight champion and boxing legend Manny Pacquiao. Who can blame them? A win brings a legitimate world title, a victory over a future Hall-of-Famer and more than likely the biggest payday in their career.Former two-time champion “Showtime” Shawn Porter is the latest fighter to call out Pacquiao. Porter recently said, per <a href="https://www.boxingscene.com/porter-eyes-early-2020-return-calls-pacquiao-showdown--144097">Boxing Scene</a>, that the next step for him is Pacquiao.</p>
      <p>He wants to return early in 2020 after losing a split decision to Errol Spence Jr. on September 28. The Porter-Spence bout was thrilling, but the loss saw Porter dropped in the 11th round and it cost him his WBC title.</p>
      <p>Spence now holds half of the four titles at 147 pounds. A fight between him and Pacquiao would seemingly make the most sense, considering both are signed with Al Haymon’s Premier Boxing Champions stable.</p>
      <p>However, Spence was in a scary car crash last month that left him with facial lacerations. He’s expected to make a full recovery, but there is no timetable for his return. Former champion Danny “Swift” Garcia climbed in the ring to challenge Spence after that bout, so his next fight is still up in the air, although I’m told it’s very likely he’ll be the one facing Pacquiao next.</p>
      <p>Porter does own a win over Garcia in head-to-head competition, but boxing is a sport of recency. While Porter looked good against Spence, he still lost the fight. In Garcia’s last fight, he dominated Adrian Granados en route to a stoppage victory.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to justify handing Porter a title opportunity and a major payday ahead of Garcia coming off a loss. It would make more sense for Porter to take on a solid contender that he’s favored to beat in the co-main event of Garcia-Pacquiao than it would for Showtime to leapfrog Swift.</p>
      <p>Even if by some stretch Porter was pitched to Pacquiao as an opponent, it’s not a matchup the Filipino legend is likely to be excited about. Porter’s style is a roughhousing one that borders on being dirty. This is a style Pacquiao has struggled with in the past. When you consider that, and Porter hasn’t yet established himself as a major draw, it’s difficult to find Pacquiao’s motivation for taking that fight.</p>
      <p>While it may seem unfair, it’s more likely Porter will have to work his way back up with another win or two before getting another shot at a world title.</p>
