      <p>LONDON (AP) - A record crowd of 77,768 for English women’s soccer saw fresh struggles for Phil Neville’s side in a 2-1 loss to Germany at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wembley-stadium/">Wembley Stadium</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>England has now lost five of its last seven games, starting with the World Cup semifinal loss to the United States in July.</p>
      <p>“I’m really sorry we couldn’t get the result,” England forward Ellen White addressed fans on the field.</p>
      <p>White did turn things around for England just before halftime, canceling out Alexandra Popp’s ninth-minute header.</p>
      <p>But just when the Lionesses were preparing to celebrate claiming a draw against the world’s second-ranked team, Klara Buhl struck in stoppage time.</p>

      <p>As the rain fell in north London, there won’t have seemed much to celebrate for the hosts.</p>
      <p>But the English attracted what appears to be the biggest-ever crowd for a women’s friendly, anywhere.</p>
      <p>The previous best-attended women’s game was in 1999 when more than 90,000 watched the U.S. beat China in the World Cup final at the Rose Bowl in California.</p>
      <p>The next biggest crowd came at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wembley-stadium/">Wembley</a> in the 2012 London Olympics when just over 80,000 saw the U.S. beat Japan.</p>

        <p>The increased interest in the Lionesses is highlighted by the fact <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/wembley-stadium/">Wembley</a> has added around 30,000 fans to the attendance that saw England lose to Germany at the stadium five years ago.</p>
