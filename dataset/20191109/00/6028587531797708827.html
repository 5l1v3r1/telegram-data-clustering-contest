      <p>Even with better reviews, a stronger fan reception and a decent B+ Cinemascore grade, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>met Judgment Day on Friday. The $185 million Paramount/Disney/Fox release earned just $2.8 million (-73%) on Friday to set the stage for a $10.21 million (-65%) second-weekend gross. That will give the Tim Miller-directed and James Cameron-produced sci-fi sequel just $47.9 million in ten days, or just slightly above what <i>Terminator: Genisys </i>earned in five days in 2015 and what <i>Terminator: Rise of the Machines </i>earned in its $43 million Fri-Sun weekend (in a $73 million Wed-Sun debut) in 2003. The 74% Friday-to-Friday drop isn’t as bad as <i>Batman v Superman </i>(-81%) or <i>Dark Phoenix </i>(-83%), but it’s worse than any previous <i>Terminator </i>sequel (all of which opened on Thursday or Friday).</p>

      <p><i>Terminator: Salvation </i>opened on a Thursday in 2009 and its second Thursday saw an 80% drop from its first. Either way, It’s a sign that making a better sequel couldn’t save a franchise for which general audiences stopped caring decades ago. The Linda Hamilton/Arnold Schwarzenegger/Natalia Reyes/Mackenzie Davis/Gabriel Luna flick will end its domestic run with around $65-$70 million domestic, or about what <i>Rise of the Machines </i>earned in its first five days and what <i>Terminator: Salvation </i>earned ($65 million) in its Thurs-Mon Memorial Day launch back in 2009. Yes, I’m been beating the drum on this one’s failure, because, like <i>Dark Phoenix</i>, it’s an example of the studios looking at the threat posed by VOD and streaming and giving theatrical audiences exactly what they don’t want.</p>

      <p>In better news, Warner Bros.’ <i>Joker </i>is continuing to do its thing. It earned $2.51 million (-34%) on Friday for a new $306.802 million domestic cume. Presuming it has maintained that 32%/68% domestic/overseas split, the film has earned, on a $62.5 million budget, $958.7 million worldwide. As noted yesterday, that makes it the most profitable comic book movie, in terms of “rate of return” budget versus global gross, of all time. It’ll earn $9.22 million (-32%) in weekend six for a $313.5 million domestic cume, just shy of <i>Thor: Ragnarok </i>($315 million in 2017), a new $980 million global cume.  The DC Films flick is essentially holding up Warner Bros.’ entire year-end dramatic slate. And yeah, it should be over the $1 billion mark in a week.</p>

      <p>Walt Disney’s <i>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil </i>crossed $400 million worldwide earlier this week, and it grossed $2.002 million (-35%) for a $91.3 million cume. The $185 million Angelina Jolie sequel will earn $8.27 million (-37%) in weekend four for a $97.57 million 24-day cume as it tops $100 million sometime next week. Presuming the 22/78 split holds, it’ll have around $443.5 million worldwide by the end of tomorrow night. Buoyed by an A+ Cinemascore grade, Focus Features’ <i>Harriet </i>earned $1.99 million (49%) on Friday for a likely $6.8 million (-42%) weekend and $23 million ten-day cume. That’s not huge for Cynthia Erivos’ $17 million Harriet Tubman biopic, but it’s a solid performance thus far that points to a $40 million domestic finish.  </p>

        <figcaption>'Jojo Rabbit'<cite>Fox Searchlight</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><i>Jojo Rabbit </i>will earn around $4 million this weekend (+71%) as Fox Searchlight expanded it to 802 theaters, giving Taika Waititi’s World War II/Nazi comedy a decent $9.2 million 24-day domestic cume. Neon’s <i>Parasite </i>continued to pack them in, relatively speaking. The Bong Joon Ho-directed thriller will earn $2.53 million (+0%) in 603 theaters for a terrific $11.3 million 31-day domestic cume. The South Korean thriller that has already earned $100 million worldwide. <i>The Addams Family </i>will have $91 million domestic after a $3.71 million (-55%) weekend as it’ll just miss $100 million domestic. Warner Bros.’ <i>Motherless Brooklyn </i>held surprisingly well in weekend two, with a $639,000 (-39%) Friday and a $2.27 million (-35%) weekend. That’s still a terrible $7.427 million ten-day cume, but I digress.</p>
