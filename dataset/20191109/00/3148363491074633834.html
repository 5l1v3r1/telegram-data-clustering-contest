          <b>A transcript is as follows:</b>

      </p>
      <blockquote><b>NORAH O’DONNELL: </b>Do you think the president will ultimately be impeached and removed from office? <b>NIKKI HALEY: </b>No, on what? You’re going to impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn’t happen and – and giving money and it wasn’t withheld? I don’t know what you would impeach him on. And look, Norah, impeachment is, like, the death penalty for a public official. When you look at the transcript, there’s nothing in that transcript that warrants the death penalty for the president. And I think that – <b>O’DONNELL:</b> To be clear, it was not a complete transcript. There are still things that are missing from it. And in it, he does say, “I would like you to do us a favor,” though. <b>HALEY:</b> The Ukrainians never did the investigation. And the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there’s just nothing impeachable there. And more than that, I think the biggest thing that bothers me is the American people should decide this. Why do we have a bunch of people in Congress making this decision?</blockquote>
