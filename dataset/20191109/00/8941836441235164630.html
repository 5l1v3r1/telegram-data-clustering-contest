      <p>EIBAR, Spain (AP) - Real Madrid got the job done early again, scoring three goals in the first 30 minutes as it thrashed Eibar 4-0 in the Spanish league on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The victory came three days after Madrid took a three-goal lead by the 14th minute of a 6-0 rout of Galatasaray in the group stage of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The win at Eibar left Madrid top of the standings with 25 points, two more than Real Sociedad and three more than Barcelona, which hosts Celta Vigo later Saturday. Sociedad was held by last-place Leganés to a 1-1 draw on Friday.</p>
      <p>It was one of the best games of the season for Madrid, which was up 2-0 after goals by Karim Benzema in the 17th and Sergio Ramos in the 20th. Benzema added another in the 29th and Federico Valverde also netted in the 61st.</p>
      <p>Benzema’s second goal and the strike by Ramos came from penalties after fouls on Eden Hazard and Lucas Vázquez.</p>

      <p>Madrid right back Dani Carvajal made his 250th appearance for the club.</p>
      <p>It was only the third away win by Madrid in 11 league matches since coach Zinedine Zidane returned to the club late last season.</p>
      <p>The team has kept a clean sheet in five straight matches in all competitions, since a 1-0 loss at Mallorca in the Spanish league.</p>
      <p>Eibar, which was coming off two straight wins, dropped to 15th place, staying six points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
