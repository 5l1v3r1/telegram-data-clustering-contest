      <h1>AP Interview: Huawei founder says US woes not hardest crisis</h1>

      <p>SHENZHEN, China (AP) - For decades, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a>’s founder stayed out of sight as it grew to become the biggest maker of network gear for phone carriers and passed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> as the No. 2 smartphone brand.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren Zhengfei</a> is shedding that anonymity as China’s first global tech brand mobilizes to fight back against U.S. sanctions and warnings <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei Technologies Ltd.</a> is a security risk.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneur at the center of the Trump administration’s battle with Beijing over technology is a survivor of competition that drove Western rivals out of the market, brushes with financial disaster and job stress so severe he contemplated suicide.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old former army engineer who worked his way out of childhood poverty sees American pressure as just the latest of the tests that have hardened him and his company.</p>
      <p>“For three decades, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> has been suffering and no joy,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> said in an interview. “The pain of each episode is different.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>This episode has a personal dimension: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a>’s daughter, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a>’s chief financial officer, is under arrest in Canada on U.S. charges she helped to violate sanctions against Iran.</p>
      <p>The escalating clash with Washington has transformed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> from an admired but rarely seen businessman worth an estimated $3 billion into one of China’s most prominent figures.</p>
      <p>He belongs to the generation of entrepreneurs who founded communist-era China’s first private companies in the 1980s. They navigated a shifting, state-dominated landscape, overcoming shortages of money and technology to create industries that are expanding abroad.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> launched <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> in 1987 after his military post was eliminated.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> is a star in industries the ruling Communist Party is promoting but a target for complaints those plans are based on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over business secrets.</p>
        <p>Despite his success, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> talks like a struggling rookie, worrying aloud that employees might get too comfortable.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> writes letters urging employees to “prepare for the worst,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicole-peng/">Nicole Peng</a> of Canalys, an industry research firm.</p>
        <p>As for “whether his character can help the company to survive,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicole-peng/">Peng</a>, “I’m sure it will. It will survive. Like he said, they are prepared for it. They know there is always difficulty.”</p>
        <p>Born in 1944, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> was raised by a schoolteacher who he said fed seven children on a monthly wage of 40 yuan ($6).</p>
        <p>When <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> was a teenager, the ruling party embarked on the Great Leap Forward, a disastrous campaign to become an industrial power overnight. At least 30 million people died in the 1959-61 famine that followed.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a>’s mother declared no one would die and divided each meal into nine portions, one for each family member, said Tian Tao, co-author of “The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> Story.”</p>
        <p>“His mother’s ‘meal system’ had a big impact on him,” said Tian.</p>
        <p>Following that ethos, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> says it is owned by the Chinese citizens who make up half its workforce of 180,000. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a>’s ownership has declined to 1.14% as more shares are distributed to employees.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> joined the army in the 1960s and was sent to the northeast to build a textile factory. He said he slept outdoors in weather as cold as -28 C (-18 F) and ate noodles and pickled radish.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> says he has tried to ensure <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a>’s long-term survival through a system of shared decision-making. Still, he is known as a forceful, even autocratic, decision-maker.</p>
        <p>That was highlighted by a battle in 2000 over whether to develop the personal handy-phone system, which caught on as a low-cost alternative to mobile service. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> rejected PHS as a distraction from work on next-generation mobile technology that promised to be cheaper and more reliable.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> said he resisted appeals to back PHS as bills for 3G development rose to 6 billion yuan ($750 million).</p>
        <p>“Today’s crisis is one-tenth or 1% of the pressure at that time,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> said.</p>
        <p>Tian, his biographer, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> employees told him <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a>, unable to sleep, would call and worry aloud about how to pay a 300 million yuan ($50 million) monthly wage bill.</p>
        <p>“When <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren Zhengfei</a> talked with employees six or seven years ago, he revealed a secret: He had suicidal thoughts several times,” said Tian, a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> adviser and co-director of the Ruihua Innovation Research Institute at Zhejiang University.</p>
        <p>Following his daughter’s December 2018 arrest in Vancouver, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> launched a charm offensive aimed at defusing Western suspicions the company facilitates Chinese spying.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> gives interviews lasting up to two hours to reporters and TV crews who trek to Shenzhen, a former fishing village near Hong Kong that is now a technology center of 15 million people.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a>, a ruling party member, tried to defuse security concerns by promising in January he would defy any official demands to reveal foreign customers’ secrets.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a>, along with Nokia Corp. and LM Ericsson, leads in fifth-generation telecom technology. It is meant to upgrade and expand networks to support self-driving cars and other futuristic applications. But that increased reach makes 5G politically sensitive.</p>
        <p>The company’s U.S. market vanished in 2012 after a congressional panel declared <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> a security risk.</p>
        <p>Despite that, sales tripled as <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> made inroads into Europe, Asia and Africa. Sales last year rose almost 20 percent to $105 billion.</p>
        <p>U.S. export controls, if enforced, will disrupt <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a>’s access to processor chips and other technology. Its smartphones would lose Google maps and other services, making it hard to compete.</p>
        <p>To limit that impact, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ren-zhengfei/">Ren</a> has emphasized making <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/huawei-technologies-ltd/">Huawei</a> a self-reliant technology creator. This year’s research spending is due to rise 20% to $17 billion.</p>
        <p>The company has released a smartphone operating system it says can replace Google’s Android if necessary. It makes some of its own processor chips but needs U.S. suppliers for high-end products.</p>
        <p>“They do things from scratch,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nicole-peng/">Peng</a>. “I think this is the influence of the founder.”</p>
