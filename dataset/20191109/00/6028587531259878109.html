      <p>If I had a dime for every time someone was discussing a sequel and said, “Sure, but it’s no <i>The Godfather Part II</i>,’ I’d have a decent amount of cash.Francis Ford Coppola’s 1974 movie, which acts as both a sequel and a prequel his 1972 original, continues to be one of a handful of films widely considered to be the gold standard of follow-up films. However, getting it there wasn’t easy.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t think it was a classic sequel. It was a very difficult film in many ways, and it took a lot of time to shoot,” explained Fred Roos, one of the film’s co-producers. “We shot all over the world from Hollywood and Miami to the Dominican Republic and Sicily, Rome, and China, to name just a few of the places. The structure of the movie was very unusual too, having it take place in two different times and so many different places, we tried lots of things to make it work. We experimented with it, trying different things.”</p>
      <p>“We did a lot of test screenings too until we finally hit one screening, I remember it was in San Diego, where we got the right balance, and it finally worked. But it was touch and go. We had some bad screenings where the cutting back and forth between the two stories bothered people, but we eventually found the right formula.”</p>
      <p>Although it’s considered a classic now, when it initially hit theaters, critical reaction was decidedly mixed. However, that didn’t affect it come awards season where <i>The Godfather Part II</i> secured 11 nominations, walked away with six wins, and became the first sequel to win Best Picture.</p>
      <p>It’s a time Roos remembers well. He explained: “At the time, people would say, ‘Oh, it’s no <i>The Godfather</i>.’ On the night of the Oscars, when we won Best Picture, Paramount Pictures had three films nominated in that category including<i> The Conversation</i>, which I also co-produced, and <i>Chinatown</i>. Everyone thought <i>Chinatown</i>, which is a great movie, had it in the bag.” </p>
      <p>“When they announced that <i>The Godfather Part II</i> was the winner, we were not expecting it. After that, the movie’s reputation just grew and grew and rightfully so. I still believe it is one of the 20 best movies ever made, not just one of the best sequels.”</p>
      <p>To mark the film’s 45th anniversary, <i>The Godfather Part II</i> is returning to the big screen for a limited number of performances over three days - Sunday, November 10, 2019, Tuesday, November 12, 2019, and Wednesday, November 13, 2019. The revival is part of the ongoing <a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/events/tcm2019-the-godfather-part-ii-45th-anniversary-1974">TCM Classics series</a>. </p>
      <p>Recalling the film’s original release, Roos believed that it effected in the industry in several ways.</p>
      <p>“What <i>The Godfather Part II</i> did was show, not that there have been many since, that a sequel could be as good as, if not better than, the original,” Roos recalled. “By the way, the ‘Part II’ in the title was controversial. The studio said, ‘You can’t call it <i>The Godfather Part II</i>. Nobody’s ever done that. You have to think of another title.’ But, Francis stuck with that. Now we have hundreds of films that are Part II or Part III or whatever. It made that OK.”</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot I miss about those days. Back then, you could let a film build and add theaters gradually. You can rarely do that anymore. You have to come out in all your theaters at once, and you live or die in that first week. There’s almost no chance now of building an audience little by little. However, there are good things about today. The streamers allow all kinds of movies to get made that might not get made any other way can be made any other way in this climate, but because of the way they are shown, they might not stick with you like a theatrical release.”</p>
      <p>Made for $13 million, <i>The Godfather Part II</i> grossed $88 million worldwide, considerably less than the first film in what became a trilogy. That came as little surprise to Roos, even then.</p>
      <p>He explained: “A sequel rarely sits as well as the original if the original is a big hit. The fact that it hung in there and remains seen by so many so often is amazing. Plus, it was a long film, a very long film, which the studio was not happy about but they went with it. Because of the length, it meant theaters could have fewer screenings a day, which can affect the box office.”</p>
      <p>Having <i>The Godfather Part II</i> return to theaters to mark the film’s 45th anniversary is something Roos delighted in, for several reasons, and admitted it’d been too long since he watched it himself.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I can’t remember the last time I saw it. However, I’ve never sat down and said, ‘I’m going to watch it from beginning to end.’ The only time I do that is when we have a retrospective, and I’m expected to be there in the theater,” he confessed. “But that’s where the movie looks best, on the big screen. The way it was shot, the incredible performances, everything up there grabs your attention.”</p>
      <p>He concluded: “Francis Ford Coppola, the director, and I both knew that Pacino and De Niro were headed for long careers because the talent was so far off the charts. <i>The Godfather Part II</i> is a great example of that. You can’t hold that back. I mean, they weren’t classically beautiful leading men, but they continue to command that screen.”</p>
