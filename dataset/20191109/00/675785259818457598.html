      <p>A woman was forced to close her business on the first day after finding her new shop was ruined by floodwater.</p>
      <p>Freya King, 22, prepared months to open a children's book store, Toy Stories, in Matlock, Deryshire, and scheduled for launch on Friday.</p>
      <p>Freya, from Chapel-en-le-Frith, told <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/matlock-derbyshire-flooding-floods-ambergate-3517335">Derbyshire Live</a> she arrived the store in Crown Square to find it around four inches deep in water.</p>
      <p>Stock worth of £400 had been ruined and around £3,000 worth of damage had been done to the floor.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm feeling pretty low. It's quite disheartening.</p>
      <p>"I'm about four inches deep in water. The floor is going to have to be ripped out again.</p>
      <p>"Tractors keep coming through and blasting water through the shops. The sand bags are piled high.</p>

      <p>Due to widespread flooding in the area, trains were not able to run between Derby and Matlock and roads within the town remained closed.</p>
      <p>Freya said she had no idea when the shop will eventually be able to reopen.</p>
      <p>"We've been trying to set it up for two months," she added.</p>
      <p>"The water is almost going over our wellies. It's quite bad."</p>
      <p>A number of flood warnings are active in Derbyshire this afternoon, including for the River Derwent at Ambaston Lane, Ambergate, Belper, Calver, Chatsworth, Darley Dale, Duffield, Matlock Bath, Raynesway, and Whatstandwell.</p>
