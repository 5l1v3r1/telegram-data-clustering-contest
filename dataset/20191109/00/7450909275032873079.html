      <p>The police are one step closer to solving the disappearance of Aniah Blanchard, the stepdaughter of <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> heavyweight <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Walt-Harris-72046">Walt Harris</a>.<br/><br/>On Friday morning, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-authorities-arrest-suspect-disappearance-alabama-college-student/story?id=66845362">ABC News</a> reported that Ibraheem Yazeed, one of the suspects in the alleged kidnapping of Blanchard has been apprehended. He was <a href="https://www.oanow.com/news/crime_courts/update-suspect-in-aniah-blanchard-disappearance-captured-overnight/article_145273bc-9d87-5d3e-b2cc-f36e86b0afe2.html">arrested and brought in</a> by the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force along with the Escambia County Sheriff's Department on Thursday night in Pensacola, Florida. Yazeed will be charged with first-degree kidnapping and will be held without bond, and at the time was out on bond for kidnapping and attempted murder charges in another state. He is currently awaiting extradition to Lee County, Alabama, which is home to the city of Auburn.<br/><br/>On Wednesday, the police <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Police-Seek-Person-of-Interest-in-Case-for-Walt-Harris-Missing-Stepdaughter-165299">put out images</a> from surveillance footage of the convenience store where Blanchard was last seen. The man was later identified on Thursday as Yazeed, which ultimately led to his arrest later that day. The police have since admitted that there may be others involved in the case, stating, "Additional charges and/or arrests are anticipated."<br/><br/>Blanchard was reported missing on Oct. 31, and after a search her vehicle was recovered an hour away from her home in Auburn. The vehicle showed damage, and with that coupled with additional evidence that the police discovered, Blanchard is <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Alabama-Governors-Office-Offers-Reward-for-Missing-Daughter-of-UFC-Fighter-Walt-Harris-164743">now considered to be a victim of foul play</a>. The Governor's office has issued a reward for information leading to the arrest and potential conviction of those involved, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SjpM1FXpZ/">several additional figures in the sport</a> including UFC President Dana White and light heavyweight champ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jon-Jones-27944">Jon Jones</a> have put up additional money for the reward, which now totals $105,000 to find her.<br/><br/>The police ask for anyone with information about Blanchard's whereabouts to call the Auburn Police Division Detective Section at 334-501-3140, the anonymous tip line at 334-246-1391 or the 24-hour non-emergency number at 334-501-3100.</p>
