      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> trimmed the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Los Angeles Lakers</a>‘ lead to six points with nearly nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, and Staples Center buckled in for a big finish between two NBA division leaders.</p>
      <p>Instead, the Heat missed their next 13 shots and scored only six more points all night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a> have two of the world’s best offensive players in their lineup, but they’re leading the overall NBA standings because of what they’re doing on the other end.</p>
      <p>“One thing about it - if your offense is behind your defense, you’re a really, really good team,” LeBron James said. “And I’m OK with that right now.”</p>
      <p>Anthony Davis had 26 points and nine rebounds, and James scored 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a>‘ seventh consecutive victory, 95-80 over the Heat on Friday night.</p>

      <p>James hit a pair of clutch 3-pointers in the waning minutes to seal another impressive win for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a>, who haven’t lost since their season opener against the Clippers.</p>
      <p>Davis and James both had moments of brilliance with the ball in their hands, but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a> are looking impressive on the defensive end during their outstanding start.</p>
      <p>“I had high expectations about what we could be,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a> coach Frank Vogel said. “We have a ton of defensive talent, (and) because the care factor has been high, it’s come together pretty quickly.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> went 4 of 19 in the fourth quarter, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a> held the Heat to one field goal and six points in the final 8:54. LA limited the Heat to 6-of-35 shooting on 3-pointers and outrebounded them 48-37 to win a meeting of division leaders off to outstanding starts to the new season.</p>

        <p>“It’s our way,” Davis said. “We want to be a good defensive team. That team scores, I think, 115 (points) or something a game. We knew they were coming off a back-to-back, and we just wanted them to make them make shots. They had looks they missed. For the most part, we wanted to run them off the line. They’re No. 1 in 3-point field goal percentage, and we held them to 17%.”</p>
        <p>Butler scored 22 points and Goran Dragic added 19 for the Heat, who still lead the Southeast Division despite losing twice on their three-game Western road trip. One night after scoring 124 points in a win at Phoenix, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> couldn’t find a consistent offensive rhythm.</p>
        <p>“Even in the first half, we were playing this game in the mud,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> coach Erik Spoelstra said. “Obviously, we didn’t have all of us. We’re not making any excuses by any means. That’s a great team. … It just got away from us in the fourth quarter. I still thought we were there with six points, but they just scored three straight possessions and went from there.”</p>
        <p>Butler scored nine points in the third quarter to keep <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> in striking distance despite its 3-for-24 start on 3-pointers, including 11 consecutive misses spanning halftime.</p>
        <p>“They put a lot of pressure on defense,” Dragic said of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a>. “(With) their rebounding and their skills, you have two really good players. We tried to crowd them as much as possible, and we feel like we did a good job, but then in the end they got 10 more rebounds than us, so that was probably the key.”</p>
        <p>A THOUSAND TWENTIES</p>
        <p>James became the third player in NBA history to score 20 points in 1,000 career games. Only Karl Malone (1,134) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,122) have done it more often. James has played 1,206 games in his 17-year career. Kobe Bryant only did it 941 times.</p>
        <p>ZONE BREAK</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> led for only one possession all night despite employing a zone defense that bothered the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-lakers/">Lakers</a>‘ offense early on. Los Angeles swiftly adjusted to the scheme and moved the ball effectively, getting 30 assists on its 40 field goals.</p>
        <p>Vogel’s plan put the ball in Davis’ hands near the free throw line to break down the defense, and he responded with a season-high seven assists.</p>
        <p>“Once we get the ball in the middle of the floor, you know, it’s pick your poison,” Davis said. “I can score, or I can throw a lob to JaVale (McGee) or Dwight (Howard), or find the shooters in the corner. Once we get the ball in the middle of the zone, the rest is just making a play.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
