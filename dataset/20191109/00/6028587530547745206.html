      <p>Rye whiskey is arguably America’s original spirit. It predates bourbon by more than a century. Until the onset of Prohibition in the America, rye whiskey out sold bourbon by a considerable margin. In the 18th century, rye was widely cultivated along the eastern seaboard. The grain was hardier and had a shorter growing cycle. An important advantage at a time when the northern hemisphere was experiencing “the little ice age” and was colder than it is now.</p>
      <p>Rye has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and return it to soil whose nitrates had been depleted by growing corn. Many early American farmers grew some rye as a backup in case their wheat or corn crop failed. It was often the preferred cover crop for fields that were intended to be fallow between corn plantings. If the rye turned out to be surplus it would usually end up as whiskey.</p>
      <p>Along the east coast there were two main types of rye whiskey produced. In Pennsylvania, rye whiskey typically had a mash bill that was 95% or more comprised of rye. This style was referred to as Monongahela rye. In the mid-Atlantic states, rye whiskey would generally have a mash bill that was around 30%-35% corn and 65%-70% rye. This style of rye whiskey was called Maryland rye.</p>
      <p>In the late 18th century virtually every American farm had a small still. Converting surplus grain into alcohol was an important way of preserving its caloric and economic value. Otherwise, pests, molds and weather would quickly destroy the value of surplus grain.</p>
      <p>In 1791, the U.S. Congress passed the country’s first excise tax on alcohol. Called the whiskey tax, it was set at nine cents per gallon. It has risen steadily ever since. Currently it’s at $13.50 per proof gallon (a gallon of 100% alcohol).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As farmers/distillers made their way across the Appalachians, in part to get away from the federal government and its whiskey tax, they brought their stills and their mash bills with them. Corn grew better in the Midwest and was more plentiful. The rye whiskey made there followed the Maryland mash bill and incorporated a large percentage of corn. Over time, the corn portion of the mash bill increased, giving rise to the style of spirit that would become bourbon. According to the late David Pickerell, by 1810, there were more than 2,200 distilleries operating in Kentucky alone.</p>
      <p>Bourbon was typically shipped down the Mississippi and became the most common beverage in the south. Both styles of rye whiskey continued to be produced on the east coast. Since the bulk of Americans lived there, rye demand and sales remained strong.</p>
      <p>Like other American spirits the rye whiskey industry was decimated by Prohibition. Following its repeal, however, government subsidies encouraging the cultivation of corn put rye whiskey at a significant cost disadvantage. The larger bourbon producers took advantage of the post-Prohibition chaos to buy up regional brands and consolidate production in larger, scalable distilleries. Those consolidators would become the nucleus of many of the larger American spirit companies that exist today. There were no industry wide consolidators that emerged in the rye whiskey industry, however. The industry remained small and fragmented, lacking the production scale and marketing muscle of the larger bourbon producers.</p>

      <p>World War II provided the final nail in the coffin of rye whiskey. Before Prohibition, Maryland, for example, had hosted 44 distilleries, 13 of which were in Baltimore. In 1936, even after many closures, Maryland was still producing 14.1 million gallons of rye whiskey. During WWII, many distilleries switched from producing rye whiskey to producing industrial ethanol for war related industries. After the war ended, few returned to making rye whiskey.</p>
      <p>From the end of WWII on, sales of rye whiskey steadily dropped. David Ozgo, Senior VP of Economic and Strategic Analysis at the Distillers Council of the U.S. (DISCUS), a spirits industry trade group, estimates that in 1952, American distillers produced around 400,000 9-liter cases of rye whiskey. That was an astounding drop from the 5.5 million 9-liter cases produced just in Maryland in 1936.</p>
      <p>By 2006, sales had dropped to only 150,000 cases. Bourbon sales that year reached 14.7 million cases. Many of the major distillers were only devoting one to two days of production each year to meet their rye whiskey demand.</p>
      <p>Since 2007, however, rye whiskey sales have exploded. By 2018, sales of rye whiskey</p>

      <p>had reached over one million 9-liter cases. Renewed interest in cocktail culture was an important contributor, as was the rise of American craft distillers and their interest in authentic American spirits. The major beverage companies also took advantage of the renewed interest to increase their production and to put marketing dollars behind some historic rye brands and to back entrepreneurial craft distillers introducing new expressions of rye.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, prices for rye whiskey have soared, especially for aged expressions that are increasingly hard to find. At the same time, there has been an explosion of unfamiliar rye brands, some the reemergence of historic expressions, others entirely new. </p>
      <p>Rye is a difficult grain to work with. When cooked it is sticky and is prone to adhere to still walls during distillation, burning and creating off flavors. Many producers often contract out the distillation of new make rye whiskey to specialist distillers experienced with handling high rye mash bills.</p>
      <p>The two largest producers of rye whiskey in North America are Midwest Grain Products (MGP) in Indiana and Alberta Distillers in Alberta. It’s estimated that over 80% of the rye whiskey available in the U.S. originated from one of these two producers. When it comes to stocks of rye whiskey aged for 15 or more years, almost all of it originated from these distillers. The percentage of rye whiskey produced by these two producers is dropping as new production kicks in, but there is no question that a large percentage of the rye whiskey currently available shares their DNA.</p>
      <p>Picking your way through the rye whiskey universe can be tricky. Although some bottlers have relied on different blends of aged rye, specific barrel selections to define their house style or have used any number of cask finishes to differentiate their rye from those of other rye whiskey bottlers using the same source, the common DNA of many rye offerings is unmistakable. Moreover, pricing varies widely. It’s not uncommon to find similarly aged rye from the same producer in different bottler expressions at widely varying prices.</p>
      <p>Below is a selection of 10 outstanding rye whiskeys, showcasing different styles, that retail for $50 or less. Some of these come from well-known national brands like Jim Beam or Jack Daniels, although the fact that these companies also produce excellent rye whiskeys is not as well known. Others bear historic names, often of regional brands, that have been resurrected or revitalized. Some are new rye expressions from craft producers and are not always available on a national basis. All are outstanding, well priced and well worth exploring.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Old Overholt, Straight Rye Whiskey, 3 YO, 40% ABV, $20</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Old Overholt, Bottled in Bond, Straight Rye Whiskey<cite>Photo, courtesy Old Overholt. Beam Suntory</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Old Overholt is America’s oldest whiskey brand, dating back to 1810. It was originally a Monongahela style rye and was based in West Overton, Pennsylvania. By the 1960’s, Old Overholt was the only nationally distributed brand of rye whiskey in America. The company passed through several hands before eventually ending up with the James B Beam Distilling Company in 1987.</p>
      <p>Old Overholt is considered the foundation of modern American rye whiskey. Its devotees range from Doc Holiday to John F Kennedy and John Foster Dulles. Ulysses S Grant was also a fan and was rumored to have drunk it on campaign during the Civil War. If you are an old rye fan you are familiar with Old Overholt. If you are just beginning your exploration of rye whiskey, then this should be your starting point.</p>
      <p>Old Overholt is a Kentucky style rye, meaning notwithstanding its Pennsylvania origins, the current expression has a high proportion of corn. The mash bill isn’t disclosed by the distillery. On the nose, the rye is sweet, with notes of cereal, caramel and vanilla, and a pronounced aroma of candied orange zest. It shows the typical spicy elements of rye, but these are overshadowed by the pronounced corn sweetness. The palate is not as intense as the nose. It features notes of saddle leather, along with candied orange zest and some cinnamon spice. The finish is short to medium length featuring corn sweetness, along with some orange zest and cinnamon. This is a very smooth, mild whiskey. It’s an excellent introduction for the rye novice, Best served neat as it doesn’t stand up well to a lot of ice.</p>
      <p>There is also a Bottled in Bond version that is aged for an additional year and is at 50% ABV. It offers more intensity on the nose and palate, and also features dried fruit and more pronounced char notes. It’s priced at $25.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Russell’s Reserve Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey, 6 YO, 45% ABV, $35</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russell’s Reserve is bottled by Wild Turkey and is named after the distilling duo, father and son, Jimmie and Eddie Russell, the company’s long serving master distillers. The expression is drawn from #4 char barrels hand selected by the Russell’s. The mash bill is believed to be 52% rye, 36% corn, 12% barley.</p>
      <p>The rye is sweet, with the characteristic spiciness of rye. On the palate, it is full and rich and satiny smooth, exhibiting sweetness, dried fruit and vanilla notes and cinnamon baking spice. The finish is medium length, sweet and peppery, with lingering dried fruit notes.</p>
      <p>There is also a small batch version bottled at 55% ABV, which is more intense and represents the best of the hand selected barrels. It’s priced at $50. It’s the better value but can be difficult to find.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rittenhouse Rye, Bottled in Bond, NAS, 50% ABV, $25</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Rittenhouse Bottled in Bond Straight Rye Whiskey<cite>Photo, courtesy Heaven Hill</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Rittenhouse Rye is produced at the Heaven Hill distillery. Typical of Kentucky styled rye whiskeys, its mash bill is 51% rye, 37% corn and 12% malted barley. This is another rye whiskey that began as a Monongahela type rye. It’s named after Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia and was the best-selling brand in Philadelphia after Prohibition.</p>
      <p>The brand was resurrected by Heaven Hill in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>On the nose. there are notes of sweet cooked grains, caramel, along with tropical notes of banana and a little melon, as well as stone fruit notes of peaches and a bit of apricot. On the palate, there are the same fruit notes, along with vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg spice, and a bit of cocoa and pepper. The finish is medium length, sweet and smooth, with lingering fruit and pepper notes and a touch of maple syrup.</p>
      <p>Rittenhouse is similar to Woodford Reserve, Knob Creek, and other Kentucky style ryes, in that it has a distinctive dried fruit sweetness and is less spicy than typical ryes. They are sometimes referred to as “barely legal ryes,” since the rye portion of the mash bill is barely above the minimum 51% rye grain. They can be very similar to high rye bourbons and are the easiest rye whiskey for the bourbon drinker to transition to.</p>
      <p>This is a lighter style of rye, sweet and fruity. At $25, Rittenhouse offers an exceptional value and is significantly cheaper than many other Kentucky style rye whiskeys.</p>
      <p>
        <b>George Dickle Rye, NAS, 45% ABV, $25</b>
      </p>
      <p>The George Dickle Rye is sourced from MGP and is based on a mash bill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. The rye is filtered using the Lincoln county process. It’s chilled and then filtered, a three to five day process, through a densely packed column of sugar maple wood charcoal and then aged in new oak barrels which have been given a #4 char. The heads receive a #2 char. This is the same process used to make George Dickle Tennessee whiskey.</p>
      <p>The charcoal filtration reduces the characteristic spicy rye aromas, producing a rye whiskey that is sweeter on the nose, with pronounced vanilla, candied sugar notes, along with grilled peaches and apricots. On the palate, the whiskey is creamy and smooth. The filtration process and the high char barrels leaves a distinctive smoky, candied, sugar sweetness, along with vanilla.</p>
      <p>The finish is medium length, sweet and peppery, with hints of old leather, dried fruit and a bit of smoke and oak. This is a very easy rye to drink and at $25 an exceptional value. Pity it doesn’t come in a 100-proof version.</p>
      <p>See also the <b>Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Rye, NAS, 47% ABV</b> for another example of a rye made using the Lincoln County process. The mash bill consists of 70% rye, 18% corn and 12% malted barley. The whiskey is believed to be a 4 YO that has been subject to significant temperature variations. The resulting whiskey is fruitier and less spicy than your typical rye, exhibiting pronounced aromas and flavors of tropical fruit, especially banana and cherry kirsch, followed by notes of caramel and creamy vanilla custard. Think of it as a rye version of Jack’s No. 7.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Rye, NAS, 45% ABV, $45</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dad’s Hat is a classic Monongahela style rye made at the Grundy Mill Distillery in</p>

        <figcaption>Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye<cite>Phogto, courtesy Grundy Mill Distillery</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Bristol, Pennsylvania by craft distiller Mount Laurel Spirits. The mash bill is 80% rye, 15% malted barley and 5% malted rye. The combination of malted and unmalted rye was one of the characteristics of the Monongahela style rye whiskeys. The whiskey is aged for six months in newly charred quarter casks.</p>
      <p>On the nose, the whiskey offers a pronounced aroma of fresh grass, along with dried tropical fruit. There are notes of anise, along with some medicinal notes, and an aromatic dried herbal quality.</p>
      <p>On the palate, the whiskey has a pronounced weight and chewy viscous quality. The dried fruit notes gradually give way to an intense rye spiciness of cinnamon and cloves, along with a bit of pepper and a slightly bitter, grassy, herbal note. The latter is often characteristic of youngish rye whiskeys. The finish is medium length, with herbal and medicinal notes followed by pepper and some cinnamon. This is an excellent rye to use in cocktails as the herbal and medicinal notes are nicely complemented by sweet and citric notes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James E Pepper 1776 Straight Rye Whiskey, NAS, 50% ABV, $45</b>
      </p>
      <p>James E Pepper is a historic brand. Founded in 1780, it continued distilling until 1958. In 2008, the rights to the brand were acquired by the Georgetown Trading Company. The rye whiskey was originally sourced from MGP. The historic James E Pepper distillery in Lexington, Kentucky has been refurbished and put back into production. The first release of whiskey from the distillery is expected in 2021.</p>
      <p>The company bottles three different rye whiskeys: a 100 proof, a barrel proof and a 15 YO. All three are based on the MGP mash bill of 90% rye and 10% malted barley. The first two expressions are believed to be 3 YO. Tasting notes refer to the 100-proof expression.</p>
      <p>On the nose, the rye is spicy and peppery. There are the green vegetal and herbal notes typical of younger rye, followed by aromas of menthol, orange zest, cinnamon, clove and root beer. On the palate, the whiskey is smooth and dry featuring notes of cut grass, mint, orange zest and root beer.</p>
      <p>The finish is medium length, smooth but drying, with a hint of char and a lingering bitter note. This rye is very different from the typical, corn influenced, Kentucky style rye whiskeys. Along with Dad’s Hat, they are a good indication what historic, Monongahela style rye whiskey tasted like in the 18th century. The style is not for everyone, but if you are interested in learning more about rye whiskey and its various styles, they are definitely worth a taste.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pikesville Straight Rye Whiskey, 6 YO, 55% ABV, $45</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Pikesville Straight Rye Whiskey<cite>Photo, courtesy Heaven Hill</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Pikesville is another resurrection of a historic rye whiskey. It’s produced by Heaven Hill at the Bernheim distillery. First produced in 1895, it shut down in 1972, It was the last Maryland rye whiskey producer. The brand continued bottling rye from its stocks until 1982, after which it was sold to Heaven Hill. It returned to market in 2015. The mash bill consists of 51% rye, 39% corn and 10% malted barley. It’s not clear how the current mash bill compares to the historic one.</p>
      <p>On the nose, there is the characteristic sweet and spicy character of rye whiskey, along with notes of dried cherry and apple, licorice and cinnamon. On the palate, there is a distinctive cherry note followed by vanilla, cinnamon some clove and red fruits, along with lingering notes of cherry, cinnamon and vanilla. The finish is long, sweet and smooth with the cherry, cinnamon and vanilla notes persisting.</p>
      <p>This is a smooth, easy drinking rye that will appeal to bourbon lovers that like a sweeter, more fruit forward style.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Balcones, Texas Rye, NAS, 50% ABV, $40</b>
      </p>
      <p>Balcones is a Texas craft distillery that produces a particularly flavorful rye whiskey. The mash bill is 100% rye, 80% of which is a historic variety called Elbon, and the balance is European rye kilned as a chocolate rye, a crystal rye and a roasted rye. For a detailed description of Balcones’ production process see my <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2018/12/22/balcones-distillery-a-texas-legend-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary/#57ac48b520ac">earlier feature</a>. The rye whiskey is aged in #3 char barrels for one to two years.</p>
      <p>On the nose, there are notes of citrus zest, leather wax and sweet caramel, along with vanilla, milk chocolate and hints of cloves and allspice. The chocolate aroma becomes more pronounced as the whiskey opens up. There is also a bit of dried cherry in the background.</p>
      <p>On the palate, there is a candied note accompanied by some bitterness and a pronounced tobacco flavor, followed by additional flavors of chocolate and coffee, along with some citrus zest and peach, and some elements of baked cinnamon apple and creamy vanilla custard.</p>
      <p>The finish is long and smooth, with a viscous oily quality and a candied sweetness and a pronounced peppery note, along with a lingering chocolate note, dried peach and a bit of wood char. This is a great sipping rye!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>High West ‘Double Rye’ Straight Rye Whiskey, NAS, 46% ABV, $35</b>
      </p>
      <p>High West is a Utah based craft distiller located just outside Park City. Its ‘Double Rye’ is a blend of 2 YO rye based on a 95% rye and 5% barley mash bill sourced from MGP, and a 5 to 7 YO rye produced at the distillery based on a mash bill of 80% rye and 20% malted rye. The 2 YO rye is produced in a column still while the older rye is produced in a pot still.</p>
      <p>This is a very aromatic rye, with distinctive notes of cooked apple, cinnamon, clove and a hint of mint. On the palate, there is more apple, along with anise, and the typical rye spices. There is also a persistent dried aromatic herbal quality that hangs in the background. The finish is dry, long and smooth, with lingering rye spice notes of cinnamon and clove. This is a very smooth, complex, easy drinking rye whiskey, with a distinctive taste wrapped around a classic rye profile.</p>
      <p>The world of rye whiskey is rapidly growing, with many new expressions slated to come to market over the next several years. Innovative cask finishes are just starting to appear and promise to add more flavor and complexity to rye whiskeys.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that resurrected historic brands may be markedly different than their original expressions. Many bourbon producers have reintroduced historic east coast brands based on the Kentucky rye mash bill, rather than the original one. Craft producers are bringing a host of new production practices, as well as innovative cask finishing techniques.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, if you are a bourbon drinker and are looking for a sweeter, less spicy, fruitier version, then best to start is with Kentucky style rye. If you are looking for a dry, spicier, possibly grassier and more herbal version that emphasizes notes of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg, then a Monongahela style high rye mash bill will suit you better and give you a taste of the spirit’s historic style. Maryland style rye is a good midpoint between bourbon and traditional high rye mash bills. If smoothness is what you are looking for, then start with the Tennessee rye whiskeys that have gone through the Lincoln County process. Either way, there are no shortages of possibilities with which to begin your journey of discovery.</p>
