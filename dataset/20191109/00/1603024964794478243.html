      <p>Reacting to the Supreme Court of India's verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case, Congress on November 9 said that it respects the verdict and appealed all parties and communities to maintain peace and harmony.</p>
      <p>"We appeal to all the parties concerned and to all communities to abide by the secular values and spirit of fraternity enshrined in our Constitution and to maintain peace and harmony. It is the responsibility of each one of us to reaffirm our tradition of mutual respect and unity among all that has defined our society through the ages," the Congress said in a statement.</p>

      <p>"Ram is sacrifice, Ram is bhaichara, Lord Ram’s name cannot be used to divide. Those who do this in the name of Ram, don’t understand him at all. The doors are now closed for the BJP to use Ram for its power hunger," Surjewala said.</p>
