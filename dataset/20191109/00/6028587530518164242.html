      <p>A collection of specialty boutiques, INTERMIX opened shop in 1993 and can be found across America. It’s a brand known for bringing together sought-after, established labels (McQueen, Balmain, Dolce &amp; Gabbana) with new designers on the scene (such as the favorite, Alighieri), making for a fresh and compelling edit.</p>

      <p>As for Rao, she joined INTERMIX in 2014 having built up a wealth of knowledge in the industry. Her work has taken her to Africa, India, and Europe and she’s served in senior roles at Gilt.com, Calvin Klein and before that she spent 16 years at Gap Inc., where she held several leadership positions and was responsible for successfully growing domestic and international businesses for both the Gap and Banana Republic brands. Impressive.</p>
      <p>Combining all this consumer and retail know-how it, has made her the perfect woman to craft the vision for INTERMIX, developing the overall business strategy tapping into contemporary culture, because as Rao says herself, “fashion is a reflection of culture.”</p>

        <b>FC: What was your first fashionable memory?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jyothi Rao: I remember spending my weekends as a teenager in London in the ‘80s visiting all the boutiques on South Molton street, New Bond Street, Covent Gardens and Knightsbridge, Harrods, Harvey Nicks, Liberty and so many more. I couldn’t afford to buy anything from most of these stores but I loved to look at the clothes. I would pour through fashion magazines, discovering who Karl Lagerfeld and Jean Paul Gaultier were and I was very influenced by the music scene in London; a mashup of punk and ‘80s glamour. It was an exciting time for fashion.</p>

        <b>FC: How, when, why did you get into the fashion industry?</b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: I was 21 when I graduated from college and was open to a myriad of career options from investment banking to marketing roles. I interviewed with several companies who came to my college to recruit graduates and I landed on a role in merchandising because it combined my love for fashion and my love for numbers. </p>

      </p>
      <p>JR: The INTERMIX woman is informed, confident and fun. She sees fashion as a form of self-expression and doesn’t take it too seriously. I am endlessly inspired by the wonderful community of women we serve because they are interesting, generous and supportive of one another.</p>

        <b>FC: How is the retail landscape changing for you, and how are you adapting to this?</b>
      </p>
      <p>JR: Customers are at the center of everything in retail today. They are setting the standards of what they expect from the brands they purchase, they are the content creators and the influencers. At INTERMIX, we are very proud of having a diverse team from the leadership level to the most junior level of the brand, we put our customers at the center of every decision we make, and we continue to look for ways to bring our community further into the brand.</p>
