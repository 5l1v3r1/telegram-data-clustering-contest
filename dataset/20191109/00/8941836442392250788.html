      <p>MILAN (AP) - Nicolò Barella scored his first league goal for Inter Milan to help the Nerazzurri come from behind to beat Hellas Verona 2-1 and move top of Serie A on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Barella struck a stunning winner seven minutes from time after Matias Vecino had cancelled out Valerio Verre’s penalty for Verona.</p>
      <p>Inter moved two points above eight-time defending champion Juventus, which hosts AC Milan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Verona remained ninth ahead of the rest of the weekend’s fixtures.</p>
      <p>Inter was in need of a boost after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>But it went behind in the 19th minute when goalkeeper Samir Handanovic tripped Mattia Zaccagni and Verre drilled the resulting spot kick powerfully down the middle.</p>
      <p>Along with Juventus, Verona had the best defensive record heading into the weekend and Inter struggled to break the visitors down.</p>
      <p>But it laid siege to the Verona goal and it eventually paid off in the 63rd minute when Vecino headed in Valentino Lazaro’s cross.</p>
      <p>And Inter snatched all three points when Barella cut inside from the left and curled an unstoppable strike into the top corner.</p>
