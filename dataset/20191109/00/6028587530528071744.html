      <p>Thanks to Lionel Messi’s mastery and set piece hat trick, FC Barcelona headed back to the top of La Liga with a 4-1 win over Celta Vigo at the Camp Nou on Saturday. Here’s what we learned during the tie. <b>Valverde had a few surprises up his sleeve</b></p>
      <p>Samuel Umtiti started at centre-back instead of compatriot Clement Lenglet, Sergi Roberto got the nod in central midfield as opposed to Sergio Busquets and though Luis Suarez being on the bench was no shock, Antoine Griezmann was finally awarded the central role meant for him when the Uruguayan picked up an injury against Levante last weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Roberto began well</b>
      </p>
      <p>Often in Busquet’s pivot role, he had early success akin to Arturo Vidal when charging forward at times, and his chaos resulted in the ball dropping to Messi’s feet for Barcelona’s first shot on goal around the quarter of an hour mark.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As did Ansu Fati</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old looked far sharper than his last start at the Camp Nou, the 5-1 mauling of Valladolid, and his low cross into the box forced a handball for the penalty Messi converted to make it 1-0. Still, it wasn’t enough to not be brought off for Ousmane Dembélé during the break.</p>
      <p>
        <b>There was confusion over Nelson Semedo's exit</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the wait for the spot kick, the Portuguese right-back, who had been exchanging neat passes with Frenkie de Jong, was brought off for Sergi Busquets. With this, Roberto filled in at his and Semedo’s shared position, but rather than confirm the knock, some TV stations suggested the move was tactical.</p>
      <p>
        <b>It wasn’t however</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Brazilian correspondent Marcelo Bechler, who is based in Barcelona, Semedo asked to come off and went straight into the changing room upon substitution. Prior to the second half getting underway, a calf issue was confirmed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Junior Firpo again showed signs of naivety and inferiority</b>
      </p>
      <p>Caught out when pushing up to midfield on more than one occasion, Arthur of all people could be found covering for him at left back. Hopefully Alba can recover quickly and his right-back stand in Semedo’s niggle isn’t too serious, or Barcelona could have a real problem on their hands if the Domincan is their only option on the left of the back line. Admittedly, he was better at holding his line once his side were comfortably ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arthur was denied his fifth assist of the season</b>
      </p>
      <p>By the pitch not being big enough. Darting towards the edge of the box, he squared it to Messi in the six-yarder but the ball was shown to be out of play by some distance. Still it will have given the Brazilian a lift after a strange week or so being dropped twice from the last three squad lists.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Messi’s foul on the edge of the box allowed Celta to equalise</b>
      </p>
      <p>For once, albeit temporarily, it was not him wowing with a deadball pearler at the Camp Nou when Lucas Olaza ripped one past a fooled Marc-Andre Ter Stegen. The leveller looked like sending Barcelona down the tunnel at half time tied for the second consecutive match and needing a big second 45.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But this is Messi’s house</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not to be outdone, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner got the chance to put Barça 2-1 ahead when Arthur had his shirt pulled in perfect range. He made no mistake in converting the 51st free-kick of his career, and the Blaugrana went off to chants of ‘MESSI! MESSI! MESSI!’ in adoration as opposed to the jeering whistles.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Messi: Three of Barcelona’s last three and not even playing that well</b>
      </p>
      <p>At least not by his standards. The Slavia game midweek was scoreless, yet he hit a penalty in at Levante and another one here tonight before the free-kick. This represented all three of his side’s three goals in their last three games up to this point, while simultaneously demonstrating that Messi-dependance has never been stronger. Upon sealing his third, the stat could be updated to all four of FCB’s last four strikes over the line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Messi-Griezmann connection continued to falter</b>
      </p>
      <p>Messi could be seen trying to play his teammate in on one move, but there was not a single completed pass between the pair in the first half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dembélé made an instant impact</b>
      </p>
      <p>Replacing Fati on the right while Griezmann moved to the left, he ran into the box with his ambidextrous trickery and was unlucky not to curl his shot into the top corner from the corner of the 18-yard-box. Later, with 20 minutes to spare, he played a brilliant low driven pass that Messi slid in for and almost got a foot to.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Celta were gluttons for punishment in allowing Messi a second chance from dangerous quarters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Messi completed his hat-trick in the 48th minute with another free-kick that was almost a carbon copy of the three others scored in the Camp Nou this season. It really is getting quite ridiculous now...</p>
      <p>
        <b>Messi and Griezmann worked better once Messi completed his hat trick</b>
      </p>
      <p>And Messi looked genuinely disappointed, in that he wanted Grizi to score, when the World Cup winner could not convert around an hour in after releasing him. At long last, there were other exchanges between them that preceded the effort.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Griezmann is winning over the fans</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brought off for Suarez in the 73rd, he was cheered by the Camp Nou faithful for his contribution despite not being <i>that</i> impressive<i>. </i>Owing to the change, Dembélé switched to the left.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Busquets showed off his finishing nous for the fourth</b>
      </p>
      <p>His starting absence for all three of Barcelona’s defeats in 2019/2020 well-documented, Busquets wonderfully drilled home a bouncing shot five minutes from time when a headed clearance from Dembélé’s dipping ball sat up nice for him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Barcelona are back on top</b>
      </p>
      <p>Heading into the international break, they top La Liga through their +2 superior goal difference over Real Madrid. Both sides currently on 25 points, we are set for a scintillating Clasico a week before Christmas if they can keep up this up.</p>
