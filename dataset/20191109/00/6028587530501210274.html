      <p>This wickedly comic production from Ireland’s Druid theater company and Tony Award-winning director Garry Hynes stars Aaron Monaghan, who appeared as Estragon in Druid’s acclaimed <i>Waiting for Godot</i> in the 2018 White Light Festival. The play will be performed at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College through November 23.</p>
      <p>According to Druid, when peace descends, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, is not a happy man. Crippled from birth and intensely ambitious, he sets about bending the world to his own desires. No bond is too sacred, no blood too thick – nothing will stand between Richard and the crown. (Shakespeare) gives us one of the great villains in Richard III, in a chilling and darkly comic story of power and ambition.”</p>
      <p>Writing in the program, Eleanor White, inaugural recipient of Druid’s Marie Mullen Bursary for female theater artists working in the fields of direction, dramaturgy, and design, says, “Richard is truly one of the most beguiling figures in all of literature. He has a magnetic presence: it’s hard not to be drawn into his antics, his sheer audacity, and his irreverent, clever, elegant turns of phrase. He is a frighteningly modern figure—he is so captivating and entertaining a performer that it’s alarmingly easy to dismiss his villainy and sometimes even delight in it.</p>
      <p>“Historically, it seems as though Richard wasn’t quite the monstrous villain he’s made out to be. Contemporary accounts of his reign depict a ruler who is discerning and measured. It wasn’t until the Tudor dynasty came to power that this idea of Richard as a tyrant, whose physical deformity of the spine was a manifestation of his inner wickedness, began to come to prominence.</p>
      <p>“Shakespeare drew on this Tudor propaganda when writing Richard III, and immortalized this particular version of Richard. In fact, much of today’s conception of King Richard III is actually derived from Shakespeare’s play, rather than history itself. This is perhaps because, as Shakespeare realized, this villain of near-mythical proportions is too charismatic and satisfying a creation to be dismissed. Richard is maybe the greatest theatrical villain of all time— in every sense of the word.”</p>
