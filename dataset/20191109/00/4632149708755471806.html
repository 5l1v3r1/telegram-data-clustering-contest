It’s the politics, more precisely the elections, where people are the audience, politicians are (supposedly) the performers and media is the <br/>narrator of this grand festival. Directed by Sandeep Paranjape, it narrates the story of three friends who have very distinct personalities. Their lives change when a girl walks into their lives and all of them fall for her. Some seek attention, some adventure, and some just chaos. <br/><br/>This story through its life events and interactions is a take on how the stakeholders of our democracy woo the public and how the public in turn responds to these advances. Expectations, promises, tactics, rifts, alliances, manipulation – all find their way to this hilarious story. <br/><br/>WHERE: Bangalore International Centre, Stage 2, Domlur <br/>WHEN: 4.30pm &amp; 7pm, November 10 ENTRY: `300, bookmyshow.com <br/><br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></p>
