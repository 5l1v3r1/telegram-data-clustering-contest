      <p>WWE Friday Night SmackDown aired a pre-taped show from Manchester, England headlined by a showdown-turned-alliance between frenemies Braun Strowman and Tyson Fury, who joined forces to make quick work of The B-Team. Friday Night SmackDown also saw King Baron Corbin defeat Roman Reigns with help from former Raw tag team champions Bobby Roode and Dolph Ziggler.</p>
      <p>SmackDown’s viewership rebounded last week from its scary low viewership of 888,000 coming out of WWE’s FS1 debut.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Opening Segment Featuring Baron Corbin and Roman Reigns</b>
      </p>
      <p>England is one of the few places WWE tours that have a deep understanding of the whole monarchy thing. In no way did that mean they weren’t going to boo King Corbin.</p>
      <p>Baron Corbin testicle humor—comedy material fit for a king.</p>
      <p>I know Roman Reigns has made leaps and bounds as a babyface since his triumphant return, but feuding with Baron Corbin has also been a sizable part of that equation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The New Day def. The Revival—WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championships</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>If there were only one set of tag team championships and these two were embroiled in any semblance of a legitimate storyline, this match could have headlines a pay-per-view.</p>
      <p>Watching Kofi Kingston lose in recent weeks made it feel like he was miles away from another WWE Championship run. But in a weird way, watching him celebrate a middling SmackDown Tag Team Championship win like he had just had his third child made him seem lightyears away.</p>
      <p>Imperium’s main roster appearance was very cool to see, but after getting chased away, WWE is continuing to emphasize the sentiment that NXT only got over last week because of a weakened roster.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura def. Ali and Shorty G</b>
      </p>
      <p>I wonder if Shorty G’s next action figure will come with a career death certificate.</p>
      <p>Daniel Bryan and Sami Zayn had all that time together after not making the trip to Saudi Arabia. So if Daniel Bryan refutes Zayn’s offer, Sami only has himself to blame.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sasha Banks def. Nikki Cross</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sasha Banks’ original theme was fire, but Snoop Dogg only made it better.</p>
      <p>The angry tension between Bayley and Sasha Banks is a far cry from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfoyrdGoK24">this segment</a> that made fans speculate there would be a potential love angle between the two.</p>
      <p>Bayley is great at a lot of things, but seeing Shayna Baszler coming is not one of them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tyson Fury Calls out Braun Strowman</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>I was hoping this segment would lead to a challenge: Team Fury vs. Team Strowman, with Fury leading a team of boxers and Strowman leading a team of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/10/31/wwe-crown-jewel-2019-results-braun-strowman-loses-another-big-match-after-tyson-furys-countout-win/">bearded giants who lose big matches.</a></p>
      <p>Braun Strowman making a hot tag to Tyson Fury might be the worst sequence of pro wrestling in modern history. But now I feel like I have to see it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Carmella and Dana Brooke def. Fire and Desire</b>
      </p>
      <p>I fully expected Bianca Belair to hit the ring and obliterate everybody in this match. Sadly, I was wrong.</p>
      <p>Maybe Fire and Desire would have had a better chance of going over if Sonya Deville died her hair blonde.</p>
      <p>
        <b>King Corbin def. Roman Reigns</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Roman Reigns has been in a holding pattern for long enough that when he finally returns to the world championship picture it will feel refreshing. But, if he keeps taking these midcard losses, he might stay in that holding pattern.</p>
      <p>Roman Reigns “losing the locker room” WWE’s thinly veiled response to all that talk of “locker room leaders” coming out of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/11/03/wwe-superstars-continue-twitter-revolt-as-saudi-arabia-flight-finally-lands/">Saudi Arabi #Flightmare</a>.</p>
      <p>Are Dolph Ziggler and Bobby Roode going to be the first two members of King Corbin’s Court?</p>
