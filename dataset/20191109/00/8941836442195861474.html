      <p>SHIGA, Japan (AP) - Local favorite Ai <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/suzuki-motor-corporation/">Suzuki</a> shot a bogey-free 7-under 65 to take a three-stroke lead after the second round of the LPGA Japan Classic on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/suzuki-motor-corporation/">Suzuki</a> had seven birdies at the par-72 Seta Golf Course for a 12-under 132 total. Gaby Lopez shot a 67 and was in second place in the final event of the LPGA Tour’s Asia Swing.</p>
      <p>“I have to shoot more than 3 under to win the tournament,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/suzuki-motor-corporation/">Suzuki</a> said. “Usually winner scores low. Especially this week with this course, I think I have to play and score 5 to 6 under. That will be my target score tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Lopez finished birdie-birdie to secure a position in the final grouping on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It’s key to be below the hole on every single green,” Lopez said. “Everything slopes back to front. The more you are putting uphill the more aggressive you can be.”</p>

      <p>Australian Hannah Green, who held a share of the lead with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/suzuki-motor-corporation/">Suzuki</a> after the opening round on Friday, shot a 69 and was tied for third with Hyo Joo Kim (68).</p>
      <p>“The back end of the round I felt a lot more confident and I pushed myself to make sure I finished under par,” said Green who had three birdies on the back nine. “It was nice to finish birdie-birdie today because I didn’t do that yesterday.”</p>
      <p>Defending champion Nasa Hataoka struggled with her game and finished with a 76 that included five bogeys and a double bogey, after an opening-round 71.</p>
      <p>Lexi Thompson, making her first start since the Indy Women in Tech Championship in September, shot a 68 to move up the leaderboard after a first-round 74 and was 10 strokes behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/suzuki-motor-corporation/">Suzuki</a>.</p>
