      <p>PORTSMOUTH, Ohio (AP) - Ohio communities will be part of a $350 million federal study analyzing drug intervention techniques and policies.</p>
      <p>Ten Ohio counties will be among the first wave of communities participating in the National Institutes of Health’s HEALing Communities Study, The Portsmouth Daily Times reported.</p>
      <p>About $66 million will be channeled for the study through Ohio State University to Ashtabula, Athens, Cuyahoga, Darke, Greene, Guernsey, Hamilton, Lucas, Morrow and Scioto counties.</p>
      <p>The study will also look at communities in Kentucky, New York and Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>It will launch in December and is expected to last four years.</p>

      <p>Mike Martin, the health commissioner for Scioto County in southern Ohio, is grateful his county has been included.</p>
      <p>“What we are doing still clearly is not working as much as we might’ve hoped and prayed for,” Martin said. “We still have way too many people dying unnecessarily.”</p>
      <p>Martin said some of the study’s goals include reducing opioid deaths by 40%, expanding medically assisted treatment for opioid use disorder and reducing high-risk opioid prescribing.</p>
      <p>Federal officials hope the study will help government officials at all levels determine best practices for combatting a national opioid epidemic that has killed 400,000 people since 2000.</p>
