      <p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - The Latest on pressure from lawmakers and celebrities to call of the execution of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Rodney Reed</a> in Texas (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:05 p.m.</p>
      <p>The family of a Texas death row inmate whose conviction has come under new scrutiny say Republican <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Gov. Greg Abbott</a> needs to grant a reprieve at a rally outside his mansion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Rodney Reed</a> is scheduled to die later this month for the 1996 killing of a 19-year-old woman in Central Texas. But celebrities such as Beyoncé, religious leaders and Republican lawmakers say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Reed</a>’s conviction deserves a second look.</p>
      <p>Rodrick Reed, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Rodney</a>’s brother, told supporters outside <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Abbott</a>’s mansion on Saturday that they’re asking the governor to consider new evidence in the case.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p>Neither <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Abbott</a> nor his office have commented on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Reed</a>’s case.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Abbott</a> has overseen nearly 50 executions in Texas since becoming governor. He spared a condemned prisoner for the first time last year after the victims’ family asked for mercy.</p>

        <p>All eyes are on Texas Gov. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Greg Abbott</a> and whether he’ll allow the execution of a death row inmate to proceed despite pressure from lawmakers and celebrities to call it off.</p>
        <p>Supporters of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Rodney Reed</a> are set to rally Saturday outside the governor’s mansion in the state capital, Austin. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Reed</a> is scheduled to die later this month for the 1996 killing of a 19-year-old Stacy Stites.</p>
        <p>But new evidence in the case has led a growing number of Texas legislators, religious leaders and celebrities to press <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Abbott</a> to intervene ahead of the Nov. 20 execution.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/greg-abbott/">Abbott</a> hasn’t spoken publicly about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rodney-reed/">Reed</a>’s case. Some of his Republican allies who are pushing him to stop the execution say they trust the governor will be deliberative before making a decision.</p>
