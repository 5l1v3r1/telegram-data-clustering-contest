      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - New shuttle service for visitors debuted Saturday at Sabino Canyon Recreation Area on the outskirts of Tucson.</p>
      <p>Officials say the emission-free electric shuttles will operate hourly on the Sabino Canyon route between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. and that the service eventually will have five of the open-air vehicles capable of carrying up to 60 passengers.</p>

      <p>Partners in the new service include the U.S. Forest Service, Tucson Electric Power and Regional Partnering Center, the owner of the shuttles operated by Total Transit Enterprises/Total Ride.</p>
