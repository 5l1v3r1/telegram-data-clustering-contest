      <p><b>CHICAGOÂ (AP)</b> - Chante Stonewall had 23 points and 12 rebounds, Jolene Daninger scored 14 points and No. 18 DePaul beat Miami (Ohio) 98-79 on Friday night in the preseason WNIT.</p>
      <p>Stonewall, the Big East tournament's most outstanding player last year, scored six points during DePaul's 16-1 run to start the second quarter for a 44-14 lead. She finished 11 of 14 of the field in just 26 minutes as DePaul shot just 43.6 percent, but outrebounded Miami 53-35.</p>
      <p>Sonya Morris added 12 points and Lexi Held and Deja Church, a Michigan transfer, each scored 11 for DePaul. Coach Doug Bruno is five wins away from reaching the 700 plateau, joining Connecticut's Geno Auriemma and Villanova's Harry Perretta as the only active coaches to do so.</p>
      <p>Savannah Kluesner led Miami with 21 points and Peyton Scott added 15 in the season opener for both teams.</p>
