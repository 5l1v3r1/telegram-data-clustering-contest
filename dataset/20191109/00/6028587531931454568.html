        <b>Penn St at Minnesota (+7, 47)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Minnesota’s 8-0 season has drummed up murmurings of a potential Cinderella run. A look back at the schedule suggest that their journey up to this point has seen them face less than formidable opponents, and Saturday’s dance with Penn State will provide a solid litmus test to the potency of this teams potential.</p>
      <p>“This game should see a great atmosphere,” shared Martin. “However the noon eastern kickoff time doesn't help the Minnesota faithful. The Gophers’ schedule year to date consists of Maryland, Rutgers, Nebraska, Illinois, Purdue, Georgia Southern and Fresno St., and when your two toughest opponents hail from the Mountaint West and Sunbelt conferences, your perfect record starts to lose its shine.”</p>
      <p>“Lay the short number with the Nittany Lions.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Iowa St vs Oklahoma (-14.5, 68)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most public bettors are going to be drawn to the Sooners in this spot, with Oklahoma entering fresh off one of the biggest upsets of the season and likely eager to take their frustrations out on a lesser opponent.</p>
      <p>“The bounce-back factor situation might not be in play when you consider that both teams are off a bye week after losing outright as double digit favorites. Additionally, Iowa St. has had a much tougher schedule to date and all three of their losses were within one score.”</p>
      <p>Martin suggests backing the dog to stay within the number here.</p>
      <p>“I think Matt Campbell and his QB Brock Purdy stay within two touchdowns in Norman. I am on the underdog Cyclones.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Air Force vs New Mexico (+21, 56)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bob Davie is on his way out as the head coach for New Mexico, and given that he has ended his last two seasons with 7 game losing streaks, we have seen teams seemingly quit on him before.</p>
      <p>“When teams have "quit" in the past on a coach it is a great profile to bet against,” suggests Martin. “Air Force has one of the top rushing offenses in the country, and asking a Lobo defense that already has one foot out the door to stop the option for 60 minutes is a a tall task. This is an Air Force team with a shot at 10 wins on the season, and I am banking on the Falcons to fly past New Mexico big time.”</p>
