      <h1>Cockburn leads way as Illinois holds off Grand Canyon 83-71</h1>

      <p>PHOENIX (AP) - Illinois started its two-game desert road trip in one of the rowdiest environments in college basketball.</p>
      <p>Grand Canyon’s purple-clad “Havocs” spent the game bouncing, clapping and screaming, making it hard for the Illini to even hear each other during timeouts.</p>
      <p>Illinois survived the road havoc and now faces another, potentially tougher one at Arizona’s McKale Center.</p>
      <p>Kofi Cockburn had 23 points and 14 rebounds, Andres Feliz added 21 points and Illinois pulled away late to beat Grand Canyon 83-61 Friday night.</p>
      <p>“The homecourt atmosphere was everything it was rumored to be,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. “I told our players one of the advantages of a homecourt advantage is not only getting the home team ready, but they’re so disruptive in terms of communication.”</p>

      <p>Illinois (2-0) worked the ball inside to Cockburn early and that opened up the rest of the floor. The Illini led by four at halftime and stretched it to 14 with a big run to start the second half.</p>
      <p>Riding the energy from one of college basketball’s best home crowds, Grand Canyon (0-2) kept it close in the first half and made a late run to cut the Illini’s lead to four.</p>
      <p>Illinois kept the Antelopes at arm’s length from there to open a two-game trip to the desert with a win before facing No. 21 Arizona on Sunday</p>
      <p>Grand Canyon spread the floor to make a late run and made 8 of 19 from 3-point range.</p>

        <p>The Antelopes were no match for the Illini inside, outrebounded 52-26 while giving up 15 second-chance points on 20 offensive rebounds. Illinois also had a 44-32 advantage in the paint.</p>
        <p>Isiah Brown led Grand Canyon with 18 points and Jovan Blacksher Jr. added 14.</p>
        <p>“Disappointed, but really proud of my guys,” Grand Canyon coach Dan Majerle said. “They played with a lot of passion and heart, they played hard. It was a big step up in what we played the first game.”</p>
        <p>With 85% of their scoring back and a frenetic, turnover-producing defense, the Illini ratcheted up expectations entering their third season under Underwood.</p>
        <p>Illinois instead got it off to an inauspicious start, needing overtime to beat Nicholls at home in its opener.</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon got its seventh season under Majerle off to a shaky start, losing by 11 at home to Division II Davenport.</p>
        <p>The Antelopes have their smallest team under Majerle, so it was no surprise they had trouble stopping Cockburn inside. The 7-foot Jamaican freshman powered his way past GCU defenders throughout the first half, scoring 14 points on 5-of-8 shooting and grabbing seven rebounds by halftime</p>
        <p>“He’s an imposing figure,” Underwood said. “We’ve got to take advantage of that and I thought tonight we did.”</p>
        <p>When the Antelopes started closing in on Cockburn, Feliz took over, scoring 12 first-half points.</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon kept pace from the 3-point arc, where it struggled in the opener. The Lopes made 5 of 9 in the first half - they were 2 for 19 against Davenport - to stay within 41-37 at halftime.</p>
        <p>“I thought what did we needed to do early,” Underwood said. “We got a little bit sloppy at the end of the first half when we really had a chance to really take the next step.”</p>
        <p>Illinois hit its first six shots to open the second half on a 15-4 run, pushing the lead to 56-41.</p>
        <p>The Antelopes kept Illinois from running away with it, hanging around before trimming the lead to 71-67 with four minutes left.</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon couldn’t get any closer and had to play without Alessandro Lever after the center fouled out.</p>
        <p>“Our guys expected to win this game, so there’s a lot of disappointment in that locker room,” Majerle said.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Illinois played better than its opener and a solid tuneup for the more difficult game of the road trip, at No. 21 Arizona on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon had its hands full with Illinois’ size, but put up a better fight than it did in the opener.</p>
        <p>FREE THROW WOES</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon was good from the free throw line its opening loss, making 15 of 19. The Antelopes were not so good against Illinois, going 9 for 16.</p>
        <p>“That’s something we can control and we have to be better,” Majerle said.</p>
