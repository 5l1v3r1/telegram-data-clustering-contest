      <p>You can browse our full <b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events">NYC show calendar</a></b> for all of tonight’s shows, but here are some highlights…</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/slayer-announce-final-tour-dates-with-primus-ministry-phil-anselmo/">Slayer, Primus, Ministry, Philip H. Anselmo @ Madison Square Garden</a></b><br/>Thrash legends Slayer are saying this is their final tour, and if they really mean it, they’re going out with a bang. (Or more like: a flame, as they are using pyro in like every song.) As we witnessed at <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/slayers-final-chicago-show-at-riot-fest-was-straight-flames-review-setlist/">Riot Fest</a>, Slayer are still a force to be reckoned with. They’ve also lined up killer support, including Primus, Ministry, and former Pantera frontman Phil Anselmo (who will be playing Pantera songs).</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/vio-lence-add-nyc-shows-to-reunion-tour-bay-area-thrash-doc-coming-soon/">Vio-Lence, Zombie Apocalypse @ Brooklyn Bazaar</a></b><br/>After a long hiatus, thrash legends Vio-lence finally reunited, and they’ve been playing shows all year (we <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/psycho-vegas-2019-sunday-pics-recap-opeth-power-trip-integrity-uncle-acid-warhorse-more/">caught them at Psycho Las Vegas</a>, where they sounded great). They play their second NYC reunion show at Brooklyn Bazaar tonight.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/william-basinski-performing-8-hour-durational-at-issue-project-room/">William Basinski @ Issue Project Room</a></b><br/>Experimental musician William Basinski has become known for his lengthy, immersive compositions, and he’ll head to Issue Project Room tonight for a special career-spanning eight-hour performance, described as “a marathon sequence of past, recent, and new work amongst a site-specific light installation from artists Brock Monroe and Seth Kirby.”</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/twiabp-release-new-assorted-works-compilation-tour-starts-soon/">The World is a Beautiful Place &amp; I am No Longer Afraid To Die, Harmony Woods @ Amityville Music Hall</a></b><br/>Indie/emo/post-rock/etc collective The World Is A Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid To Die haven’t released new music in two years, but they just put out a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/twiabp-release-new-assorted-works-compilation-tour-starts-soon/">compilation of odds and ends</a> and they’re now on tour. Their unpredictable live show is always worth catching, and this tour should be no different. They play Long Island tonight after a Brooklyn show yesterday.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/chameleonsvox-touring-w-theatre-of-hate-and-jay-aston-gene-loves-jezebel/">ChameleonsVox, Theatre of Hate, Jay Aston @ Saint Vitus</a></b><br/>Former Chameleons frontman Mark Burgess is performing Chameleons songs under the name ChameleonsVOX these days, and he’ll bring decades of favorites to Saint Vitus. Fellow UK post-punk/goth vets Theatre of Hate and Jay Aston of Gene Loves Jezebel (who will perform acoustically) serve as openers.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11073453">Devon Welsh, Abandon @ Public Records</a></b><br/>Former Majical Cloudz vocalist Devon Welsh has continued solo since the project disbanded, releasing the great <i>Dream Songs</i> last year, and the just-as-good <i>True Love</i> this year. His emotional, sparse songs work best in intimate venues, and this show at Public Records should be no exception.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/taken-playing-rare-northeast-shows-with-state-faults-gatherers/">Taken, Gatherers, State Faults @ The Kingsland</a></b><br/>Post-hardcore greats Taken reunited and released their first new music in nearly 15 years last year, and now they’re finally playing NYC. It’s a great bill all around, including State Faults who ended their silence with their first album in six years this year.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/dwight-yoakam-on-tour-adds-nyc-show/">Dwight Yoakam @ Terminal 5</a></b><br/>Country icon Dwight Yoakam stops by Terminal 5 to perform songs from across his multi-decade career, including plenty of covers.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.bluenotejazz.com/newyork/schedule/index.shtml">Talib Kweli w/ live band ft special guests @ Blue Note (two shows)</a></b><br/>Talib Kweli continues his full-band Blue Note residency with two shows tonight. He’s promising some special guests at both shows, who are currently TBA.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/toro-y-moi-expands-fall-tour-w-channel-tres-playing-brooklyn-steel/">Toro y Moi, Channel Tres @ Brooklyn Steel</a></b><br/>Toro y Moi has proved to have a lot of longevity, even after the end of the chillwave era, and he is now set to bring his tour to Brooklyn Steel for the second of two sold-out shows. Opening is Channel Tres, who released the very good Black Moses EP in August.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11154686">Toro y Moi (DJ set), Riobamba, A. Ferraro, A. Woodward @ Elsewhere</a></b><br/>After playing Brooklyn Steel, Toro y Moi keeps the party going with a late-night DJ set at the nearby Elsewhere.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/samiam-add-dates-with-moving-targets-shades-apart-the-fus-garrett-klahn-more/">Samiam, Shades Apart, Tru, Died Out @ Crossroads</a></b><br/>Fresh off playing NYC, ‘90s emo/post-hardcore vets Samiam take their tour to NJ tonight, and making this show extra special is home state heroes Shades Apart opening.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11059723">Chris Cohen, Lina Tullgren, Lightning Bug @ Rough Trade</a></b><br/>Songwriter and onetime Deerhoof member Chris Cohen plays this Rough Trade show behind his dreamy, jangle pop-inspired self-titled album, released earlier this year. Opening are NYC artists Lina Tullgren, who released <i>Free Cell</i> on Captured Tracks in August, and psych/dreampop band Lightning Bug, whose new album <i>October Song</i> came out in September.</p>
      <p><b><a href="http://nyc-shows.brooklynvegan.com/events/11028634">Fat Heaven, Lone Wolf, Mikey Erg, The Young Rochelles @ Gold Sounds</a></b><br/>Gold Sounds hosts a punk bill tonight, including prolific cult artist Mikey Erg.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/ny-comedy-fest-adds-100-more-shows-to-2019-lineup-hasan-minhaj-pete-holmes-more/">New York Comedy Festival</a></b><br/>The 2019 New York Comedy Festival continues today, with dozens of shows happening across the city, including Bill Maher, Norm Macdonald, Las Culturistas/Seek Treatment, Trevor Wallace, Jena Friedman, and tons more.</p>
