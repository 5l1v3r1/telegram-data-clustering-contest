      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Nate-Diaz-11451">Nate Diaz</a> appears to be done with MMA again.<br/><br/>On his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4joEhVg6Aa/">Instagram</a> late Wednesday night, Diaz alluded to the idea that he was done with the sport. At UFC 244 this past weekend, Diaz dropped a doctor stoppage technical knockout to <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Jorge-Masvidal-7688">Jorge Masvidal</a> at the end of Round 3. Early in the fight, Masvidal opened up a sizeable cut above Diaz' eye, and as it continue to get worse throughout the bout, Doctor Nitin K. Sethi waved off the contest between rounds.<br/><br/>Diaz' <a href="https://twitter.com/NateDiaz209/status/1192350454816149504">post read</a>:<br/><br/><i>"F*ck a rematch this sh*t was over before it started. I'm goin on out on tour. Peace out fight game."</i><br/><br/>After the fight concluded, Diaz <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Nate-Diaz-Doesnt-Believe-Masvidal-Rematch-Will-Happen-Ive-Been-Here-Before-164933">lamented</a> that he would probably not receive an immediate rematch, claiming "I've been here before" in regards to not getting the fights he wants. While he and Masvidal both clamored for a rematch, UFC President Dana White was <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Dana-White-Not-Interested-in-Immediate-Rematch-Between-Jorge-Masvidal-Nate-Diaz-164913">reluctant</a> to sign off on that contest.<br/><br/>This would not be the first time Diaz has decided to remove himself from the sport, as he famously sat out for nearly three years from 2016 to 2019 following his two tilts with <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Conor-McGregor-29688">Conor McGregor</a>. Although he was <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Report-Nate-Diaz-Also-Off-UFC-230-Card-Following-Dustin-Poirier-Injury-Withdrawal-143687">linked to a matchup</a> against <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Dustin-Poirier-50529">Dustin Poirier</a> along the way, the withdrawal for Poirier frustrated Diaz to wait another nine months. He made his long-awaited return to MMA in August, when he beat former lightweight king <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Anthony-Pettis-26627">Anthony Pettis</a> by decision.</p>
