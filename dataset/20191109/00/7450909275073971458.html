      <p><i>Dazn is the exclusive streaming partner of Bellator MMA. <a href="https://bit.ly/2FOodGj">You can sign up here and live stream 100+ fight nights a year</a>.<br/><br/></i><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Bellator-MMA-1960">Bellator MMA</a> returned to Winstar World Casino in Thackerville, Oklahoma, Friday night and middleweights headlined the marquee.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/John-Salter-44683">John Salter</a> (17-4) continued his ascent back up the 185-pound ladder after losing to reigning champ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Rafael-Lovato-Jr-116967">Rafael Lovato Jr.</a> as he toppled The Netherlands’ <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Costello-van-Steenis-152859">Costello van Steenis</a> over three arduous rounds. Salter used his wrestling prowess to take “The Spaniard” down repeatedly and dominated the first two frames, but things got hairy in the third.<br/><br/>Van Steenis (12-2) came out of his corner aggressively in the final frame with kicks and knees, as well as heavy punches. Van Steenis rocked Salter with a few of his strikes and opened up a cut above the American’s right eye. With his gas tank depleting and in the midst of having the tides turned against him, Salter scored a desperate takedown with a minute left and rode out the clock. Even with van Steenis’ late surge, Salter had put enough in the bank to earn a unanimous decision with scores of 29-28 across the board, capping off a solid <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/events/Bellator-233-Salter-vs-van-Steenis-79753">Bellator 233</a> event on DAZN.</p>

      <h3>’King Mo’ Knocked Out in Final Bout</h3>
      <p>It was supposed to be a glorious swan song for <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Muhammed-Lawal-29858">Muhammed Lawal</a>, but it didn’t end the way he wanted.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Andrew-Kapel-39691">Andrew Kapel</a> sent “King Mo” into retirment by knocking the longtime veteran out cold in the opening frame. After Lawal (21-10, 1 NC) absorbed a front kick to the grill and a few scattered punches, the decorated wrestler tried getting inside with punches. However, when the former <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Strikeforce-716">Strikeforce</a> champion ducked down, he walked directly into a right-handed missile that exploded on his chin. Lawal spun around and fell flat on his back, which prompted Kapel (15-6) to finish him off with follow-up punches, ending the catchweight battle in just 82 seconds.</p>
      <h3>Blencowe Dominates ‘Peacemaker’</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Arlene-Blencowe-131845">Arlene Blencowe</a> looked fabulous in turning away <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/organizations/Ultimate-Fighting-Championship-2">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a> veteran <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Leslie-Smith-46542">Leslie Smith</a> after three hard-fought rounds.<br/><br/>The Aussie avoided takedowns throughout the bout and outstruck “Peacemaker” nearly every time they traded blows. While Smith (11-8-1) landed plenty of stinging punches in her own right, it was Blencowe (13-7) that landed the harder, more telling blows. In the end, all three judges saw it the same: 30-27 for “Angerfist.”</p>

      <h3>Fortune Stays Unblemished</h3>
      <p>In the opening bout of the main card, heavyweight prospect <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Tyrell-Fortune-204623">Tyrell Fortune</a> remained perfect as a pro as he vanquished Africa’s <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Azunna-Anyanwu-68352">Azunna Anyanwu</a> in the second stanza.<br/><br/>After an uneventful opening frame, Fortune (8-0) cracked his opponent with a straight right to the face. Anyanwu (15-6) stumbled backward and from there, Fortune unloaded punches to the head, followed his foe to the ground and finished him with a barrage of fists. The end came officially at 1:56 of the Round 2.</p>
