      <h1>11 Free Programs To Help Veterans Succeed As Entrepreneurs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gerri Detweiler</a></address>
      <p>Veteran-owned businesses are an important engine of economic growth. New research from <a href="https://www.experian.com/business-information/landing/state-of-veteran-business-owners.html?cmpid=bis-20-us-vbo-webinar&amp;sf_code=7010H0000023bSS&amp;utm_source=referral&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bis-20-us-vbo-webinar">Experian</a> has found that veterans tend to own and operate business with a larger employee base, and veteran-owned businesses have better longevity and sustainability than non veteran-owned business. (Experian analyzed and compared the credit data of veteran-owned businesses and non-veteran-owned businesses from 2015 through July 2019.) Nearly 25% of veterans express interest in starting a business. That’s the good news. The bad news is entrepreneurship among younger veterans is on the decline. <a href="https://bunkerlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Veteran-Entrepreneur-Ecosystem-A-Bunker-Labs-White-Paper-rev2.pdf">A report by Bunker Labs</a> suggests one way to foster veteran entrepreneurship is through an “ecosystem” approach: “Taking an ecosystem approach to facilitating entrepreneurship requires ensuring that there is relationship density, strong network effects, and connected resources for entrepreneurs.” </p>
