      <p>There’s more than a little familiarity surrounding Sunday afternoon’s 2019 MLS Cup final, the third contested between the Seattle Sounders and Toronto FC, teams that just might be the MLS’ version of the prolific 1970s Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys squads that helped popularize the NFL.At the same time, it’s not exactly something the league has seen before.</p>
      <p>While D.C. United and the LA Galaxy traded blows during MLS’ very early days, neither ever captivated its city as Seattle and Toronto do for theirs now. And whoever wins this rubber-match of a final after they spilt their 2016 and 2017 title games could be laying the groundwork to be considered the next MLS dynasty after the Galaxy’s reign ended following their fifth MLS Cup in 2014.</p>
      <p>More concretely, there’s also quite a bit of individual and team history that is on the line Sunday, even if the final fixture feels like we’ve been here before</p>
      <h3>Nick DeLeon, The ‘Big Shot Bob’ Of MLS?</h3>
      <p>In his first season with Toronto, fullback Nick DeLeon has rediscovered the offensive promise he hasn’t showed since his 2012 rookie campaign with D.C. United. And if he scores Sunday in his first postseason with The Reds, he would seal his place as one of MLS’ greatest clutch playoff performers, with a penchant for scoring in huge moments much the way NBA forward Robert Horry did during his playoff career.</p>
      <p>Simlar to Horry, a regular season role-player who earned the nickname <a href="https://unpluggdwithngl.com/a-series-of-fortunate-events-looking-back-on-the-curious-career-of-robert-horry-f4ec1d4d050f">“Big Shot Bob”</a> for hitting some huge postseason shots, DeLeon has scored some incredible goals among his six playoff tallies. (Unlike Horry, who has an incredible seven NBA championships, DeLeon has never won MLS Cup, though he does have a U.S. Open Cup to his name.</p>
      <p>DeLeon’s most memorable playoff strike may still be his first, which decided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1RG6O4tHZg&amp;t=21s">an epic 2012 Eastern Conference semifinal tie</a> between D.C. United and the New York Red Bulls. His most recent, the 2019 Eastern Conference decider from distance against Atlanta United shown in the video above, was nearly as stunning. And his cracking, extra-time equalizer in the 2018 knock out round for D.C. against Columbus shown below was only overshadowed because D.C. eventually succumbed on penalties.</p>
      <p>Further, DeLeon’s previous two goals this postseason have come off the bench, making him the seventh player in MLS history to score twice in the same postseason as a sub. If he scores off the bench as third time, he would be the first ever to do so.</p>
      <p>Even if he scores as a starter Sunday, DeLeon would be the first MLS player ever to reach seven postseason goals before his 20th regular season tally. He’s already tied for second-highest among those with fewer than 30 regular season goals:</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Greg Vanney’s Sneaky Longevity</h3>
      <p>In terms of age, Toronto FC coach Greg Vanney is somewhere near the mean among the current cohort of MLS managers. But if he can win a second MLS Cup, he’ll join a club related to MLS coaching longevity that has exactly two members. Himself, and the league’s only five-time MLS Cup winning coach, Bruce Arena.</p>
      <p>Vanney and Arena would be the only two coaches in league history to win an MLS Cup later than five years into their tenures with a given club. Vanney was hired midway through the 2014 campaign and thus is technically in his sixth season with The Reds. Arena was in his seventh season with the Galaxy when they won their third MLS Cup under his guidance in 2014.</p>
      <p>The vast majority of MLS Cups – 16 of 23 in fact – have been won by coaches no more than three years into their club tenures at the time. Only two coaches – Arena twice in 2012 and 2014, and Peter Vermes in the year in between – have won MLS Cup as deep as their fifth season with a team.</p>

      <h3>How Many Seats Acutally Are There?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Seattle Sounders have already announced Sunday’s noontime local kickoff <a href="https://www.soundersfc.com/post/2019/11/01/sounders-fc-announces-centurylink-field-sellout-november-10-mls-cup-final-against">will be a sell-out</a>, with every seat CenturyLink Field open just as they are for the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks. Now the question is whether they can find enough extra seats to surpass last year’s MLS Cup attendance record set by Atlanta United.</p>
      <p>Some 73,019 fans watched Atlanta defeat the Portland Timbers 2-0 to win their first title in club history at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. That’s more than 1,000 fans more than the listed capacity of The Link in Seattle. But it’s also more than 2,000 fans more than the listed capacity of The Benz in Atlanta. In other words, there is usually a little wiggle room to these totals, so the record would seem in play.</p>
      <p>At worst, the match is a sure bet to be the second-most attended MLS Cup in league history.</p>
