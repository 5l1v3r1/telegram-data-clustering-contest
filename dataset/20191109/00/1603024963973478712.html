        <b>Desi bike companies ditch Auto Expo but head to international shows</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the first time in several years, Hero Motocorp, the country’s largest two-wheeler maker, will not participate in the Indian Auto Expo due to be held in the first week of February of 2020.</p>
      <p>Visitors will miss out on the concept models that the Delhi-based company showcases in every edition of the biennial show even though very few of them actually made it to the production lines set up in Haryana.</p>
      <p>Hero reasoned that it cannot afford to fund its participation costs at the India Auto Expo while keeping in mind the financial challenges thrown in by the prolonged downturn in demand.</p>
      <p>The year 2020 will also mark the third consecutive absence of Eicher Motors-controlled niche bike brand Royal Enfield from the India Auto Expo. The brand last participated in the mega event in 2014.</p>
      <p>But both Hero Motocorp and Royal Enfield spared no expense at the more expensive EICMA (International Motorcycle and Accessories Exhibition) motor show held in Milan this week. EICMA is the world’s biggest, two-wheeler-focused trade show, offering 280,000 sq meter, even bigger than India Auto Expo with 185,000 sq meter space.</p>
      <p>Together both companies displayed concept bikes and scooters some of which are planned to go into production while others were only for display to show the technological prowess that they have. Both companies were keen on making a noise at the world level and that is why financial resources had to be diverted.</p>
      <p>When compared to the India Auto Expo on cost terms, EICMA is much ahead. The cost of owning a stall at the India Auto Expo is Rs 8,900/sqmtr. This cost balloon’s up to Euro 182,000/sq meter at EICMA. Compulsory registration fees of Euro 250,000 and insurance fee of Euro 100,000 are additional costs at EICMA.</p>
      <p>Companies like Honda, Triumph, KTM, Harley-Davidson, Peugeot Motorcycle, BMW Motorrad, who are also not participating in the Auto Expo, had their massive stalls at EICMA. However, for these foreign brands, Europe is a huge market and they have specialized models that are not on sale in India.</p>
      <p>With the exception of Turkey, Hero does not have any presence in the European market. The company is present in Latin America and Africa. Its blueprint of international expansion for the next few years does not feature Europe. Hero did showcase the Xtreme 1.R concept at the EICMA this week, which won’t go into production.</p>
      <p>Royal Enfield, however, is rapidly expanding base in Europe. It has sales operations in several countries like the UK, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Germany to name a few. The maker of Continental GT, Himalayan and Classic ships fully built motorcycles from its factory in Chennai to these export markets. Royal Enfield even has a technology centre established in the UK.</p>
      <p>Looking at these trends, should more Indian companies follow suit? Are the Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra company listening?<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
