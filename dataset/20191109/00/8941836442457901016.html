      <p>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) - Authorities in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bangladesh/">Bangladesh</a> put more than 50,000 volunteers on standby and readied about 5000 shelters as a strong cyclone in the Bay of Bengal is expected to hit the low-lying nation’s vast southwestern and southern coast on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The weather office in Dhaka issued the most severe storm signal for Cyclone Bulbul, packing maximum sustained winds of 74 kilometers (46 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 150 kph (93 mph).</p>
      <p>It said the southwestern Khulna region could be worst hit. The region has the world’s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans.</p>
      <p>Junior Minister for Disaster Management, Enamur Rahman, said government offices suspended work in 13 coastal districts.</p>
      <p>As the day progressed, the volunteers used loudspeakers to ask people to move to shelters in Chittagong and other regions, according to the ministry. In Cox’s Bazar coastal district, local tourists were alerted to stay in hotels while a few hundred visitors were stuck on Saint Martins Island.</p>
