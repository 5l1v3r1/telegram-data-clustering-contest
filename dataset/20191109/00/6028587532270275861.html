      <p>Perfectly timed with MLBs postseason zenith, the 2019 Topps Update Baseball set marries the excitement of World Series baseball with an incredible season retrospective. The anticipated series bookends Topps’ flagship set by celebrating mid-season trades, the All-Star Game and a talented rookie class. With Ronald Acuña Jr. and Juan Soto's superstar emergence this season, collectors fixated on their 2018 Topps Update Baseball rookie cards. Both base versions reached over $20, with the Acuña Jr. “Bat Down” variation fetching near $300. Fans hoping to stash away this year’s Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Austin Riley’s flagship rookies have loaded up on 2019 Topps Update Baseball in anticipation of their future stardom. Beckett contributor Joey Shiver explained why Topps Update has grown to prominence amongst Topps' sets.</p>
      <p>“Collectors have always enjoyed rookie cards,” Shiver said via e-mail. “The Update release has featured some of the most popular rookie cards in recent years, dating back to Mike Trout in 2011. The ability to pull rookies that may not have made it into Series 1 and 2 is very appealing. A lot of collectors use Topps flagship as their set to build each year, and the inclusion of the mid-year hot rookies in the Update series makes them ‘must-have’ cards.”</p>
      <p>While there is a strong rookie contingency within 2019 Topps Update Baseball, the rare short-printed variations have also garnered much attention. These variations, either in the form of different action shots or legends substituted for the base versions, can be as rare as 1:622 packs. With both Guerrero Jr. and Riley among the rookies who have these hidden short prints, Shiver feels collectors will be on the hunt during the offseason.</p>
      <p>“Besides the rookie class, my favorite thing about 2019 is the variation chase,” he said. “Even if it is a relatively bland SP, I always enjoy finding those cards that are a little different than the base versions. … There is something fun about unique cards that aren’t found in every pack.”</p>
      <p>Topps Update Baseball’s configuration honors collecting tradition by offering a complete set within a 24-pack box. After digging through a review box, a complete 300-card set was an exciting reality that further justified its $80 price tag.</p>
      <p>Each box also holds a variety of inserts and guarantees either one relic or autographed card. The 1984 Topps 35th Anniversary and 150 Years of Professional Baseball inserts continue a popular theme from their earlier flagship releases and the new issues such as Est. 1869 and The Family Business both deserve a second look.</p>
      <p>Topps addressed an industry concern by including one Silver Pack directly in each sealed hobby box. Previously, card shops distributed these Silver Packs directly to customers who bought a sealed box. After some dealers were opening the Silver Packs early or backdooring them to customers, Topps took control by placing the packs directly into the boxes.</p>

      <p>The product’s season-end release adds momentum for the cold winter months, leaving fans with a rookie base to track approaching spring training. Shiver said 2019 Topps Update Baseball's future stars could distinguish it as a landmark set to cap the decade.</p>
      <p>“I think 2019 ranks near the top releases over the last ten years just because of the depth of the rookie class,” Shiver said. “This could simply be a result of recency bias, but I think this rookie class will hold a lot of interest with collectors for the next few years.”</p>
