      <p>Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado received a coveted defensive award Friday night, sharing the stage with a high school teammate and another elite third baseman at a ceremony in New York.Both Arenado and Oakland’s Matt Chapman were repeat winners of the Platinum Glove Award. Arenado was two years ahead of Chapman at El Toro High School in Lake Forest, Calif.</p>
      <p>Both players were surprised when Mike Gonzales, their coach at El Toro, made a surprise appearance and presented the awards to the players.</p>
      <p>“It’s huge. It’s such an honor (and) such a proud moment for myself and my family,” Gonzales said to MLB.com. “Being a part of these guys’ careers and to see how compassionate they are with our family and my kids, to see their work ethic and to see them mature as young men just makes me so proud, knowing that I’ve known them since they were 12, 13 years old. The people they’ve grown up to be is just tremendous.”</p>
      <p>This is the third consecutive year Arenado has won the National League Platinum Glove and the second straight AL Platinum for Chapman.</p>
      <p>Candidates for the Platinum Glove are the 18 Gold Glove winners in both leagues. The Platinum Award determines the best defensive player in each league and originated in 2011. Winners are chosen by a combination of fan votes and the Society for American Baseball Research’s defensive index, which considers a fielder’s range, his arm and his sure-handedess, along with his outstanding plays, using metrics such as reaction time, the amount of ground covered and the velocity of throws.</p>
      <p>Arenado, 28, is one month shy of seven full years in the major leagues and has won a Gold Glove in each of those seven seasons. He is the first infielder in major league history to win a Gold Glove in seven seasons to start his career. Chapman has won the Gold Glove for American League third basemen in both of his two full seasons with the A’s.</p>
      <p>The Rockies drafted Arenado in the second round out of El Toro in 2009 after he played shortstop in high school. Chapman, 26, played the same position in high school and went to Cal State Fullerton before Oakland selected him in the first round in 2014.</p>
      <p>“I talk to these guys all the time,” Gonzales said. “They’re always so generous with their time with myself and my family. I have two boys who play baseball, so they’re always at their beck and call if they ever need anything. It’s just a great relationship. They’ve always stayed grounded. They never forget where they came from. It’s just a great friendship they’ve grown to have.”</p>
      <p>Arenado and Chapman only compete against each other in interleague play, and the Rockies and A’s last played in 2018 and do not meet in 2020. But theirs is an unbroken bond made even stronger by their defensive excellence at the same position and their Platinum Glove Awards.</p>
      <p>“Thank God we’ve been able to stay healthy this year to go out and compete every day,” Arenado said. “There are so many great ballplayers won won Gold Gloves and so many players who didn’t win Gold Gloves who are so good. So to be voted by (the fans) is a seriously unreal feeling. It’s pretty surreal. But we’ve just got to continue to work hard and hopefully make it happen again.”</p>
