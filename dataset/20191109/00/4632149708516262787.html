      <p><i>Elderly man gets hacked with machete for advising neighbour to give up liquor</i> <br/><br/>The Sarjapura police were in for a shock when a 40-year-old man walked into the station with a blood-soaked machete and a blood-stained shirt, wanting to confess and surrender for killing a man. The accused claimed that he had killed the man because he had advised him to give up drinking and be a responsible father and husband. <br/><br/>After interrogating the man, the police rushed to the location where the incident had taken place, accompanied by the accused. <br/><br/>On reaching there, they found the victim, lying unconscious, bleeding profusely. <br/><br/>The victim was rushed to a nearby private hospital and an emergency surgery was performed on him. He has survived the gruesome murder attempt on him. <br/><br/>According to the police, the accused is a habitual drunkard and is alleged to have been creating nuisance in the area when the victim had advised him to change and give up drinking. The accused is married and is the father of two young children and the victim was trying to advise him to give up drinking for the sake of his family. <br/><br/>The victim has been identified as K Chikkaveerappa, a resident of Sarja­pura. The incident happened at the victim’s land located in the same area. The accused, identified as L Ravi, 40, has been arrested and the machete which was used for the gruesome murder attempt has been recovered. The incident happened last week between 8.45 and 9 in the morning. <br/><br/>“My father is still recovering. He had to undergo surgery on his head and has about 25 to 30 stitches. The accused who resides near our house is a habitual drunkard and creates trouble for everybody. A few days prior to the incident, Ravi had troubled my father while he was sitting outside our house. My father had advised him not to drink and to take care of his family. Since then, he had started abusing my father asking him to mind his own business. Last week, when my father was at the farm, the accused went there, picked up a fight and attacked him with a machete,” said the victim’s son, Kantharaju. <br/><br/>When the old man collapsed, Ravi assumed he was dead and walked into the police station with the bloody machete to confess the crime and surrender. <br/><br/>“I heard about the incident when someone saw my injured father lying in the field and called me. I went to the spot and found my father unconscious. <br/><br/>He was immediately shifted to a nearby private hospital, where he was in the ICU for almost five days. He is still recovering. Ravi creates trouble for everyone and is always under the influence of alcohol,” Kantharaju added. <br/><br/>Ravi who has been arrested and remanded to judicial custody has been booked for attempt to murder (IPC 307) and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace (IPC 504). <br/><br/>“During the questioning, Ravi claimed that the old man had attacked him. To avenge the attacked, Ravi said he used his machete to hack the old man. We have discovered that the accused is a habitual trouble maker,” said an officer who is a part of the investigation. The Sarjapura police have registered a case and investigations are on.</p>
