      <p>CODY, Wyo. (AP) - A deadly virus has led to a quarantine at a Wyoming animal shelter.</p>
      <p>The Park County Animal Shelter in Cody began a three-week quarantine Monday after a litter of kittens came in carrying the disease feline parvo.</p>
      <p>None of the shelter’s dozens of cats may leave and no more may enter during the quarantine.</p>
      <p>The outbreak has killed at least 15 kittens, including all nine in the infected litter.</p>
      <p>Shelter manager Valerie Swensrund tells the Cody Enterprise a vaccine nearly eradicated the disease but some people have stopped vaccinating their cats.</p>
