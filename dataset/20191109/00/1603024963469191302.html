      <p>The Gurudwara Kartarpur Sahib is located across Ravi River in Pakistan and is about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district of Punjab, India.</p>
      <p>The inauguration of the corridor comes in the midst of frayed ties between India and Pakistan following New Delhi's decision in August to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcate the state into two Union Territories.</p>
