      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - FBI agents in Oregon say the number of computer-related crimes has soared in the state, with losses surpassing $24 million this year alone.</p>
      <p>Most of the money has been stolen by organized crime groups targeting individuals and employees of organizations with access to a lot of money. They trick victims into making wire transfers to bank accounts controlled by the criminals.</p>
      <p>The FBI said Friday that in 2018, $12.4 million was stolen from victims in Oregon using this so-called business email compromise. From January through Sept. 30 of 2019, losses totaled around $12 million, on track to exceed last year. Other cybercrimes include romance scams and extortion.</p>
