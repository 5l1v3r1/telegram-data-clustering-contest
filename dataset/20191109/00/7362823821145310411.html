      <h1>MSNBC host gets laughed at by Wisconsin gun owners when asked about buybacks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:16:54+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">MSNBC</a> host Ali Velshi was laughed at by Wisconsin gun owners when he asked them about gun buybacks, which have been floated by several <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 Democratic candidates</a>.</p>
      <p>Mandatory buybacks have become a prominent stance among progressive candidates ever since former congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has since dropped out of the race, declared that he'd confiscate AR-15s and AK-47s at the September presidential debate.</p>
      <p>Other candidates who have supported mandatory gun buybacks include Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, D-Calif., and Sen.<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a>, D-N.J.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Velshi sat down with a panel of eight gun owners in Beaver Dam, Wisc., and asked them about the popular progressive policy.</p>
      <p>“Let me ask you about a proposal that's been floated out there by a presidential candidate or more about gun buybacks," Velshi <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/nicholas-fondacaro/2019/11/07/wisconsin-gun-owners-laugh-when-msnbc-host-suggests-buybacks">said</a>. “Who thinks that's a good idea?"</p>
      <p>That sparked audible laughs and chuckles from the panel.</p>
      <p>"I just bought mine for a million bucks, so if they're willing to pay me that..." one gun owner told Velshi.</p>

      <p>When asked if the issue of gun rights was in the "top three" election issues going into 2020, four of them raised their hands.</p>
      <p>"Don't mess with my rights to protect my family by trying to take away my firearms," another gun owner said.</p>
