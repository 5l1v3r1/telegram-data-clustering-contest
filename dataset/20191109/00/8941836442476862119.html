      <p>MOSCOW (AP) - Ukrainian and separatist rebel officials say both sides have begun pulling back forces and equipment from a frontline area of the conflict that has killed more than 13,000 people in the past five years.</p>
      <p>The Saturday pullback in the Petrivske area follows two similar movements in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces have been fighting since 2014. The withdrawals are seen as a significant step that could lead to a summit of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany on ending the conflict.</p>
      <p>The Petrivske movement initially was set for last weekend, but Ukraine called that off because of what it said were cease-fire violations by the rebels.</p>
