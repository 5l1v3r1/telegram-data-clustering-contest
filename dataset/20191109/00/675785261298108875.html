      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T00:01:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Ellis, Jason Beattie, =, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-ellis/, https://www.facebook.com/Jason-Beattie-148163672552769/</a></address>
      <p>The savage Tory education cuts are hitting Labour areas the hardest, analysis shows.</p>
      <p>And of the small number of places where schools are better off than in 2015, the vast majority are Conservative constituencies.</p>
      <p>The probe shows there are just 18 of 533 Parliamentary constituencies in England where per-pupil funding will be higher in real terms in 2020 than five years before. Thirteen of them are Tory areas.</p>
      <p>Only three of the 20 worst hit places are Tory – 16 are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>.</p>
      <p>Head teacher Anne Swift said: “The words of the Prime Minister about levelling up funding ring very hollow for head teachers who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>

      <p>“It’s a scandal. We are having to make redundant teaching assistants who support children with special educational needs... or schools are closing early.</p>
      <p>“We’re depriving children of their entitlement to a good education and it is hugely frustrating for [us] not to give them what they need.</p>
      <p>“When schools in deprived areas are having to ask their already deprived parents for extra funds, that’s hardly a levelling up.”</p>
      <p>She is based in Scarborough, North Yorks, where real terms per-pupil funding is down £343 annually, putting it 143rd on the list. The analysis by the National Education Union shows the worst hit constituency is Dulwich and West Norwood, with a yearly funding loss of £782 per pupil.</p>
      <p>Birmingham has been severely affected. All 10 constituencies are losing out – with nine of them in the 100 most severely affected.</p>

      <p>School funding has been slashed by £7billion since the Tories came to power in 2010.</p>
      <p>The shortfall has forced schools to lay off staff and beg parents for money for essentials such as stationery and toilet paper.</p>
      <p>Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: “A Labour government will fully reverse Tory cuts and give our schools the funding they need.” NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said its league table “should send shockwaves through the country”.</p>
      <p>But Tory David Morris said: “NEU claims about schools funding can’t be trusted. We are boosting schools funding by £14billion over the next three years, meaning every pupil in every school will get more money.”</p>
      <p>The PM made an election visit to George Spencer Academy, in Notts, as he tries to convince voters of his school cash claims.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> will announce today Labour would open 1,000 Sure Start centres to boost young families. Around 1,000 of the vital community centres were shut under Tory cuts.</p>
      <p>Labour would also double free childcare for two- to four-year-olds to 30 hours a week. Mr Corbyn said: “The Conservatives are failing a whole generation of children.”</p>
      <p>Labour has slammed Mr Johnson for saying Northern Ireland businesses can put customs declarations forms “in the bin” as there will be “no barriers of any kind” to trade crossing the Irish Sea should his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> deal be passed.</p>

      <p>He suggested Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay was wrong to say goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would face checks. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson “doesn’t understand the deal he has negotiated or he isn’t telling the truth – probably both”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> ’s plans for a post-Brexit trade deal could be blocked if it exposed the NHS to predatory US drug firms, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> leader Nicola Sturgeon has said.</p>
      <p>On the campaign trail yesterday Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage called again for Mr Johnson to ditch his Brexit deal in order for the two parties to agree an electoral pact.</p>
      <p>It came as several of Labour’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> candidates stood down over offensive comments.</p>
