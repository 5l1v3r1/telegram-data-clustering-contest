After Foss couldn’t defend himself intelligently anymore, referee <a href="https://www.sherdog.com/fighter/Peter-Lavery-21658">Peter Lavery</a> called a stop to the action at the 1:03 mark of the first round. “Skeletor” is now on a three-fight winning streak, with all of those victories coming by stoppage under the Cage Warriors banner.</p>
