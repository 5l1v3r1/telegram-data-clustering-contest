      <p>Just one week after their 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, interims coach Hansi Flick has resurrected Bayern Munich. The Bavarians smashed their closest rivals Borussia Dortmund 4-0 in front of 75,000 spectators at the Allianz Arena.“Hansi Flick will remain our coach for the foreseeable future,” Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. “[Flick] said before the game, the two games are the finish line. He crossed the finish line today, I would say, with flying colors. And now we will calmly continue with him.”</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich parted way with head coach <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/manuelveth/2019/11/04/niko-kovac-departure-exposes-structural-problems-at-bayern-munich/#572e993f4786">Niko Kovač after the club’s 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt one week ago</a>. Flick was installed as an interims solution and was supposed to be replaced during the international break.</p>
      <p>The German record champions headed into the game with a makeshift defense against a Borussia Dortmund side that was fantastic on Tuesday in their 3-2 win over Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Winless at the Allianz Arena since April 2014, Dortmund players Mats Hummels and Axel Witsel promised a strong performance against Bayern. Sporting director Michael Zorc, in the meantime, demanded masculine football—a statement that was heavily criticized by many members of the German media.</p>
      <p>Dortmund felt that they were the favourites against a Bayern side forced to start left-back David Alaba as a center-back and 19-year-old Canadian Alphonso Davies as a left-back. The back four was complemented by Javi Martínez and Benjamin Pavard, all four would be excellent.</p>

      <p>Dortmund, in the meantime, was in the game, for just ten minutes and then Bayern took control. In the 17th minute, Robert Lewandowski scored the opener, it was his 15th goal in 11 Bundesliga games this season, and a new record—he became the first player to score in 11 consecutive Bundesliga games.</p>
      <p>Bayern kept on attacking against a hapless Dortmund side, forcing head coach Lucien Favre into making a change in the 36th minute when he replaced Jadon Sancho with Raphaël Guerreiro—Sancho went into the game with an injury and was played off the park by Davies.</p>
      <p>Dortmund kept the score close until the 49th minute when Serge Gnabry made it 2-0. The goal was reviewed but ultimately stood.</p>
      <p>Lucien Favre made further changes, adding Marco Reus and Paco Alcacér for Julian Weigl and Mario Götze in the 60th minute. Alcacér then had Dortmund’s first, and ultimately only chance, in the 68th minute—disappointing given Bayern’s defensive problems heading into the match. Just eight minutes later, Lewandowski scored his 16th goal of the season, and then in the 80th minute, it was all over when Hummels scored an own goal.</p>
      <p>From the ranks, Bayern fans were chanting: “Who will win the championship? BVB Borussia, hey!” Mocking their rivals, who had traveled to Munich with big promises. Dortmund fans, in the meantime, booed and whistled their players on the final whistle.</p>
      <p>“Bayern were better; I think we had a good first quarter of an hour, then a couple of good minutes when Paco and Marco came in,” Hummels said after the game. “That's it; we were not brave enough. We made many technical mistakes. We just weren't good enough.”</p>
      <p>“We need to forget this game,” Witsel said. “I don’t know when the last time Dortmund won here. It’s been many years. Let’s just forget and try to do better next season.”</p>
      <p>“This wasn’t masculine football,” Zorc said when asked about his controversial statement ahead of the game. “It was no football at all.” The sporting director, however, protected his coach, Lucien Favre, stating that the players were the problem and not the head coach.</p>
      <p>Favre was somewhat lost for words after the game, however. “They were simply better than us,” Favre said. “We were so bad. It's unbelievable.”</p>
      <p>The Borussia Dortmund coach was under fire earlier this season but seemed to have stabilized his side with good performances against Borussia Mönchengladbach (2-1), Wolfsburg (3-0) and Inter.</p>

      <p>The manner of his side’s defeat will once again kindle rumors that Dortmund could be looking for a new head coach—José Mourinho is a friend of Hans-Joachim Watzke and has been learning German.</p>
      <p>Hansi Flick, in the meantime, was in a good mood after the game. The interims coach will now be in the saddle until at least the Fortuna Düsseldorf game, perhaps even longer as Bayern’s preferred option, Ajax coach Erik ten Hag, will not be available until the summer.</p>
      <p>“I'm thrilled because we did exactly what we had to do,” Flick said after the game. “We played football that fans here are used to and want to see.”</p>
      <p>The players are also happy to continue with Flick. Captain Manuel Neuer even compared Flick to Liverpool coach Jürgen Klopp. “He is a people catcher,” Neuer said. “I have worked with him since 2009; he gives us confidence.”</p>
      <p>"Now we have time to work,” Robert Lewandowski said. “We analyzed a lot, especially the transition from defense to attack. He helped us a lot in a short time. I think he is a good option.” </p>
