      <h1>House on Benefits Street up for sale for £100k - and it's a right tip</h1>
      <h2>You can now bag yourself a bargain terrace on the road that was thrust into the spotlight during a Channel 4 reality show that made residents unlikely celebrities</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T05:30:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Cathrina Hulse-BM</a></address>
      <p>It's the famous road that made unlikely stars of residents including White Dee, Fungi and Smoggy.</p>
      <p>Now a buyer with cash to spare and forward vision can snap up a two-bedroom terrace on James Turner Street in Winson Green for offers over £100,000.</p>
      <p>But there's a snag - the house is in a complete and utter state.</p>
      <p>The road hit the headlines in 2014 when <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/benefits-street">Benefits Street </a>burst onto our screens.</p>
      <p>The reality TV shone the spotlight on the lives of people living in <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/benefits-street">James Turner Street</a>. It showed the struggles of Brummies living on the poverty line but also revealed the camaraderie of residents.</p>
      <p>Now potential buyers have the chance to by their very own home on Benefits Street after details were posted on the Rightmove website. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Yet from the wild, overgrown rear garden to the grubby, stained bathroom, this property needs plenty of TLC.</p>
      <p>The end terrace has two bedrooms, a lounge, dining room, kitchen and a downstairs bathroom.</p>
      <p>Take a look below to see the keenly priced property in all its glory.</p>
      <h3>Lounge</h3>

        <figcaption>The lounge at James Turner Street</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>The wallpaper is peeling and the room has been used as a bedroom with a double bed still in situ.</p>
      <p>If the new owner can look past the old-fashioned fireplace, battered chests of drawers and rubbish littering the frayed carpet, the room is a decent size.</p>
      <h3>Kitchen</h3>

        <figcaption>The kitchen at James Turner Street</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>A renovation nightmare! An off-white paint adorns the walls of the typical terrace-type kitchen which has some built in cupboards and black worktop.</p>
      <p>There is a radiator, cupboards and a sink. But there is clutter galore, with the kitchen littered with plates, food and rubbish.</p>
      <h3>Downstairs bathroom</h3>

      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>The kitchen leads through to the downstairs bathroom which, again, needs a good paint job.</p>
      <p>For your money, you will inherit a filthy bath - and the room is in need of another BIG clean-up. </p>
      <h3>Dining room</h3>

        <figcaption>The dining room in James Turner Street.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>This main room is filled with furniture and clutter including a black chair, table and black bags.</p>
      <p>The ceiling is peeling and the room feels in need of a proper makeover.</p>
      <h3>Bedroom One</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Bedroom one at James Turner Street.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Holes in walls and a missing door.</p>
      <p>This is the kind of bedroom that could give you nightmares!</p>
      <p>But size is a bonus.</p>
      <h3>Rear garden</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The overgrown rear garden</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Another case of DIY SOS!</p>
      <p>Overgrown and with carpets and chairs dumped in it, this garden is also in need of serious TLC.</p>
      <p>Yet it does have potential and is a nice size.</p>
