      <h1>‘Nagaland: Twilight of the Headhunters’ travel documentary by Coconuts TV now airing on Discovery Asia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T05:04:02+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 05:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Coconuts TV original documentary NAGALAND: TWILIGHT OF THE HEADHUNTERS is now broadcasting on Discovery Asia.</p>
      <p>The adventure travel doc follows host Sebastian Perry as he explores Nagaland, a region of India historically known for headhunters and a thriving opium trade. In just five generations, Nagaland has transitioned from a tribal society to one with smartphones, the latest fashions, and widespread Christianity – but how has rapid modernization affected these proudly traditional people?</p>
      <p>The 48-minute documentary takes viewers on a journey through Nagaland, an isolated corner of India sandwiched between Myanmar and the Himalayas. Sebastian’s quest is to track down some of the last living Naga headhunters and see how their traditions and cultures have withstood ever-present calls to modernize. Along the way, he discovers a new generation of Naga, a people lacking a solid identity in modern India, and eager to embrace their proud heritage.</p>
      <p>Viewers can tune in to NAGALAND on Discovery Asia at the following times this weekend. Additional airing times will be updated as schedule becomes available.</p>
      <p>November 10, 2019: 18:30</p>
      <p>November 11, 2019: 02:00 and 13:30</p>
