      <p>REUTERS: Ben &amp; Jerry's has been sued by an environmental advocate who said it deceived consumers by touting that the milk and cream it uses to make ice cream came exclusively from "happy cows."</p>
      <p>In a complaint filed last week, James Ehlers said Ben &amp; Jerry's "breached consumer trust" by representing that the milk and cream were sourced from cows on Vermont dairies that participate in its "Caring Dairy" program.</p>

      <p>Ehlers said less than half the milk and cream actually came from "happy cows," with the rest coming from "factory-style, mass-production" dairy operations.</p>
      <p>He said the deception enabled Ben &amp; Jerry's and its parent Unilever Plc to charge premium prices, unjustly enriching themselves and violating a Vermont consumer protection law.</p>
      <p>The proposed class action filed on Oct. 31 in the federal court in Burlington, Vermont seeks damages for ice cream purchasers nationwide and in Vermont, and to stop Ben &amp; Jerry's from claiming its milk and cream came from "happy cows" on "Caring Dairy" farms.</p>
      <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's spokeswoman Laura Peterson said the company does not discuss pending lawsuits, but was "committed to building a resilient, regenerative dairy supply" and considered its Caring Dairy program "the most progressive in the industry."</p>
      <p>According to Ben &amp; Jerry's website, the Caring Dairy program requires participating farms to meet a variety of standards to ensure the humane treatment of cows (https://www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2016/caring-dairy-standards).</p>
      <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's was founded in 1978 in a renovated gas station, and has long positioned itself as socially conscious.</p>
      <p>Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food company, bought Ben &amp; Jerry's in August 2000.</p>
      <p>Ehlers was a candidate for governor of Vermont last year, but lost in the Democratic primary.</p>
      <p>The case is Ehlers v Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Vermont, No. 19-00194.</p>
