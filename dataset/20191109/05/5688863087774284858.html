        <b>Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting is confident that their new acquisition Ravichandran Ashwin’s will be able to exploit the spinner-friendy conditions in Delhi during the upcoming IPL season. The Delhi Capitals traded left-arm spinner Jagadeesha Suchith to Kings XI Punjab for Ashwin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With an excellent return to the Indian squad in the home series against South Africa, Ashwin has regained his mojo as one of India’s premier spinners. The 33-year-old has over 500 wickets in international cricket, with the experience of having won the IPL twice with CSK. <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ricky_ponting">Ricky Ponting</a>, the head coach of the Delhi Capitals, is certain that the conditions at the Arun Jaitley Stadium will suit the lanky off-spinner.</p>
      <p>"Ashwin adds a lot of value to any team that he is a part of, and I am sure it is going to be no different when he joins Delhi Capitals. It is no secret that the pitch on our home ground is on the slower side, and is known to assist spinners. I believe, Ashwin, with his clever bowling, will have a tremendous impact when he bowls on it," Ponting said in an official statement.</p>
      <p>Though he was picked first by the <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/mumbai_indians">Mumbai Indians</a> in 2015, 25-year-old Suchith is yet to find his feet in the IPL; he was signed by Delhi only as a replacement last season. But with the move to <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/team/kings_xi_punjab">Kings XI Punjab</a>, he will be reunited with team director <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/anil_kumble">Anil Kumble</a>, who was part of the 2015 Mumbai squad. </p>
      <p>"I would like to wish Suchith all the very best, and I am sure he will excel in his new team. I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ravichandran_ashwin">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> to the Delhi Capitals family," Jindal told ANI.</p>
      <p>"He is easily one of the best and most experienced spinners around, with a tremendous record in India and IPL colours. There is no doubt in my mind that Ashwin's presence will benefit our team tremendously, as we eye the big prize - the IPL title," he added.</p>
