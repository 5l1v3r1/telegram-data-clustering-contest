      <p>Ron my head son!</p>
      <p>Stunned shoppers went Cristiano crazy as it appeared the world's most famous footballer was on a shopping trip in Birmingham's Bullring.</p>
      <p>A huge crowd crowd grew as word that Portuguese idol Ronaldo - surrounded by bodyguards - was in town spread earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Fans posed for selfies with the man they thought was the Juventus and former Manchester United and Real Madrid star as mums whipped out their phones and their kids pose up with the 'star'.</p>

      <p>But - in a dummy run worthy of the great man himself - the focus of all the attention was actually a Brummie prankster.</p>
      <p>The identity of the lookalike remains a closely-guarded secret, but was organised by YouTube sensation TolaTheKurd.</p>

      <p>He said: "A lot of planning went into creating and executing this prank, from choosing times to meet up, where the video should be shot, how many security guards were needed and how many actors we should have.</p>
      <p>"I have done many videos previously, however nothing like this. Many crazy prank I have pulled of on my family and in public however Itâ€™s my first fake celebrity prank."</p>
