      <p>Being overweight comes with a host of insecurity. Something similar happened with 17-year-old Vibhav, who was tired of covering himself with jackets to hide his fat. Here is his inspiring weight loss journey!</p>
      <p><b>Name: </b>Vibhav Deepak</p>
      <p><b>Occupation:</b> Student</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b>17 years</p>
      <p><b>Height: </b>5 feet 8 inches</p>
      <p><b>Highest weight recorded:</b>106.5 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Weight lost: </b>40 kgs</p>
      <p><b>Duration it took me to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/10-exercises-to-lose-weight-in-10-minutes/from-fat-to-fit-in-10-minutes/photostory/58490883.cms">lose weight</a>:</b>11 months</p>
      <p><b>The turning point:</b> The constant body shaming and being conscious of how I looked all the time drained me. However, the breaking point was when I checked my weight and it had reached a whopping 106.5 kilos! That was the day I decided to buckle up and get back in shape.</p>
      <p><b>My breakfast: </b>Boiled eggs, a glass of milk along with a bowl of fruits. The occasional bowl of oats filled with fruits prevented me from getting bored of my routine</p>
      <p><b>Post-breakfast snack </b>: Handful of dry fruits</p>
      <p><b>My lunch:</b> My lunch varied from day to day. But I made sure it wasn't unhealthy. Various dals with rice (these dals were boiled and sauteed) or meat curry on some days .</p>
      <p><b>My dinner:</b> Chicken breast with rice. I also indulged in large bowls of salads to keep the fibre content high. Boiled vegetables were a blessing. I kept changing my dinner as my main target was <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/weight-loss">fat loss</a> and aid muscle gain.</p>
      <p><b>Pre-workout meal: </b>A glass of milk with a banana.</p>
      <p><b>Post-workout meal: </b>This was usually dinner and I had it 45 minutes to an hour post my workout</p>
      <p><b>I indulge in:</b> I indulged in cheat days once a week. I enjoyed pizza, ice cream and homemade mutton biryani. I made it a point count calories.</p>
      <p><b>My workout</b>: I'm still in college so I don't have the time to workout in a gym. I've lost all my weight by working out at home only. My aim right now is to maintain this weight. I workout 3 times a week. It includes doing 100 burpees as I do cardio before doing muscle training. I workout my core and chest 3 times a week. I also go for a 10 kilometers jog every Sunday morning as it helps to clear my mind and makes me feel empowered.</p>
      <p><b>Low-calorie recipes I swear by: </b>Soya Manchurian and Mushroom stir fry</p>
      <p><b>Fitness secrets I unveiled: </b>During your weight loss journey, it is important to keep yourself hydrated and sleep well. Also, do not ever follow fad diets, they do not work.</p>
      <p><b>How do I stay motivated? </b>Looking at the mirror and seeing the remarkable changes is enough to keep me motivated. I am happy with the way I look right now and it keeps me on the right track.</p>
      <p><b>How do you ensure you don’t lose focus? </b>Looking at my old pictures still haunts me and this prevents me from slacking. Every time I overeat, I make sure I balance my food intake and exercise harder.</p>
      <p><b>What’s the most difficult part of being overweight?</b> It was really heartbreaking when I wasn't able to participate in sports activities. I was also tired of being insecure of the way I looked. I used to keep adjusting my clothes and used to cover myself with a jacket. Ultimately, I could no longer take the jibes on my weight of the people around me.</p>
      <p><b>What shape do you see yourself 10 years down the line? </b>Staying healthy and fit is my primary goal but it wouldn't hurt to have abs</p>
      <p><b>What are the lifestyle changes you made? </b>I made a couple of changes in my life and followed them strictly. I started eating clean, shunned junk food completely and began exercising daily.</p>
      <p><b>What was the lowest point for you? </b>When I weighed a massive 106.5 kilo, it was the unsolicited comments of friends and relatives that made me realise the gravity of the situation. I craved for a chiseled physique and six pack abs as I was very conscious of my image. I wanted to look as good as my idols and wanted a fit body and ooze confidence.</p>
      <p><b>Lessons learnt from weight loss: </b>I have realised that consistency is the key. You can only achieve the desired results with consistent efforts. The sacrifices you make during your weight loss journey--including cutting down on your favourite food--will be all worth it. Once your drop the first kilo, it motivates you to keep going on.</p>
