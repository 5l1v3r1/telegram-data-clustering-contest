      <h1>BREAKING: Appeal Court declares Akpabio winner of senatorial election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:14:53+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361726-akpabio-prevails-as-appeal-court-orders-rerun-in-one-local-govt.html" target="_blank">Cletus Ukpong</a></address>
      <p>The Appeal Court in Calabar has given Godswill Akpabio another chance at the senatorial slot of the Akwa Ibom North West District.</p>
      <p>The court nullified the election that returned Chris Ekpenyong of the PDP as winner and ordered a rerun in Essien Udim local government area within 90 days.</p>
      <p>The former governor was first elected senator from the district in 2015 when he concluded his two terms as governor.</p>
      <p>He was appointed into President Muhammadu Buhari’s cabinet in July, serving currently as the Niger-Delta minister.</p>
      <p>Chris Ekpenyong of the Peoples Democratic Party was initially declared winner of the election by INEC, but Mr Akpabio challenged the decision at the election’s tribunal.</p>
