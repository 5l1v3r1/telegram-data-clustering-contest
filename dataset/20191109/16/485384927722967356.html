      <h1>Vertical farming, micro-algae and bio-reactors — the new frontier of sustainable food</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:33:52+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/antony-funnell/8059042" target="_blank">Antony Funnell</a></address>
      <p>It's brunch time in the not-too-distant future. You're in your favourite cafe and you have a craving for pancakes.</p>
      <p>You know they're delicious because you order them all the time: fluffy and light with a slightly carroty taste.</p>
      <p>Hardly a health food, but at least they're easy on the environment — they're made with organic eggs and 100 per cent locally-sourced bacteria.</p>
      <p>The bioreactor that produces the flour is only a block away.</p>
      <p>Like many people, you're worried about the size of your carbon footprint, so it's good to know that none of the main ingredients had to be shipped or flown in.</p>

      <p>The coffee is good too — from a boutique plantation in an old converted office block just down the road.</p>
      <p>It's expensive, but it's worth paying a little more to make sure the produce you eat and drink is grown right here in the city.</p>
      <p>Your friend orders the pork and fennel sausages with a side salad — from the rooftop farm above the cafe.</p>
      <p>She often feels guilty about the amount of meat she consumes. But at least the pig she's eating was raised on micro-algae, not soybean. So, a small chunk of the Amazon is still standing because the trees in that area weren't cut down to make way for yet another enormous soya plantation.</p>
      <p>Eating pancakes made from bacterial flour and animals raised on unicellular photosynthetic micro-organisms might seem a little out there, but these ideas are currently being explored by scientists as part of a new approach to farming called controlled environmental agriculture (CEA).</p>
      <p>And CEA, some agricultural researchers argue, could be the best way of reducing the environmental destruction associated with modern farming, which is both land and resource intensive.</p>
      <h3>The veggie patch goes high-tech</h3>
      <p>CEA represents a small but growing dimension of agriculture.</p>
      <p>It's attracting huge investment, particularly in the United States where venture capitalists see gains to be made in a high-tech process known as vertical farming.</p>
      <p>Vertical farms look like a cross between a factory and a laboratory.</p>
      <p>Plants are grown indoors on trays, often stacked up to 30 tiers high.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Everything about the indoor environment is governed by sensors and automation, but the crucial ingredient is the artificial lighting.</p>
      <p>"All the vertical farms operating today are using a type of lighting called LEDs, which stands for light emitting diode," says Jeffrey Landau, the director of business development at Agritecture, an urban agriculture consultancy.</p>
      <p>"Different types of crops prefer different types of lighting. So, your leafy greens, your vegetative crops prefer light towards the blue side of the spectrum.</p>
      <p>"Whereas your fruiting and flowering crops, they will want something more along the red spectrum of lighting."</p>
      <p>Each variety of plant has its own tailored lighting recipe, allowing them to photosynthesise for much longer periods of the day — up to 18 hours at a time.</p>
      <p>In practical terms, that means more crop yields.</p>

      <p>The major players, to date, have concentrated on producing perishable goods such as salad vegetables — crops that traditionally require large amounts of water.</p>
      <p>But vertical farming expert Paul Gauthier believes even staples like potato and wheat could eventually be grown indoors.</p>
      <blockquote>"Everything is possible. I don't think there is anything in the vertical farm that we can't grow," he says.</blockquote>
      <p>"I was growing coffee trees inside a vertical farm.</p>
      <p>"It's a question of which kind of design we have to make and what the economics are behind it."</p>
      <p>Dr Gauthier, who now works for the New Jersey-based company Bowery Farming, admits both the capital and energy costs involved in vertical farming are "definitely huge".</p>
      <p>But that needs to be put in context, he argues, because significant government subsidies have long been provided to traditional farming operations.</p>
      <h3>People in glass houses</h3>
      <p>Others aren't so convinced.</p>
      <p>Viraj Puri sees the Silicon Valley-inspired approach adopted by companies like Bowery as unnecessarily high-tech.</p>
      <p>"It has certainly attracted a tonne of investment, media attention, consumer interest, there's no doubt about it," he says.</p>
      <p>"I still think the business models will require a path to profitability before it can start to attract more mainstream financing."</p>
      <p>Mr Puri, the CEO and co-founder of Gotham Greens, operates five rooftop urban greenhouse facilities in New York and Chicago.</p>
      <p>His approach to controlled environmental agriculture is to recast the classic Dutch greenhouse of an earlier age, but with 21st century modifications.</p>

      <p>"These are glass and steel structures controlled by computers that are able to monitor climate 365 days of the year, 24 hours a day, and make smart adjustments, data-driven adjustments, in order to maximise crop productivity, efficiency, reduce production losses," Mr Puri says.</p>
      <p>"They combine a lot of these advanced horticultural and engineering techniques that proponents of vertical farming espouse and promote."</p>
      <p>And they also have the potential to achieve exponential crop yields.</p>
      <p>"One can still get 50 times the productivity on certain types of crops. But one relies primarily on natural sunlight which is a free natural resource," Mr Puri says.</p>
      <p>Next year, Gotham Greens is due to open a 2,800-square-metre facility just outside Denver, Colorado, as part of a $70 million capital expansion plan.</p>
      <p>"Some of these greenhouses are the size of dozens of football fields, so these aren't backyard hoop houses but rather very sophisticated climate-controlled buildings," Mr Puri says,</p>
      <p>And they can get even bigger.</p>

      <p>A French company is currently constructing a roof-top greenhouse in the centre of Paris that will cover some 14,000 square metres when completed.</p>
      <p>Like Bowery Farms, Gotham Greens sells itself on growing pesticide free crops, grown locally with very few transport miles.</p>
      <p>"Urban farming is about bringing issues closer to large population centres," Mr Puri says.</p>
      <p>"And telling the story of how agriculture is an enormous consumer of natural resources around the world and how this form of farming can play a significant role in a more sustainable future."</p>
      <h3>The substitution game</h3>
      <p>For Cambridge University's Asaf Tzachor, the solution to environmental degradation lies not just in rethinking how we grow, but what we grow.</p>
      <p>The future of food that he envisages is busy fermenting away in a bio-reactor in Iceland.</p>
      <p>The facility is run by a company called Algaennovation, which has been experimenting with the development of a new kind of animal food supplement made from microalgae.</p>
      <p>Dr Tzachor estimates up to 85 per cent of the soybean produced globally each year is used to feed farm animals.</p>
      <p>Soya farming in South America is identified by environmental agencies as a major cause of deforestation.</p>
      <p>So, the idea is to simply substitute the microalgae for soya.</p>

      <p>"Microalgae are very interesting. They are marine organisms, which means that they don't need freshwater, unlike soybean," Dr Tzachor says.</p>
      <p>"And we don't have to cultivate them on terrestrial areas, so we can grow them within facilities, and these facilities can also be closed."</p>
      <p>The savings on water alone would be significant, says Dr Tzachor.</p>
      <p>He says experiments at Algaennovation's facility have so far been able to achieve between 200 and 250 times more biomass per litre of water than soybean farming.</p>
      <p>The next stage of development is demonstrating that microalgae production can be done on a mass scale.</p>

      <p>A similar approach is being undertaken by researchers in Finland, but their focus is on producing a supplement for human food rather than stock feed.</p>
      <p>Pasi Vainikka, from the company Solar Foods, says his company has used a bio-reactor to produce an edible flour made from fermented bacteria.</p>
      <p>"We have a fermenter, but we don't use yeast. We use a specific microbe that doesn't eat sugar," he says.</p>
      <p>"So instead of sugar we introduce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and these the microbe uses for energy and carbon instead of sugars to grow.</p>
      <p>"Then we take the liquid out of the fermenter when the microbes grow and multiply and you end up with a dry powder."</p>
      <p>The flour, called Solein, has a 65 per cent protein content, says Dr Vainikka, and can be used as a substitute for wheat flour or soya in everything from bread to protein drinks.</p>
      <p>"The organism has carotenoids. When you taste it raw it has a bit of an umami (savoury) taste," he says.</p>
      <p>"When you add it to pancakes, for example, it tastes as if it would have egg, and also a bit of carrot taste."</p>
      <p>"The production cost, according to our estimations, is around $US5 per kilogram."</p>
      <p>But that cost, says Dr Vainikka, could be expected to decrease as production begins to scale.</p>
      <blockquote>"We are about 10 times more environmentally friendly than plants and about 100 times better than animal-based proteins," he says.</blockquote>
      <p>"If we want to make a fundamentally more sustainable food system for the increasing population, we need to disconnect from agriculture, which usually means irrigation, use of pesticides and a lot of land use.</p>
      <p>"So, when we disconnect from everything that has to do with these processes, the environmental benefits are huge."</p>
      <p>Despite the promise offered by controlled environmental agriculture, Mr Puri cautions against seeing it as "panacea or a silver bullet" for the world's growing food demand issues.</p>
      <p>"I think solutions are going to have to be varied and they have to be uniquely suited to their own geographical, economic, social and cultural contexts," he says.</p>
      <p>"I think there's many different ways to farm sustainably and responsibly.</p>
      <p>"Indoor farming techniques can certainly play a significant role for certain types of crops, high-value crops, crops that use a lot of water, crops that often have to be shipped in refrigerated trains, planes or trucks over great distances."</p>
      <p>But the challenge is great. The United Nations estimates the world's population will increase to around 9.7 billion by 2050.</p>
      <p>That's another 2 billion mouths to feed.</p>
