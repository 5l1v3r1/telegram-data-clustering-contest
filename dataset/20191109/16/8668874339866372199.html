      <p>Follow all the action on the <i>RugbyPass</i> live blog from the Guinness PRO14 match between <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/munster">Munster</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> at Thomond Park.</p>

      <p>Munster coach Johann van Graan told <i>RugbyPass</i> he had no regrets seeing the Springboks lift the World Cup two years after he decided to quit the South African national team for a provincial stint in Ireland.</p>
      <p>As an assistant, first to Heyneke Meyer and then Allister Coetzee, he had earned his Test level stripes, soldering through 71 matches from June 2012 through to November 2017 when he decided he wouldn’t stay on under the incoming Rassie Erasmus and would instead take over the position Erasmus had just left vacant at Munster.</p>
      <p>Two years later, an irony is that Felix Jones, a van Grann assistant who surprisingly left Munster in June with no job lined up, was called up by Erasmus in an emergency after ill-health forced Swys de Bruin out of the reckoning. A few months later Jones is now a World Cup winner, unlike van Graan who is busy preparing for another Champions Cup campaign.</p>

      <p>“No, I don’t live my life with regret,” <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/no-i-dont-live-my-life-with-regret-munsters-van-graan-on-the-boks-from-mandala-to-last-saturday">insisted van Graan to <i>RugbyPass</i></a>. “I had a fantastic time at the Springboks and I had this opportunity to come to Munster and it’s one I grabbed with both hands.</p>
      <p>“I have loved my time here (with Munster) and you have got to be happy for other people when they achieve success and it’s incredible for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> to win the World Cup for the third time.</p>
      <p>“I was privileged to be at the two previous World Cup finals, in ’95 as a 15-year-old boy and I went to the 2007 World Cup just before they won it in that final in Paris. I was fortunate enough to have been at the previous two and watched the third one in Cardiff (where Munster were preparing for a PRO14 game).”</p>
