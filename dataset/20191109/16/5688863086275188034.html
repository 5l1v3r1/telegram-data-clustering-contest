        <b>Irfan Pathan has said that Bangladesh skipper Mahmudullah has a glimpse of MS Dhoni in his captaincy while Harbhajan Singh opined that Mushfiqur will be the key to taming India. Bangladesh, who came into the tour as an underdog, now have a real chance of sealing the series in Nagpur tomorrow.</b>

      <p>The Bangladesh team has been exceptional on the ongoing tour. Although they couldn't find an answer to a flamboyant <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/rohit_sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> in the second T20I, they were on song in the first match in Delhi where they registered their maiden T20I win against India.</p>
      <p>Achieving the great feat without the big guns of the team, like Shakib Al Hassan and Tamim Iqbal, is really a commendable job and former Indian pacer <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/irfan_pathan">Irfan Pathan</a> has acknowledged how good Mahmudullah Riyad has been as the leader of the pack. Pathan heaped Mahmudullah with praises as he also went on to say that his captaincy has a glimpse of <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/ms_dhoni">MS Dhoni</a> in it.</p>
      <p>"When you win a match against one of the best teams in the world, it helps in boosting your confidence and Mahmudullah had shown great qualities of a captain including the changes he made during the match," Pathan told TOI.</p>
      <p>"There was a hint of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his captaincy as he also used part-time bowlers after the power play which is a strategy often used by Dhoni."</p>
      <p>The veteran India spinner Harbhajan has opined that Bangladesh's man behind the stumps, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/mushfiqur_rahim">Mushfiqur Rahim</a>'s experience and skills will be key for Bangladesh as they will look to seal off the series in Nagpur and register their first ever T20 series win over the hosts.</p>
      <p>"Mushfiqur Rahim is a player with a lot of experience, his ability to play both spin and pace bowling is great and he has the maximum responsibility in the Bangladesh squad in terms of batting which gives him an edge over Mahmudullah who is also a good player for the Bangladesh team," said Harbhajan.</p>
