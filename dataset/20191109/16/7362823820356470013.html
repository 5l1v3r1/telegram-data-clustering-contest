      <h1>Beatles album cover photographer Robert Freeman dead at 82</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:32:45+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>Photographer Robert Freeman, who helped define the image of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">The Beatles</a> with some of the band's best-known album covers, has died aged 82.</p>
      <p>A statement on The Beatles' official website announced Freeman's death Friday but didn't give a cause.</p>
      <p>Born in 1936, Freeman began his career as a photojournalist for London's Sunday Times and captured portraits of leading jazz musicians before working with The Beatles. He shot the black-and-white cover for the 1963 album "With The Beatles," picturing the Fab Four's faces in part-shadow. It became a defining image of the group and was used for the 1964 U.S. album "Meet The Beatles!"</p>

      <p>In an online tribute, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/paul-mccartney-dreams-john-lennon-the-beatles">Paul McCartney</a> said "people often think that the cover shot for 'Meet The Beatles' of our foreheads in half shadow was a carefully arranged studio shot."</p>

      <p>"In fact it was taken quite quickly by Robert in the corridor of a hotel we were staying in where natural light came from the windows at the end of the corridor," McCartney wrote.</p>

      <p>For that 1965 album Freeman subtly stretched The Beatles' faces, subtly suggesting the psychedelic experiments to come.</p>
      <p>Ringo Starr tweeted: "God bless Robert Freeman peace and love to all his family."</p>
