      <p>Samsung Still Leads Smartphone Market In The Third Quarter Of 2019<br/>4 (80%) 2 votes</p>
      <p>After a deep sleep, the global smartphone market is awakening. Recently, <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS45636719">IDC released</a> a report for smartphone shipments in the third quarter of 2019. As the statistics show, in the quarter, global smartphone shipments totaled 358.3 million units, a year-on-year increase of 0.8%. Though this is a very small growth, we should state this is for the first time in a long period of time that this market doesn’t decrease.</p>

      <p>Not accidentally, the South Korean tech manufacturer ranks first, leading the list. It has managed to ship over 78.2 million units. And this was enough to occupy 21.8% of the global smartphone market and ensure a year-on-year shipment growth of 8.3%.</p>
      <p>The second place is occupied by Huawei (including its sub-brand Honor). The Chinese tech company has shipped 66.6 million units in the third quarter. It takes 18.6% of the market share and has a year-on-year shipment growth of 28.2%.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Cupertino-based Apple is pushed to the third place. It has sold over 46.6 million units. Apple’s share is 13%, and the year-on-year shipments fell by 0.6%.</p>
      <p>And though there are no changes in the first three positions, other manufacturers are in a fierce competition for the rest of the places. Xiaomi and OPPO ranked fourth and fifth in the list, respectively. If Xiaomi has shipped 32.7 million units (including its own sub-brand Redmi) and took 9.1% of the market, OPPO sold 31.2 million smartphones and took 8.7% of the market.</p>
      <p>All other brands have shipped 103 million units in total. And it’s worth noting that this is far away from last year’s result.</p>
