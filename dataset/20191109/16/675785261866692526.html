      <h1>Tyson Fury trains with UFC star Darren Till as boxer considers switch to MMA</h1>
      <h2>Fury displayed his trademark power and slick movement as Till put the heavyweight bruiser through various training drills</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:46:08+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Tyson Fury was put through his paces by UFC superstar Darren Till as the lineal world heavyweight boxing champion bids to transition to MMA.</p>
      <p>Speculation has been rife in recent weeks that the British boxer had been eying a switch to the octagon following a successful, albeit brief, stint in wrestling with WWE.</p>
      <p>Though he has a potential rematch with fellow undefeated boxing champ  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> to look forward to in February next year, the Gypsy King remains keen to try his hand at another sport.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Manchester boxer Fury met up with Liverpool fighter Till to showcase his MMA talents.</p>

      <p>Fury displayed his trademark power and slick movement as Till put the heavyweight bruiser through a series training drills.</p>
      <p>The boxer also posted a snap of the pair on Instagram, captioning his post: "The 2 baddest mofos in the fight game."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/mike-tyson-train-francis-ngannou-20829319">Francis Ngannou</a>  has been touted as a potential opponent for Fury should he make the move to MMA, with the Frenchman saying he would relish the chance to fight the boxer.</p>
      <p>And speculation the pair will meet next year went into overdrive after the 31-year-old announced on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page that he would link up with Till.</p>

      <p>"Good news everybody, I'm going to go training with Darren Till this weekend," said the Gypsy King in a video posted online.</p>
      <p>"We're going to smash it and he's going to get me started on my MMA career. Get in there my boy."</p>
      <p>Fury's latest revelation came a day after the lineal champ hit back at rival Wilder's claims that the Brit was running scared of a potential rematch between the duo.</p>

      <p>The pair first met in the ring in Los Angeles in December last year, with Fury rising off the canvas as the bout ended in a draw following a monumental clash.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of his WBC world title defence against Cuban Luis Ortiz, Wilder said he felt Fury was no longer as keen on the rematch as he once was, prompting an angry response from the Brit.</p>
      <p>"The thing is with you Wilder, crack on with your own business and I'll see you February 22 to finish what I started. This time you're going to get smashed you big bum dosser," said Fury.</p>
