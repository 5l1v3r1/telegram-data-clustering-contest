      <p>​In September, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into a whistleblower's allegation that Trump abused the power of the office during a 25 July phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by using security assistance as leverage to pressure him to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Trump has denied any wrongdoing and denounced the impeachment inquiry as another political witch hunt by Democrats aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
