      <p>Amazon has come under fire after t-shirts with the words "Daddy's little s**t" were for sale on the site.</p>
      <p>Shocked shoppers voiced their horror after spotting the item of clothing, which was offered by a seller named Onlybabycare.</p>
      <p>Amazon was blasted for selling a product that "sexualised children" and "promoted paedophilia".</p>
      <p>A screenshot of the t-shirt - which has since been removed - was shared by journalist Yashar Ali on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Ali wrote: "Posting here in hopes it'll expedite removal from Amazon."</p>
      <p>It immediately drew horrified responses, with one writing: "If I ever saw a child wearing this t-shirt, I'd call the police."</p>

      <p>Lawyer Eliza Orlins responded: "I cannot believe it's still up. And it comes in sizes starting at 2T. FOR TWO YEAR OLDS!!!!"</p>
      <p>Kendra Wagner wrote: "Amazon makes it very hard to contact them, but I just wrote through chat. Said it sexualized children and promoted pedophilia.</p>
      <p>"And they said thanks for bringing it to our attention - it is a new item and there is a team that looks at offensive items for sale.</p>

      <p>"So I held back requesting that 'Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself' T-shirts could stay."</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user responded: "What in the fresh hell is this? Take me off this planet. Willing to carpool."</p>
      <p>Responding to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/amazon-tshirt-daddys-little-slut-tshirt-only-babycare-a9194486.html">The Independent</a> , an Amazon spokesman said: â€œAll sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account.</p>
      <p>"The product in question is no longer available."</p>
      <p>Users later shared screenshots of other childrens' products from different sellers carrying the offensive phrase, although many of these later appeared to have been removed by Amazon.</p>
      <p>One woman posted an image of a baby onesie with the offensive words on it, stating: "I wish I could unsee this."</p>
