      <h3>Globe acknowledged Makati City as way ahead of its counterparts when it comes to adopting digital technologies and solutions.  This is due to the city government's early adoption techniques and strong cooperation with the company's building of much needed telecommunications infrastructure.</h3>
      <p>Globe President and CEO Ernest Cu revealed that the digital-first mindset policy of Makati City being implemented by Mayor Abby Binay has paved the way for the company to improve the connectivity to increase the digital adoption in the city. “Makati is a great example of an LGU that recognized the need for network infrastructure, to enhance  connectivity that will benefit its residents, “ Cu said.</p>
      <p>Globe will provide fast and free WiFi access via GoWiFi to 27 barangay health centers, inside the Makati City Hall and University of Makati  as part of the memorandum of agreement between Globe and Makati City government. “Globe Prepaid &amp; TM customers in Makati can enjoy 1GB of free GoWiFi for every registration of GoSAKTO, GoSURF &amp; EasySURF worth P50 and above that they can use in any GoWiFi hotspot in the city,” Cu said.</p>
      <p>Globe will install antennas on poles owned by the city government to improve mobile signal in more than 100 strategic sites wherein the processing of permits will be fast tracked based on the Public Private Partnership agreement approved by the city council.</p>
      <p>Cu said that Makati was the first city to adopt financial inclusion in partnership with Globe since 2017 that empowered 1,000 micro small medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) to use the GCash QR Codes payment facility such as Jollijeeps, select sari-sari stores and some of the city’s transport system. Globe and Makati City will also recognize the 100 thousandth Makatizen GCash card holder during the GoWiFi MOA signing.</p>
      <p>Cu also thanked Mayor Binay for supporting the company’s education drive on health safety of the cell sites to Homeowners Association (HOA) in Makati during their roadshows. Globe has long taken up the sore issue of challenges in building cell sites as it noted that many homeowner associations (HOAs) continue to oppose cell site proposals made by the company due to alleged health hazards.</p>
      <p>Globe is also in talks with the city government to address the health access concerns of the residents through KonsultaMD which offers 24/7 access to licensed Filipino doctors who are trained, experienced and ready to provide with high-quality health and medical information anytime, anywhere.</p>
      <p>GoWiFi is the country’s largest WiFi service in the country that aims to provide customers better WiFi experience with speeds of up to 100Mbps depending on the location–available to all users regardless of network.</p>
      <p>GoWiFi continues its expansion plans nationwide, particularly in high-traffic areas like malls, hospitals, and schools to make high-quality internet connection accessible and affordable to more Filipinos. As of the first half of the year, GoWiFi is now accessible in 2,500 sites nationwide, up by 500 sites from the previous year.</p>
