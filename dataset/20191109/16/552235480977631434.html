      <h1>Hearts 5 St Mirren 2 as Steven Naismith inspires Jambos to end home hoodoo - 3 talking points</h1>
      <h2>St Mirren remain at the bottom of the table after their heavy defeat but it's much better news for Austin MacPhee.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:58:27+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">David McCarthy, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/david-mccarthy/</a></address>
      <p>Hearts smashed their home hoodoo with a vengeance as they left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> cast adrift at the foot of the table.</p>
      <p>Austin MacPhee’s team stormed to a 5-2 win - with the goals from five different scorers - to secure their first <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> victory at Tynecastle since beating Aberdeen on March 30 and lift some of the gloom on Gorgie.</p>
      <p>They edged a terrific first half 3-2 before turning on the style after the break to chalk up a comfortable win against Jim Goodwin’s side, who played well in patches but can’t concede the kind of the goals they gave up if they are to escape the drop.</p>
      <p>Neither team went into the match with a great deal of confidence, but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> , with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> and Jamie Walker restored to the starting line-up, looked stronger than of late and within six minutes they were in front.</p>
      <p>It couldn’t have been simpler, either, although Jim Goodwin will be raging at his team’s defending of Andy Irving’s corner, delivered at shin height into the near post where Naismith sprinted to send a smart volley past Vaclav Hladky.</p>
      <p>Saints, without an away win in the league since May, could have folded but to be fair to them, they dug in and slowly worked their way back into the game with Tony Andreu finding pockets of space to ask questions of the Hearts defence.</p>

      <p>And sure enough, the Frenchman was instrumental in St Mirren’s 21st minute equaliser, peeling off at the back post to nod a Sam Foley cross into the path of Jon Obika, who slammed home from seven yards.</p>
      <p>It was the home side’s turn to respond to a setback and they did so on the half hour when they retook the lead. Uche Ikpeazu had been operating wide right but moved inside to get on the end of a Naismith head flick from an Irving thrown in. The striker still had plenty to do as he rounded Vaclav and with the angle tightening rapidly, he managed to get away his shot and although it might have flown wide, it hit Sean McLoughlin and ended up in the back of the net.</p>
      <p>The Gorgie delight lasted just three minutes, though, and St Mirren battled back for a second time to level through Danny Mullen. The striker’s composed finish past Joel Pereira was superb but Hearts’ defending was shocking - Christophe Berra allowing a punt from Hladky to sail over his head to allow Mullen to run in one-on-one with the keeper.</p>
      <p>It was becoming like a basketball match and sure enough, before half-time, Hearts took the lead for the third time in the match. Again, it was far too simple from St Mirren’s point of view as Michael Smith had acres of room to stick a cross onto Ollie Bozanic’s head and the Aussie hit the target and despite Hladky getting a hand to it, he couldn’t keep it out.</p>
      <p>Within  a minute of the restart Hearts finally put clear daylight between themselves and the opposition and this time there was no denying the quality of the goal. Smith’s cross from the right was bulleted home by Jamie Walker, who timed his run and his header brilliantly.</p>

      <p>If that was good, Hearts’ fifth was the pick of the bunch in the 76th minute. Sub Jake Mulraney cut in from the left and rifled an unstoppable effort into the postage stamp corner to make absolutely sure of the points.</p>
      <p>To be fair to the visitors, though, they kept at it and Sean McLoughlin forced the save of the match from Pereira from a long range piledriver.</p>
      <p>That was as close as they came as Hearts saw the match out comfortably.</p>
      <h3>3 talking points</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Hearts have something to build on</b>
      </p>
      <p>Make no mistake, this is a huge win for Hearts as they finally won a league game at Tynecastle not only for the first time this season but since March. It might not yet be the fortress it once was but this at least, gives the Jambos something to build on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Long season in store for Saints</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jim Goodwin’s team played some good stuff in the first 45 minutes and finally found their to goal twice in that period. But just when they got it right at one end, they toiled at the other and that’s why they are still propping up the table. It’s going to be a long season for them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MacPhee's risk pays off</b>
      </p>
      <p>Austin MacPhee’s decision to play Uche Ikpeazu out wide, against the much smaller Calum Waters, paid dividends as the striker caused the Saints defence all kinds of problems and with Steven Naismith buzzing around to great effect, Hearts simply had too much up front for their opponents.</p>
