      <p>Most Democrats in the country’s battleground states want to vote for a candidate who is more centrist than liberal, according to a new survey.</p>
      <p>A <i>New York Times</i>-Siena College <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/us/politics/democrats-poll-moderates-battleground.html">poll</a> released Friday found that voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, and Florida preferred a candidate who would work with the other side of the aisle. Of those surveyed, 62% said they want a nominee who promises “to find common ground with Republicans,” compared to 33% who said they want a nominee who fights “for a bold progressive agenda.”</p>
      <p>Additionally, 55% said they want the candidate to be “more moderate than most Democrats,” while 39% preferred the candidate to swing further to the left than most. Respondents were split on how they want to see the candidate handle the role, with 49% preferring that the nominee bring “politics in Washington back to normal” and 45% hoping for a “fundamental, systemic change to American society.”</p>
      <p>Joe Biden led in five of the six states polled, with Elizabeth Warren enjoying a slight edge in Wisconsin. The only three candidates who brought in double-digit support in any of the states were Biden, Warren, and Bernie Sanders. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris fell far behind the trio in all six states.</p>
      <p>Nationally, Biden is the front-runner, with a RealClearPolitics <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a> putting him at 28.3% support and Warren trailing him 20.6%.</p>
