      <p><b>HARTFORD, Conn.Â (AP)</b> - Connecticut lawmakers want to explore ways to reduce health care costs, including efforts taken by neighboring Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>The General Assembly's Insurance and Real Estate Committee plans to hold an informational forum on Thursday at the Legislative Office Building.</p>
      <p>They're expected to discuss three major policy concepts, including a possible state-funded reinsurance program, prescription drug importation and the benchmarking of health care costs to a statewide target, similar to a Massachusetts initiative.</p>
      <p>Besides the committee members, the Office of Health Strategy, health care advocates, health insurers, the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, and other stakeholders are expected to participate in a series of panel discussions.</p>
      <p>Connecticut lawmakers say they hope the high cost of health care will be addressed in the new regular legislative session, which begins in February.</p>
