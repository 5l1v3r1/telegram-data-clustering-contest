      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Lexie Hull scored 27 points, DiJonai Carrington added 16 and No. 3 Stanford downed San Francisco 97-71 on Saturday in the first college basketball game played at Chase Center, the Golden State Warriors new facility in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Ioanna Krimili scored 17 points for the Dons (1-1), who are 9-24 in the series with the Cardinal. Mikayla Williams added 12 points and Lucie Hoskova scored all 10 of her points in the first half.</p>
      <p>Hull, whom Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer referred to “playing like a woman possessed” after the season opener, did nothing to tarnish that image. She was 10-of-12 from the field, including 5-of-7 from 3-point range. She also added eight rebounds and three assists.</p>
      <p>Carrington also grabbed eight rebounds. Freshman Ashten Prechtel led Stanford with nine boards. Alyssa Jerome added 11 points.</p>
      <p>The Cardinal scored the first seven points of the third quarter and held onto a double-digit lead the rest of the way. Stanford eventually opened a 21-point advantage when Hull hit a 3-pointer midway through the quarter.</p>
      <p>Stanford shot 55.6% from the field in the first half, with Hull and Carrington combining for 10-of-15 and a 44-32 halftime lead.</p>

      <p>Hoskova and Krimili were a combined 8-of-16 for 21 points but the rest of the team went 4-of-21.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Stanford: Not that VanDerveer was worried, but having Carrington respond with a big game against the Dons eases any doubts about her ability to continue what she started last year in a breakout season. Lacie Hull, who missed all four of her shots in the season opener, recovered with a nice shooting afternoon Saturday.</p>
      <p>San Francisco: Coach Molly Goodenbour, who played for Tara VanDerveer at Stanford and was part of its two national championships, starts four underclassmen and a junior as she builds her program. Saturday’s game was her 95th as the Dons coach and 399th game overall.</p>
