      <h1>Gasoline prices to go up; diesel on rollback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T16:55:38+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Myrna Velasco</a></address>
      <p>It will be a mixed bag of adjustments in retail pump prices next week – with gasoline prices anticipated going up by P0.60 to P0.70 per liter; and diesel will be on a marginal rollback of P0.10 to P0.20 per liter.</p>
      <p>That had just been based on the four-day trading outcome in the world market, but Friday (November 8) trading results could still change the final numbers.</p>
      <p>The oil companies are expected to implement cost swings at their respective retail pumps on Tuesday (November 12), which has already been their routine on price adjustments.</p>
      <p>Prior to the next round of cost movements, independent player Cleanfuel announced on Friday that it enforced P0.30 per liter rollback on the price of its autoLPG, considered an alternative fuel for the transport sector.</p>
      <p>Philippine pump costs swing based on the fluctuation of prices in the world market given its dependency on fuel imports. The other factor influencing domestic pump prices is the peso-dollar exchange rate.</p>
