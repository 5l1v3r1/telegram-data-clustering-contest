      <p>FC Barcelona defender Gerard Pique revealed in an interview with El Pais on Saturday that he likes to court controversy and revealed one of the secrets to Spain's World Cup success in 2010: card games until the early hours of the morning to avoid boredom.</p>
      <p>In the interview, the Catalan spoke about a number of his businesses, as well as his partner Shakira. The main focus was his involvement in the Davis Cup, which starts in Madrid on Nov. 18.</p>
      <p>Pique said that card games helped pass those dead hours in South Africa nine years ago. "Of course we won, but I also spent hours and hours looking at the ceiling. There wasn't much else to do," he said.</p>
      <p>"You can't spend a whole month in one place and only play football. I won a lot of games of pocha. We would play cards night after night until three in the morning, with Pepe Reina as the entertainer."</p>
