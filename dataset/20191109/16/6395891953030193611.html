      <p><b>WAREHAM, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - A 65-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested in the stabbing death of a 33-year-old man.</p>
      <p>Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz's office says David Robbins, of Wareham, has been charged with murder and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in the Wednesday death of Yves Roux Jr., also of Wareham.</p>
      <p>Police say the stabbing happened sometime before 5 a.m. along Main Street in Wareham. Officers found Roux bleeding near a vehicle that had sustained damage.</p>
      <p>He later died at a Boston hospital.</p>
      <p>It's not immediately clear if the men knew each other or what might have prompted the stabbing.</p>
      <p>It couldn't be determined if Robbins has a lawyer. He's slated to be arraigned Tuesday in Wareham District Court.</p>
