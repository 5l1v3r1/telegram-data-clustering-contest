        <b>France's left wing celebrated former Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's release from jail, while Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was waiting for him in the French capital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The release on Friday of Brazil's former left-wing leader, popularly known as Lula, was greeted with rapturous applause from crowds of supporters in Brazil</p>
      <p>The firebrand leader with his trademark gristly white beard walked out of jail on Friday.</p>
      <p>Lula's release mustered staunch support from France's socialist allies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A citizen of honour in Paris</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paris' mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was "happy" with his release. "I'm expecting him very soon in Paris where he is a citizen of honour," she said.</p>

      <p>Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the head of the hard-left France Unbowed party <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/americas/20190906-france-melenchon-visits-brazil-lula-jail-bolsonaro-corruption">who had visited Lula in jail</a><a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20190920-eye-france-rebel-without-pause">,</a> tweeted "Victory, Brazil's justice system works."</p>
      <p>Former French President François Hollande tweeted "Lula's place was never in prison. His freedom is restored and I know he will put it to good use."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bolsonaro on the guard</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lula's freedom gives the opposition, which has been splintered and largely rudderless in the Bolsonaro era, a towering figure to lead the charge.</p>
      <p>Criticising Bolsonaro's economic policies, Lula vowed to keep fighting for impoverished Brazilians.</p>
      <p>Breaking his silence on the release of his arch-nemesis, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro urged his Twitter followers 'not to give ammunition to the scoundrel' who was "momentarily free, but guilty."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lula denounces 'politically motivated' case</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lula's <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20191109-bolsonaro-asks-brazilians-not-to-give-ammunition-to-freed-lula">dramatic exit</a> from jail in the southern city of Curitiba on Friday came a day after a Supreme Court ruling that allows defendants to remain free while their appeals are pending.</p>
      <p>Lula was favourite to win last year's presidential election but was imprisoned after being implicated in a major corruption scandal called Car Wash (Lava Jato).</p>
      <p>The race was won instead by far-right candidate Bolsonaro. Lula has always proclaimed his innocence and that the case against him was politically motivated.</p>
      <p>A point of view shared by his supporters in France.</p>
      <p>"Lula Free! Finally! His release by the Supreme Court demonstrates the lies and deceit which have allowed [Jair] Bolsonaro to come to power," tweeted Olivier Faure of the Socialist party.</p>
      <p>Lula is still appealing the case that put him behind bars, related to the alleged purchase of a beachfront apartment in Sao Paulo state.</p>
      <p>He will be barred from standing for office unless the corruption charges against him are dropped.</p>
