      <p>The attack took place on Friday afternoon in the municipality of San Vicente Coatlan, near a rural area known as La Cementera. <a href="https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/comando-armado-ataca-a-policias-en-oaxaca-reportan-cinco-muertos/1346728">According to</a> Mexico’s <i>Excelsior</i>, a group of unknown gunmen attacked the squad of officers as they carried out a series of enforcement patrols in the area. The officers had been patrolling in the police vehicles marked #1730 and #1718.</p>
      <p>The officers called for help after the initial attack. This led to a large-scale deployment of police officers and emergency medical personnel that quickly arrived in the area. Paramedics rushed the two wounded officers to local hospitals while state investigators transported the fallen officers to a local morgue. Authorities did not disclose which criminal organization or cartel carried out the attack.</p>
      <p>A video released by the citizen journalist page La Voz del Pueblo revealed the moment when state police officers gathered at the morgue expressing their sorrow in front of their fellow fallen officers.</p>
