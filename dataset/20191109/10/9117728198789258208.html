      <p>Such has been Leclerc's impressive form in 2019, former Ferrari champion and 2008 nearly man Massa has implied that he believes Leclerc can win a title before his Aston Martin Red Bull Racing counterpart.</p>
      <p>In an interview with motorsport.com, Massa said: <i>“He's a very talented guy, but the thing that strikes me most is his head, and his ability to handle pressure.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I do not know whether he is faster or slower than Verstappen, but the seven pole positions in his first year of Ferrari say a lot. He made some mistakes, but I think we all have to consider his still limited experience in F1 and it was his first year in a top team.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He is a future world champion, and I think we will not have to wait long. I do not exclude that he can achieve that goal even before Verstappen.”</i>
