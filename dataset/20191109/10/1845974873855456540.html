      <h3>Our writers predict a win for Chelsea against Crystal Palace, because they’d be pretty ashamed to predict a loss and these clubs have not played to a draw since 1995.</h3>
      <p>Chelsea have an overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/chelsea-fc/bilanzdetail/verein/631/plus/0?gegner_id=873&amp;saison_id=&amp;wettbewerb_id=&amp;day=&amp;heim_gast=&amp;punkte=&amp;datum_von=-&amp;datum_bis=-"><b>positive record against Crystal Palace</b></a>, but the south London side do have that way of popping up as a bogey team at inconvenient times. With the Blues looking to take an eight-game Premier League win streak into the break, this would be an inconvenient time for an act of bogeyness. We don’t think it’ll happen.</p>
      <p><b>Olaoluwa Nwobodo: Chelsea 3 – 1 Crystal Palace.</b> Frank Lampard will play a tired squad, so playing with the intensity of Tuesday night’s second half will be a bit difficult. Crystal Palace will do everything possible to frustrate the Blues while threatening them from set pieces. Chelsea will go behind first from a Gary Cahill header. However, they’ll come back to win through goals from Tammy Abraham, Michy Batshuayi, and N’Golo Kante.</p>
      <p><b>Gabe Henderson: 4 – 0. </b>I’m really confident about this match. The 4-0 scoreline prediction is something I’ve been set on for the last few days. It’s in matches like these – with injuries and suspensions – that Chelsea rise to the occasion, especially coming off the 4-4 draw with Ajax and right before the international break.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s Blue and White Army, complete with Billy Gilmour and Callum Hudson-Odoi in the XI, will thrash Crystal Palace to continue their fantastic run of form.</p>
      <p><b>Abhishek Pancholi: 2 – 1.</b> Michy Batshuayi may not be getting the kind of game time he thinks he deserves, but he will turn up with the winner against his former loan club. Tammy Abraham will open the scoring, heading in a cross from one of the wingers. Gary Cahill will try his hardest but will be powerless against the younger Englishman’s superior athleticism.</p>
      <p>Palace will equalize in the second half, completely against the run of play. Unfortunately for them, that will be the full extent of their jubilation, as their former striker will settle the game just 10 minutes later.</p>
      <p><b>Scott Brant: 2 – 0. </b>After the craziness that was Ajax at Stamford Bridge, the Blues have struggled at home. Nothing would bolster my confidence more than a clean sheet just before the break. The center back partnership has been unbeatable over the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>Mateo Kovacic is due and deserving of a goal and Kurt Zouma has been wandering at times looking for one, as well. So here’s to Gary Cahill’s return and a well deserved clean sheet going into the break.</p>
      <p><b>Kevin Peacock: 3 – 0.</b> Chelsea at home are difficult to predict. Against one of London’s so-called lesser teams, they’ve often struggled. After the midweek madness that occurred in the Champions League, this game will probably be less theatrical. However, with Mike Dean overseeing the proceedings, who knows.</p>
      <p>For one player, though, it’ll be all about coming home. Gary Cahill will return to a fine welcome. Hopefully, he won’t stop Tambraham from scoring his now obligatory goal.</p>
      <p>The game won’t finish 4-4, neither will it be a draw. Chelsea will be too good for Crystal Palace despite the Eagles’ good form. Chelsea to win with Cesar Azpilicueta (still pumped from Tuesday) and Michy Batshuayi scoring the goals.</p>

      <p><b>Barrett Rouen: 3 – 0.</b> I was questioning going with 3-0 or 2-0 or 2-1, but for some reason have feeling in this one.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are going to be playing without the banned Jorginho, which means that they’ll be more defensively solid in this match. Jorginho has improved his positioning, tackling and shows a great deal of the things that his game was lacking under Maurizio Sarri. But he’s still always thinking pass and attack, perhaps without even knowing it, as opposed to thinking about safety.</p>
      <p>The Blues will defend better in this match but they’re still dripping with the usual venom in attack that they have had all season. Crystal Palace are open for the taking. Victory, and nothing less is acceptable.</p>
      <p><b>Nate Hofmann: 3 – 2.</b> The big question here is whether the Chelsea players have sobered up after the hallucinogenic-fueled footballing rave that was the Ajax match.</p>
      <p>There’s also the small matter of Jorginho – Chelsea’s player of the season so far – being ineligible. If N’Golo Kante can slot into his spot, that’s great, but Palace will show up with a physical, densely-packed midfield, which isn’t exactly the type of opponent you would want to reintegrate a recovering player against.</p>

      <p>Then there’s Mason Mount, whose status is uncertain after he picked up an ankle knock in the aforementioned Ajax peyote trip.</p>
      <p>So we might be treated to a midfield containing a likely-exhausted Mateo Kovacic, a still-tender N’Golo Kante, and an apparently cast-aside Ross Barkley. Fortunately, Palace’s midfield doesn’t offer much in the way of technical quality or attacking impetus. When Palace do get forward, it’s pretty much just the Wilfried Zaha and (maybe) Jordan Ayew show. Chelsea should dominate proceedings, but after the Woodstock of football Tuesday night, you’d bet on the visitors finding a chance or two of their own. Cheeky bet on Zaha scoring his first goal of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Hugo Amaya: 3 – 1.</b> A difficult game for Chelsea, as the result won’t capture the way the team played. However, the adrenaline from the previous game will carry the team forward with three opportunistic goals. Crystal Palace’s goal will be scored by none other than Gary Cahill, because, well, it’s a Chelsea thing. And come on, what fun would it be if he didn’t score?</p>

      <p>Despite the difficulties, Chelsea will come out on top and carry the good run with the hope that the international break won’t bring bad news (again).</p>
