      <p>Thohoyandou police are searching for a group of suspects who allegedly stoned a man to death at the University of Venda in Limpopo.</p>
      <p>The alleged mob attack took place on the university’s campus, next to a student residence, in the early hours of Friday morning.</p>
      <p>“The police responded to frantic calls from community members about a person being assaulted by a group of people. On arrival, police discovered the body a man who might be in his mid-twenties, with multiple injuries and assortment of objects like stones and sticks next to him. The group had already dispersed,” says Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo.</p>
      <p>The deceased has not yet been identified. He was wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and black adidas socks without shoes, Mojapelo adds.</p>
      <p>The motive for the attack is still unknown but police are investigating a case of murder. Officers have launched a "massive manhunt for the suspects involved," Mojapelo says.</p>
