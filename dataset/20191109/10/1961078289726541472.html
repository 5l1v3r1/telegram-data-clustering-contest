      <h1>What’s a ‘Hairbag?’ $7 Million May Hinge on the Answer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:00:13+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Goldstein and Ali Watkins</a></address>
      <p>For as long as anyone can remember, younger officers in the New York Police Department have referred to their elders as “hairbags” — usually behind their backs.</p>
      <p>It’s an archaic bit of slang with obscure origins. In police parlance, “the bag” means “the uniform.” So some officers believe “hairbag” is a riff on a longtime officer’s uniform — <a href="https://brooklynnorth.blogspot.com/search?q=hairbag">so old it has become hairy</a> — and describes veterans who know what the police call “The Job” inside out.</p>
      <p>Others think the phrase is an insult that comes from the practice, perhaps apocryphal, of officers using a haircut as an excuse for leaving their posts. This theory holds that sergeants used to demand a bag of hair trimmings as proof, and eventually burned-out officers who shirked work came to be known as “hairbags.”</p>
      <p>Now, generations after the word entered the police lexicon, it has emerged at the center of a court battle in Manhattan, where a federal judge has been asked to pin down its precise meaning. A fair amount of taxpayer money — more than enough to buy haircuts for the entire patrol force — may end up riding on the outcome.</p>
      <p>At issue is a $7 million age-discrimination lawsuit brought by a decorated detective, Keith Dietrich, who had the plum assignment of guarding Mayor Bill de Blasio. He claims he was forced out of the mayor’s security detail and nudged into retirement this year at age 56 because his commanders regarded him as a relic.</p>
      <p>Central to his lawsuit against the city is the claim that his supervisor called him a “hairbag” behind his back, which Mr. Dietrich says is evidence that older officers are viewed with suspicion and disdain.</p>
      <p>“A hairbag is an older cop, a burned-out cop, who doesn’t want to do anything and doesn’t care anymore,” Mr. Dietrich said in an interview, adding a few expletives. He said he felt outrage when he was called one. “It was disgusting,” he said. He stood tall, pointing to his spit-shined shoes and squared-away clothing, and asked: “Do I look like a hairbag?”</p>
      <p>Mr. Dietrich’s lawsuit describes a litany of petty humiliations. He was pushed off the prestigious team that guards the mayor and relegated to a security booth at City Hall. He was forced to wear the uniform, which detectives, who normally wear suits, regard as a demotion.</p>
      <p>At times, he said, he was told to take the subway between City Hall and Gracie Mansion, the mayor’s residence on the Upper East Side — rather than traveling by police car — which he perceived as a sign of disrespect. And he was passed over for a promotion to “first-grade detective,” a coveted designation that comes with a significant pay raise, even as younger detectives were promoted.</p>
      <p>All of this came as a surprise to Mr. Dietrich, who was more accustomed to being treated as a hero. As a young officer, he had received the department’s highest medal for valor <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/96/sp467-96.html">for his </a>actions during a gunfight in a Queens parking garage in 1994. He then spent years on a narcotics squad in Queens before joining the mayor’s security detail in 2014.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dietrich’s plight — a decorated detective manning a guard booth — got the attention of higher-ups who began asking what had happened.</p>
      <p>One such higher-up was Thomas Galati, the department’s chief of intelligence, who called Mr. Dietrich in for a career chat in 2017. It was then that Chief Galati told Mr. Dietrich the problem: Mr. Dietrich’s commanding officer thought Mr. Dietrich was “a hairbag,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the city have argued that the “hairbag” remark “can be deemed to indicate his superiors’ assessment of the plaintiff and his work ethic, and have nothing to do with his age.”</p>
      <p>But in May, a federal judge in Manhattan, Colleen McMahon, rejected that argument, concluding instead that the comment “suggests a negative perception of plaintiff’s attitude and abilities because of his age.”</p>
      <p>That decision brought the case one step closer to a trial, which would probably explore the word’s origin and definition, according to Mr. Dietrich’s lawyer, Marshall Bellovin.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dietrich’s lawsuit is a reminder that police slang is very much alive today. To officers these words offer a powerful language for communicating what happens on the streets or at Police Headquarters.</p>
      <p>Some officers have theorized “hairbag” comes from the way <a href="https://brooklynnorth.blogspot.com/search?q=hairbag">the wool uniforms of yesteryear — the “bag” in police slang — would pill</a> with age, creating a hairy, or at least fuzzy, appearance.</p>
      <p>Another possibility is that the word traces its roots to the Fire Department, not the Police Department. A retired New York City fire chief, Howard J. Hill, explained in <a href="https://www.fireengineering.com/2019/06/20/203114/whats-a-hair-bag/#gref">a recent article in Fire Engineering magazine</a> that as far back as the 19th century, firefighters would use a haircut as an excuse to leave the firehouse, sometimes for a romantic tryst.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hill explained that “a firefighter was required to present the officer with a lock of cut hair in a bag as proof of seeing a barber, not the love of his life; hence, the term.” Those who “missed an alarm for a fire while supposedly out getting a haircut” would be labeled “a hair bag.”</p>
      <p>The word has been used in the Police Department since at least 1958, when it appeared in a glossary of “New York City Police Argot” in the department’s magazine, Spring 3100. The definition was brief and neutral: “a veteran policeman.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/02/15/archives/police-cops-have-slanguage-of-own.html?module=inline">A 1970 article</a> in The New York Times gave the word a more positive spin, defining a hairbag as “a veteran patrol man, also a patrolman with backbone.”</p>
      <p>Over time, it appears, the word took on a negative connotation for some officers. “A bitter and burned-out complainer” is the way Edward Conlon, the author and former detective, defined it in a <a href="http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1998-08-10#folio=038">1998 New Yorker article</a>, written under a pseudonym.</p>
      <p>In a recent memoir, a former top chief in the department, Charles Campisi, recalled hearing the phrase shortly after leaving the academy. His new training officer asked him, “I guess they told you rookies that we’re all a bunch of hairbags and not to listen to us and pick up our bad habits, right?”</p>
      <p>The phrase is not dying out. When a pair of officers set up a satirical news site about the Police Department in 2017, they called it <a href="https://www.thehairbagtimes.com/">The Hairbag Times</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dietrich’s lawyers are starting to take depositions of police officials. At a recent one, Inspector Howard Redmond, the commanding officer who was accused in the lawsuit of calling Mr. Dietrich a hairbag behind his back, pleaded ignorance.</p>
      <p>He acknowledged having heard the word, but claimed not to know its meaning, according to Mr. Dietrich, who was present for the deposition.</p>
      <p>That struck Mr. Dietrich as implausible. “Come on, every cop knows what a hairbag is,” he said.</p>
