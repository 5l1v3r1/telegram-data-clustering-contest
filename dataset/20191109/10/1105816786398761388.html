      <h1>US demands Russia, Syria stop air strikes killing civilians</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:16:14+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>WASHINGTON: </b>The United States on Friday demanded that the Syrian government and its Russian allies stop airstrikes in northwestern Syria, saying they had a pattern of attacking civilians.</p>
      <p>An <i>AFP</i> correspondent on Wednesday saw a rescue worker carry the limp body of a tiny girl, her throat covered in blood, in the village of Al-Sahaara in the enclave of Idlib.</p>
      <p>The US State Department said that attacks in the northwestern area over the previous two days had struck a school and a maternity hospital, killing 12 people.</p>
      <p>“The latest reported incidents reflect a well-documented pattern of attacks against civilians and infrastructure by Russian and Syrian forces,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said.</p>

      <p>“We urge Russia and the Assad regime to resolve this conflict through the UN-facilitated political process and to stop waging war in civilian areas,” she said in a statement.</p>
      <p>President Bashar al-Assad in April launched a devastating offensive in Idlib, a region home to three million people that remains under the control of Syria’s former al-Qaeda affiliate.</p>
      <p>The violence comes amid talks in Geneva on amending Syria’s constitution to pave the way to end the brutal civil war, which has killed more than 370,000 people since 2011.</p>
