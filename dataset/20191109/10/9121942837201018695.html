      <p>BURNLEY, England (AP) — Mistakes from West Ham goalkeeper Roberto handed Burnley a 3-0 win in the Premier League to end a losing run on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ashley Barnes scored in the 11th minute after Roberto failed to catch the ball at a corner.</p>
      <p>Chris Wood put the ball in the net, only for video review to disallow it for offside, but scored soon after in the 44th after a poor pass in defense left West Ham exposed.</p>
      <p>West Ham’s inconsistent stand-in for the injured Lukasz Fabianski, Roberto added an own-goal in the 54th, knocking the ball into his net at a corner.</p>
      <p>After three straight losses, the win at Turf Moor returns Burnley to the top half of the table, while West Ham is on a seven-game run without a win in all competitions since beating Manchester United 2-0 on Sept. 22. The Hammers haven’t won away in the league since August.</p>
      <p>There was another blow for West Ham in stoppage time as Manuel Lanzini was stretchered off with an apparent shoulder injury.</p>
