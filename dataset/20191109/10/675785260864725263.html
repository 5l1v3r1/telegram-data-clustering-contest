      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-a-celebrity-lineup-2019-14274681">I'm A Celebrity 2019</a> star Roman Kemp has posted a grovelling apology for "offensive" posts on his social media accounts.</p>
      <p>The radio presenter, 26, is said to be heading into the jungle next week, and before flying to Australia he decided to give his social media accounts a thorough cleanse.</p>
      <p>He said he decided to take a look at his posts after an incident with a troll, and admits he was "shocked and appalled" by some of the "offensive" messages he'd shared in the past.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> today, Roman declared he's deleted the offending posts and apologised to fans for his language.</p>
      <p>He explained: "I wanted to talk about something I’ve seen a lot of celebrities talking about, and people around the world talking about, and that is the use of language online.</p>
      <p>"I went through something terrible with a troll online and it encouraged me to look back and take responsibility to see if I had ever posted anything that could cause harm or offence to someone.</p>

      <p>"Being totally honest, I'm shocked and appalled and ashamed to say I did find things."</p>
      <p>Roman insisted he's a changed person and is "truly, deeply and utterly sorry" for the things he posted in the past.</p>
      <p>He went on: "I did find things I’m not at all proud of. I don’t associate myself with that.</p>
      <p>"I know the person who wrote those things is not the man I am now, but they were there.</p>

      <p>"I made the conscious decision to get those things, I have deleted those things.</p>
      <p>"I don’t want that negativity in the world. I don’t want the legacy I have on the internet to be a place where there is negativity, or something that can cause offence.</p>
      <p>"For anyone that has ever been offended by something I have said online, I am truly, deeply and utterly sorry.</p>
      <p>"Going forward, I want to be that good social media user that spreads happiness about humans, not negativity.</p>
      <p>"I hope that you watching this want to do the same. Together, let’s make the internet a bit of a better place."</p>
