      <p>After weeks of closed-door depositions, public hearings into whether President Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate a rival for political gain are scheduled to begin on Wednesday. William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a top State Department official, are set to appear in front of the House Intelligence Committee. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine who was removed from her post, is scheduled to appear on Friday.</p>
      <p>Representative Adam B. Schiff, above, a California Democrat and the chairman of the committee, is leading the investigation. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/magazine/adam-schiff-impeachment.html?module=inline">The Magazine took a look at how he’s running the inquiry</a>. It’s worth setting aside some time for this interesting long read.</p>
      <h3>A flood of transcripts</h3>
      <p>Ahead of the hearings, House investigators released several transcripts of closed-door depositions. Scan key excerpts from the testimonies or read the full transcripts:</p>

        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html">A key witness revises his testimony</a>
      </h3>
      <p>With a “refreshed” recollection, Gordon D. Sondland, above, the United States ambassador to the European Union, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html?module=inline">revised his testimony in the impeachment inquiry</a>. Mr. Sondland, a hotelier from Portland, Ore., told investigators that he had laid out a quid pro quo to a top official in Ukraine. In return for military aid, he said, the country would most likely have to publicly pledge to begin investigations that Mr. Trump wanted, involving his political rivals.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, above, who provided damaging testimony about the phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, has become a target for President Trump and his allies. Two New York Times reporters, Mike McIntire and Nicholas Confessore, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-vindman-twitter.html?module=inline">wrote about an attack on the colonel’s </a>character and motives being spread on Twitter by Trump supporters, including Donald Trump Jr. Others have questioned the loyalties of Colonel Vindman, a decorated Army officer who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/29/us/politics/who-is-alexander-vindman.html?module=inline">born in Ukraine and came to the United States as a child</a>.</p>
      <p>We also learned this week that, shortly after the White House released a reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump’s call with Ukraine’s leader, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/us/politics/trump-william-barr-ukraine-call.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">asked Attorney General William P. Barr to hold a news conference to say that he had broken no laws</a> during the call. Mr. Barr declined. It may be a sign that the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/trump-william-barr.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">inquiry is testing the ties between </a>the two men.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>From Kiev, Andrew Kramer of The Times reports new details of how Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/ukraine-trump-zelensky.html?module=inline">Zelensky, and the country’s top officials dealt with President Trump’s demands</a> for investigations in their country.</p>
      <p>Under the threat of a hold on military aid, Mr. Zelensky, above, who was elected on a platform that included ending politically motivated investigations, and his government were making plans to announce the inquiries. News of the freeze leaked in the United States, causing an uproar on Capitol Hill and preventing the Ukranians from having to make those announcements after all.</p>
