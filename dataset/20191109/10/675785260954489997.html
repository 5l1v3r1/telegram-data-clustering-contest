      <h1>Mum hits back at 'hate comments' after appearing on documentary about food banks</h1>
      <h2>Heather has been upset by some of the backlash she's faced after she appeared in TV documentary Exposure: Britain's Hidden Hunger</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:44:58+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Shannon Hards</a></address>
      <p>A mum has responded to the backlash she received after appearing on an ITV documentary about families using <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/food-banks">food banks.</a></p>
      <p>Heather, from Camborne in Cornwall, said she's upset about comments she was faced with after being in new ITV <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/documentaries">documentary</a>  Exposure: Britain's Hidden Hunger on Thursday.</p>
      <p>She said she took the chance to speak as there are lots of low income families who are struggling, <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/celebs-tv/camborne-mum-speaks-backlash-over-3515905">Cornwall Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>The mum urged people who write "hate comments" to think before they write and said such comments are "shameful".</p>
      <p>Heather, who lives with her five children and husband Mike, confessed that the family struggles during the summer holidays because she can't rely on school meals to feed her kids.</p>
      <p>She said when they had children they could afford a large family but circumstances have since changed and have been out of their control.</p>

      <p>Mike has a job in retail on £8.20 an hour but the couple can't afford to feed their five children on his wages and family benefits so are forced to resort to the food bank, she said.</p>
      <p>The show follows three families who are struggling to feed their children at a time when in Britain an estimated 14 million people are living in poverty.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the episode Heather said she hopes to study to become a journalist, in order to gain employment and provide for her family.</p>
      <p>She said: "I’m upset at the comments when people haven’t even seen the film yet and they don’t know me.</p>
      <p>"Lots of low-income families are struggling and I took the chance to speak out about it so that everyone is aware.</p>
      <p>"We are a working family but we get top ups of certain benefits because we are a low-income family. We can’t help if my husband’s hours are low and he works all that he can.</p>
      <p>"I’m in ill health so am struggling myself but now that my daughter has started school, I’ll be trying to get some work too."</p>

      <p>Heather said: "I am nervous about the episode but it is nice to know I am helping people. I am trying to help people be aware that we are all embarrassed to use food banks but hopefully if someone talks about it the shame will go away."</p>
      <p>She continued: "I have heard from my friends who watched the show and have told me how proud they are that I’ve done this.</p>
      <p>"I think Don from the food bank has received some emails too – I’m not sure what they say but I understand they are all positive. I keep myself private usually and have low self-confidence so this has been a difficult thing to do but I just wanted to raise awareness.</p>
      <p>"I like the fact that there are some good people out there some people have reached out to say that they have used food banks too.</p>
      <p>"The children wanted to stay up last night to watch it and I had the film crew in contact last night.</p>
      <p>"It was really nerve-wracking – a lot of people don’t like being filmed or having their picture taken and I’m definitely one of those but I knew that the production team needed help and wanted someone to speak out."</p>

      <p>Heather added: "I would say to people who write hate comments to think before they write. It is shameful to think that these people are writing stuff about my kids and they have children themselves.</p>
      <p>"You can see who the decent people are from looking at the comments because the bad people expose themselves.</p>
      <p>"I do appreciate the support, the messages and the people who are standing by us."</p>
      <p>Heather admitted during last night's episode: "I think I’ve been reliant on the food bank every time the holidays have come for as long as I can remember. Without that I don’t know what we’d do.</p>
      <p>"It’s either pay your bills or put food on the table and you really see that in the six weeks' holidays."</p>
      <p>Mike added: "We don’t have any luxuries or anything like that.</p>
      <p>"We don’t go out, we don’t have holidays, we don’t do anything, there’s no money for it, we are just getting by.</p>
      <p>"I’m going to work as many hours as I can just to put food on the table, pay the bills, keep the debt collectors out the door, that’s all I’m doing but that in itself is empty."</p>
      <p>He added: "I don’t want to be saying, ‘no, you can’t have that piece of bread because it needs to be for breakfast in the morning’ or whatever it is."</p>
      <p>The couple later admitted that they both felt humiliated to ask for support from the local food bank.</p>
      <p>Mike said: "I don’t like going into the building because I feel embarrassed I suppose."</p>
      <p>Heather added: "It’s a pride thing, even when I go to ask for vouchers, usually at my doctor’s, it’s like I check to see if anyone is around and I go under my breath, 'can I have some food bank vouchers please?'</p>
      <p>"It’s something you don’t want people seeing."</p>
      <p>Mike said: "It does feel embarrassing but we’ve got no choice. It makes me feel like an inch tall to think that I’m working and I’m taking food away from someone that may need it more but I know that we wouldn’t survive without it.</p>
      <p>"We wouldn’t be able to provide every meal for our children."</p>
      <p>Heather added: "I don’t want to rely on the food bank. I want to be at a point where I don’t have to rely on the food bank because it makes you feel like a failure, it makes you feel like you aren’t providing for your children, which is a really horrible feeling."</p>
      <p>In the episode Heather and her children visit the Camborne, Pool Redruth (CPR) Foodbank run by co-ordinator Don Gardner.</p>
      <p>The CPR Foodbank has for many years collected items before distributing them to families struggling to make ends meet in the Camborne, Pool and Redruth area.</p>

      <p>Emma Revie chief executive at the Trussell Trust said: “What we are seeing year-upon-year is more and more people struggling to eat because they simply cannot afford food. This is not right.</p>
      <p>“Enough is enough. We know this situation can be fixed – that’s why we’re campaigning to create a future where no one needs a food bank. Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/what-universal-credit-benefit-explained-13390461">Universal Credit</a> should be part of the solution but currently the five week wait is leaving many without enough money to cover the basics. As a priority, we’re urging the government to end the wait for Universal Credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households. </p>
      <p>"Ultimately, it’s unacceptable that anyone should have to use a food bank in the first place. No charity can replace the dignity of having financial security. That’s why in the long-term, we’re urging the Government to ensure benefit payments reflect the true cost of living and work is secure, paying the real Living Wage, to help ensure we are all anchored from poverty."</p>
