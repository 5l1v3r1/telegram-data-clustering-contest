      <p>Sharon Stone demonstrated her famous, Basic Instinct leg-crossing scene on stage while making a powerful speech about sexuality.</p>
      <p>The actress, 61, recreated the moment, this time with underwear on, as she was crowned Woman Of The Year at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards in Berlin.</p>
      <p>She told the audience: “Some years ago I was sitting on a sound stage, and my director said, ‘Can you hand me your underpants because we’re seeing them in the scene and you shouldn’t have underpants on but we won’t see anything.’</p>
      <p>“And I said, ‘sure.’</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know this moment would change my life.”</p>

      <p>Referring to the scene from the 1992 film, in which she starred opposite Michael Douglas, she said: “Thank you for choosing me to be Woman Of The Year because there was a time when all I was, was a  joke.”</p>
      <p>Wearing a short, black dress and sitting on the stage, Stone said she had reclaimed her “grace” and “dignity”.</p>
      <p>“I respected it… Because we have every right to be powerful in whatever form of sexuality we choose to have and no-one is allowed to take that away from you.”</p>
      <p>She told the GQ Men Of The Year awards she was “here in my grace, tenderness and dignity” and “it was hard won”.</p>
      <p>She asked the audience to recreate the scene, saying: “Do you feel empowered? Maybe not. Let’s do it again.”</p>
