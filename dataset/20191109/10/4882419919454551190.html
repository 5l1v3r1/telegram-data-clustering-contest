      <h1>Barcelona vs. Celta Vigo: Valverde's side can't afford another slip up</h1>
      <h2>The Catalans have failed to win their last two games and must beat Celta on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:51:34+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:51</time> by <a rel="author">Toni Frieros</a></address>
      <p>It's true that any team would swap places with Barcelona right now. The Catalans are top of La Liga and their Champions League group. That is true. But in the case we need to focus on an old proverb: you can't see the forest for the trees...</p>
      <p>Barça have set the bar so high over the last decade that they're always obliged to win, but also to play well, to stick to their identity. It has been a while since we have seen that Barça. We didn't see it at Levante last week when they lost and we didn't see it in midweek when they drew with Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Coach Ernesto Valverde said on Friday it's "very important" to return to winning ways this weekend. He knows better than anyone that bad results need to end before the international break. They cannot afford to slip up against a Celta Vigo side in the relegation zone... that has lost its last four games.</p>
      <p>Barça must win on Saturday against Celta, who will be coached for the first time by new manager Oscar Garcia, who has strong connections to Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Will Luis Suarez play? He has been passed fit and included in the squad. A late decision will be made on if he is ready from the start. Messi, Griezmann, Dembele and Ansu are all in the squad, too, while Carles Perez drops out.</p>
      <p>There's also a return for Junior Firpo. He's not featured since September but comes in with Jordi Alba injured. He could start at left-back in a game Valverde must win.</p>
