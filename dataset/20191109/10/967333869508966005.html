      <p>Royal well-wishers may start bracing for another round of baby news as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have apparently displayed some interest in having a second child.</p>
      <p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid a surprise visit to British Army wives at a Windsor, UK event on Wednesday, and bonded with military families.</p>
      <blockquote>“Harry was really quite interested in how things were with second children because we both have older children,” military wife Susie Stringfellow told the state-run Forces Network, referring to herself and her friend.</blockquote>
      <p>“We were trying to encourage him to have a second baby,” she added with a chuckle.</p>
      <p>Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905081074816017-royal-baby-prince-harry-meghan-markle/">welcomed their first-born</a> and so far only child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, in May this year.</p>
      <p>Another woman who was present recounted that “Harry was saying how little Archie was starting to crawl, how they've started eating different foods, [making] all of the funny faces.”</p>

      <p>Speaking to British Vogue in July, Prince Harry revealed that he only wants two children “maximum”.</p>
      <p>That same month, royal expert Katie Nicholl said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910161077062092-prince-harry-goes-emotional-while-talking-about-meghan-markles-pregnancy/">the pair are “loving parenthood” so much</a> that they might be preparing for bringing in a sibling for Archie.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think it's probably a little premature to be speaking about a second baby,” Nicholl noted. “That said, sources close to the couple told me that they really would love to have a big family.”</blockquote>
      <p>She added there will possibly be a second pregnancy announcement for Meghan and Harry “sometime next year, but, for the moment, the focus is obviously on Archie.”</p>
