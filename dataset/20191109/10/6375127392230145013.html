      <h3>MARIAN Rivera just renewed her contract as endorser of Reverie by Beautederm for its line of home products. When they got Marian last year, they offered soy candle scents. Now, they also offer a Beautederm Air Diffuser with several aromatic oils to choose from, all made in collaboration with Marian herself: Into The Woods (Bamboo Scent, which is Marian’s own favorite), Smells Like Candy (Cherry Scent, best for kids), Time To Bloom (Fresh Rose Scent), Something Minty (Eucalyptus Scent), and Rest &amp; Relaxation (Lavender Scent, the best to put you in the right romantic mood, says Marian).</h3>
      <p>“The diffuser and the oils will increase moisture in your room for easier breathing and a good night’s sleep,” says Marian. “It rehydrates your skin and also has a built in light that can serve as a night light for your kids. I don’t endorse a product I don’t believe in and I’m happy to be the face of Beautederm Home kasi its president and CEO, Rhea Anicoche Tan, is now family to me. She made me so comfortable in our partnership and I’m humbled by the trust she’s giving me.”</p>
      <p>“It’s not surprising naman that we want her to remain as our endorser,” says Rhea. “Kasi last year, one month after she became our endorser, the sales of Beautiderm tripled agad. This coming Christmas season, Beautederm beautifully packaged  home products are ideal as gifts for your friends and family, from our skin set with its soap, toner, purified facial wash, day and night creams, our Origin Senses perfume for men, and our topselling Beaute Balm, Au Revoir Skin Soothing Oil and Cristaux Gold Elixir Serum to keep you young looking. Since we started in 2009, Beautederm now has 100 outlets all over the country, also in Singapore and soon, in New Zealand and Europe.”</p>
      <p>Marian is a hands-on mom and she really uses Beautederm products for her and hubby Dingdong Dantes’ own home. But her fans are missing her and curious as to when they’ll see her again in a TV soap or a movie. “May pinaplanong soap but for next year na, Mauuna muna 'yung kay Dong na ‘Descendants of the Sun’. May usapan kasi kami na alternate kami in doing soaps para may maiiwang isa sa aming bahay to personally take care of our kids. Ako, hatid-sundo ko sa school si Zia at breastfed sa akin si Ziggy, so mas ako ngayon ang laging nasa bahay. Marami ring movie offers, pero next year na lahat 'yan.”</p>
      <p>Zia is now herself an endorser. What about Baby Ziggy? “Napag-usapan namin ni Dong na, as much as possible, we want them to have a normal childhood. Si Zia kasi, mas pinagkakaguluhan pa ngayon kaysa sa’min ni Dong. We decided na when she reaches four years old, tigil na muna lahat ng exposure niya, pati sa social media. Para maging normal ang pagiging bata niya. Right now, lahat ng kinikita niya sa endorsements goes to her own bank account at makukuha niya 'yun when she’s of the right age.”</p>
      <p>Recently, she reconciled with her former manager, Popoy Caritativo, with whom she had a rift when she opted to be managed by Triple A. “Well, sabi nga ni Popoy, dumating na 'yung right time na na-heal na 'yung mga sugat na nakasakit. Mahal ko si Popoy at habang panahon kong tatanawin ang utang na loob na sa kanya ako nag-umpisa.”</p>
      <p>How about Lovi Poe with whom she had a falling out when they did “Temptation Island"? “Wala naman talagang away na naganap sa’min ni Lovi. Kaya nang magkita kami when she guested sa ‘Sunday Pinasaya’, hindi pin-lano yun at basta nagyakapan kami agad. At saka ang tanda ko na para magkaroon ng kagalit. Masarap mabuhay nang walang kaaway. At ang bait ni Lord sa akin, lahat binigay na Niya, so ano pa bang gugustuhin ko?”</p>
      <p>Marian has also discarded her imported and branded bags and garments in favor of local products. “Parang natapos na 'yung time na nahilig ako sa expensive branded na gamit so I sold them and bought locally made things, pati mga sinusuot ng mga anak ko. Nakita ko kasi na maganda ang mga gawa rito sa atin at magaling talaga ang mga Pinoy, so I want to support them. Parang mas makabuluhan kapag gawang Pinoy ang gamit ko.”</p>
      <p>Marian also wants to share her blessings to the needy, so she and Rhea Tan will partner with Yes Pinoy Foundation to help victims of the recent Mindanao earthquake. “We all should help kasi yung victims, nagsisisiksikan sa evacuation centers at kailangan nila talaga ng tulong. So I’m glad that Rhea has agreed to help them at bibili raw agad ng kaban-kabang bigas to be distributed there.  We who are so blessed should really share our blessings with the less fortunate.”</p>
