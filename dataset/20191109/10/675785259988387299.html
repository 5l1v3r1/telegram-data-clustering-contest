      <p>A police officer punched a Slovan Bratislava fan to the floor with one shot amid crowd trouble following their defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> in the Europa League at Molineux.</p>
      <p>Around 1,000 Slovan fans made the trip to the West Midlands and three arrests were made.</p>
      <p>Allegations included coin-throwing, a racial comment and assault of an officer.</p>
      <p>Footage shows several Slovan fans charge at cops, before one is struck in the face and floored by the single punch.</p>
      <p>Officers also use batons to stop the onrushing fans following the match which Wolves won 2-1 to leave them on the brink of qualification for the knockout stages.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for West Midlands Police told the Express and Star: "There were pockets of disorder during the evening which included a group of away supporters surging towards home fans forcing police officers to intervene.</p>
      <p>"An officer was assaulted as officers contained the volatile away following.</p>

      <p>"A 36-year-old man from Slovakia was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and remains in police custody for questioning."</p>
      <p>Wolves' victory was the second over their Slovakian opponents this season after also claiming the three points in the reverse fixture.</p>
      <p>The match in Bratislava was played 'behind closed doors' - although thousands of supporters still attended owing to a UEFA rule that allowed children under the age of 14 to attend accompanied by an adult.</p>
