      <h2>Aston Villa and West Brom latest | The 40-year-old face of Matchroom Sport was speaking in Los Angeles as YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul prepare to throw gloves in front of 20,000 fans.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:25:02+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:25</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/tom-leach/</a></address>
      <p>Dean Smith's side may be lacing their gloves to do battle with rivals Wovles in the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> at Molineux on Sunday, but boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has aimed a surprise below the belt dig at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> and their nearby rivals <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a>.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old face of Matchroom Sport was speaking in Los Angeles as YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul prepare to throw gloves in front of 20,000 fans, and millions watching around the world, at the world famous Staples Centre on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The fight has created quite a media storm with the two social media influencers headlining a card filled with some of the most talented boxers in the world.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Two-weight world champion Billy Joe Saunders and the man dubbed the next Floyd Mayweather, Devin Haney, will both be in action on America's east coast on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>But it will be gaming star Olajide Olatunji, better known as KSI, and vlogger Logan Paul who will contest the night's main event in what is expected to draw the biggest pay per view numbers of any boxing fight so far this year.</p>

      <p>And as the anticipation builds for the clash, Hearn was asked what boxing purists would make of the bout and it's incredible popularity - and his response may well get blood boiling in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>"The hardcore fans hate casual fans. They hate the word casuals," he told Behind the Gloves.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"They'll say: 'Oh, he's a casual. He only goes to the big fights!' - but that's sport.</p>
      <p>"Do you think everybody would want to go to West Brom against Villa? Sorry to West Brom and Villa fans, no," he said with a laugh.</p>

      <p>"They want to see Manchester United against Liverpool. That's just sport."</p>
      <p>While KSI and Logan Paul come face to face in the staples centre, with the ring walk timed for 4am, Villa's stars will already, hopefully, be tucked up in bed preparing for their very own slug-fest at Molineux.</p>
