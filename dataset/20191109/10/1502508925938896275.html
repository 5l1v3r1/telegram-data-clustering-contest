      <p>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by 22.1 per cent to Rs 45 crore, the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Greenply Industries' CMD Rajesh Mittal said, "E-way bill and GST implementation is becoming strict and we are witnessing that the unorganised players raise prices, leading to a reduction in the price disparity."<br/><br/>The company's expansion in Gabon in West Africa is "shaping up well" and it is looking forward to a better performance in the coming years, he said.</p>
