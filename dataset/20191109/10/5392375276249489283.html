      <p>Since it’s only a Custom Gift Box Edition, the smartphone is the same as the ordinary model, which means we find a large 6.59-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2340 and a real full screen design; no notches or holes on the screen. The front camera is indeed hidden in a pop-up mechanism in which we have a 16MP image sensor.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile as far as the rear cameras are concerned, the Honor 9X packs a primary 48MP sensor with f/1.8 aperture, a secondary snapper with 2MP resolution and ultra wide lens. Finally we have a third 2MP depth sensor.</p>

      <p>Powering Honor’s 9X we then have a super efficient HiSilicon Kirin 810 octa-core processor with a maximum clock of 2.27Ghz  paired with a Mali G-52 GPU. Memory wise we find a minimum of 4GB of RAM up to 8GB of RAM; meanwhile storage is available in 64GB and 128GB configurations.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Honor 9X comes with a large 4000mAh capacity battery with support for 10W charging, it features a microSD slot to upgrade the internal memory, a 3.5mm audio jack and FM radio.</p>
