      <h2>TV chef Gino D'Acampo's eponymous Birmingham restaurant opened on Temple Row on October 31 promising to "serve real Italian food" But does it deliver?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T10:04:11+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Sanjeeta Bains, https://www.facebook.com/sanjeetabainsbm/</a></address>
      <p>The much anticipated <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/first-look-inside-gino-dacampos-17173578">Gino D’ACampo My Restaurant</a> opened on Halloween.</p>
      <p>Apart from Marco Pierre White Steakhouse at The Cube, which <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/marco-pierre-white-tells-jamie-16781497">the man himself acknowledged </a> benefits from the rooftop location, big-name chef chain operations haven’t got the best track record in the city.</p>
      <p>The short-lived Tom’s Kitchen, from Tom Aikens, closed at the Mailbox earlier this year and we all know what happened to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/marco-pierre-white-tells-jamie-16781497">Jamie’s Italian.</a></p>
      <p>The current hospitality climate is harsh and having your name above the door is simply not enough to maintain a restaurant.</p>
      <p>TV chef and cookbook author Gino D’Acampo appears to be bucking the trend.</p>
      <p>Gino fronts a growing chain of Italian restaurants owned by Individual Restaurants group (which also runs Brum eateries Bank and Piccolino).</p>
      <p>The cheeky chappie chef is a household name thanks to his appearances on daytime shows This Morning and Let’s Do Lunch, Gordon, Gino and Fred's Road Trip and for giving us travel as well as food porn on Gino’s Italian Escape.</p>
      <p>Judging by the number of shows TV channels are giving him, Gino is TV gold. But do his restaurants provide foodie gold? </p>

      <h3>The setting</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>This is the sixth Gino D’Acampo restaurant to open in the UK.</p>
      <p>On Temple Row one door down from The Ivy, it’s a very pretty restaurant - light and airy with a super swanky bar.</p>
      <p>The turquoise colour scheme could be quite calming if it wasn’t for the thumping loud music coming from the laptop of a DJ standing just around the corner from the entrance.</p>
      <p>The music seemed very incongruous to the chic restaurant surroundings - I felt like I had been transported back in time to a Nineties wine bar.</p>
      <p>The restaurant area snakes around the bar so it is much bigger than it looks from outside but not as cathedral sized as Jamie's old Bullring place.</p>
      <p>The trip to the loos at this restaurant is perhaps the most interesting in Brum -  a tour through the Gino Hall of Fame.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There are dozens of pictures of the TV star with his many celebrity friends. The pics are crammed on the walls lining the staircase.</p>
      <p>Once downstairs, I’m greeted by a nightclub type loungey restroom area - there is a comfy sofa and chairs with a full length mirror just outside the toilets.</p>
      <p>Are people drinking and eating quickly in tune to the loud music until they have to vacate their table and and retreat downstairs to carry on the party here? This definitely felt Gino: My Club territory.</p>
      <p>Back upstairs we ate our starters, and my colleague commented several times the music was far too loud for his liking.</p>
      <p>But we were surrounded by much older diners who didn't seem at all bothered.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>The food</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Opening the menu feels like settling in to read a good book.</p>
      <p>It is massive. Firstly there is a lengthy preface from Gino introducing the choices and it includes a dedication to his dad.</p>
      <p>It's not really a menu - more like an autobiography presented as a menu -  there are descriptions about the inspiration behind each dish and, rather handily, which Gino cookbook you can find them in and what page number. It's quite a sweet touch and one I'm sure his fans will appreciate. </p>
      <p>The menu/autobiography sections are confusing. The front page is devoted to Gino's mains recommendations and then you find the starters and cicchetti dishes, before pasta, pizza  mains and speciality grills and steaks.</p>
      <p>And the sides are all on the back page so we didn't see them till it was time for dessert.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The 'Fantastico' starter immediately sprang out from the menu - cured hams, percorino, mozzarella,buffalo ricotta, artichokes, olives, sundried tomatoes and a selection of breads. It certainly sounded fantastico but at £23.25 - expensive as a starter for two.</p>
      <p>Instead, we opted for the tomato caper foccacia  and a couple of antipasti dishes - arancini balls and calamari.</p>
      <p>The foccacia was lovely - freshly made and flavoursome.</p>
      <p>The arancini balls were hearty but I thought bland, the calamari were crispy and tender. Both greatly benefited from their accompanying dips.</p>

        <figcaption>Carbonara at Gino D'ACampo: My Restaurant - Pecorino cheese but no peppercorn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For mains,  I went for classic carbonara - free range eggs, pancetta and pecorino cheese. Gino's menu description says its made like "it should be just like in Italy".</p>
      <p>I was offered no shake from the pepper grinder - but my waiter was very generous with the cheese. Always welcome. Grazi.</p>
      <p>My pasta was pleasant enough. I fared much better than my colleague. </p>
      <p>He had gone for ravioli with ham and ricotta,  sundried tomatoes and spicy Calabrian sausage. The pasta was swimming in oil from the sausage.  I took a bite and grimaced.</p>
      <p>It was super soggy with unappealing flavour contrasts.</p>

        <figcaption>Baileys Panna Cotta with caramel sauce and hazelnut cantuccini biscuit at Gino D'Acampo: My Restaurant</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>My colleague was not as dismissive of his dish -  he thought it should come with a health warning as  the spicy sausage was far too spicy but apart from that "it did the job".</p>
      <p>For dessert, we shared a Baileys Panna Cotta with caramel sauce and Hazlenut Cantuccini biscuit. It had the perfect wobble, tasting very rich and sweet  but one bite was enough for me.</p>
      <h3>The drink</h3>
      <p>There is an extensive prosecco wine and cocktail list. I chose the house prosecco and was disappointed when it was served to me without any bubbles and just three quarters full.</p>
      <p>After my fairly flat prosecco - which would be an absolute outrage in Bella Italia never mind in Italy. The wine menu is very decent.  I chose a hearty glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo which was reliably delicious.</p>
      <h3>The service</h3>
      <p>As you'd expect from Gino's gaffe, there is never any doubt this is a Italian restaurant - the accents are very, very strong.</p>
      <p>And I lost count of the number of times I heard prego and gracious. It would have made a fun drinking game.</p>
      <p>The actual service was effusive and warm. Staff were happy to assist with dishes to recommend as well as  wine pairings.</p>
      <p>I was surprised though that the waiter didn't know what the page number at the bottom of each dish description stood for on the menu. He had to go away and ask someone.</p>
      <h3>The cost</h3>
      <p>£91.30 for three starters, two mains, one dessert, one prosecco, two large glasses of wine, diet coke and an espresso.</p>
      <h3>The verdict</h3>
      <p>On the restaurant's website, Gino states he "promises to serve real Italian food, as it should be, whilst keeping the offering affordable for guests".</p>
      <p>The food was nothing special - I've had better pasta at fellow chain Gusto which is a more affordable experience. </p>
      <p>But whatever it says on the website and on the menus, this place is not about the food.</p>
      <p>It's about evoking Gino's personality - and it represents him perfectly.</p>
      <p>As a way to spend a Friday evening - the place is fun, silly and harmless just like Gino. Fans will lap it up, if they don't mind picking up the expensive bill afterwards.</p>
      <p>It's like dining in Reflex on Broad Street - but with better decor.</p>
      <p>It's a real shame this is not Gino D'Acampo: My Bar. As a drinking establishment, the concept would work so much better for me.</p>
      <p>The Gino playlist is popular retro toe-tapping stuff. This guy sure knows how to show you a good time.</p>
      <p>During our meal, I was singing along to a  dance remix of Hall and Oates.</p>
      <p>For a fabulous meal, there are other Brum places where Italians do it  much better  - such as Fumo up the road and Laghi's in Edgbaston.</p>
      <p>My dining experience at Gino D'ACampo  was loud, warm and fun.</p>
      <p>Worth a visit - but not for the food.</p>
      <p>Food 2/5</p>
      <p>Service 3/5</p>
      <p>Setting 4/5</p>
      <p>Value 2/5</p>
