      <p>Waiters was unconscious when the plane landed, and suffered a seizure when he awakened, according to Andy Slater of South Florida’s FOX Sports 640 radio.</p>

      <p>The incident was initially reported as a “medical emergency” aboard the team’s aircraft.</p>
      <p>The Heat were flying to Los Angeles from Phoenix, where they defeated the Suns 124-108 on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>According to the Miami Herald, Waiters has now missed the first nine games of Miami’s season, after having been suspended last month for “conduct detrimental to the team.”</p>
      <p>Waiters reportedly got into an argument with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra after Miami’s preseason game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/indiana-pacers">Houston Rockets</a>.</p>
      <p>“There were a number of unacceptable incidents this week, culminating with his unprofessional conduct on the bench last night,” Heat President Pat Riley <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/fl-sp-heat-suspend-dion-waiters-20191020-wzk5hinbyvc2dd7wzmktjrkzom-story.html">told the Sun Sentinel of South Florida</a> on Oct. 19. “As a consequence, I feel we had to suspend him.”</p>
      <p>Of the games he has missed, Waiters was considered on the active roster for two of them – a win last Sunday against the Houston Rockets and the Thursday victory in Phoenix – but did not see playing time, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nba/miami-heat/article237182848.html">according to the Herald</a>.</p>

      <p>Waiters is in the third year of a four-year $52 million contract and would receive a $1.1 million bonus if he appears in 70 of the team’s 82 games this season, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Four other Heat players sat out Friday’s game against the Lakers with various injuries, the report said. Miami (6-3) lost 95-80 to Los Angeles (7-1).</p>
