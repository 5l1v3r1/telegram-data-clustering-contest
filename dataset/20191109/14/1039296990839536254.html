      <p>Both bikes get a Rs 2,520 hike, with the FZ priced at Rs 99,200 and the FZ-S at Rs 1.01 lakh.</p>
      <p>Yamaha has just launched its first BS6-compliant two-wheeler in India, with the updated FZ and FZ-S V3.0. Prices for the standard FZ start at Rs 99,200, while the FZ-S carries a base price tag of Rs 1,01,200; both bikes have received a hike of just over Rs 2,500, over their respective BS4 models. The FZ-S also gets two new colours schemes – Metallic Red and Darknight, the latter costing an additional Rs 1,500.</p>
      <p>The BS6-complaint FZ and FZ-S will be powered by a 149cc, single-cylinder engine, just like on the outgoing model. However, Yamaha has increased the compression ratio from 9.5:1 to 9.6:1, and interestingly, the updated engine produces lower power but makes more torque than the unit it is replacing. Peak power and torque stand at 12.4hp at 7,250rpm and 13.6Nm at 5,500rpm, in comparison to 13.2hp at 8,000rpm and 12.8Nm at 6,000rpm on the previous model. As you can see, peak torque also comes in at a lower point in the rev range.</p>
      <p>The rest of the bike remains largely unchanged and features like the front and rear disc brake with single-channel ABS and instrument cluster have been carried over from the outgoing FZ. Yamaha has also revealed that it will be launching the rest of its BS6-compliant line-up in the near future. </p>
