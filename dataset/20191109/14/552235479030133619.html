      <h2>Dan Carden denies claims that he changed the lyrics on the classic tune during a bus trip to the races.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tom-watson-quits-jeremy-corbyns-20828055">Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn</a> has said he is looking into reports that a member of his shadow cabinet sang "Hey Jews" to the Beatles song "Hey Jude".</p>
      <p>Dan Carden has denied the Buzzfeed news website's story that he changed the lyrics on a private bus to London from the Cheltenham races in March last year.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said it was an "awful story" and "totally unacceptable" if true.</p>

      <p>Asked about the reports on a visit to Leeds, he said: "Dan Carden has emphatically denied that.</p>
      <p>"It is an awful story and if it's true it is utterly and totally unacceptable. I am looking into it."</p>
      <p>Mr Carden, who is seeking to be re-elected as MP for Liverpool Walton, tweeted: "I have been categorical in my denial about allegations relating to a coach trip some twenty months ago.</p>
      <p>"This was a coach full of journalists and MPs. If anyone genuinely believed any anti-Semitic behaviour had taken place, they would've had a moral responsibility to report it immediately.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Yet this allegation is only made now when a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/generalelection">General Election</a> is imminent.</p>
      <p>"I stand by my record as an anti-racist campaigner. I would never be part of any behaviour that undermines my commitment to fighting racism in all its forms."</p>
