      <h1>Austin MacPhee eviscerated during incredible Hearts radio rant as he's accused of Craig Levein betrayal</h1>
      <h2>Former Jambo Allan Preston believes he should be nowhere near the club as Ann Budge looks for a new boss.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:59:58+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Former Hearts star Allan Preston has slaughtered caretaker boss Austin MacPhee claiming he should be nowhere near the club as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> looks to appoint a new manager and sporting director.</p>
      <p>MacPhee, before their match against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a>, refused to rule himself out of the running for both roles after the sacking of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> .</p>
      <p>And Preston slammed MacPhee during an incredible rant criticising his tactics and team selection in the Jambos' Betfred Cup defeat to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> last weekend.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old claimed MacPhee was 'putting two fingers' up to Levein by bringing Craig Wighton out of the cold for the Hampden clash.</p>

      <p>He told BBC Sportsound: "Austin MacPhee, certainly not for me as manager or sporting director.</p>
      <p>"I thought last week tactically he was all over the place, he picked the wrong side as well. As soon as that team line was in last week an hour before kick-off, he handed the initiative to Rangers.</p>
      <p>"Ikpeazu was described as unplayable two weeks before by Steven Gerrard.</p>
      <p>"He then plays Steven MacLean, Steven is a good lad but he wasn't mobile at 27 never mind 37 in the biggest pitch in Scotland.</p>
      <p>"So Rangers in turn an hour before kick-off can squeeze the game, squeeze the life out of Hearts. And they did that.</p>
      <p>"They absolutely annihilated Hearts. He included Craig Wighton from absolutely nowhere. Wighton is today not in the 18 as well so what does that tell you?</p>
      <p>"It looks like he was putting two fingers up to Craig Levein by saying you've got nothing out of Wighton, but I'll get a tune out of him."</p>

      <p>Preston also rubbished suggestions that MacPhee has the credentials to become <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a>' sporting director as he claimed he had a huge say in bringing flop Malaury Martin to Tynecastle in 2017.</p>
      <p>He also believes the relationship between MacPhee and Levein would pose a problem with his former boss continuing to be employed at the club.</p>
      <p>He added: "Lets go on to the sporting director role. Sporting director will have the overall say at Hearts, he will run the football department from top to bottom. Craig Levein is still at the club. So Craig Levein was Austin MacPhee's boss and now Austin MacPhee, if he gets it, it will be Craig Levein's boss?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"How is that going to sit? And let me just tell you sporting director brings in the players to Hearts. Lets go with Malaury Martin, three and-a-half-year contract, described by Austin who brought him in as a 'dead ball specialist'</p>
      <p>"We do not play American Football where we can put people on and off to take free kicks and corners. The guy was ridicilous.</p>
      <p>"So if he is the sporting director at Hearts, I worry if he is bringing in guys like Malaury Martin to the club."</p>

      <p>Preston continued to take aim at MacPhee saying he needed to 'get a life' for his pre-match comments about wanting to make Hearts a 'consistent Europa League club'</p>
      <p>He said: “Did I hear Austin right when he said that Hearts want to be a consistent Europa League club? What is all that about?</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry, but you’re talking about a club here that’s in relegation trouble in our top league and you’re talking about that. Come on! Get a life, get real!</p>
      <p>“OK make a pitch for it (the job) but it’s nonsense and somebody’s got to tell him it’s nonsense.”</p>
