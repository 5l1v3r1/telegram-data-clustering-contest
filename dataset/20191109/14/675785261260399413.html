      <h2>Phil Neville will lead out England Women in front of a sold out Wembley Stadium as they face Germany. The Lionesses have struggled for form recently but will be aiming to bounce back</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:56:07+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>England Women are expected to play in front of more than 80,000 at Wembley on Saturday for their international fixture with Germany.</p>
      <p>It will be a landmark and record occasion for women's football in England, but the last time these two sides met under the arch, the visitors recorded a 3-0 win in 2014.</p>
      <p>Neville's team have struggled for form since reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup and he discussed the journey for his squad to hit the pinnacle ahead of next year's Olympics and the 2021 Euros.</p>
      <p>Phil Neville says his Lionesses are getting closer to the levels of professionalism he wants, but are 10 to 15 per cent away playing the football he views as perfect.</p>

      <p>"They are getting up to the levels we have talked about in terms of professionalism that I want," Neville said.</p>
      <p>"Back in the first six months it was 'I say, you do, I say, you do,' in terms of driving the culture. Now I've got the players and captains in particular that are driving the culture from within.</p>
      <p>"I have taken a step back in terms of being that person that always drives things because ultimately from a learning point of view, it is better peer to peer telling each other what to do in terms of standards than me always driving that.</p>

      <p>"From a playing point of view I still think we have got another 10 to 15 per cent to go from what I see as really perfect football and that is what we are working on and that is what I want to see."</p>
