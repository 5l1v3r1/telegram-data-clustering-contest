      <p>Cape Town - <b>Paarl Rocks</b> batsman <b>JP Duminy</b> has been ruled out of the <b>2019 Mzansi Super League</b> due to a hamstring injury suffered in the lead-up to the team’s opening match against the Cape Town Blitz on Sunday at Boland Park.</p>
      <p>Duminy was diagnosed with a high-grade partial tear to his right hamstring after undergoing an MRI scan.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old missed out on last year’s tournament because of a hand injury. </p>
      <p>Paarl Rocks captain Faf du Plessis said he’s desperately disappointed for Duminy. </p>
      <p>“JP brings a lot of value in a lot of different areas. His experience will be missed, especially by the younger guys.</p>
      <p>“I have full confidence in our team to bounce back from this. We have strengthened our batting this year and we’ll use this setback as motivation,” said Du Plessis. </p>
      <p>Paarl Rocks coach Adrian Birrell said the squad is focused on the opening game against the Blitz on Sunday. </p>
      <p>“We will assess our options on Monday and then decide how to best replace JP,” he said. </p>
      <p>This is the second high-profile withdrawal to the Paarl Rocks squad for the 2019 tournament after Proteas batsman <b>Aiden Markram</b> sustained an injury during the recent tour of India.</p>
      <p>Despite retiring from all international cricket earlier this year, Duminy remains the Proteas leading T20I run-scorer. He is also an experienced T20 franchise cricketer, having played in India, Pakistan, Canada and the Caribbean.</p>
