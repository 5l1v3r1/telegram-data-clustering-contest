      <p>Kartik Aaryan, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Janhvi-Kapoor">Janhvi Kapoor</a> and Lakshya starrer 'Dostana 2' has been in the limelight since its inception. Directed by Collin D'Cunha the film is the sequel to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abhishek-Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> and John Abraham's 'Dostana'. The cast was announced a while back and on Diwali, the entire cast of the film got clicked together at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a>'s office.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the cast of the film along with the man of the ship Collin jetted off to Amritsar for the first schedule of the film. Today, Kartik took to his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> to share a BTS picture from the sets. In the picture, the actor can be seen hiding his face behind the clapboard.</p>
      <p>Kartik shared the pic and captioned it as, " <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dostana2/">#Dostana2</a> Begins !!! 👫🚶🏻‍♂️🌈 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/karanjohar/">@karanjohar</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/janhvikapoor/">@janhvikapoor</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itslakshya/">@itslakshya</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/collindcunha/">@collindcunha</a> ❤️"</p>

      <p>Before flying out of Mumbai, Kartik made sure to stop by at producer Karan Johar’s residence to take his blessings and even shared a comical post about it on his Instagram handle. “Maa da laadla #Chandigarh nikal gaya #Dostana2!! The Dharma rivaaz that all actors need to follow before starting a Dharma film @karanjohar,” he captioned the photo.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, reportedly, 'Dostana 2' will see Janhvi and Kartik as siblings who fall for the same guy played by Lakshya. The film is slated to release in 2020.</p>
