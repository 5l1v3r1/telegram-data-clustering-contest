      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tamil-nadu">Tamil Nadu </a>parties, including the main opposition DMK on Saturday batted for respecting the Supreme Court verdict on the Babri Masji-Ramjanmabhoomi issue while the State remained peaceful, sans untoward incidents.</p>
      <p>While superstar Rajinikanth said he respected the verdict, AMMK leader T T V Dhinakaran called for calm and harmony.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tamil-nadu">Tamil Nadu </a>Congress Committee President K S Alagiri said his party "bowed and accepted," the verdict.</p>
      <p>The top court's ruling should be respected the way the national flag is honoured, the State unit Congress chief said.</p>
      <p>An Indian Union Muslim League release here quoted its national general secretary and MP P K Kunhalikutty as saying that the party respected the verdict.</p>
      <p>After analysing the verdict and following consultations, the party would discuss the issue in its meeting on November 11 and decide future steps in national interest, the MP said.</p>
      <p>Tamil Maanila Congress chief G K Vaasan hailed the verdict as historic and unanimous and batted for harmony.</p>
      <p>CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan said everybody should respect the verdict,adding social harmony should be maintained and no side should see it either as a victory or defeat.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu, meanwhile, remained peaceful and there were no reports of any untoward incidents from anywhere.</p>
      <p>The police made elaborate security arrangements and posted adequate armed personnel in vulnerable and sensitive locations, including places of worship.</p>
      <p>Key installations and major infrastructures like the over a century old Pamban rail bridge in Ramanathapuram district witnessed deployment of a posse of police personnel.</p>
      <p>Patrolling was stepped up, vehicle checking intensified and riot control vehicles stationed at vantage locations.</p>
      <p>Passengers were frisked and baggage screened at railway stations, including the Central Railway Station here. Also, sniffer dogs were pressed into service for surveillance and monitoring.</p>
      <p>Security was beefed up in areas, including the Big mosque point at Triplicance here ahead of the verdict and it continued to be on.</p>
      <p>In Coimbatore and nearby Tirupur, perceived as communally sensitive,over 2,800 personnel from local and Central Armed Police Forces were deployed for a three-tier security.</p>
      <p>DMK President MK Stalin said the apex court has "found a solution to an issue" pending for a "long time" and that its verdict should be taken forward "without any bias."<br/><br/>"All sections should accept (the verdict) and I firmly believe it will be taken forward in a way upholding communal harmony, and without harming the country's plurality," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Since the Constitutional bench of the apex court had delivered the verdict, it should be implemented "without any bias," he added.</p>
      <p>Actor Rajinikanth said he respects the verdict delivered by the Supreme Court and urged all sections to follow suit.</p>
      <p>"Members of all faiths should strive for the welfare of the country and its growth without any religious differences," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Dhinakaran, AMMK leader and independent MLA, said the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>verdict should be seen just as a court ruling and that one and all should maintain peace and harmony.</p>
      <p>PMK founder S Ramadoss said the verdict was not a victory or defeat for any side, adding it should by no means create a rift between Hindus and Muslims, whom he indicated, were like brothers.</p>
      <p>"Rather, this should be seen as a tool to boost harmony between the two faiths," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ramadoss urged the Centre to constitute on time a trust for the construction of a Ram temple as directed by the Supreme Court and also takes steps to provide five acres of land to Muslims to build a mosque.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court, in an unanimous verdict on Saturday, cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ayodhya">Ayodhya </a>in Uttar Pradesh and directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque.</p>
      <p>In one of the most important and most anticipated judgements in India's history, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to the more than a century old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.</p>
