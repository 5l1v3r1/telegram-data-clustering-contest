      <p>Plymouth's Stephen Beer, who is known for appearances on TV shows Too Fat To Work and Jeremy Kyle has claimed he was forced to stage a fake affair.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old married man appeared on the now-axed tabloid talk-show seven times, first reaching out after he believed his wife was being unfaithful.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/forced-send-incriminating-texts-affairs-staged-bosses-jeremy-kyle-guest-reveals-truth-behind-axed-show-11068710/">The Metro reports</a> that Mr Beer said that he felt that producers would use him and his wife "to fill some spots on the show".</p>
      <p>Mr Beer told Metro: "I contacted them in the first place but what they do is they phone you about four or five times a day.</p>
      <p>"After that they contacted me asking me to go on the show and asked if we had anything new to say, but every time we were going on there to say one thing, it got changed at the last minute."</p>

      <p>He appeared on Jeremy Kyle in 2016 with Melissa Ede who has since passed away in an episode titled 'my transgender love rival is trying to steal my husband'.</p>
      <p>In the episode, Ms Ede went head to head with Mr Beer over the alleged cheating on his wife.</p>
      <p>After Melissa's £4million Lottery win in 2018 Mr Beer pleaded with her for some cash.</p>
      <p>He said Melissa had told him that she would pay £11,000 for him and his partner to have gastric band surgery if she ever won the lottery, something which she strongly denied.</p>

      <p>Mr Beer now claims that the affair between him and Ms Ede was "fake".</p>
      <p>He told The Metro: ‘The producers staged the affair with myself and Melissa, who tragically passed away earlier this year. She wanted to go on the show anyway but the story about the affair is fake.</p>
      <p>"They also told is to send each other text messages so it would look like there was more going on, but none of it was true.</p>
      <p>"I went to visit Melissa in Hull because we were friends anyway but she told Jeremy Kyle that she fancied me, so the story changed again at the last minute before I had even gone on stage."</p>
      <p>He claimed that he felt like the show was a "prison" as "everyone has their own assistant who would follow you everywhere, even if you wanted to go to the toilet".</p>
