      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is defending his decision to nominate the former head of the Massachusetts Republican Party for the position of clerk magistrate of the Stoughton District Court.</p>
      <p>Baker on Wednesday nominated Kirsten Hughes to the post.</p>
      <p>In a press release announcing the nomination, Baker's office pointed to Hughes' experience as an attorney, general counsel for the Norfolk County Sheriff's Office and as Quincy city councilor.</p>
      <p>Unmentioned was Hughes' years as chair of the Massachusetts Republican Party from 2013 to 2019.</p>
