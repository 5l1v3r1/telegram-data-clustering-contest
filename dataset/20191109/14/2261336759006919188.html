      <h1>Logan Paul ready to callout Dana White after KSI rematch: I love MMA, I want to fight in the UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:00:00+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>With hopes of eventually fighting in the UFC, Logan Paul plans to namedrop Dana White after his rematch in boxing this weekend against fellow YouTube star ‘KSI.’</p>
      <p>Paul and KSI will rematch each other this Saturday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The two fought to a draw in their first bout last year, however that was a ‘white-collar’ fight. This time they’ll ditch the headgear, and make it a full professional contest for the rematch.</p>
      <p>Talking recently to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16tKd9exBEg">Cageside Press</a>, Paul said whether he wins or loses in the rematch, he will call-out the UFC president post-fight—as he hopes to fight in the UFC one day.</p>
      <p>“One-hundred percent, the first name that’s coming out of my mouth is Dana White,” Paul said. “I want to fight in the UFC. I think Dana White can make that happen.</p>
      <p>“I love MMA. I grew up wrestling. I was one of the best wrestlers in Ohio. No disrespect, but what the (expletive) am I doing? I’m using half of the skills I was training my whole life to do.” (<a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/logan-paul-name-dropping-dana-white-after-ksi-rematch-wants-ufc-fight">Transcription via MMA Junkie</a>)</p>
      <p>With almost twenty million YouTube subscribers, Paul feels the new audience he attracts to boxing from his large following on social media are the “future” and the “smartest people on the planet.”</p>
      <p>“They’re the future, man,” Paul said. “They are the greatest. They are the future of the world. They’re the smartest, most cunning, slick, coolest group of people on the planet. Generation Z, I love y’all.”</p>
      <p>Paul vs. KSI 2 will stream live on DAZN in the United Sates, as well as on Sky Sports Box Office in the UK &amp; Ireland, and FITE TV in other international markets—starting at 11 PM Eastern, 8 PM Pacific. Stay tuned to Bloody Elbow for more news, notes, and live coverage of the event.</p>
