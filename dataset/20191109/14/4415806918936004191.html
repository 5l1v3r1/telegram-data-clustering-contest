      <p>Chelsea 2 - 0 Crystal Palace</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic fired Chelsea to a sixth straight Premier League win as they overcame Crystal Palace 2-0 at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>England striker Abraham took his league goal tally for the season to 10 and in-form midfielder Pulisic grabbed his fifth in five games.</p>
      <p>After the thrills and spills of the 4-4 midweek Champions League draw with Ajax, this was back to the domestic Saturday job for Frank Lampard’s side.</p>
      <p>They endured a frustrating first half against an obdurate, well-drilled Palace, but found a way through after the break.</p>
      <p>It meant defeat for Roy Hodgson in his 300th Premier League match as a manager while Lampard, with 288 games less under his belt, saw his side climb – temporarily at least – to second in the table.</p>

      <p>Chelsea’s youth revolution continued with Lampard naming their youngest Premier League starting line-up, with an average age of just over 24.</p>
      <p>They made a bright and busy start with 19-year-old full-back Reece James, making his first top-flight start, forcing Vicente Guaita to tip a dangerous cross away.</p>
      <p>Willian then fed Pulisic, who danced past a sliding Joel Ward in the area only to be foiled by Guaita at his near post.</p>
      <p>Palace, without a win in their previous three matches, were living dangerously throughout the first half, inviting Chelsea on but keeping them at bay on the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>They gave away plenty of free-kicks around the box but Willian, Emerson and Mason Mount took it in turns to miss the target.</p>
      <p>A frustrating opening period for the hosts ended when Pulisic headed N’Golo Kante’s cross over the top, before former Chelsea stalwart Gary Cahill slid in to block Willian’s shot.</p>

      <p>However, it took just six minutes after the interval for Abraham to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>Mateo Kovacic was the architect, brushing off a couple of challenges in a congested midfield before finding Willian with a clever reverse pass.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian’s neat flick on the edge of the box teed up Abraham, who strode forward and confidently buried his shot past Guaita.</p>
      <p>Pulisic, having another fine game, almost grabbed an immediate second with a bullet towards the top corner but Guaita managed to keep it out.</p>
      <p>Palace briefly threatened an equaliser but James Tomkins headed wide from a corner.</p>
      <p>Instead, Chelsea killed off the visitors with 11 minutes remaining when Pulisic fed Michy Batshuayi in the area, continued his run and got on the end of the striker’s deflected shot.</p>
