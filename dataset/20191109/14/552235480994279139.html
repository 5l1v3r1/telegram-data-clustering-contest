      <h1>Eddie May in Hibs 'commitment' poser as he makes veiled Paul Heckingbottom dig</h1>
      <h2>The academy chief is in the dugout for today's clash with St Johnstone but doesn't want the job permanently.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-09T14:54:38+00:00">09 Nov 2019, 14:54</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Hibs caretaker manager Eddie May has offered a veiled jibe about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul Heckingbottom</a> 's style of play as he appeared to question the commitment of some of his signings.</p>
      <p>The Englishman was sacked by the club this week, with the academy boss taking charge for today's trip to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> .</p>
      <p>He's made five changes from the team which lost 5-2 to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in Heckingbottom's last game, with Thomas James, Adam Jackson, Daryl Horgan, Stevie Mallan and Josh Vela dropping out.</p>
      <p>James, Jackson and Vela were all summer signings, and Florian Kamberi has been restored to the XI for only his second start since September.</p>

      <p>May said: "I've looked at the games where we've been competitive and I want players who are committed to the club.</p>
      <p>"I want players who are good on the ball and people who are attacking. It's just unfortunate that some guys have missed out today but they're part of a squad and everyone will get their opportunity. If things aren't going well we can put some of these players on.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"We have to take responsibility on the park in terms of delivering a more pleasing on the eye product but also more attacking.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> have probably been a little bit unfortunate in some games, they could be a few points better off, but we're not and we have to make sure that we go out and make a difference on the park.</p>
      <p>"We've picked a team that suits us."</p>

      <p>May is in caretaker charge for today's game but made clear he has no interest in taking the job permanently.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think I've already stated that. I'm in for a reason, someone has lost their job which is unfortunate and someone else will come in and take the club forward.</p>
      <p>"It's not about me it's about what's best for the club and there are some very good candidates who want the job so I think they have to go and look at everyone and then make the right decision."</p>
