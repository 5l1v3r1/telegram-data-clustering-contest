      <p>Nippon Ichi Software has released the first gameplay trailer for its wildly-titled adventure game <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../void-terrarium-gets-charmingly-weird-teaser-trailer-568612.phtml">void tRrLM(); //Void Terrarium</a> </i>(or simply Void Terrarium). The Japanese video shows off the strange title's blend of exploration, crafting, combat and survival elements.<br/><br/><i>Void Terrarium </i>is the story of an abandoned service bot living on a post-apocalyptic Earth. Originally believing itself the last functioning form of life, the little droid soon discovers a mysterious girl, Toriko, who exists within a glass dome that keeps her safe from the atmosphere's toxicities.<br/><br/>Players will guide the fates of both of these characters, sending the bot out to gather resources, acquire help, and fend off enemies. Meanwhile Toriko works to maintain her health and build a habitat, hoping to make the duo's lonely existence a little less harrowing. The trailer features the bot searching for food and engaging in turn-based combat, while Toriko cultivates plants inside her dome-home.<br/><i><br/><i>Void Terrarium</i></i> launches in Japan on PS4 and Nintendo Switch January 23.</p>
