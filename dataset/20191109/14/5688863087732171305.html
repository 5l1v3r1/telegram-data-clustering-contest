        <b>World's No.1 T20 side Pakistan seem to be on a losing spree as they have been comprehensively beaten in two series back to back. Newly appointed T20I captain Babar Azam has termed the 2-0 loss to Australia as a learning experience and has promised to come back stronger in the next series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It won't be a mistake to say that the No. 1 T20 side in the World, Pakistan is currently the worst performing side of the format. The Men in Green have lost two series back to back, which includes a whitewash at home to a second-string Sri Lanka side.</p>
      <p>While the first match of the series Down Under was washed out, the remaining matches were a nightmare for Pakistan. Australia won the second encounter by seven wickets, while the final T20I was a walk in the park for the Kangaroos as they sealed the series by winning the match by 10 wickets.</p>
      <p>Pakistan's newly appointed skipper Babar Azam said that it was a great learning experience and promised that the team will put up a better show in the upcoming series.</p>
      <p>"Kaffi (Quite) disappointed that we lost to a team like this. But we have learnt a lot from this series and we'll take the positives and come back hard in the next series. I have learnt a lot, there is a lot to learn as well. Hopefully, I'll apply it in the future," Azam said in the post-match presentation.</p>
      <p>Azam also pointed out that Muhammad Musa and Mohammad Hasnain were picked up in the side to give the youngsters exposure</p>
      <p>"Musa and Hasnain were bowling quick. But Finch and Warner played really well. We played them so that they can use this experience in the future. We have a three day gap before the practice match; looking forward to the Test series."</p>
      <p>The two-Test match series between the two sides will be starting from November 21 and the Pakistan team will be playing a day-night warm-up match against the Australia A side in the lead up to the series.</p>
