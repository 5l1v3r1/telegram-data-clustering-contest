      <p><b>ASHLAND, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A law enforcement official says he's persuaded the bishops of an Ohio Amish sect to install blinking lights on buggies to make them more visible to motorists.</p>
      <p>The Ashland Times-Gazette reports Ashland County Chief Deputy Sheriff Carl Richert has been working with local Amish and Mennonite communities for years to make their buggies and wagons easier to spot.</p>
      <p>Richert says the community that agreed to install blinkers is more liberal and modern than other sects. He says he has warned community leaders that if they don't begin using reflective tape and lights on their buggies the Ohio Legislature could pass laws mandating them.</p>
      <p>A local Amish buggy maker has ordered around 200 battery-powered blinking lights and anticipates community members will generally be willing to use them.</p>
