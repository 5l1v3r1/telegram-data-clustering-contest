      <p>A recent plane crash in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> that resulted in “substantial damage” to the aircraft and at least one injured person was caused by a gender reveal stunt gone wrong, officials said in a report Friday.</p>
      <p>An Air Tractor AT 602 crashed on Sept. 7 in Turkey, a small city just 90 miles west of the Oklahoma border, after slowing down too much in order to dump out “350 gallons of pink water” as a part of a gender reveal,  the National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/brief2.aspx?ev_id=20190908X51027&amp;ntsbno=GAA19CA535&amp;akey=1">said</a>.</p>

      <p>The pilot reportedly told officials that they were maneuvering at a low altitude when the plane “got too slow,” causing it to aerodynamically stall before crashing.</p>
