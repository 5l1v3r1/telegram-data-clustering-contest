      <p>Lebanon’s grand mufti called Saturday for the formation of a new emergency government of technical experts and for those in power to meet protesters’ demands.<br/><br/>“The time has come to meet the people’s demands and the national free will that transcends sects, political parties, and regions,” Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Derian said in a televised address on the occasion of Prophet Mohammed’s birthday.<br/><br/>“The time has come and is opportune, after this national wake-up call, for the reform process to begin and for those in power to form an emergency government made up of competent people, without delay,” Derian said, Reuters reported.<br/><br/>It is time “to immediately proceed with carrying out the reform package prepared by Prime Minister Hariri to solve the country’s problems”, he noted.<br/><br/>Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai has also called for a change in government to include qualified technocrats.<br/><br/>Before he stepped down, Hariri agreed a package of reforms with partners in the coalition government aimed at easing an economic crisis that sparked the unprecedented protests against the sectarian ruling elite.<br/><br/>The plans included a 50% reduction in the salaries of current and former officials and $3.3 billion in contributions from banks to achieve a “near zero deficit” for the 2020 budget.<br/><br/>According to Reuters, the country’s power-sharing system is based on 18 recognized religious sects and dates back to French colonial rule. <br/><br/>It allocates posts for each of the country’s communities, forming the basis of its major political parties and creating a delicate balance between Christians, Sunni and Shiite Muslims and other groups.</p>
