      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Durban Heat</b> failed to deliver any heat and instead had rain ruin their <b>Mzansi Super League (MSL)</b> opener against the <b>Tshwane Spartans</b> at Kingsmead on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Seasonal wet weather throughout the week building up to the game meant that a damp outfield was already in place when the players arrived.</p>
      <p>The toss was initially delayed due to the field not being dry enough, and, when the heavens opened again shortly after 13:00, it left umpires Allahudien Paleker and Adrian Holdstock with little choice but to call off the game.</p>
      <p>It was a disappointing outcome, particularly after the spectacular start to MSL 2.0 on Friday when the Cape Town Blitz edged defending champions the Jozi Stars in a high-scoring thriller in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>The Heat and the Spartans take two points each from the game, with the hosts next in action when they are at home to the Paarl Rocks next Friday.</p>
      <p>The visitors take on the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants on Wednesday.</p>
