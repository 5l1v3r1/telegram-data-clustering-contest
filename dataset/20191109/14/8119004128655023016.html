        <b>The authorities have suspended all flights to and from Chattogram’s Shah Amanat International Airport for 14 hours from Saturday afternoon as Bangladesh braces for Cyclone Bulbul.</b>
      </p>
      <p>However, flights operations at Barishal, Jashore and Cox's Bazar airports are unaffected, according to officials.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Meteorology Department issued great danger signal No. 10 for the maritime ports of Payra and Mongla while the Chattogram port has been advised to signal No. 9.</p>
      <p>The ‘very severe’ cyclonic storm is expected to cross the Sundarbans delta on Saturday evening, according to meteorologists.</p>
      <p>Under the circumstances, no flights will operate in and out of Chattogram airport until 6am on Sunday, said AKM Rezaul Kabir, the port-city airport’s spokesperson.</p>
      <p>The Sylhet airport -- which usually remains closed at night -- will be kept open to manage the air traffic.</p>
      <p>No decision has yet been taken to on the operations at the Jashore, Cox's Bazar and Barishal airports. A decision will be taken after evaluating the local weather situation, an official said.</p>
      <p>Barishal airport’s Manager Rathindra Nath Chowdhury said, "Flight operations will continue as usual at our airport. If someone wants to operate a flight, there is no barrier.”</p>
      <p>"There is no directive to suspend the flights. From morning until now, six aircraft have taken off,” Jashore airport’s Manager Masudul Haque said.</p>
