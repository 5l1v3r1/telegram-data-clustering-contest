      <p>Eleanor Tomlinson has said her characters need to be more than just damsels in distress.</p>
      <p>She believes some of her projects are already outdated and would not be made now due to “helpless” female parts.</p>
      <p>The Poldark actress is trying to leave her role of Demelza behind her as she tackles sci-fi in The War Of The Worlds.</p>
      <p>Set in an Edwardian era where wives were expected to be dutiful, Tomlinson nevertheless plays a strong woman in the female-led adaptation of HG Wells’ classic novel.</p>

      <p>The actress believes that female roles need to have more depth than was previously acceptable on screen, and must do more than wait for rescue from male leads.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think nowadays even jobs that I’ve done, I think you would struggle to make now having the women be so helpless – unless they’re historical, that’s a different thing.</p>
      <p>“I think you need women to be able to have a personality other than to just be the damsel in distress, it’s important.”</p>
      <p>Tomlinson stars in the new BBC adaption of the novel, which sees a woman take a lead role as Earth is invaded by aliens, in a change from the original.</p>
      <p>The actress has been hands-on in her approach to the action and adventure in the part, and is happy to launch into a new challenge, although she is grateful that people know and appreciate her role of Demelza in Poldark.</p>

      <p>She said: “I’m trying my best to force it to change. I’m trying to get as many different roles as I can under my belt, different characters, different periods.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to be pigeonholed.</p>
      <p>“I am so flattered to be known as Demelza and that’s so wonderful, I’m so grateful for it, and I love that fact that I have that behind me and I can walk into a room and people may have seen it.”</p>
      <p>Tomlinson stars alongside Rafe Spall, Robert Carlyle and Rupert Graves in the upcoming BBC adaptation.</p>
      <p>She became star-struck on set around Trainspotting star Carlyle, saying: “I was really nervous, I’m such a fan, but I just loved him. He’s just so nice and such a brilliant actor.”</p>
      <p>The War Of The Worlds begins Sunday November 17 at 9pm on BBC One. The series is three episodes long.</p>
