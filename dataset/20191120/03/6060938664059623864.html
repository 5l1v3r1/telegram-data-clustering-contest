      <h1>Nysa's toned abs are a major distraction in these pics with mom Kajol</h1>

      <p>The trailer of Ajay Devgn's ambitious project, 'Tanhaji-The Unsung Warrior', was launched yesterday. While everyone was expecting <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a>, who is also part of the magnum opus to be present at the event, she merely disappointed fans by giving it a miss. Later in the day's time, she was spotted at the airport along with her daughter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nysa">Nysa</a> and that cleared the reason for her absence. Seems the mother-daughter duo had their plan in place already.</p>
      <p>Kajol looked younger in her orange printed Punjabi suit and attracted major eyeballs with her fame, while daughter Nyasa who is very particular about her attires whenever she steps out for any outings, surprised everyone with her toned <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/abs">abs</a>. Sticking to her style mantra, Nysa was snapped in a very stylish avatar as she flaunted a belly revealing knot top paired with a low waist jeans. She was clicked by the shutterbugs as she exited the airport and headed towards her car along with mom Kajol.</p>

      <p>Moreover, The star kid looked graceful as she left her tresses open with no make-up and her postures and gestures reminded us of her mother who was walking alongside her. For the uninitiated, Nysa is completing her studies in Singapore and also stays there. She often returns to Mumbai to spend time with her family and friends.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there were buzz about Nysa debuting in Bollywood soon, however father Ajay Devgn had rubbished the rumour by stating that she is busy completing her studies and is in no mood to enter Bollywood now.</p>
