      <h1>Real Estate Institute of New Zealand says banks are making life more difficult for rural borrowers, risking a major drop in farm values</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:54:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:54</time> by <a rel="author">Greg Ninness</a></address>
      <p>The Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) has launched a furious attack on banks and the Government, blaming them for a sharp downturn in farm sales and warning that bank lending practices could cause a major drop in farm values.</p>
      <p>According to the REINZ, 1336 farms were sold in the 12 months to October, down 9.4% compared to the previous 12 months.</p>
      <p>The biggest decline was in dairy farm sales which were down by 36%, followed by finishing farms, down13.6% and grazing properties down 3.7%.</p>
      <p>Only arable farm sales went against the trend with sales up 7% in the 12 months to October compared to the previous 12 months.</p>
      <p>In a strongly worded statement the REINZ pointed the finger of blame at the Government's fresh water policies and the banks for making it more difficult for rural borrowers to get loans.</p>
      <p>"There appears to be a mood of frustration and even anger throughout the rural sector at the advancement of one government-promoted fresh water policy after another, to the consternation of cost-impacted recipients, and those within the forestry-impacted pastoral sector are venting feelings with vibrant messages and emotive action directed strongly towards the occupants of the Beehive," the statement said.</p>
      <p>It also gave the banks a good serve.</p>
      <p>"Sheltering behind such issues is the dark elephant in the room - the banking industry, which surprisingly in view of extremely low interest rates, is less than subtly erecting barriers to frustrate rural borrowers, and in the process risking a potential major drop in farm values as increasing numbers of land owners seek to exit the industry," REINZ said.</p>
