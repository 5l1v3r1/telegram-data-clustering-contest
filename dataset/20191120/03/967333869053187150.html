        <b>A similar incident was reported in 2017 after a 26-year-old man was arrested at the border between the United States and Mexico smuggling drugs by means of a remote-controlled drone and was sentenced to 12 years in prison.</b>

      <p>The US Customs and Border Patrol announced the arrest of a 16-year-old boy at the US-Mexico border, after Border Patrol agents spotted him moving around the border wall with two duffel bags, <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/2019/11/19/teen-accused-of-using-rc-car-to-smuggle-meth-across-border/">according to local TV network Fox 5 San Diego</a>.</p>
      <p>Agents reportedly said that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907251076353176-trump-says-mexico-put-more-troops-border/">they caught the boy</a> on early Sunday morning hiding in “thick bushes” with the two bags, which they later found were packed with some 50 bundles of methamphetamine with a street value of over $100,000.</p>
      <blockquote>Along with the two bags, agents reportedly found a remote-controlled car used by the boy to transport the packages of narcotics across the border.</blockquote>
      <p>Border Patrol officials reportedly suggested that it is likely someone on the other side of the border controlled and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907211076308538-illegal-migrants-storm-us-mexico-border-cbp-fires-tear-gas-pepper-spray---report/">loaded the model car with the drugs</a>. They assumed that transporting that many packages on that small of a car would have taken many trips back and forth across the border.</p>
      <p>According to the Fox 5 San Diego, the teen was taken to the border town of Otay Mesa, located in the southern side of San Diego, California, to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907091076191378-us-request-additional-1000-troops-mexico-border/">face charges of drug smuggling</a>.</p>
