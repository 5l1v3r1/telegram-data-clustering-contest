      <p>Police on Tuesday released an image of the person suspected in <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/patrols-upped-in-bay-ridge-after-spates-of-car-vandalism/">vandalizing more than 50 cars</a> parked on a leafy Brooklyn street this weekend.</p>
      <p>The suspect, dressed in all black and wearing a face mask, scratched up and slashed the tires of the vehicles on Saturday night and early Sunday morning in Bay Ridge, cops said.</p>
      <p>The vandal struck all of the cars when they were parked on Shore Road between Bayridge Avenue and Bayridge Parkway, cops said.</p>
      <p>The NYPD has upped patrols in the area since the vandal struck, with the commanding officer of the local precinct deploying “Neighborhood Coordination Officers, patrol officers and anti-crime personnel to the area to conduct patrols to monitor the area and search for a suspect(s) during every tour,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/patrols-upped-in-bay-ridge-after-spates-of-car-vandalism/">an NYPD spokesperson said</a>.</p>
      <p>City councilman Justin Brannan, who represents the neighborhood, has offered a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest of the vandal.</p>
