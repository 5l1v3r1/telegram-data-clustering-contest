      <p>Microsoft seems to be testing a new feature that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/20/microsoft-gmail-integration-outlook/">lets users add Google services to their Outlook accounts</a>. From a report:<i> If available on your account, you should see a pop-up that says, "Add your Google Mail and Calendar to Outlook and easily manage everything in one place." Doing so allows you to switch between your Outlook and Gmail inboxes (though this causes the entire browser tab to refresh) and browse your Drive files. It's not clear how Google Calendar is integrated into Outlook. At the moment, you can only select a single Gmail account to sync with Outlook, which could be frustrating since so many people use multiple Gmail addresses.</i></p>
