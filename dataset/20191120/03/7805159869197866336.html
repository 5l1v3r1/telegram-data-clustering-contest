      <h1>Realme 5s is a Realme 5 but with a 48MP quad camera setup and a new red color</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/tusharmehta/" target="_blank">Tushar Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Realme and Xiaomi’s sub-brand have a lot in common. Both of the brands offer impressively specced smartphones at fiercely competitive pricing. Of the two, Realme has witnessed a much more staggering growth over the past several months and that is probably because of their relentless launches new phones every month. But today, Realme is <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-7s-48mp-snapdragon-660/">following Redmi’s footsteps</a> and revitalizing a few months old smartphone with a new camera setup. Alongside their first true flagship – Realme X2 Pro, Realme is launching the Realme 5s which comes with a 48MP primary camera.</p>
      <p>In August this year, Realme launched its first set of quad-camera smartphones viz. the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-5-pro-quad-cameras-snapdragon-712-india-europe/">Realme 5 and the Realme 5 Pro</a>. While the Pro variant comes with a 48MP <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/sonys-imx586-48mp-smartphone-camera/">Sony IMX586</a> sensor, the non-Pro features a 12MP primary camera. To bridge this gap, Realme has announced the Realme 5s, which features a 48MP primary camera while the rest of the specs remain the same. Notably, Realme is using a 48MP <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-32mp-48mp-isocell-camera-sensors/">Samsung ISOCELL Bright GM1</a> sensor here instead of the Sony sensor we saw on the previous 48MP phones from the company.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Realme has also introduced a new Crystal Red color with the same design as the previous generations. Another slight change on the new smartphone is the <a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/glass-types/gorilla-glass-3-plus.html">Gorilla Glass 3+</a> protection on the front compared to the Gorilla Glass 3 on the Realme 5. Additionally, the Realme 5s comes only with 4GB of RAM but no 3GB/32GB variant. All of the other aspects, including the 6.5-inch HD+ display, Snapdragon 665 SoC, 5,000mAh battery, etc. remain unchanged.</p>
