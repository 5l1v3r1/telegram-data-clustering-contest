      <p>The League dating app—which filters users to make sure they’re in the right league—has decided to mess around with video speed dating.</p>
      <p>Since the League launched in 2015, it has garnered the reputation as the dating app for social status-focused <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/06/23/heres-a-dating-app-for-shallow-people-who-deserve-each-other/">snobs</a>. “While your mother may call you picky, we call you self-aware,” the app’s site explains. “We’ll do the vetting so you can do the petting.”</p>
      <p>Now the app is launching a feature that caters to people who are too busy hustling and social climbing to go on actual physical dates.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's note: While the app is available in Australia, it's unclear if and when these new features will roll out in the country.</i>

      <p>Starting on December 1, some League users will be able to try <a href="https://live.theleague.com/">League Live</a>. The feature automatically connects pairs of participating users, based on their mutual preferences, for two-minute video-chatting dates.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20967166/the-league-live-video-dating-app-launch">the Verge</a>, each person gets three of these dates back-to-back, with each session prompted by an ice-breaker. If both users like each other then the app will connect them and allow them to continue chatting. League Live will reportedly only happen at 9 pm on Sundays.</p>
      <p>CEO Amanda Bradford told the Verge that early tests showed the feature was popular among users who are 35 to 40-years-old—possibly because they have less time to get sucked into an evening with someone who may not be able to hold a conversation. She also said the feature was useful for users who don’t live in heavily populated cities and may have to travel farther for dates.</p>
      <p>Bradford told the Verge that only users who have a good “League Score”— which is based on app activity, profile completion, and whether or not the user has been reported—will be able to use League Live.</p>
      <p>The League did not respond to a Gizmodo request for comment on its plans to expand its video dating efforts.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year when China’s top internet dating site Jiayuan started experimenting with video streaming, we said it was only a matter of time before dating apps in the US <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/mixing-chatroulette-with-tinder-is-the-horrifying-future-of-online-dating">started making users face-time with potential hookups</a>. With apps like Bumble, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/tinders-horny-streaming-series-for-gen-z-exposes-your-terrible-soul">Tinder</a>, and Hinge, trying new ways to keep horny people logged-on, it’s becoming increasingly likely that the future of online dating will start to look like Chatroulette.</p>
