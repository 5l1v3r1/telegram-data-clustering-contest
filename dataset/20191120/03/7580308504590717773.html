      <p>A total of 24 titles will be competed for at this year’s Asoju Oba Cup, which holds from November 25 to 29 at the 51st Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere, Lagos State.</p>
      <p>According to the organisers, the championship, the oldest private sponsored competition in Nigeria, has been categorised into the cadet, intermediate and seniors with battles in both the men and women’s singles, doubles and mixed-doubles, as well as the para-table category, which would be holding for the fifth time.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the five-day tournament, the son of the late initiator, Ayodeji Okoya-Thomas, said the 2019 edition would be the fifth competition after the death of his father, Sir Chief (Dr.) Molade Okoya-Thomas, who hosted the 46th edition.</p>
      <p>“It is noteworthy to mention that in the last 50 years that this journey has been ongoing, everyone has stood by our father and the family. We earnestly appeal, therefore, that as we move forward in anticipation of many more years of this tournament, we will continue to enjoy the same love and support.</p>
      <p>“I am most obliged to emphasise and recognise the unwavering support from the friends of our late father and especially the media without which the success of the championship wouldn’t have been recorded,” Ayodeji said, adding that he believed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu would allow sports under his stewardship in Lagos to experience a gigantic development.</p>
      <p>Ayodeji, who stated that cash and material prizes would be awarded to the athletes adjudged as the most outstanding this year, added, “Two new giants trophies have been unveiled for the female now renamed Lady’s Olivet Trophy and male singles champion along with prizes. In addition are the two miniature trophies, which will be kept by the champions in both the categories,” he stated.</p>
