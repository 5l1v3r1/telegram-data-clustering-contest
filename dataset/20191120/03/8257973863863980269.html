      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Washington-Redskins/?tps=1">Washington Redskins</a> released former <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers/?tps=1">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> outside linebacker Noah Spence, the team announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Redskins originally signed Spence in mid-September after the Buccaneers cut him at the end of training camp. Washington promoted linebacker Carroll Phillips from the practice squad in a corresponding roster move, according to the <a href="https://www.redskins.com/news/redskins-sign-lb-carroll-phillips-from-practice-squad-release-lb-noah-spence">team</a>.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay selected Spence in the second round of the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/2016-NFL-Draft/?tps=1">2016 NFL Draft</a> out of Eastern Kentucky. The franchise expected the pass-rusher to take on a bigger role after he recorded 5.5 sacks in his rookie season, but he has only notched two sacks in three seasons since his first year in the league.</p>
      <p>In 41 career games, Spence has tallied 37 total tackles, 7.5 sacks and two passes defensed.</p>
      <p>Phillips joined the Redskins' practice squad at the end of October after seeing limited snaps with the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jacksonville-Jaguars/?tps=1">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Indianapolis-Colts/?tps=1">Indianapolis Colts</a> over the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>Phillips, who entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2017 out of Illinois, is expected to be the fourth player in the Redskins' pass-rush rotation behind <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ryan-Kerrigan/?tps=1">Ryan Kerrigan</a>, Montez Sweat and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ryan_Anderson/?tps=1">Ryan Anderson</a>.</p>
