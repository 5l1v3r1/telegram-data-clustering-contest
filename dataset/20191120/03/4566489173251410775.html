      <h1>Thai court strips opposition frontman of MP status: judge</h1>

      <p>The billionaire frontman of Thailand's anti-military bloc was stripped of his MP status on Wednesday over a media shareholding case, a court ruling that could lead to him being banned from politics and jailed for up to 10 years.</p>
      <p>The leader of the upstart Future Forward party, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 40, shook up the country's arch-royalist power structure when his party became the third-largest in March elections.</p>
      <p>But he has battled legal cases since and was suspended from parliament earlier this year after accusations he held shares in a media company when he registered as a candidate.</p>
      <p>He denied the charges and said they are politically motivated, but judges at the constitutional court ruled against him on Wednesday, calling his evidence "suspicious".</p>
      <p>"The MP status of Thanathorn has ended," Judge Worawit Kangsasitiam said.</p>
      <p>His removal as an MP means that the Election Commission could bring criminal charges that carry serious penalties - including a political ban and imprisonment.</p>
      <p>It also deals a gut punch to his party, which surged among young Thais after it called to purge the military from politics, end military conscription and slash defence spending.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn has repeatedly insisted the 675,000 shares he held in V-Luck Media were sold to his mother on January 8 -- weeks before he registered to run as a candidate.</p>
      <p>But the court rejected the claim, saying there was no "official proof" that the transfer took place on that day.</p>
      <p>Before walking into the court Thanathorn urged his supporters not to lose hope.</p>
      <p>"Future Forward is the people, Future Forward must carry on," he said to dozens of people waving the party's signature orange flag and giving him flowers.</p>
      <p>The constitutional court disbanded a different anti-military opposition party linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra right before the March vote.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn's main rival is Thai premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha, a general who led the coup in 2014 and was voted in as civilian premier with the help of junta-appointed senators.</p>
      <p>Future Forward has also come under fire for being a rare voice of criticism against Thailand's royalist establishment.</p>
      <p>The monarchy, one of the world's richest and headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is at the apex of Thai power.</p>
      <p>Last month, 70 Future Forward MPs voted against a royal decree transferring two key army units to the direct control of the king -- an unprecedented political objection to a royal command.</p>
      <p>The decree still passed parliament with an overwhelming majority.</p>
