      <h1>If You Loved The Skywhale, There’s Now A Giant Floating Skywhale Daddy</h1>

      <p>I mean I don’t really know where to start with this story about the unveiling of the multi-boobied <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/skywhale">Skywhale</a> balloon’s kid, so we might as well start right at the multi-boobied beginning.</p>
      <p>In 2013, artist Patricia Piccinini designed a hot air balloon to fly above Canberra as part of its centenary celebrations. There’s no easy way to describe the balloon, but I guess I’ll just tell you that it’s very big, looks kinda like a greenish, dead-eyed whale, and that it is pretty much covered in boobies.</p>
      <p>Here it is:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Within moments of taking to the air, the balloon was dubbed ‘Skywhale’, and became the subject of much controversy. Mostly that controversy came from a bunch of booby-haters, who felt that Canberra should not have spent $30,000 on a giant, inflatable Eldritch horror. These people have no imagination, and I do not care for them.</p>
      <p>Anyway, six years later, Skywhale is back in the news, because the thing is gonna get its very own kid.</p>
      <p>Yep, next year, in 2020, ‘Skywhalepapa’ will take to the skies, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-20/skywhale-hot-air-balloon-is-breeding-meet-skywhalepapa/11720942">as the ABC reports.</a> The new balloon, also designed by Piccini, will look very much like the last one, only this time it will have a smaller set of Skywhales tucked under one of its flippers.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Also, the whole thing is gonna be big as hell. The National Gallery of Australia, the institution that will launch the Skywhale, have used the word “monumental”, which is exactly the word I want to hear as part of a Skywhale discussion, tbh.</p>
