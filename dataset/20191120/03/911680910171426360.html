      <p>PHOENIX — Nearly 12,000 customers with Arizona Public Service, or APS, who relied on rate plan recommendations from the utility company were given inaccurate information and may have ultimately switched to a more expensive plan, according to a <a href="https://docket.images.azcc.gov/E000003736.pdf">letter from APS to the Arizona Corporation Commission</a> .</p>
      <p>"Last Thursday, we became aware that the online APS rate compare tool was relying on incorrect information and, as a result, has provided certain customers with inaccurate rate plan recommendations since February 2019. This issue also affected rate plan recommendation letters that were sent to some of our customers earlier this year," the letter, dated Nov. 19, 2019, read. <b><a href="https://docket.images.azcc.gov/E000003736.pdf">View the letter.</a></b></p>
      <p>As a result, APS said it would contact those customers who were not on the "most economical" plan and that they would be given a credit.</p>
      <p>"The credit will be equal to the difference between what they have paid since switching plans and what they would have paid had they been on their most economical plan," APS said in its letter.</p>
      <p>APS has also taken down its online rate comparison tool and delayed implementing a new comparison tool that was supposed to go live this week. It will also run tests on that new rate comparison tool "to confirm that it is providing accurate and reliable information to customers."</p>
