      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): IHH Healthcare Bhd led a minority investment in Singapore-based genomic medicine company Lucence Diagnostics Pte Ltd as part of a US$20 million Series A funding.</p>
      <p>In a statement today, IHH said the investment is part of its collaboration with start-ups to deploy innovative and cutting-edge healthcare technology to enhance patient experience, treatment and clinical outcomes across its network of 80 hospitals in 10 countries.</p>
      <p>"In Singapore, for example, IHH is working with a local start-up to improve estimated bill size for patients ahead of admission through predictive artificial intelligence (AI)," it said.</p>
      <p>The partnership with Lucence will give IHH patients access to Lucence's suite of cancer diagnostics and AI-driven analytics.</p>
      <p>Lucence uses liquid biopsy — a blood-based technology that is less invasive than tissue biopsies — to help clinicians discover a range of information about tumours and aid in their treatment decisions, through a simple blood sample.</p>
      <p>It focuses on Asia-prevalent cancers such as lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, nasopharyngeal and liver cancers.</p>
      <p>IHH chief executive officer (designate) Dr Kelvin Loh said the investment in Lucence will provide IHH patients with better access to this advanced technology.</p>
      <p>He added that liquid biopsy is a "game-changer" in its endeavour to provide cancer patients with better, value-driven outcomes through precise treatment selections and more affordable care.</p>
      <p>"IHH looks to drive greater synergies with Lucence and co-develop solutions for patients, as well as explore opportunities to sharpen our precision medicine capabilities with other like-minded partners across our 10-country network," Loh said.</p>
      <p>Lucence founder and CEO Dr Tan Min-Han said, "Our mission is to reduce worldwide suffering through early cancer detection."</p>
      <p>"This partnership with IHH Healthcare will accelerate more ground-breaking research to achieve early cancer detection and effective cures, and expand access to this much-needed liquid biopsy technology to patients across Asia and the United States," Tan added.</p>
      <p>At 10.35am, IHH dipped 0.92% or 5 sen to RM5.40, for a market capitalisation of RM47.38 billion.</p>
