      <p>Late stage lung cancer used to be a death sentence. But for some patients, treatment is progressing to the point where lung cancer can be managed like a chronic disease. Targeted therapies fight the cancer where it starts.<br/><br/>"In 2015, I was a very healthy mother of four," said 49-year-old Lee Anne Robinson of Torrance.<br/><br/>That's what she thought until she tripped at one of her son's soccer games.<br/><br/>"I heard this snap," Robinson said.<br/><br/>At the hospital, scans revealed troublesome spots on her lungs, spine and liver.<br/><br/>"They figured the broken leg was related to the tumor," Robinson said.<br/><br/>She had hardly smoked, but Robinson had stage 4 lung cancer. Her prognosis? Less than a year.<br/><br/>"I knew enough about cancer to know that that was a bad one and I wasn't going to survive it," Robinson said.<br/><br/>Keck School of Medicine's Dr. Jorge Nieva, who is a medical oncologist, said lung cancer is not just one disease.<br/><br/>He said contrary to popular thought, it isn't just caused by smoking. Research shows various genetic and molecular abnormalities drives lung cancer.<br/><br/>"We now treat patients on the basis of the molecular profile of their tumor using comprehensive genetic sequencing," Nieva said.<br/><br/>Robinson tested positive for what's called an ALK mutation. About 4% of lung cancer patients have this genetic anomaly.<br/><br/>She enrolled in a clinical trial for Lorlatinib, a daily, single pill therapy that targets ALK.<br/><br/>"The Lorlatinib gave me my energy back," Robinson said.<br/><br/>Nieva said, "We find that they can often times can go on to have extremely high quality of life for a very long period of time with their disease."<br/><br/>As with any drug, there are often side effects.<br/><br/>With Lorlatinib, patients may suffer from anxiety, depression, paranoia and suicidal thoughts.<br/><br/>"They're real, " Robinson said.<br/><br/>Anti-depressants are helping her cope.<br/><br/>Nieva said there are a whole host of other targeted therapies that can treat other genetic mutations.<br/><br/>And for those who don't have a genetic driver, immunotherapy is now considered a first-line therapy for those patients.<br/><br/>"The last scan I had," Robinson said, "Everything is clear and nothing is growing."<br/><br/>Now she is looking forward to traveling the world with her kids.</p>
