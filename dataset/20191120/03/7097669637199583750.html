      <h1>Lou Dobbs Guest Mocks Vindman: He’s a ‘Deep State Crybaby’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:04:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/" target="_blank">Justin Baragona</a></address>
      <p>After an <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/army-officer-says-trump-was-inappropriate-to-demand-ukrainians-probe-biden?ref=home">impeachment hearing</a> that featured Republicans suggesting National Security Council official Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was insufficiently loyal to America on Tuesday, Fox Business host <a href="https://contemptor.com/2019/09/13/lou-dobbs-says-trumps-white-house-so-happy-there-is-sunshine-beaming-throughout-the-place/">Lou Dobbs </a>and former Trump aide Christian Whiton openly mocked the Iraq War veteran for wearing his Army uniform to testify.</p>
      <p>During Tuesday night’s broadcast of <i>Lou Dobbs Tonight</i>, Dobbs—who also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-cherishes-lou-dobbs-so-much-he-puts-him-on-speakerphone-for-oval-office-meetings">serves as an informal adviser</a> to the president—groused about Vindman requesting Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) properly refer to him by his military rank during the hearing.</p>
      <p>“This Colonel Vindman, who insisted for some reason on wanting to be called lieutenant colonel,” the Fox host grumbled. “I have never heard anyone referred to a lieutenant colonel as lieutenant colonel when addressing them verbally but, you know, as he wishes. I mean, he looks like a popinjay, he really does!”</p>
      <p>Later in the program, after Dobbs asserted that the American public is already growing bored with the impeachment hearings, Whiton embraced the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-impeachment-panel-republicans-to-alexander-vindman-fuck-you-for-your-service?ref=home">latest Trumpist strategy </a>of ridiculing a decorated military officer.</p>
      <p>“You see Vindman, this bureaucrat who poured himself into an Army outfit to go and frankly speak contemptuous things against the commander-in-chief, incidentally, a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice,” Whiton declared.</p>
      <p>“If you did that as a private in the Army you would get court-martialed,” the ex-Trump adviser continued. “I guess if you're, you know, a never-Trump bureaucrat Deep State crybaby you get away with it.”</p>
      <p>Whiton went on to complain that Vindman wasn’t a “political appointee” of Trump’s, claiming this is the “way the Deep State works” to take down a president.</p>
      <p>“They take detailees, not the best from these agencies, often the worst, they stick them into the White House,” he concluded. “It's a practice that frankly should end, and the political appointees, Tim Morrison and [Kurt] Volker aren't mistaking themselves for the president, it's these Deep State bureaucrats that do.”</p>
