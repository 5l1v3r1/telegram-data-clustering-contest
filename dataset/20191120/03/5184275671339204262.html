      <p>Post <i>Uri: The Surgical Strike</i>, along with Vicky Kaushal proving himself to be a bankable actor, fans have been eager to witness his next portrayal. While the actor has Karan Johar’s <i>Takht</i>, another project that’s making noise is <i>Sardar Udham Singh biopic</i>, and guess what? The actor has finally found his leading lady.</p>
      <p>Banita Sandhu, who made her debut with Varun Dhawan’s <i>October</i> has been roped for the Udham Singh biopic. The actress who’s been missing from the Hindi films since quite a while now has herself confirmed the news of reuniting with director Shoojit Sircar for their 2nd collab.</p>

      <p>In a conversation with Deccan Chronicle, Banita revealed the same as, “I am in Udham Singh. We shot for it in Punjab. Vicky Kaushal is amazing and it was great to be back working with the October team again.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the actress had been busy working on the Tamil version of Sandeep Reddy Vanga’s <i>Kabir Singh</i>. When asked about the same, the actress revealed, “I haven’t watched the final film yet, so I wouldn’t be able to say how my role has shaped up. But Vikram sir (legendary Tamil actor Vikram whose son Dhruv made his debut in Adithya Varma) and I worked to give my character more agency and autonomy in the film. I hope that gets translated on screen.”</p>
      <p>The actress was hailed for her performance in October that released last year, by both the critics as well as the audience. However, while the movie did turn out to be beneficial for Varun, Banita hardly was approached by any filmmaker or got any project. Hopefully, with Sardar Udham Singh, the actress will be recognized for her acting skills and doors will open for her in the Industry.</p>
