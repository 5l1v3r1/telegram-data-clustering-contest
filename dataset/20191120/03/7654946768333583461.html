      <h1>Spencer Dinwiddie remains defiant as NBA contract feud escalates</h1>

      <p>Spencer Dinwiddie is officially in a standoff with the NBA.</p>
      <p>After the league<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/24/spencer-dinwiddie-nba-cant-stop-my-bold-contract-demands/"> shot down Dinwiddie’s proposal</a> to turn his player contract into a digital token in September, both sides have engaged in ongoing discussions to try to “find common ground.” But The Athletic reported Tuesday that if Dinwiddie goes through with his plan without league approval, he could be subject to contract termination, fines or suspension without pay.</p>
      <p>Conversations between attorneys for the NBA and for Dinwiddie have gone on for months, with the 26-year-old remaining confident and enthusiastic in his investment idea throughout the process.</p>
      <p>Now, the question is whether Dinwiddie will pursue his plan even though talks of disciplinary action have started to gain traction.</p>
      <p>“Oh for sure,” he said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It was first reported in mid-September that Dinwiddie was attempting to convert his contract into a digital investment vehicle under the token name “$SD8.” He would give up some of his future earnings in exchange for an upfront lump payment. Since then, the NBA has met with Dinwiddie twice to work toward a resolution.</p>
      <p>The league originally said his plan violated the collective bargaining agreement, which states “no player shall assign or otherwise transfer to any third party his right to receive compensation from the team under his uniform player contract.”</p>

      <p>Meeting again before the start of the regular season, the league claimed Dinwiddie’s 2020-21 player option worth $12.3 million complicates things for an investment platform. The Athletic reported that he agreed to switch the premium numbers to ensure it wasn’t based on basketball-related income, but that apparently creates issues elsewhere.</p>
      <p>According to The Athletic, NBA officials are now saying there are gambling issues within Dinwiddie’s vehicle structure, citing the proposition of the payout and his availability for games. The league has an issue because he and those who choose to invest would potentially be betting millions on whether he becomes a free agent or his availability for games.</p>
      <p>“I really just find the play-option stuff so funny,” Dinwiddie said. “If we’re going to break it down by technicality, wouldn’t every player in a player-option year be incentivized to screw their team and shoot a million times and try to average 40 points and all that stuff, right? But I’m saying if we’re going to talk about gambling, then it’s gambling by nature. The same way a team option would incentivize a team to short the player, right? Like ‘Oh, if I don’t play him as many minutes, maybe I can sign him to a long-term deal, lock him up and then he can’t potentially make as much money.’</p>
      <p>“If you want to play that card, then that’s on you guys, because you guys made the CBA the way you guys made it. I’m merely just saying since the CBA is the way it is, can I do this with my money? That’s literally all I said.”</p>
      <p>Dinwiddie called it an “asinine assertion” that a player option is considered gambling because fans would be involved. He considers the league’s argument in citing the player option as a form of gambling to be “ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>The Players Association has been involved and supports the mission, according to Dinwiddie. Which is why the 6-foot-5 point guard believes “This isn’t so much a Spencer thing as it is a CBA thing.”</p>
      <p>He took to Twitter later Tuesday to publicly confirm that he plans to go through with everything.</p>
      <p>“2 things. Yes I’m doing it. No I’m not getting myself suspended and jeopardizing the team,” Dinwiddie wrote. “Regardless of what they want you to believe basketball is my second priority in life behind my family (Elijah specifically). Guess that makes three things.”</p>
      <p>If Dinwiddie is penalized for going through with his plan, he promised to appeal. But if Dinwiddie is suspended, the Nets will be nearly out of options for ball-handlers if Kyrie Irving and Caris LeVert have prolonged absences.</p>
      <p>“I’m not gonna be like ‘OK, kick me out the league, guys,’ ” Dinwiddie said. “So, they’re gonna choose what they decide to do. I’m gonna choose what I decide to do.”</p>
