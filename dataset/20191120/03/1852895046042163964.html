      <h4>Ariel Winter is continuing her European vacation and her latest stop is in Amsterdam. She donned a low-cut pink top to pose in front of a scenic Dutch house, looking ever so gorgeous.</h4>
      <p>Pretty in pink! That’s what <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/ariel-winter/"><b>Ariel Winter</b></a> was as she posed for an Instagram photo on the latest stop during her European vacation. The 21-year-old donned a super <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/17/ariel-winter-skintight-red-top-modern-family-set-instagram/">low-cut top</a> that showed off her cleavage, with push-up cups featuring  matching lace trim that also went down the sides of the garment, giving the blouse a romantic touch. It featured elbow length sleeves and tucked her top into dark denim jeans to show off her tiny waist.</p>
      <p>Ariel’s dark locks were pulled over to one side of her head, giving her a windswept look. She gave a close-mouthed smile with her rosy lipstick and made sure she was vacation photo ready with a rosy blush, long eyelashes and a perfect dark brow. She posed in front of a rustic blue traditional Dutch home along a canal in the area of Amsterdam’s Zaanse Schans, which is famous for its windmills.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/17/ariel-winter-skintight-red-top-modern-family-set-instagram/"><i>Modern Family</i> star</a> wrote the curious caption, “These hoes (LA) could NEVER,” but mainly just got fan comments like “gorgeous” and ‘beautiful.” One fan told her “such an incredible shape u r in,” after her massive weight loss over the past year. Two different Dutch fans were amazed she wasn’t more covered up, with a woman named Naomy telling her, “U want to freeze lady its coldddddd colllldd,” and user daankemmeren telling Ariel, “I hope that was not today as it was COLD!!!”</p>

      <p>It did look a little chilly with the grey skies behind Ariel. She was a lot more bundled up the day prior when she posted an I<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5A_q9cgjyi/">G photo</a> at twilight in Amsterdam with the trees along a canal lit up with lights. Ariel had on a long black coat and pants while posing next to a bike with the photo caption, “Cancelled my return ticket so farewell forever LA! 😱.” Clearly she’s loving her European vacation, which has also <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/15/ariel-winter-plunging-black-top-paris-pic/">taken her to Paris</a>.</p>
