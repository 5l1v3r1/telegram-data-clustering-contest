      <p>United States of America (USA) Consul-General in Nigeria, Claire Pierangelo, said technology innovation is the real way forward for the blue economy in a competitive global world.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the U.S. Consulate hosting of Cummins West Africa Limited, she added that the firm is becoming a global tech leader with over $35 million investment.</p>
      <p>Pierangelo said the key is sharing fair trade policies and fair investment policies in Nigeria, for companies like Cummins to feel comfortable making investment and commitment in the Nigerian economy.</p>
      <p>She said they are making a commitment in Nigeria, to help foster the maritime industry, energy industry and other industrial sectors within Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“To win in Africa, we need to priotise and win in Nigeria. Maritime will continue to drive the economy. Our strategy is to support customers better than the competition. We are not only investing in infrastructure but the people. We can have the best facility but if we don’t have the people, then that is not good.</p>
      <p>“By supporting U.S. companies like Cummins, which are making investments in the maritime and the energy sector, we promote companies that are committed to the Nigerian market. This facilitates mutually beneficial trading investment by advocating for fair trade policies within Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“We are here to celebrate, especially with Cummings International. They have opened a 35 million dollar facility in Lagos showing their commitment to the Nigerian market. They are one of the oldest, most successful companies of its kind in the United States,” she added.</p>
      <p>On technology, she said supporting top tech firms will ensure investments and trading in Nigeria, to help it tap into those resources.</p>
      <p>“Sustainable relationships in the technology area are going to be increasingly important to a country like Nigeria. Let’s be honest, you can compete even in West Africa and the rest of the world using technology.</p>
      <p>“If Nigeria doesn’t deepen and strengthen its reliance and its expertise on technology, they are just not going to be able to compete globally. So we have several programs in place that assist US businesses here in Nigeria to help foster those particularly relationships,” Pierangelo.</p>
      <p>Vice President, Power Systems, Cummins Incorporated, Gino Bureta, said blending with durable facilities, investment in infrastructure and technology can help the firm support customers better.</p>
      <p>“We opened a $35 million investment in Nigeria for a long term. This sends a clear signal to our customers that we’re here to stay. And we want to we want to make sure that we provide them the customer support that that facility will support them now,” Bureta added.</p>
      <p>He said Cummins will continue to provide superior customer support, get brand awareness, and make sure that there’s more Cummins powered equipment and in-vessels operating in the ports of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Managing Director, Cummins West Africa, Ade Obatoyin, said the newly-established office in Lagos, is a strong statement that Nigeria remains critical to its regional operations.</p>
