      <p>During a press conference Tuesday, President Donald Trump lashed out at the media for coverage of his trip to Walter Reed Medical Center over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“I went for a physical and I came back. My wife said, ‘Darling, are you okay? What’s wrong? Oh, they’re reporting you may have had a heart attack,'” he said during the conference. “I said, ‘Why did I have a heart attack?'”</p>

      <p>“‘Because you went to Walter Reed Medical Center,'” Trump said his wife Melania Trump said. “That’s where we go when we get the physicals.”</p>
      <p>He claimed that his administration’s “people in public relations” also asked about his health after seeing reports he “may have had a heart attack.”</p>

      <p>Trump said CNN reported he may have had a heart attack. In the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/politics/trump-annual-physical-walter-reed/index.html">coverage</a> of the trip to Walter Reed on its website, CNN does not mention anything about a “heart attack,” but does note that during last year’s exam, it was revealed “that Trump has a<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/17/health/trump-heart-disease-gupta/index.html"> common form of heart disease</a> and high cholesterol.”</p>
      <p>A representative for CNN did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.</p>
      <p>“These people are sick. They’re sick and the press really in this country is dangerous,” he said. “We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have the opposite. We have a very corrupt media and I hope they can get their act straight now, because it’s very, very bad and very, very dangerous for our country.”</p>
