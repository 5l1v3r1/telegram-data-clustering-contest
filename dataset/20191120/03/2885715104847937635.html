      <p>Shelter Associates, a Pune-based NGO working in the field of sanitation and housing, invited city officials and civil society organisations to the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and Agriculture for an event on ‘Data Driven Development: Inclusive Sanitation and Housing for the Urban Poor’, on World Toilet Day on November 19.</p>
      <p>The event saw back-to-back panel discussions on data, sanitation, and housing.</p>
      <p>The data panel spoke about the use of data in development projects, difficulty in digitising data and in producing dynamic data and on processes of sharing data with other stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The sanitation panel discussed the troubles of dealing with fecal sludge in cities and the need for data to understand sewerage capacity and planning for better coverage. The panel also emphasised on the need for mobilisation activities in sanitation programmes to get people to actually use the toilets they are provided.</p>
      <p>The housing panel discussed the importance of land security for slum residents and compared the merits of residents upgrading their houses by themselves and of slums being redeveloped into mid-rise buildings.</p>
      <p>The health concerns and well-being of Indians are closely linked to adequate water supply and functional sanitation systems, said participants at the panel discussions. In India, one of the major sanitary concerns has been open defecation, which is the root cause of multiple health-related problems, officials at the event said.</p>
      <p>The event was inaugurated by Ratnakar Gaikwad, former chief secretary, Maharashtra.</p>
