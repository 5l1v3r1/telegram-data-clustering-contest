      <h1>Hearst execs stunned by magazine division’s unionization plans</h1>

      <p>Hearst executives were blindsided by the news that editorial employees in the magazine division that houses Cosmopolitan, Esquire and other titles wanted to unionize.</p>
      <p>And now they’re trying to persuade staffers to reverse course, sources tell Media Ink.</p>
      <p>The Writers Guild of America East on Veterans Day revealed that an organizing drive that kicked off nearly a year ago had ended when an “overwhelming majority” of Heart’s 500 editorial employees turned in their pledge cards.</p>
      <p>Hearst Magazines President Troy Young and Chief Content Officer Kate Lewis allegedly called an emergency meeting on Nov. 12 with editors-in-chief and other top lieutenants to berate them for not knowing about the plan brewing under their noses for almost a year.</p>
      <p>“I had no idea employees felt this way,” said Young, according to one insider.</p>
      <p>Editors-in-chief were instructed to start meeting with staffers one-on-one to “discourage them from joining the union,” according to one source. “They were adamant about not putting anything in writing.”</p>
      <p>Hearst did not return e-mails seeking comment.</p>
