      <p>Understandably, there has been a lot of hype around India's inaugural pink-ball Test in Kolkata between India and Bangladesh starting on Friday and new BCCI president, former India captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>, who pushed for it, is leaving no stone unturned to make it a gala event.</p>
      <p>Former players, media pundits and officials have expressed how pink ball and playing D/N Tests is the way to go to keep Test cricket relevant in India where fans are hooked to shorter formats and even premier five-day contests haven't found patronage.</p>
      <p>The arbitrary nature of scheduling Tests by rotation even at venues where Tests have always struggled to get in crowds is also a factor that has contributed to poor attendances. It is something that skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> alluded to in Ranchi where he called for five regular and traditional Test centres like we have in England and Australia.</p>
      <p>While playing with the pink ball is a positive start in an attempt to woo fans to the grounds, former India captain and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Cricket-Academy">National Cricket Academy</a> chief <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ramachandra-Guha">Rahul Dravid</a> said that it is only one of many things that need to be done to truly inject enthusiasm among fans for Tests.</p>
      <p>"It is not the only solution to rejuvenate Test cricket, but it is one of the things we need to do. If we are able to control dew, the pink ball Test can become an annual feature in India," Dravid said during a lecture in Singapore. "You make it tough for the bowlers when the ball gets wet and takes the swing away ... it (pink ball) is a novelty that will attract people to the stadium."</p>

        <i>Will Ganguly take his former deputy's advice seriously?</i>

      <p>The length of the game though is not the only reason why fans do not visit grounds. Basic facilities like toilets, affordable and clean food are also vital factors. How many times have fans complained about unclean toilets, poor quality and obscenely priced food?</p>
      <p>"Basic things like toilets, seating, car parking need to be looked into, these are things that will draw fans," said Dravid.</p>
      <p>Fans today have also become more discerning. With better quality of TVs and affordable data services promoting live streaming of sporting events on phones, tablets and smart TVs have empowered fans with the choice to follow the game in the comforts of their homes or offices.</p>
      <p>Dravid warned that just because people flocked to the ground to follow the game earlier, one should not take it for granted that the same will continue as India and its population gets busier.</p>
      <p>"When we say there were 1,00,000 people at the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> in 2001, we are missing the point. At that time, there was no HD television that could guarantee you a better experience at home, there was no cricket on mobile, and if you wanted to catch the action, you had to make it to the ground," he said.</p>
      <p>"It is important we accept the ground reality. Yes, you can argue that the Ashes are always full and that Test cricket is in good health in England and Australia, but that's because they have a Test calendar and we don't."</p>
      <p>He urged the Board to plan for traditional festive Tests like England and Australia and like the New Year Test in Kolkata and the Pongal Test in Chennai earlier which can make for a family outing.</p>
      <p>"People can plan for a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Boxing-Day-Test">Boxing Day Test</a> in December and a Lord's Test in July a year ahead. We need this to happen in Indian cricket."</p>
      <p>When Dravid was the vice-captain and Ganguly was the captain, he helped his skipper out with timely suggestions. Now, as Board President, will Ganguly take his former deputy's advice seriously?</p>
