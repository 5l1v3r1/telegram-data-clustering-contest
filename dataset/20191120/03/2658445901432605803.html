      <p>Two persons have been confirmed dead in Lokoja during a bloody clash between party supporters on Monday at Ochadamu, Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State.</p>
      <p>The state Police Command’s spokesman, DSP William Aya, who confirmed the development in Lokoja yesterday, said a former councillor in the local government, Mrs. Salome Abu, and one Mr. Awalu Zekeri, died in the crisis.</p>
      <p>He said violence erupted on Monday due to a misunderstanding between Zekeri of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Mr. Goodwin Simeon, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).</p>
      <p>“In the process, Simeon stabbed Zekeri with a knife on his lap and he died on his way to the hospital,” Aya said.</p>
      <p>As a result, angry youths in Ochadamu mobilised to the house of Simeon Abuh, who is an uncle to the suspect and set it ablaze, thereby burning 60-year-old Mrs. Salome Abuh to death.</p>

      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that until her death, Abuh was the woman leader of PDP in Ochadamu.</p>
      <p>Aya further said three other houses were also burnt during the mayhem.</p>
      <p>In its reaction, the PDP condemned the killing of its woman leader by jubilant supporters of APC, calling on the police to arrest the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Spokesman for the Wada/Aro Campaiagn Organisation, Mr. Farouk Adejoh-Audu, while reacting to the incident, called on men of good conscience to prevail on the police to halt attacks on members of the PDP in the state.</p>
      <p>The state government, in its reaction, condemned the violent clashes in Ochadamu, warning that anyone caught taking the law into his hands would be punished, regardless of party affiliations.</p>
      <p>“We feel disturbed by reports of violence in Ochadamu, which has led to the loss of lives and property in the community,” Mr. Kingsley Fanwo, Director-General, Media and Publicity to the Governor, said.</p>
      <p>Fanwo, who also doubles as the spokesman for the Bello/Onoja Campaign Organisation, noted that government would not shield any party member, who broke the laws of the land.</p>
      <p>He said: “Gov. Yahaya Bello has directed security agents to quell the rising tension and ensure that perpetrators of the murder and arson are brought to book.</p>
      <p>“The governor is elected to protect all Kogi people, regardless of their ethnic or political beliefs.”</p>
