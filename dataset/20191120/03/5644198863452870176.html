      <p>The chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday criticized Uber Technologies Inc for its "ineffective safety culture" at the time of a March 2018 fatal self-driving car crash in Arizona.</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON: The chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday criticized Uber Technologies Inc for its "ineffective safety culture" at the time of a March 2018 fatal self-driving car crash in Arizona.</p>
      <p>NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said "the inappropriate actions of both the automatic driving system as implemented and the vehicle's human operator were symptoms of a deeper problem" citing the "ineffective safety culture that existed at the time of Uber."</p>

      <p>Recommendations the NTSB is making are likely to reverberate across the industry. The first-ever death attributed to a autonomous vehicle prompted significant safety concerns about the nascent self-driving car industry, which is working to get vehicles into commercial use.</p>
      <p>The crash killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she was walking a bicycle across a street at night in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
      <p>The NTSB previously disclosed the vehicle had significant software flaws, noting the software failed to properly identify her as a pedestrian and did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians. Uber had also deactivated a Volvo automatic emergency braking system in the XC90 test vehicle it had modified.</p>
      <p>The NTSB said on Tuesday it planned to identify the need for "safety risk management requirements for testing automated vehicles on public roads" signaling a broader question about how advanced vehicles are tested and U.S. government oversight.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the crash, Uber suspended all testing and did not resume until December in Pennsylvania with revised software and significant new restrictions and safeguards.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Uber's self-driving car effort, Sarah Abboud, did not comment immediately Tuesday but said earlier the company has "adopted critical program improvements to further prioritize safety."</p>
      <p>In March, prosecutors in Arizona said Uber was not criminally liable in the self-driving crash. Police have investigated whether the safety driver who was behind the wheel and supposed to respond in the event of an emergency should face criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Police have said the crash was "entirely avoidable" and that the backup driver was watching "The Voice" TV program at the time of the crash.</p>
      <p>The NTSB said Uber failed to adequately monitor backup safety drivers and lacked other significant safety rules.</p>
