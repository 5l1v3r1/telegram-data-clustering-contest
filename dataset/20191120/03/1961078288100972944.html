      <h1>Nine Face Hazing-Related Charges in Death of Ohio University Student</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:39:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:39</time> by <a rel="author">Emily S. Rueb</a></address>
      <p>The death of 18-year old Collin Wiant, who collapsed and died during an off-campus fraternity event at Ohio University last November, has cast an unwanted spotlight on the Midwestern school and hazing activities in general.</p>
      <p>In February, Mr. Wiant’s family sued the fraternity, Sigma Pi, which their son had sought to join. In April, the university expelled the fraternity. And on Tuesday, nine men, including seven Sigma Pi members, were indicted by an Athens County grand jury in connection with events that prosecutors said led to Mr. Wiant’s death from inhaling nitrous oxide.</p>
      <p>“The overall lesson that I think is so difficult for our youth when they live in this video game culture is that if something goes wrong, they can reset it, start it over, and everything’s O.K.,” Keller J. Blackburn, the Athens County prosecuting attorney, said in announcing the charges on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But in real life, he added, “their decisions have actual consequences.”</p>
      <p>All but one of the men are current or former students. They are charged with various offenses including trafficking in harmful intoxicants, hazing and permitting drug abuse, charges Mr. Blackburn said are likely to result in probation rather than prison time.</p>
      <p>But James Dylan Wanke, 25, the general manager of the store where the nitrous oxide was purchased, and Joshua Thomas Androsac, 20, a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity who the authorities said provided the drug to Mr. Wiant, were charged with first-degree involuntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Corbin Michael Gustafson, 22, who prosecutors say was present while Mr. Wiant ingested the nitrous oxide, was charged with reckless homicide, a third-degree felony which carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.</p>
      <p>Bob Toy, a lawyer representing Mr. Wanke, said that his client planned to plead not guilty but reserved any further comment until after his client’s arraignment on Friday.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear who would be representing Mr. Androsac or Mr. Gustafson, both of whom could not be reached for comment on Tuesday evening. No date has been set for their arraignments.</p>
      <p>Collin’s mother, Kathleen Wiant, said in a phone interview on Tuesday evening that she and her husband, Wade, “do not take any joy in anyone’s pain.”</p>
      <p>“We know that justice needs to be served and will be served,” Ms. Wiant said. “And that’s important because that’s a catalyst for change, and we need change so kids stop dying from hazing.”</p>
      <p>The charges in the Ohio University case come amid a spate of high-profile incidents on college campuses possibly connected with drugs or alcohol.</p>
      <p>Several students have died recently, including <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/13/us/fraternity-deaths-scrutiny-greek-life/index.html">three in the last two week</a>s, at <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/us/san-diego-state-student-dies-fraternities-suspended/index.html">San Diego University</a> <a href="https://www.krem.com/article/sports/ncaa/wsu/wsu-isnt-ruling-out-hazing-in-students-death-even-though-pullman-police-are/293-90f0a670-c42a-4032-a0a0-02a529e196ec">Washington State University</a> and <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/news/student-found-dead-at-fraternity-building-on-asu-campus-in/article_8bd5bb8a-04ea-11ea-9444-1f77ae46a9a3.html">Arizona State University</a>, said Ms. Wiant, who has been sharing her son’s story with college students, as well as state lawmakers in order to push for more stringent and uniform penalties for hazing, as well as more transparency for parents seeking information.</p>
      <p>Ms. Wiant said she planned to push to make hazing a felony in Ohio. She has also traveled to Washington to lobby for the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3267?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=53">END ALL Hazing Act</a>, which was introduced to a House of Representatives committee in June and would require higher education institutions to disclose hazing-related misconduct.</p>
      <p>About a month after enrolling at Ohio University, Collin Wiant pledged the Sigma Pi fraternity. But on Nov. 12, 2018, he collapsed at an unofficial party at the fraternity’s off-campus house. A coroner later determined he had died of asphyxiation after inhaling nitrous oxide from a canister, known as a whippet.</p>
      <p>In February, the family filed <a href="https://www.nbc4i.com/news/local-news/wrongful-death-lawsuit-filed-against-ohio-university-fraternity/">a wrongful-death suit</a> against the local chapter of Sigma Pi, which was later <a href="https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/the-inner-workings-of-a-now-expelled-ohio-university-fraternity-as-a-grieving-family-fight">expelled from the college’s campus</a>. The lawsuit is still pending.</p>
      <p>“The tragic death was devastating for our community, but it’s encouraging to see progress in the criminal case,” said Carly Leatherwood, a spokeswoman for the university, in an interview on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ms. Leatherwood said the university had taken several measures to increase transparency and improve the culture of group activities on campus.</p>
      <p>After a series of alleged hazing activities at several fraternities this fall, the university began <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/student-org-update">publicizing information </a>about groups that may have violated the student code of conduct, she said.</p>
      <p>The university also set up <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/news/2019/09/student-affairs-develops-hazing-prevention-task-force">a hazing prevention task force</a> for all clubs and organizations on campus.</p>
      <p>Mr. and Ms. Wiant met at Ohio University, where they were heavily involved in Greek life.</p>
      <p>Mr. Wiant said he was encouraged that stories about his son’s death, including<a href="https://gatehousenews.com/brokenpledge/home/site/dispatch.com"> a six-part investigative series</a> and a podcast by the The Columbus Dispatch documenting the fallout, had made hazing a topic of conversation between parents and children in cars and living rooms.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just legislative actions that are going to count,” Mr. Wiant said. “It’s at the core family level, encouraging your kids to go out into the world and make smart decisions.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Wiant added: “There is only one thing that’s ever going to stop hazing: kids reporting it.”</p>
