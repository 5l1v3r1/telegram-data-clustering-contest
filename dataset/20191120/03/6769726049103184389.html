      <p>THE federal government is spending an extra $868 million on road and rail projects in Western Australia over the next four years as part of a $3.8 billion dollar national infrastructure stimulus package.</p>
      <p>Key existing projects that will be brought forward as a result of the funding boost include the Bunbury Outer Ring Road, Albany Ring Road, Karratha to Tom Price Corridor, Tonkin Highway Gap and Port Augusta to Perth corridor.</p>
      <p>The money will also be spent on new projects including the Lakelands train station on the Mandurah line and widening the Mitchell Freeway southbound between Hodges Drive and Hepburn Avenue.</p>
      <p>It’s hoped the latter project will improve safety on the freeway after 560 crashes – including one fatality – were recorded between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Premier Mark McGowan said the package of works was expected to create about 1000 jobs.</p>
      <p>“This new agreement with the Commonwealth comes on top of the almost 500 road and Metronet (rail) projects currently underway or in the pipeline,” Mr McGowan said.</p>
      <p>“When complete it will be an unprecedented transformation of our transport network.”</p>
