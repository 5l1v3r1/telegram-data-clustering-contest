      <p>A woman who delivered her baby in the middle of a freezing night, 93 kilometres away from the nearest hospital, has thanked the triple-zero operator who helped her husband deliver their baby.</p>
      <p>Allanah Dower woke her husband Jonno in the early hours of the morning on July 13 last year, with the news that she was in labor.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty full on,” Jonno told 3AW’s Neil Mitchell.</p>
      <p>“I was the middle of the night, it was very foggy and down towards zero degrees. Very scary.”</p>
      <p>Allanah’s labour was progressing quickly, and the pair jumped in their ute to travel to the hospital in Wodonga, almost 100 kilometres away from their Dartmouth home.</p>
      <p>But they didn’t make it far before it became clear they weren’t going to make it, so they called triple-zero for help.</p>
      <p>Samantha was the call taker who guided Jonno through the safe delivery of baby Reginald.</p>
      <p>She said she was more than happy to help out.</p>
      <p>“It’s just so overwhelming and exciting, and when you hear that baby make its first cry, just the wave of relief that comes over you is amazing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very special experience to be part of.”</p>
