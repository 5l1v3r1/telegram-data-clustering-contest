      <p>THE Board Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Sen Olabiyi Durojaiye, has said the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) can extend communications services to 1.2 billion people across the African continent.</p>
      <p>He spoke in Lagos during a sensitisation workshop for the communications industry on the implications of the AFCFTA initiative.</p>
      <p>The two-day workshop with the theme: Improving Nigeria’s communication industry competitiveness for the AFCFTA initiative, was organised by the NCC in collaboration with the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiation (NOTN).</p>

      <p>Sen Durojaiye said there is no limit to what innovative operators/investors will get in terms of business opportunities with a larger proportion of the population made up of young people, whose hunger for data and mobile services continues to grow.</p>
      <p>He said in line with the Federal Government’s objectives, NCC is committed to ensuring that the sector continues to improve on its contribution to GDP and by extension the Nigerian economy.</p>
      <p>He said: “Through its direct contribution to the GDP and the indirect contribution to the performance of other sectors, the Telecommunication sector is indeed a facilitator of economic development. This sensitisation workshop is to engage with stakeholders, with a view towards crafting achievable recommendations and solutions that will guarantee positive growth, development and prosperity for our industry, the Nigerian economy, and the African continent. Just the way we recognise the opportunities for investors in the African market, we also know that there are challenges not to say threats.”</p>
