      <p>The limited theater run of “Scandalous: The Untold Story of the National Enquirer” has been extended through the weekend at Quad Cinema on West 13th Street in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>The documentary tells the story of the Enquirer, including its beginning as a blood and gore magazine. Founder Generoso Pope Jr. — who had taken over the floundering daily New York Enquirer with a $75,000 loan reputedly from a mafia don — soon changed it to a tabloid filled with celebrity gossip and bizarre stories to make it palatable to consumers at checkout counters in supermarkets.</p>
      <p>Among the highlights are how the magazine used a cousin of Elvis Presley’s to furtively snap a picture of Elvis in his coffin in 1977 — for an issue that sold a record 7 million copies.</p>
      <p>The documentary concludes in the current era with David Pecker as the CEO of the embattled parent company American Media Inc. and its controversial role in the “catch and kill” scandals that <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/08/30/trump-tried-to-buy-years-of-unflattering-stories-from-national-enquirer/">ensnared AMI in a federal probe</a> into alleged campaign financing violations of President Trump.</p>
