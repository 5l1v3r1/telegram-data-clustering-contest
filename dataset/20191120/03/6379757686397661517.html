      <p>A statement issued yesterday in Arusha by the chairman of ACT Board of Directors Jacqueline Mkindi said the government’s decision is an important step in defending farmers within the free market economy.</p>
      <p>The statement further explained that ACT is satisfied by the performance by top officials of the ministry and that from time to time they have been heard defending the farmer and crops from his farm.</p>
      <p>Mkindi said; “the minister for Agriculture Japhet Hasunga and his deputy Hussein Bashe have been issuing government directives not to set indicative prices for maize flour, and we in ACT on behalf of farmers in the country are pleased by these directives.”</p>
      <p>Recently, when responding to a question in Parliament deputy minister of Agriculture Hussein Bashe stressed the government decision not to interfere in setting up indicative prices for agricultural products including removing export bans for the same.</p>
      <p>ACT’s managing director Janet Bitegeko said as of now Tanzania produces six million tonnes of maize and the aim is to attain eight million tonnes by 2020/21.</p>
      <p>She said: “We in the council believe if farmers get better prices in three to four years in succession without government’s intervention, there is a great possibility to attain 15 million tonnes of maize per year, as many farmers will have the impetus to cultivate the crop.”</p>
