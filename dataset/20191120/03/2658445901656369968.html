      <p>The music talent hunt television reality show, ‘Access The Stars’, has officially kicked off with auditions in Abeokuta, Ogun State on Monday.</p>
      <p>Hosted by Dare Art Alade with Olive Emodi as co-host, ‘Access The Stars’ will air on Hip TV, Africa Magic, Views channel and Accelerate TV.</p>
      <p>The show will showcase a number of budding talents across Nigeria who will be selected by celebrity judges and will grace the stage with a line-up of some of the best artists in the Nigerian music industry. The move is aimed at giving a chance to burgeoning music stars to learn from their celebrity role models and get access to shine more.</p>
      <p>They will showcase their talents to a global audience as they go on tour with the A-list stars on ‘The Trek’. The roadshow started on Monday in Abeokuta and it will hit major cities including Lagos, Onitsha, Owerri, Calabar, and Abuja.</p>
      <p>The show is a fusion between Access Bank Plc. and the Nigerian Breweries’ Star Lager Beer .</p>

      <p>Speaking on the drive behind the initiative, Sarah Agha, Portfolio Manager, National Premium Brands, NB Plc. said; “Access Bank and Nigerian Breweries have the shared interest of serving Nigerian’s, and through this partnership, we are harnessing our collective strengths to shape an exciting future. Via this collaboration, we will give hidden gems the access to shine more by discovering, polishing and showcasing them to Nigerians, Africans, and the world.”</p>
      <p>According to Herbert Wigwe, Access Bank MD/CEO, the show is borne out of the desire of both brands to continue to connect with people through music.</p>
      <p>“Both our brands share a long history of creating excellent musical experiences for not just own customers, but the wider Nigerian audience and this is us expanding on that,’’ he said.</p>
