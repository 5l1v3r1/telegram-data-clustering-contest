      <h1>Dez Bryant Blasts Colin Kaepernick For Starting Movement After He Got Benched (TWEETS)</h1>

      <p>Dez Bryant had something on his mind on Tuesday, so he took to Twitter to get some answers.</p>
      <p>The free agent wide receiver posted a long rant to Colin Kaepernick that asked him numerous questions about what his next step was as far as actions after he started kneeling during the Anthem in 2016. He also wanted to know why he wanted to get back into a league that does not agree with his views and how him getting a job will change anything.</p>

      <p>From there, he began responding to fans, one of which is where he called Kaepernick out for essentially not doing anything when he was going to the NFC Title game and Super Bowl, but did so once he lost his job as a starter.</p>

      <p>He kept going:</p>

      <p>Kaepernick’s final season in the league had him putting up 18 total touchdowns and four interceptions in 11 games played. The narrative that he got benched for Blaine Gabbert has already been debunked, but the lie continues to live on, as you can tell by Bryant’s rant.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure what Bryant was trying to do here, but it certainly missed the mark. A simple check of Kaepernick’s ‘Know Your Rights’ camp would answer all his questions that he presented on Twitter.</p>
