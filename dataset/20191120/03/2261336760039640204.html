      <h1>UFC heavyweight contender Francis Ngannou teases ‘big news coming soon’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p>After a mostly disastrous 2018, Francis Ngannou’s 2019 has perhaps set him up for a massive 2020.</p>
      <p>The UFC heavyweight contender has been vocal about wanting the next title shot, accusing the promotion of <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/13/20962591/francis-ngannou-the-ufc-makes-appear-to-be-a-gatekeeper-heavyweight-mma-news">treating him like a gatekeeper</a>. Well after voicing his displeasure in media interviews, Ngannou has since tweeted of his recent meeting with Dana White and Chief Legal Officer Hunter Campbell, teasing a major announcement is on the horizon.</p>

      <p>“Just had a very productive meeting with the boss man Dana White and Hunter Campbell,” Ngannou wrote. “Excited to get back to work. Big news coming soon.”</p>
      <p>That’s right! An announcement that there will be an announcement.</p>
      <p>Ngannou (14-3) is riding a three-fight winning streak, with super quick knockouts of Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez, and most recently Junior dos Santos. His initial rise to the top saw him take on Stipe Miocic for Stipe’s heavyweight title back in 2018, but he was outclassed and lost a decision. A dreadful, action-deprived stinker vs. Derrick Lewis sank his stock significantly, but he has bounced back about as spectacularly as possible.</p>
      <p>So what could be that “big news” that’s soon to be revealed? Presumably if Daniel Cormier is not in position to take a trilogy bout with Miocic, then the heavy-handed Frenchman would surely be next in line for the belt, thus getting the chance to avenge his prior defeat to Stipe. Apart from that, headlining the UFC’s first foray into France, which is set to legalize MMA in 2020, would be the only other logical answer.</p>
      <p>...Or Ngannou is going to be the first major Zuffa Boxing signing. (I kid, I kid)</p>
