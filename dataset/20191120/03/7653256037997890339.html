      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Oil-prices">Oil prices</a> slipped for a third day on Wednesday as a surge in US stockpiles reinforced concerns about lacklustre global economic growth, while hopes ebbed for any movement on the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/US-China-trade">US-China trade</a> war.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/West-Texas-Intermediate">West Texas Intermediate</a> (WTI) crude futures erased early gains to be down 6 cents, or 0.1 per cent, at $55.15 a barrel by 0631 GMT, after falling more than 4 per cent over the previous two sessions.</p>
      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Brent-crude">Brent crude</a> futures were at $60.71 a barrel, down 20 cents, or 0.3 per cent. Brent dropped 3.8 per cent during the prior two sessions.</p>
      <p>Crude inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil user, rose 6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 15 to 445.9 million, data from industry group the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/American-Petroleum-Institute">American Petroleum Institute</a> showed late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The increase added to concerns about crude oversupply after Reuters reported that Russia, the world's second-biggest producer, was unlikely to back deepening output cuts when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/OPEC">OPEC</a>) meets on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna.</p>
      <p>Russia and other oil producers have agreed with OPEC to cut 1.2 million barrels per day of output through March to bolster prices, a producer group known as OPEC+.</p>
      <p>"The API data also showed US inventories posted a rather robust increase last week, which if confirmed by the EIA report, we could see oil prices continue to slide," said Edward Moya, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.</p>
      <p>Official US government inventory data from the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Energy-Information-Administration">Energy Information Administration</a> is due at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>US crude demand has slowed during a protracted trade war with China. Hopes for an end to the dispute in the signing of a so-called Phase 1 agreement between the sides has dimmed amid disagreements over the removal of tariffs.</p>
      <p>China on Wednesday also condemned legislation passed by the US Senate aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on a pro-democracy protest movement.</p>
      <p>"(The) fear here is still the trade talk with a lot of pessimism starting to filter through," said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader. "If we don't get a significant roll-back on tariffs, that's quite negative."</p>
      <p>Japanese exports tumbled at their quickest pace in three years in October, threatening to tip the trade-reliant economy into recession because of weakening demand from the United States and China.</p>
      <p>"Recent weak economic data suggested a global cyclical slowdown has yet to (show) a bottom sign, and thus demand outlook is going to remain soft," said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets.</p>
      <p>Crude imports by Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil buyer, fell 1.3 per cent in October versus a year ago.</p>
