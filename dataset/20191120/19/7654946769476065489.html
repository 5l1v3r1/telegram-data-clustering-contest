      <h1>De Blasio’s biggest ally on MTA board quits</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:16:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Marsh and David Meyer</a></address>
      <p>The MTA’s most outspoken straphanger advocate and in-house critic will quit its board next month, City Hall confirmed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Appointed by Mayor de Blasio in 2016, Veronica Vanterpool routinely made headlines as the rare — and sometimes only — voice of dissent on a board controlled by appointees and allies of Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
      <p>“Veronica Vanterpool is a true champion when it comes to advocating on behalf of millions of riders who rely on public transit every day,” said City Hall spokesman William Baskin-Gerwitz. “The mayor thanks her for elevating the discourse on transportation issues during her tenure on the board.”</p>
      <p>In the last year alone, Vanterpool spoke out against the governor’s decisions to cancel the long-planned L train shutdown, institute an indefinite state of emergency at the agency and add 500 cops to its in-house policy force.</p>
      <p>Most recently, at the November board meeting, she was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/de-blasio-tears-into-mta-for-spending-and-mismanagement/">the only board member</a> to oppose the MTA’s demand the city increase its financial contribution to the transit agency’s federally-mandated Access-A-Ride program.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a real board because we don’t function as a board, in the sense that we don’t elect or hire our chair or CEO … and there’s really no accountability,” Vanterpool said of her experience in an interview with Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/11/20/another-de-blasio-appointee-departs-the-mta-further-diminishing-his-sway-1228254">which broke the news of her exit</a>.</p>
      <p>Before starting her own consulting firm, Bronx native Vanterpool spent a decade as executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. She is leaving New York to serve as Chief Innovation Officer for Delaware’s transit agency.</p>
      <p>The departure means Hizzoner will be down to just two of his four appointees on the MTA board as the agency begins to spend its $51.5 billion budget for construction and modernization projects.</p>
      <p>Cuomo and his allies have repeatedly stalled efforts to increase oversight of the embattled state transit authority, which receives some funding from City Hall.</p>
      <p>De Blasio aides recently sent a list of questions about the mega-sized construction project, only to have an MTA’s top spokeswoman — a former Cuomo employee — call the effort a “scam.”</p>
      <p>Additionally, Cuomo declined to advance de Blasio’s nomination Dan Zarrilli, a top City Hall adviser, to the MTA board before the 2019 legislative session ended. That left the city’s MTA board slate shorthanded even before Vanterpool’s departure.</p>
      <p>Baskin-Gerwitz said the mayor will submit new board nominees “for appointment and confirmation in January.”</p>
      <p>The MTA declined to comment.</p>
