      <h2>Minutes show cautious optimism on trade, with increased attention given to corporate debt levels</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:13:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">Brendan Greeley</a></address>
      <p>Federal Reserve officials believed that political risks to growth had eased “a bit” since the end of the summer but spent some time discussing high levels of corporate debt at their last meeting, according to minutes released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Participants at the October rate-setting meeting believed that while political risks remained elevated, “there were some tentative signs that trade tensions were easing, the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened, and some other geopolitical tensions had diminished”, the minutes said.</p>
      <p>The Fed’s open market committee decided last month to cut US interest rates, the last of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f80253b8-fb35-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229">three cuts</a> responding to slower global growth, trade tension and low inflation. But at the same meeting, the committee also signalled a pause to monetary easing.</p>
      <p>Officials spent some time in the meeting discussing financial risks, including high levels of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/35602656-0561-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">corporate debt</a> and lower capital buffers for banks.</p>
      <p>While discussing whether to cut in October, several participants said that, even though uncertainty over trade policy had depressed business investment, they saw “little indication that weakness in business sentiment was spilling over into labour markets and consumer spending”. The Fed has watched carefully for signs that low corporate spending will have a broader effect on growth.</p>
      <p>And, in what is likely a first for the Fed committee, two participants suggested the group pay closer attention to the risks that climate change poses to financial stability.</p>
      <p>Equities were little changed after the minutes, with the S&amp;P 500 already down 0.7 per cent on further reports that a “phase one” US-China trade deal may not be completed this year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down to 1.74 per cent following the US-China news and unchanged post-Fed minutes.</p>

      <p>The central bank’s cautious optimism that political issues have eased, paired with a growing awareness of financial risks, show a shift at the Fed. The minutes confirmed no immediate plans for changes to the policy rate, and as chairman Jay Powell has said since October, the committee will <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/799a4a18-0a1b-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">wait</a> for a “material” change in economic conditions before it considers any.</p>
      <p>When the discussion turned to financial risks, some Fed governors and presidents were focused on “high levels of corporate indebtedness and elevated valuation pressures for a variety of risky assets”. Though they saw financial risks overall as “moderate”, they worried about the growth of corporate debt over the past decade.</p>
      <p>Two participants even worried that “market participants may be overly optimistic in the pricing of risk for corporate debt”.</p>
      <p>The increased detail on corporate debt shows the influence of Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed and Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed. Both have dissented from rate cuts this year, arguing that even though inflation is low, the Fed should still be concerned that easing the policy rate encourages financial risk-taking.</p>
      <p>The minutes said: “Although financial stability risks overall were seen as moderate, several participants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt market had grown over the economic expansion and raised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could lead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond markets; these developments could amplify the effects of an adverse shock to the economy.”</p>
      <p>The one-line mention of climate change shows a Fed increasingly concerned about the risks that rising sea levels pose to bank portfolios. In November, the San Francisco Federal Reserve held the first Fed research conference dedicated exclusively to the financial risks of a warming planet.</p>

      <p>At the October meeting, officials looked at financial indicators of a downturn, such as the difference between short- and long-term debt known as the yield curve, and saw that the risks of a recession over the medium term had fallen since the previous month.</p>
      <p>Members of the committee had also noticed that they were seeing some effects of their earlier rate cuts, citing purchases of houses and consumer durables such as cars, both of which are bought on credit.</p>
      <p>Staff reports from the Fed’s board of governors were slightly more downbeat, revising growth down “a little” since the September meeting, citing a “waning boost from fiscal policy” as the US tax cut passed in 2017 runs its course.</p>
