      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a brief but testy response on Wednesday to Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s open testimony, which shed light on Pompeo’s involvement in President Donald Trump’s Ukraine scheme.</p>
      <p>“How do you respond to Ambassador Sondland’s evidence today that you directed and coordinated Ukraine policy with the President’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani?” a reporter asked Pompeo during a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels.</p>
      <p>Pompeo said he “didn’t see a single thing today” because he was “working.”</p>
      <p>“Sounds like you might not have been,” Pompeo quipped. “I was in meetings all day and haven’t had a chance to see any of that testimony.”</p>
      <p>Sondland testified that Pompeo not only knew about Giuliani’s plot to force Ukraine to announce an investigation into Biden; he also facilitated communications between Giuliani and the diplomats who helped Giuliani attempt to carry out the scheme.</p>
