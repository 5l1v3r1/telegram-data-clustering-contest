      <h1>Alabama Player Reveals What Mac Jones Once Told Nick Saban At Practice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:30:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Alabama’s College Football Playoff hopes rest on the shoulders of backup quarterback Mac Jones.</p>
      <p>Star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury in the Crimson Tide’s game against Mississippi State. He suffered a dislocated hip and fractured a bone as a result of the injury.</p>
      <p>Now it’s up to Jones to lead Alabama in its final two regular season games against Western Carolina and Auburn. The Tide, despite playing with a backup quarterback and going on the road, are favorites to take down the Tigers next weekend.</p>
      <p>For fans wondering if Jones has what it takes to lead the team, one of his current teammates has a story for you.</p>
      <p>Alabama insider Charlie Potter shared a story from Alabama safety Jared Mayden about Jones’ time on the Crimson Tide’s scout team. As the story goes, Jones wouldn’t stop “throwing bombs” to wide receiver Tyrell Shavers.</p>
      <p>Nick Saban wasn’t happy about it and said to Jones, “Man, stop throwing it to him all the time.” Mac Jones quipped back, “Well, tell your defense to stop it.”</p>

      <p>If true, it shows Jones has some moxie.</p>
      <p>Jones is no scrub, by the way. He was the No. 18 pro-style passer in the 2017 class. He’s completed nearly 70-percent of his passes this season for 566 yards and four touchdowns to just one interception.</p>
      <p>Now he’ll get a full game against an inferior FCS opponent to gear up for Auburn.</p>
