      <h1>Left behind? The inside story of how Mike Ashley changed Newcastle's finances forever</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle were on a level financial playing field with the likes of Tottenham as the decade began, so how have they fallen so far behind them?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Rudge</a></address>
      <p>It’s apt that one of Newcastle United’s financial legacies throughout the current decade under Mike Ashley was the club’s inability to kick on as a commercial force, as many of its peers have done to great success, as the decade kicked off with a commercial deal that caused a mild uproar.</p>
      <p>As the world entered 2010, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> were enduring their first season of second division football since 1992, when the goals of Gavin Peacock and David Kelly fired them into the newly-created Premier League.</p>
      <p>A little over eight months on from their relegation at Villa Park in 2009, after eventually overcoming Plymouth in the third round of the FA Cup, Newcastle took on West Bromwich Albion at St James’ Park in their first league game of the decade.</p>
      <p>An entertaining 2-2 draw kept the club at the top of the Championship, with the bereaved Peter Lovenkrands grabbing an emotional equaliser for the Magpies that maintained their unbeaten run at home.</p>
      <p>On the same day, however, events off of the pitch would come to dominate conversation around the club. Northern Rock, the bank that had been nationalised two years earlier in the wake of the 2007/08 global financial crisis, came under fire after it agreed terms to extend its ongoing relationship with Newcastle, at a cost of up to £10million.</p>
      <p>Politicians and Geordies alike, many who had been burned by the near collapse of Northern Rock, quickly rallied. While the bank maintained the deal was in “the best interests of tax payers,” the founder of the bank’s small shareholders’ group thundered, “British taxpayers clearly should not be sponsoring football clubs as a publicly-owned, nationalised bank. Why is the taxpayer in Bognor Regis paying to support Newcastle United? Just what are these people playing at? It’s just bonkers.”</p>
      <p>Far less controversial but also a point of angst for many Newcastle fans was the dissolution of the club’s long-term relationship with sponsors Adidas, in favour of PUMA for the upcoming 2010/11 season. Newcastle and Adidas’ relationship stretched back to 1995, the German brand being present at the scene of some of their most famous and iconic moments throughout the club’s turn as title challengers and European mainstays in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
      <p>At the end of the 2009/10 season, with Newcastle promoted to the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League,</a> the club revealed revenues of £52million, down almost £35million on the previous season following relegation; and a £17million loss, marginally worse than the year before, after the club put a lid on costs, mainly wages.</p>

        <figcaption>Newcastle United players model the club's new home kit for the 2014/2015 season - made by Puma</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Magpies summarised the two deals without even the slightest hint of backlash, suggesting they were the start of great things to come at St James’ Park: “The club also managed to secure key new sponsorship deals with PUMA as kit supplier and a long-term extension with our shirt sponsor Northern Rock, which will help us build our commercial and sponsorship revenues in years to come.”</p>
      <p>Yet 10 years on from these deals, Newcastle have faltered as a commercial force, signing further deals which angered both the fanbase and wider public; while Premier League sides around them have raced ahead. In the club’s accounts published three years later, management green-lit the following sentence:</p>
      <p>“Match day and commercial revenue is a key driver because that is where the club can compete with – and outperform – its competitors to enhance its spending capabilities.”</p>
      <p>This despite Newcastle’s commercial income being millions lower than when Ashley bought the club in 2007 and the club’s investment in both players and infrastructure falling far below even the most meagre expectations on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>While it is an irrefutable fact that <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/mike-ashley">Ashley</a> has put his hand in his pocket to provide millions in loans to the club over the decade, Newcastle have simply stood still from a financial perspective; happy, it would, to be ‘there or thereabouts’ rather than at the very top.</p>
      <h3>Pardew and profits</h3>
      <p>As the decade reached its midway point, Newcastle had managed to maintain their Premier League status but were clearly regressing following a bright start. In 2011/12 Alan Pardew guided Newcastle to fifth place, Newcastle’s best achievement since the days of Sir Bobby Robson. This earned qualification for the Europa League, where they reached the quarter-finals before being eliminated by eventual finalists Benfica.</p>
      <p>However, rather than building on that fifth-placed finish, the Magpies slumped to 16th the next season and thereafter failed to gain a foothold higher than 10th.</p>
      <p>An exhilarating 3-3 draw with Burnley raised the curtain on the first day of 2015, in a game where John Carver - who had briefly replaced Robson as gaffer back in 2004 - once again found himself in the dugout at St James’ Park. The man who had delivered that season of European football less than two years ago was in discussions to become Crystal Palace manager.</p>
      <p>The Burnley result would leave Newcastle 10th but by the end of the season they had dropped down to 15th. Meanwhile they maintained their failures in the two domestic cup competitions, with Newcastle’s fifth-round appearance in the League Cup that season was the first time they’d reached that stage in either that competition or the FA Cup since 2006/07.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>On the face of it, Newcastle’s financial situation, the top line anyway, was steady if not spectacular. Revenues that season were near £129million - almost 150% higher than back in 2009/10, thanks to much more lucrative money on offer from broadcasting. Yet, of far more significance, for the fifth-straight season Newcastle were in profit.</p>
      <p>The losses that Ashley had papered over with his millions in the previous decade were a thing of the past thanks to Newcastle’s business strategy and continued Premier League status in these years. From losses of £34million, £20million, £15million and then £17million in Ashley’s first four seasons at the helm, Newcastle’s profit column for 2011-15 read: £33million, £1million, £10million, £19million and then, best of all, £36million.</p>
      <p>The grand total: £89million of profits in five seasons of football; warmly-received by a big time CEO with shareholders to please, anathema to fans desperate to see some of this cash invested into world-class players.</p>
      <p>In 2009/10, Ashley’s backing had helped the club quickly rebound to the Premier League but in the five seasons since, he’d resolved to let the club survive on its revenue streams.</p>
      <p>In these years, the club’s net spend on transfers only once crept above £20million and on multiple occasions the club was actually left with a transfer surplus. The strategy was clear: buy players from profits generated for a nominal fee and see the player snapped up years later for a larger sum, which could then be reinvested.</p>
      <p>The year of relative frivolity had in fact come with Pardew only half a year away from the exit door at St James’ Park, when more than £40million was splashed on Remy Cabella, Siem de Jong, Emmanuel Riviere, Daryl Janmaat, Jamaal Lascelles, Karl Darlow and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ayoze-perez">Ayoze Perez.</a> Balancing these transfers somewhat was the money recouped for Mathieu Debuchy and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, two examples of the buy-to-sell strategy.</p>
      <p>And what of that commercial nous that the club had claimed back in 2013 would see Newcastle outperform its competitors to “enhance its spending capabilities”?</p>
      <p>At the turn of decade, Newcastle’s earnings through commercial activities were around £15million; by the midway point, they’d hit £25million. An improvement, yes, but only without the prior knowledge that this was actually lower than the £28million commercial machine Ashley had inherited eight years earlier.</p>
      <p>While Newcastle had stood within touching distance of Tottenham, Arsenal and Liverpool back in 2007, these sides were now at least twice as big as Newcastle at the close of 2014/15, with Arsenal (£103million)  and Liverpool (£116million) many multiples higher.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And even those commercial deals that had catapulted Newcastle to this stage had come with typical Ashley controversy. PUMA had refreshed terms with Newcastle innocuously enough ahead of the 2013/14 season but serious eyebrows had been raised at the firm Newcastle had chosen to partner with as Northern Rock’s replacement going into that season</p>
      <p>The Magpies back in 2012 had unveiled the controversial payday lender Wonga as their new main sponsor, a company which had profited from charging exorbitant interest rates to people, often in desperate need of a few quid.</p>
      <p>The Labour MP Stella Creasy remarked: ”It is only through preying on families struggling to make ends meet that Wonga has made enough money to be able to sign this deal with Newcastle.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, taking the other side of the argument, unsurprisingly, the club’s managing director Derek Llambias chirped, “Wonga’s desire to help us invest in our young playing talent, the local community and new fan initiatives really impressed us and stood them apart from other candidates.”</p>
      <p>A much smaller embarrassment, but classic Newcastle all the same, Wonga’s rebranded logo released in 2014 rendered Newcastle’s kits for the upcoming season out of date - even before they were unveiled.</p>
      <h3>The hard sell</h3>
      <p>Once bitten twice shy, as the saying goes. After spluttering along following those years of promise in 2011 and 2012, Newcastle were handed their first serious investment under Mike Ashley after yet another season of disappointment. Steve McClaren, the man who had replaced long-serving caretaker manager Carver at the end of 2014/15, was handed the keys to safe. He would not see out the course of the season and Ashley would never again sanction such spending.</p>
      <p>Figures vary, but anywhere between £80million and £95million was agreed for the signings of Gini Wijnaldum, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Florian Thauvin, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jonjo-shelvey">Jonjo Shelvey,</a> Andros Townsend, Chancel Mbemba and Henri Saivet. In return, Newcastle recouped hardly anything from transfers out and at the end of the season suffered their second relegation under Ashley. The matter was compounded by a Sunderland result being the ultimate cause of their demotion.</p>
      <p>Time and time again, Ashley’s failure to intervene and invest - or at the very least, face fans head on - drew the wrath of many supporters throughout these years. However, the neglect of Newcastle United’s facilities was one area where it seemed a promise had simply been broken.</p>
      <p>Tottenham, Newcastle’s equal in the mid-2000s, spent the decade gearing up to open a brand new £1billion stadium and complex; direct investment at Brighton allowed the club up upgrade to a new ground; and countless clubs have seen their training facilities upgraded to world-class levels. Going into the 2020s, Everton, are the latest club to unveil grandiose stadium plans.</p>

      <p>Back in 2013, Newcastle sought to follow suit, announcing that Darsley Park would be laid flat and a new state-of-the-art training complex was going to be built. According to the top brass at Newcastle, this was essential if Newcastle were going to compete with clubs towards the top end of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Suffice to say, the plans were never realised and were quietly dropped in 2017, with the investment going elsewhere and the planning permission allowed to expire. Yet even as the training facilities were given a mild facelift, fans have accused St James’ Park of growing tired next to increasingly shiny grounds across the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Rather surprisingly, Ashley opted not to put the club up for sale officially following relegation in 2016, as he had done back in 2009. Instead he balanced the books and under the guidance of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> - who had replaced McClaren too late in the previous season to implement a turnaround - watched on as Newcastle jumped immediately back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>By 2017/18, the last season for which financial data is available, Newcastle were turning over around £178million a year, with around 70% of the money stemming from the Premier League. A revamped TV deal kicking in from 2016/17 had had a material impact on the value of broadcasting rights, heightening the need for Newcastle to be in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The season before, Newcastle had slumped to a pre-tax loss of around £40million, all told, after their already sizeable Championship wage bill was topped up with promotion bonuses and pay-outs for onerous contracts. But this was just a blip in the road on those fabulous profits delivered in the decade, as Newcastle returned a £19million pre-tax profit on those £178million revenues. Once more a net spend of roughly £20million was signed off, this time handed to Rafa Benitez to reshape the squad in his image.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Benitez, an idol to many fans who steered the club to 10th- and 13th-placed finishes in his two full Premier League seasons, left after his contract simply ran down, replaced by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce.</a> Benitez’ vision of lifting the club back up to Champions League football suffocated under his demands for investment. It remains to be seen exactly what impact the boyhood Newcastle United fan will have on the club.</p>
      <p>Going into the new decade, the question mark of the sale remains. Newcastle’s second birthday as a club unwanted by its current owner passed in October, although many fans know a sale could really have taken place at any point during the last 12 years. The owner unwanted by its fans has gone on considerably longer than that, in any case.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a United Arab Emirates magnate, Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed Al Nahyan, was reported to be negotiating a £350million buyout of the club from Ashley, although a deal has yet to materialise. This had followed on from failed offers by both Amanda Staveley and then Peter Kenyon, who returned in the last few months with a 46-page document outlining his plans to buy and grow the club. Again, nothing is concrete.</p>
      <p>Ashley has made no bones about his desire to sell, and his personal debts are relatively small: as of 30 June 2018, a loan of £144million remained outstanding to the billionaire, although £33million of this was repaid some time after. A new owner with real financial backing - finally - could signal the beginning of a new era in the Newcastle United story as the 2020s begin.</p>
