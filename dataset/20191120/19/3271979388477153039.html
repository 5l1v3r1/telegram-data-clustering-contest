      <p><b>Brad Pitt</b> and <b>Alia Shawkat</b> are not dating, but inaccurate romance rumors are making the rounds online simply because the two were spotted together at a few events in recent months. The actor’s rep, however, exclusively tells <b>Gossip Cop</b> on the record that the two are “just friends.” Although several outlets have already debunked the rumors, others were quick to speculate there’s something going on between the two. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can reveal who got it right and who got it wrong.</p>
      <p>This past weekend, Pitt and Shawkat were photographed at the Wilding Cran Gallery, an art exhibit in Los Angeles. In October, both posed backstage with Mike Birbiglia at the comedian’s one man show in Los Angeles. And in September, the two were spotted leaving a performance of Ethan Cohen’s <i>A Play Is A Poem</i>. Despite all of these outings, Pitt’s spokesperson tells <b>Gossip Cop</b> they’re not dating.</p>
      <p>Several outlets jumped to a different conclusion. RadarOnline was the most brazen, but baselessly so. The blog insisted there’s a “romance heating up” between Pitt and Shawkat, who’s described as his “much-younger love interest.” The Blast, a typically reliable source for celebrity news, missed the mark with a headline reading, “Is Brad Pitt Dating Alia Shawkat From ‘Arrested Development?’” The website described the two as an “unexpected match” and an “alleged couple,” before speculating that their shared taste in the arts brought them together.</p>
      <p>Lainey Gossip also speculated about a possible romance between Pitt and Shawkat, adding in its article, “New couple alert?” <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> said in its headline on the topic that the two are “rumored to be dating.” <i>InStyle</i>’s headline asked, “Um, Are Brad Pitt and Alia Shawkat Dating?” Perez Hilton also published an article breaking down the “evidence” that the two stars might be an “intriguing new couple.”</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there were several other publications that took the time to fact-check the rumors. <i>People</i> magazine correctly reported that Pitt and Shawkat are “absolutely just friends.” <i>Page Six</i> also clarified that the two stars are “not dating.” E! News accurately noted that Pitt and Shawkat are “not a couple and there’s nothing romantic going on.” <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> also set the record straight. It’s worth noting, all of these outlets debunked the dating rumors based on sources, and while these sources proved to be reliable, <b>Gossip Cop</b> is the only outlet to get an official comment from Pitt’s spokesperson.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> would also like to give <i>some</i> credit to <i>Us Weekly</i> for debunking the romance rumors. The reason the magazine only gets <i>some</i> credit is because it’s the same tabloid that published a cover story in September claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/brad-pitt-girlfriend-charlize-theron-dating-sat-hari-khalsa/">Pitt was dating spiritual advisor Sat Hari Khalsa</a> after ending a romance with Charlize Theron. The movie star never dated either of those women, and <i>Us Weekly</i>’s new piece regarding Shawkat makes no mention of the scenario it came up with in September.</p>
      <p>Pitt has a lot of different friends in the entertainment industry, both male and female, and Shawkat happens to be one of them. It’s a bit disheartening that so many outlets decided to speculate about the two dating without bothering to look into the situation. In fact, the majority of these outlets ended their articles by asking readers whether or not they believed the two were romantically involved. When it comes to stories like these, publications should be doing research and reporting actual news, not asking for guesses from readers. It’s becoming common for publications to forgo reporting in favor of speculation. As always, <b>Gossip Cop</b> recognizes the importance of fact-checking.</p>
