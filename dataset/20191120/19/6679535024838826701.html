      <h2>It will help increase water storage capacity at Manai-Shiroor area</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:32:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ganesh-Prabhu-1555/" target="_blank">Ganesh Prabhu</a></address>
      <p>With work to remove silt in the area behind the Baje Dam against the Swarna under way, people of Udupi city may not face chronic water shortage in the coming summer. Drinking water is supplied to the city from the dam located about 18 km from here.</p>
      <p>Last summer (April-May 2019), the city faced chronic water shortage with many localities getting water once in six days. One of the reasons for this scarcity was the accumulation of silt in the area behind the dam. Silt had not been removed for many years.</p>
      <p>With the district administration taking proactive steps, the work is being taken up by Yojaka India Pvt. Ltd. since November 4. It is being carried out in two blocks, one from the dam to Mane Bridge and another from Mane Bridge to Shiroor Mutt.</p>
      <p>The sand collected during the work is being stored at a stockyard at Gandhi Maidan in Hiriyadka village.</p>
      <p>The stockyard has geo-fencing and quality sand is being stored. It also has a weighbridge to measure sand. Five CCTV cameras too have been installed at the stockyard.</p>
      <p>“The work is expected to be completed by the end of December. In case there is more silt, it may get extended to January 15,” Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesh told <i>The Hindu</i>. The completion of the work is expected to take care of drinking water needs of the city in April and May. “Once the work is completed, we expect the storage capacity in the area behind the dam to increase. It will be able to store water required for 25-30 days. Hence, we do not expect chronic water shortage in summer in the city,” said Udupi Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar.</p>
      <p>“The company has been asked to complete the work as soon as possible so that water could get stored in the area behind the dam,” he said.</p>
      <h3>App launch</h3>
      <p>The sand which has been stored at the stockyard in Hiriyadka will be sold through the Udupi e-Sand App, which the district administration has created for selling sand, and is expected to be launched in about three days.</p>
