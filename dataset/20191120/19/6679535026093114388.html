      <p>The Bombay High Court on Wednesday granted temporary bail to former minister Suresh Jain, convicted in the multi-crore Jalgaon Gharkul housing scam.</p>
      <p>A Division Bbench of Justices Ranjit More and M.S. Karnik was hearing a medical bail plea filed by Jain who is lodged at the Nashik Central jail, but currently out on furlough.</p>
      <p>Advocate Aabad Ponda appearing for Jain informed the court that the Shiv Sena leader, 76, is suffering from serious medical conditions and is undergoing treatment at a hospital Mumbai.</p>
      <p>The court on Wednesday granted him bail for three months on a provisional surety of ₹5 lakh.</p>
      <p>In August, a sessions court in Dhule had found Jain guilty in the scam and convicted him under Sections 177 (furnishing false information), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.He was sentenced for seven years and fined ₹100 crore.</p>
      <p>Besides Jain, the sessions court had convicted 47 others, including another former State minister Gulabrao Deokar, ex-municipal councillors and officials, for irregularities in the Gharkul housing project.</p>
      <p>Jain had favoured Khandesh Builders, which got the contract to build houses under the Gharkul scheme, and indulged in irregularities to the tune of ₹29 crore.</p>
      <p>Of the 5,000 houses to be built on the outskirts of Jalgaon city in north Maharashtra, only 1,500 were completed.</p>
      <p>Former Jalgaon municipal commissioner Pravin Gedam had registered a complaint in this regard in 2006.</p>
      <p>On September 8, Jain challenged his conviction in the high court and sought that his sentence be suspended and he be released from jail pending hearing of his appeal.</p>
