      <p>“In the End” was released earlier this year in tribute to Dolores O’Riordan, the late lead singer of the band who passed away in January 2018. The remaining members of the band—guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, drummer Fergal Lawler—began work on the album, which is to be the band’s last, using demos O’Riordan recorded before her tragic death. </p>
