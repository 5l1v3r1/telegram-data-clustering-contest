        <i>Now that’s crossing the line! What now, Indonesia?!</i>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a reason why Malaysians just can’t meet eye to eye with Indonesians and this post probably represents the worst case of claim culture ever. It’s so silly that we can’t help but laugh.</p>
      <p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamBuatKes/photos/a.1175562435941976/1306787152819503/?type=3&amp;permPage=1">Buat Kes</a> Facebook Page, Malaysians were informed that Harimau Malaya striker Safawi Rasid is in fact, surprise surprise, Indonesian.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hahaha.. Malingsial can’t even produce high-quality players. They even bought Safawi Rasid. He was originally a Medan player but was bought by them. And you are proud of that?”</blockquote>

      <p>And obviously, the statement humoured Malaysians greatly as netizens poured into the comments section to give their two cents.</p>
      <p>“Which part of him came from Medan? It’s not that hard to go to Google and Wikipedia and check on him. You guys kept on claiming all the good stuff. Why won’t you claim Happy Polla? If not, you can claim the ‘old lady that shakes her head’. (Does Indonesia own Malaysia, and I am the only one who is left behind?)”</p>

      <p>Of course, a quick check on Wikipedia shows that Safawi was in fact born in Dungun, Terengganu – which we’re pretty sure isn’t a district in Medan, Indonesia.</p>
