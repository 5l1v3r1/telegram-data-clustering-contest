      <h1>A fan’s tribute to a legend</h1>
      <h2>Kalki Subramaniam's art show to celebrate the legacy of actor Sridevi</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:04:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-Dinesh-Varma-1143/" target="_blank">M. Dinesh Varma</a></address>
      <p>As a child, the movie hall was a safe space for Kalki Subramaniam to get away from bullying over her changing gender identity. Those escapes into a make-believe world would gradually also turn her into a die-hard fan of yesteryear film star Sridevi.</p>
      <p>Now a transgender activist, actor and author, Ms. Kalki has channelled the adulation for her icon into fan art and will showcase her digital pop art works at the Storytellers Bar, The Promenade, on Saturday, with a preview scheduled on Friday.</p>
      <p>‘Diva’, intended as a tribute and a celebration of the legendary heroine, will be on till December 22.</p>
      <p>Ms. Kalki first saw Sridevi in the K. Balachander-directed <i>Moondru Mudichu </i>and <i>Gayathri </i>as a child with family. “I can't remember anything about the films. It was only as recently as last year that I saw both the films again and was fascinated by how at 13 years of age she could act so maturely,” says Ms. Kalki.</p>
      <p>Ms. Kalki recalls how during school days, she used to bunk classes and see movies as a way to escape being bullied for her transgender identity. “It was then that I first saw <i>Mr. India</i>,” says Ms. Kalki, who still loves to jive away with friends to the song ‘Hawa Hawaii...’ when they get together.</p>
      <p>She regards <i>Chandini </i>as a magical movie that brought out the most feminine and graceful side of Sridevi. She suspects Yash Chopra who “could so beautifully bring the best of Sridevi” must also have been a big fan. And, then came <i>Chaalbaaz </i>with Anju and Manju, the double role, which was a hilarious film, frame-to-frame, she recalled.</p>
      <p>“The comic encounters of Rajinikanth and Sridevi in <i>Chaalbaaz </i>were exceptionally hilarious,” says Ms. Kalki, who also rates Ram Gopal Varma’s <i>Kshana Kshanam </i>as “an unforgettable hilarious performance”.</p>
      <h3>Transition period</h3>
      <p>“Like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, my transition period from one gender to the other was my metamorphosis. Sridevi with her screen presence, made me see how graceful I can be, how talented and dedicated I can be,” says Ms. Kalki, who established Sahodari Foundation to work for comprehensive empowerment of transgenders. “She made me laugh, she made me dance, she gave me the energy I needed during the struggling years of in life,” said Ms. Kalki. “I have never met her and didn't really have the inclination to meet her. I always wanted to be her fan and a distance admirer and I am content with that.”</p>
      <p>‘Diva’ is her way of paying tribute and showing gratitude to Sridevi. The ten digital artworks are a combination of multiple computer software, handwork and brush strokes.</p>
      <p>“‘Diva’ is just that. The pop artworks I created are from the 1980s and 1990s period of Sridevi, which correspond with my childhood days,” says Ms. Kalki, who is a trailblazer herself, being the first transgender artiste to play the lead in the Hindi film <i>Kalashnikov</i>.</p>
