      <h1>Democratic debate: All eyes are on Pete Buttigieg, especially from skeptical black voters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:24:46+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/opinion/" target="_blank">Suzette Hackney, Indianapolis Star</a></address>
      <p>Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg's success in recent polls suggests he has a big target on his back — one that, if not skillfully negotiated, could cost him the Democratic nomination.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg’s campaign is surging, just in time for Wednesday’s Democratic presidential primary debate in Atlanta. Once an obscure long shot, Buttigieg has wedged his way to the top of a field featuring Democratic candidates Vice President Joe Biden and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/16/iowa-poll-buttigieg-leads-iowa-followed-warren-sanders-biden/4218623002/">Buttigieg is leading in the Iowa polls, with 25% of voters in one survey<b> </b>saying he’s their first choice for president.</a> Since September, according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, Buttigieg has risen 16 percentage points among Iowa’s likely Democratic caucusgoers. Biden, Sanders and Warren are all about 10 percentage points behind Buttigieg.</p>
      <p>Momentum is on Buttigieg's side among the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates — at least for now. If he wins Iowa he could also secure New Hampshire, which sometimes follows the whims of bellwether state Iowa. Because of his newfound top-tier stratus, Buttigieg also will undoubtedly be in the crosshairs of his rivals. And unfortunately, Buttigieg’s campaign has given them some ammunition.</p>
      <h3>Weakness with black voters</h3>
      <p>Buttigieg, who has struggled to build broader appeal among people of color, particularly African Americans, is facing allegations that his campaign grossly inflated support among black voters in South Carolina.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conspiracies for thee but not for me: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/19/trump-health-hypocrisy-2016-clinton-smears-speculation-dangerous-column/4230547002/">Speculating about Trump's health is 'dangerous,' but Hillary Clinton's was fair game?</a>
      </p>
      <p>Last month, Buttigieg’s campaign announced that more than 400 South Carolinians endorsed his Douglass Plan, his proposal aimed at helping to combat institutional racism and empower black Americans. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bidens-rivals-scramble-to-dent-his-support-from-black-voters/2019/11/11/286e2748-ff14-11e9-9518-1e76abc088b6_story.html">It turns out some of the signees were not African American, nor did they even live in the state.</a></p>

      <p>Earlier this week, Buttigieg was again dinged because a stock photo that appeared on his campaign website accompanying details about the Douglass Plan — named after abolitionist and activist Frederick Douglass — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/18/pete-buttigieg-black-american-douglass-plan-kenyan-photo/#comments-wrapper">was that of a Kenyan woman and child. </a>The photo was reportedly removed from the website’s page in September.</p>
      <p> “As our campaign has grown, we have brought all of our web development in-house to help guard against mistakes like this," Buttigieg's campaign said in a statement. "We apologize for its use and the confusion it created.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why make it easy to rig elections?: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/20/kill-electoral-college-invite-trump-presidents-rig-elections-column/4238308002/">Killing Electoral College would invite Trump, future presidents to rig their reelections</a>
      </p>
      <p>Stock photos certainly are used in today's digital sphere, both on professional and personal platforms. But with Buttigieg’s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/01/pete-buttigieg-third-quarter-fundraising-shows-staying-power-dem-race/3824544002/">large campaign kitty</a>, such a snafu looks looks amateurish — and worse — dishonest.</p>
      <p>In both cases, I don’t believe there’s some deeper, nefarious political manipulation happening, but among<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/suzette-hackney/2019/06/14/wooing-black-voters-delicate-dance-buttigieg-writes-columnist-suzette-hackney/1443217001/"> already skeptical black voters</a>, such missteps can be costly. I expect Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), both African American, to take at least a few swipes Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Expect to be challenged</h3>
      <p>After all, during<a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2019/10/16/presidential-race-2020-democratic-debate-ohio-why-pundits-praising-pete-buttigieg-performance/3995099002/"> the October debate, Buttigieg set an aggressive tone.</a> Along with other candidates, he repeatedly used his time to go after Warren, who was leading in polls at the time.</p>
      <p>“This is why people are so frustrated,” Buttigieg said about Warren’s lack of details in her “Medicare for All” health care platform. “Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this.”</p>

      <p>I foresee Warren returning the favor.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, 37, has thus far beat back criticism about his youth and lack of government experience by touting a need for generational change and arguing that he has more executive experience than President Donald Trump. I expect his (ahem) older rivals to try to paint Buttigieg as an up-and-comer but not ready for the Oval Office.  </p>
      <p>Buttigieg may be the mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city, but he’s playing on the biggest stage of his career now. He is at a pivotal point in his presidential bid. Wednesday's debate may be Buttigieg's toughest test yet. The pressure is on and he has little room for error.</p>
