      <p><b>“Over the past 20-plus years, Supreme has gone from a brand servicing skaters who were often considered rebels, to becoming a highly respected, highly sought-after collecting category in its own right,” </b>Caitlin Donovan, Christie’s director of sales, was quoted as saying.</p>

      <p><b>“It was the first of the streetwear and ‘hype’ brands to forge the path to an entirely new market and audience of collectors. Supreme has been a cultural lightning rod. Through supply and demand it has transformed young male retail shoppers into secondary market collectors and connoisseurs,” </b>she added.</p>
