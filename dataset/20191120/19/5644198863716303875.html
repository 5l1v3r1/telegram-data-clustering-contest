      <p>HONG KONG: Dozens of protesters stood firm inside a besieged Hong Kong University on Wednesday (Nov 20), as a standoff with police showed no signs of ending.</p>
      <p>Protesters have held the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) campus since Sunday, wielding Motolov cocktails, bricks and arrows.</p>

      <p>A 20-year-old protester, who gave his name as Ken, said food and water supplies were running low.</p>
      <p>“We will die because they don’t let me out,” he said. “Some people want to get out but they cannot. So we left this SOS.”</p>

      <p>Protesters said about 50 of them remained after hundreds had fled deteriorating conditions and officials warned that police may fire live rounds. </p>
      <p>Around 20 of the holdouts are students of the university, a PolyU official said.</p>

        <b>"NEVER GIVE UP"</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 15-year-old armed with a bow and arrow, who identified himself as William, said: "I don't ever give up. Yes, I will fight until the end.</p>
      <p>"But ... it's very dangerous, because when you use the bow, the police must shoot you, with some unknown bullets. Maybe real bullets."</p>

      <p>"I already know where I will hide," a 19-year-old student, who gave his name only as Paul, said as he emerged in a hoodie, shorts and slippers to ask about breakfast in the canteen.</p>
      <p>"I have enough food for at least a week and then will see what happens," he said.</p>

      <p>"We need some energy to get ready for the big fight. Now that there's not many of us left they may want to come in," said a former student named Marc, 26.</p>
      <p>"We know this place, it's our home and it is a maze. And we have weapons. We're not going to give up now, it's too late for that," he said.</p>

      <p>On Monday, some protesters made daring escapes by sliding down ropes and running to motorcycles waiting to get them away, while others <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-sewer-escape-polyu-campus-riot-police-12108028">attempted to leave through the sewers</a>.</p>

      <p>"It has been a disastrous life for us spending these days in Polytechnic University, because we can't live here. The supply of food, water, electricity is going to run out," said a student named Alesa, who said she had tried twice to escape through the sewer.</p>
      <p>"It's in vain," she said. "I'm a bit upset, but overall, I'm peaceful. I think if a generation are destined to be criminals, who is to save the next generation?" she said.</p>
