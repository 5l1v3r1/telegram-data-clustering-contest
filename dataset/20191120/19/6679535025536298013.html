      <p>Members belonging to the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), Holistic Approach for People’s Empowerment (Hope) NGO and various other organisations on Wednesday took out a rally demanding distribution of rice and other essential commodities to all cardholders in the Union Territory.</p>
      <p>The rally began at Mahatma Gandhi Road and culminated in front of the head post office on Rangapillai Street.</p>
      <p>V. Chandra, State president of AIDWA, said that a survey conducted by Hope NGO revealed that cardholders wanted supply of rice through fair price shops instead of payment of the equivalent in cash subsidy into their bank accounts.</p>
      <p>The government should ensure prompt distribution of rice and other essential commodities in ration shops.</p>
      <p>The Public Distribution System should be strengthened to ensure that its benefits reached the cardholders, she said. Victor Raj, Director of Hope NGO, was present.</p>
