      <p>Ghanaian songwriter, producer and singer Gladstorm Kwabena Akwaboah Jnr., known in showbiz circles as Akwaboah says the genre of music he does makes it difficult for him to find artistes to collaborate with.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with Rev. Erskine on Yfm’s  Morning Radio Show, Akwaboah said,  “With the kind of songs I do, I struggle to get collaborations. If the song is good, how do you get someone deep like you to work on it?”</p>
