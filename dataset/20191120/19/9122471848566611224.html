      <h1>ESPN Analyst Outlines ‘Nightmare’ Scenario For College Football Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:49:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>There wasn’t much change in last night’s <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff rankings</a> update on ESPN. LSU and Ohio State remains locked in at Nos. 1 and 2, followed by Clemson and Georgia. Alabama and Oregon remain the first two teams on the outside looking in.</p>
      <p>Right now, the path for those top four teams is pretty clear: keep winning, and you’re in. LSU, OSU, and Clemson are all undefeated, while Georgia is set to face LSU in the conference championship. At 12-1 with a win over the Tigers, you couldn’t leave UGA out.</p>
      <p>If we get some chaos, however, during conference title week, things could get very interesting. A “nightmare scenario” outlined by ESPN’s Rece Davis during last night’s rankings show would only really require one major upset.</p>
      <p>Davis set the stage for this possible outcome during last night’s ESPN broadcast:</p>
      <p>-Clemson wins out, finishing at 13-0 with the ACC title.<br/>-Minnesota and Ohio State win out, and the Golden Gophers knock off Ohio State in the Big Ten title game to finish 12-1.<br/>-Georgia beats LSU for the SEC Championship, leaving both teams at 12-1.</p>
      <p>Clemson would obviously be a lock in this scenario, but the rest of the field is way up for debate, with the Golden Gophers inserting themselves in the debate in a major way.</p>
      <p>Kirk Herbstreit believes the debate comes down to LSU and Ohio State, the current No. 1 and No. 2 teams, with the  Buckeyes having an edge. Via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/LSU-Tigers-Ohio-State-Buckeyes-nightmare-college-football-playoff-scenario-Kirk-Herbstreit-138884453/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Clemson is in. Georgia is in. Minnesota is in. The debate is between Ohio State, the most complete team all year against that LSU offense. It’s not the team, it’s Joe Burrow and the LSU offense. I think Ohio State would get the nod in that scenario as the most complete team all year.”</blockquote>
      <p>David Pollack has LSU getting in over the Buckeyes, with Minnesota drawing Clemson in the 1-4 game.</p>
      <blockquote> “Clemson is in immediately as the No. 1 seed. Georgia has to go in with three Top 16 wins, probably most impressive resume. I don’t think LSU is getting left out in that scenario. You’d have a possible rematch LSU-Georgia in the next round. Minnesota would be in.”</blockquote>
      <p>Joey Galloway follows suit with Pollack, while Jesse Palmer has a slightly different take from his ESPN colleagues. He thinks LSU and Georgia both make it, but would put Ohio State over Minnesota, if the Buckeyes blow out Penn State, even with the Gophers having that head-to-head win as the final data point.</p>
      <blockquote>“I would put Georgia at No. 1 based on their resume and I would put Clemson at No. 2. LSU in based on resume, Burrow winning the Heisman and Ohio State in over Minnesota, especially if Ohio State houses Penn State.”</blockquote>
      <p>Herbstreit went on to express relief that this “is not going to happen,” but it really isn’t that far fetched, if you believe there’s a chance of Minnesota beating the Buckeyes.</p>
