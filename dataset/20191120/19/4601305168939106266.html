      <h1>"Forgotten" African-American cemetery discovered under Florida high school</h1>

      <p>At least 145 coffins have been discovered underneath King High School in Tampa, Florida. Apparently a citizen researching area cemeteries advised the school district that in the first half of the 20th century, there was an African-American graveyard on the site. So far, ground-penetrating radar revealed 145 coffins just a few feet below the surface. From <a href="https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2019/11/20/tampa-king-high-school-potters-field-cemetery-found-on-campus">Bay News 9</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The pattern of the findings matches historical records for a "potter's field," or pauper's field, called Ridgewood Cemetery, the district said. <br/><br/>"Hillsborough County Public Schools remains committed to respecting the individuals who are buried there, and their families," officials said.</blockquote>
      <p>This is just the latest of several "forgotten" African-American cemeteries found in Tampa<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2019/10/28/more-lost-cemeteries-will-be-found-historians-say/"> in the past year</a>.</p>
