      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – The union representing striking Metro Vancouver transit workers says there will be a complete shutdown of the bus system three days next week if Unifor and Coast Mountain Bus Company are not able to reach a deal.</p>
      <p>Unifor spokesperson Gavin McGarrigle said at a news conference on Wednesday that if the two parties don’t come to a deal there will be a total shutdown of the bus system on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week.</p>

      <p>“We have taken measured action in order to protect the public,” McGarrigle said. “Drivers took no action for weeks, other than refusing to wear their uniforms while we spoke to the public.”</p>
      <p>He says the union was hopeful about bargaining, but relations with CMBC, which operates on behalf of TransLink, continued to break down.</p>
      <p>“Beginning one week from today, we will engage in a complete system shutdown on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of next week,” he continued. “No members of Unifor Local 111 and 2200 will report to work on those days. Picketing will begin at all locations and we expect a complete shutdown of the bus system in Metro Vancouver as a result.”</p>

      <p>Acknowledging the chaos a total shutdown will cause the traveling public, McGarrigle said Unifor members will hold a rally of support for riders, but it is up to elected representatives to deal with the impasse.</p>
      <p>Unifor and CMBC have been in on-and-off talks all month, while job action by the roughly 5,000 Unifor transit drivers, SeaBus operators and mechanics continues.</p>
      <p>Union members are asking for improvements to working conditions, wages and benefits.</p>
