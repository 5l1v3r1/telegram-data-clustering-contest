      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> have reportedly identified <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/roma/"><b>Roma</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/edin-dzeko/"><b>Edin Dzeko</b></a> as a potential January signing.</h2>

      <p>Having failed to replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexis-sanchez/"><b>Alexis Sanchez</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romelu-lukaku/"><b>Romelu Lukaku</b></a> in the summer, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> is keen to bring in a new striker at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>While Juventus attacker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mario-mandzukic/"><b>Mario Mandzukic</b></a> has been heavily linked with a switch to Old Trafford, it appears that United are considering their options.</p>
      <p>According to <i>ESPN</i>, the Premier League giants may opt to move for Dzeko, who has previously represented Manchester City.</p>
      <p>As a result of Mandzukic's lack of game time, the report claims that Dzeko has emerged as the more likely arrival at the beginning of 2020.</p>
      <p>The Bosnia-Herzegovina international has contributed six goals and two assists from 15 outings in Serie A and the Europa League this season.</p>
