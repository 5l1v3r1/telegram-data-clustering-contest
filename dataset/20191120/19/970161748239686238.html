      <p>Dog the Bounty Hunter has confirmed he is still alive after rumours started to circulate the much-loved star had passed away.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, fans started to post RIP messages to the 66-year-old after a hoax story fuelled speculation he had died.</p>
      <p>However, it turns out he is more than alive, and shared a picture of himself as proof.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/dog-the-bounty-hunter-not-dead-hoax-alive-sign/">TMZ published the snap, which sees Dog, whose real name is Duane Chapman</a>, holding up a sign reading: ‘I’m alive’.</p>
      <p>In his other hand, he can be seen gripping the day’s copy of The Denver Post, and we don’t need any more evidence that he is still kicking.</p>

      <p>The publication said: ‘Dog was on his way to a workout when his phone started blowing up and he first heard about the hoax — which claimed he’d died because his grief over his late wife, Beth Chapman, caused a flare-up of his recent heart problems.’</p>

      <p>However, they branded the article fake news, and reassured fans that ‘Dog is doing well and nowhere near the grave.’</p>
      <p>The hoax came after the star suffered from a period of bad health seeing him hospitalised from a suspected heart attack.</p>
      <p>At the time reps for Dog confirmed to Metro.co.uk that he was resting up.</p>

      <p>‘I can confirm Dog is under doctor’s care and is resting comfortably,’ they said: ‘Thank you for all of your well wishes- keep ’em coming.’</p>
      <p>Dog’s medical emergency came three months after he was left heartbroken by the tragic death of his wife Beth, who died aged 51 after being diagnosed with terminal throat cancer.</p>
      <p>Just recently, the TV personality opened up about his grief following the sad news, and detailed how he considered taking his own life</p>
      <p>‘I just hope that I don’t live very much longer without her, because now she made the first step, she’s through the gate.</p>
      <p>‘She paved a way for me. I want to take a pain pill so bad,’ he revealed.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, “Hi honey”, and would she go, “You dumbass, why would you do that?”</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Or would she go, “Wow, you’re here”. I’ll be like “Of course I’m here. You left me. I’m here”, So, am I obligated to do that?’</p>
