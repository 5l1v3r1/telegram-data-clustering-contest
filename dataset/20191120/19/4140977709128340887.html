            <b>MAH Vs DEL Dream11 : The enthralling Super League stage of the marquee tournamnet gets underway today as two stalwarts go at loggerheads.</b>
          </p>
          <p>After exulting a pristine and sublime brand of cricket in their group stage encounters to top their respective groups, both Maharastra’s and Delhi enter the land of today’s enthralling encounter in ravishing form. These are two staunch names in Inca’s domestic cricketing fraternity, sides who have fully lived up to the enormous expectations accorded on their head by doling out pinch perfect performances.</p>
          <p>Topping Group C of the ongoing edition of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with the five wins from seven matches, Maharashtra look unstoppable, unforgiving and unsparing at the moment with the side upbeat with the three wins in succession. The most reason was a thumping 45 run win over Punjab, one which saw them maraud their way to 201 while batting first before curbing their opponents at just 156, a pulsating effort which emphasised the gargantuan nature of their side.</p>

                <p>And when they make an advent into the Super League stage of the showpiece T20 tournamnet, the side will be looking to emanate the same rampant display as they and Delhi get the newest round of the tournamnet underway. They know things won’t be easy for them though with Delhi themselves in flawless touch at the moment having topped Group E with the five wins as well from seven matches with the side emulating Maharastra’s three wins in succession.</p>
                <p>The 20 run win over Odisha in the previous match ensured that the margin the win came by saw the side edge Jharkhand into first place despite both ending with 22 points by the finest margin of NRR. This is a clash befitting to throw open the doors of the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, a match which promises to regale us in an edge of the seat thriller.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A tough wicket to bat on, the lowly score of 113 put up by the side batting first across the three matches in this edition of the trounamnet is clearly evident of how much a travesty it is going to be to bat here. The wicket does take a turn for the better though as the match runs down its course, something which will push the side winning the toss to chase over here. </p>

                            <h3>MAH Vs DEL Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>A key figure for his side, Delhi’s wicket-keeper as tallied up the 171 runs in 6 encounters to see us make the unit’s player an instant choice in this department of our Dream 11 side. On a wicket where batting won’t be the easiest, he’ll be asked to hold fort at the top of the order and string together meaningful partnerships consistently.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs DEL Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>He will find company in the form of Himmat Singh and Dhruv Shorey, two players who haven’t quite been as dependable as the side would have envisioned but players who come bearing with them immense fight and character. This is a partnership always capable of doling out a quirky and electric performance, two names we are going to be entrusting to do the job for Delhi today.</p>
                            <p>Elsewhere from Maharashtra, there were hardly any deliberations in hammering down the dependable and flamboyant Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad into our framework. In Gaikwad, Maharashtra have not only their leading run getter but one of the highest scorers across the league as well with the player having garnered up an expansive 268 runs in 7 encounters.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs DEL Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The 157 runs for Kedar Jadhav will make him our first choice in this slot of our Dream 11 side with the player having come up with handy contributions across all the matches the side have played in. His immense knowhow of the game and acumen paired with his application and technique will see him thrive and flourish on this surface to make him a safe option for the day.</p>
                            <h3>MAH Vs DEL Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His team’s top wicket taker, with 10 wickets in 7 matches, Satyajeet Bachhav is an instant selection for us in this docket of our unit. Samad Fallah follows him closely behind with the 9 wickets in the same number of matches to see us rope him in as well whilst Azim Kazi will be coming in as well to wrap up the trivalent of picks from the side.</p>
                            <p>Seven wicket man, Simarjeet Singh is our first name from Delhi with Subodh Bhati accompanying him for this encounter. The side are up against a Maharashtra side which has imbued in it names who have an innate and precarious ability at their disposal and if Delhi are going to win this one, they’ll be needing this duo to rise to the occasion and pick up wickets at crucial junctures.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Gaikwad will captain our side out for this encounter whilst we are selecting Bachhav as our vice-captain</p>
