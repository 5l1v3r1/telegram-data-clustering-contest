      <p>Attacks by Bashar Assad's forces in Syria and air raids by his ally Russia killed at least 21 civilians including eight children in Idlib province on Wednesday, a monitoring group said.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a ground-to-ground missile fired by regime forces that hit a makeshift camp for the displaced near Qah village close to the border with Turkey killed 15 civilians, including six children, and wounded around 40 others.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, "Russian military aircraft" targeted the town of Maaret al-Numan in the south of the province, it said, and "six civilians were killed, among them four children".</p>
      <p>A number of people were wounded in the raid, some "in a critical state", and the toll there was likely to rise, the Britain-based monitor's head Rami Abdel Rahman reported.</p>
      <p>The Assad regime also carried out mortar, gun, and rocket attacks in four villages of Idlib.<br/><br/>The death toll from the attacks on residential areas in the Idlib de-escalation zone over the last month totals 75, including 13 children, said the White Helmets.<br/><br/>Turkey and Russia agreed in September 2018 to turn Idlib into a de-escalation zone where acts of aggression are expressly prohibited.<br/><br/>The Syrian regime and its allies, however, have consistently broken the terms of the cease-fire, launching frequent attacks inside the zone.<br/><br/>The de-escalation zone is currently home to some four million civilians, including hundreds of thousands displaced in recent years by regime forces from throughout the war-weary country.<br/><br/>Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011, when the regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity.<br/><br/>Since then, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 10 million others displaced, according to U.N. officials.</p>
