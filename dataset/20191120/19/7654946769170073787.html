      <p>Dozens of volunteers fanned out across a New Jersey park Wednesday to search for a 25-year-old nanny who disappeared after a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/ex-boyfriend-of-missing-nj-woman-sent-her-angry-texts-on-night-she-disappeared/">fight with her ex-boyfriend</a>, according to a report.</p>
      <p>More than 170 volunteers flocked to Michael Tighe Park in Freehold Township to hunt for Stephanie Parze, who vanished on Oct. 30 — the same night she received a slew of curse-filled texts from former beau John Ozbilgen, <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2019/11/distraught-family-of-stephanie-parze-join-community-search-for-missing-25-year-old.html">according to nj.com</a> and past reports.</p>
      <p>“Time is of the essence when your little girl is missing,” her tearful dad, Edward Parze, told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Two other locations, which the family refused to disclose, were also being searched Wednesday based on tips from the community.</p>
      <p>Friends of Parze along with county fire officials and law enforcement officers — some from as far away as Baltimore — helped with the search, Parze told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Volunteers gathered around a wooded section of the park at around 10:30 a.m. to start looking for Parze, who disappeared <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-goes-missing-after-visit-to-psychic/">after a night out</a> at a New Brunswick comedy club with her mom and three sisters.</p>
      <p>Parze’s car and phone were found at her home in Freehold Township and she missed a nanny job scheduled for the next day, according to her family.</p>
      <p>Police later learned Ozbilgen — a 29-year-old stock broker — had fired off at least 10 texts and Facebook messages to her on Oct. 30, including ones fuming that she, “she always has to make their relationship suck” and calling her a “f–king c—t,” Monmouth<br/>County Assistant Prosecutor Caitlin Sidley has said.</p>
      <p>Detectives spotted marks around Ozbilgen’s neck when they were investigating Parze’s disappearance, Sidley said.</p>
      <p>In September, Parze filed a simple assault domestic violence complaint against Ozbilgen, who was arrested earlier this month on unrelated<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/missing-nj-womans-ex-charged-with-child-porn-eyed-in-her-disappearance/"> child pornography charges</a>.</p>
      <p>Police say he is a person of interest in Parze’s disappearance but he has not been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>Parze is a talented make-up artist who once worked at the European Wax Center in Freehold.</p>
