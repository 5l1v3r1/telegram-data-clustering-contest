      <h1>F.B.I. Sought to Interview Whistle-Blower in Ukraine Case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:08:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Goldman and Julian E. Barnes</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON — The F.B.I. sought last month to interview the whistle-blower who helped ignite the impeachment inquiry as a witness in an ongoing investigation, several people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>The interview never took place. It is not clear why agents wanted to talk to the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. analyst, or how interested they remain in speaking to him.</p>
      <p>The F.B.I. contacted lawyers for the whistle-blower and did not use his name in making the request. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/26/us/politics/whistle-blower-complaint.html?module=inline">The whistle-blower’s account</a> of the effort by President Trump, the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and administration officials to push Ukraine to pursue investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically became a road map for the House’s impeachment investigation and has been largely corroborated by subsequent testimony.</p>
      <p>The F.B.I. made clear to his lawyers that the whistle-blower was not the target of any ongoing investigations, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>The F.B.I. request could be a routine, “check-the-box” request, according to one person briefed on the request. But it also could be related to the more substantive issues about the Ukraine pressure campaign raised in the whistle-blower complaint, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-seeks-interview-with-cia-whistleblower-121637359.html">Yahoo News</a> first reported that the F.B.I. was seeking to speak with the whistle-blower.</p>
      <p>In August, after learning about the whistle-blower complaint, the Justice Department’s criminal division reviewed the whistle-blower complaint and found that there was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/us/politics/william-barr-trump-ukraine.html?module=inline">no violation of campaign finance laws.</a> The following month, as the complaint became public, the Justice Department announced that it had determined no further action was necessary on the complaint.</p>
      <p>Mr. Giuliani <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html?module=inline">is under scrutiny by federal prosecutors </a>in Manhattan, at least in part for his role in efforts to remove the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani was also a key player in the efforts to press Ukraine’s government to pursue the investigations sought by Mr. Trump in his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. They included investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a debunked theory about Ukrainians meddling in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>The F.B.I. might also have wanted to learn about threats made against the whistle-blower. The C.I.A. is providing protection to the whistle-blower, who is an agency employee continuing to work on intelligence matters.</p>
      <p>Still, the F.B.I. has not renewed its request to speak to the whistle-blower since it first asked several weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>Since the original F.B.I. request, the issue of interviewing the whistle-blower has become more fraught and entangled in partisan politics.</p>
      <p>House Republicans have demanded the chance to interview the whistle-blower as part of the impeachment inquiry, but Democrats have resisted, withdrawing an earlier request to speak to him. House Democrats believe there is no reason to call in the whistle-blower since his information was secondhand, and they now have sworn testimony from witnesses more directly involved in the July 25 call as well as people more directly involved in the pressure campaign on Kyiv.</p>
      <p>An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment. Andrew P. Bakaj, the lead attorney for the whistle-blower, also declined to comment but said that it remained critical for the identity of his client to be protected for his safety.</p>
      <p>Although the testimony in the impeachment hearings has centered on witnesses with more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump’s pressure campaign, the whistle-blower remains a central, but mysterious, figure. Republicans continue to press witnesses about whether they spoke to people who could be the whistle-blower.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bakaj has offered to have his client answer written questions from the committee.</p>
      <p>But House Republicans have continued to focus on the whistle-blower’s push to make the Ukraine pressure campaign public, as part of a larger effort to demonstrate partisan motivations. Republicans have suggested the whistle-blower was partisan because he was originally detailed to the White House under the Obama administration to work on Ukrainian affairs and was a registered Democrat.</p>
      <p>The whistle-blower has remained an obsession among right-wing media and Trump allies who have speculated about the analyst’s identity and political affiliation. Several right-wing websites have purported to identify the whistle-blower, but no mainstream media outlet or even top-tier conservative site has identified the officer who filed the complaint.</p>
      <p>Republicans have frequently noted that before filing his complaint, the whistle-blower met with a Democratic staff member of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>“The Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistle-blower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee,” Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who is the ranking member of the intelligence committee, said Wednesday. “They lied to the American people about that cooperation and refused to let us question the whistle-blower to discover the truth.”</p>
      <p>Democrats have said such charges are misleading and emphasized that the concerns raised in the whistle-blower’s complaint have been largely confirmed by other witness testimony in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bakaj reiterated his position that efforts to focus on the whistle-blower or reveal his identity reflect a “desperation to deflect from the substance of the whistle-blower complaint.”</p>
