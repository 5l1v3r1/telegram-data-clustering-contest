      <p>The role of the officials in implementing the right to information laws so as to make the administration transparent and strengthen the democratic institutions of the country was significant, said Vincent M. Paul, the State’s Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), here on Wednesday. He was speaking after inaugurating a one-day workshop on right to information. He said that the Right to Information Act was a tool against bureaucratic red-tapism.</p>
