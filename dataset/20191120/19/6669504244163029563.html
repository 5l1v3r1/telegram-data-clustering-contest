      <p>Wild Ambition Brewing has been open for less than a year but wants to expand its operation in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The brewery opened in the Mill Creek Industrial Park, off Sexsmith Road near Highway 97, last December with limited hours four days a week and limited serving options.</p>
      <p>An application was filed with the City of Kelowna yesterday, Nov. 19, to operate a lounge with room for 30 people indoors and 48 on an outdoor patio, and to operate seven days a week from 9 a.m. to midnight and to sell sandwiches and pastries.</p>
      <p>“We are not expecting the transition from our existing retail shop and tasting area to retail shop and lounge to be particularly dramatic,” states a letter accompanying the application by co-owner Theresa Cashen.</p>
      <p>“The existing serving limit of three 125 ml tasting pours disappoints our customers who would like the opportunity to sample more than three beers from our extensive beer list or have a larger serving of a single beer.”</p>
