      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> launched a vocal defense of explosive impeachment testimony against him from a notebook scrawled with black felt tip.</p>
      <p>The President of the United States read from his book – embossed with ‘Aboard Air Force One’ – as US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland accused him of corruption Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Trump was flanked by daughter and special adviser Ivanka, who kept a stony expression throughout.</p>
      <p>One page of the book was snapped by a photographer, and read: ‘I want nothing, I want nothing.</p>
      <p>‘I want no quid pro quo.</p>

      <p>‘This is the final word from the Pres of the US.’</p>
      <p>Trump used the notes as an aid while denying claims he’d made lawyer Rudy Giuliani press Ukraine to launch an investigation into his political rivals.</p>
      <p>The president reportedly wanted Ukraine’s newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky to probe Joe Biden’s son Hunter’s links to Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have pressed for a probe into alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election which he ended up winning.</p>

      <p>Conspiracy theories about that interference have already been debunked.</p>
      <p>Sondland further suggested that $400million in military aid the US promised Ukraine to guard itself from Russian aggression had been held up until Zelensky agreed to Giuliani’s terms.</p>
      <p>He claims that is the ‘quid pro quo’ – a favor for a favor – that proves Trump abused his office for personal gain.</p>
      <p>Trump also used Wednesday’s appearance to distance himself from Sondland, despite appointing the millionaire hotelier – who donated to his campaign – to the key ambassadorial role.</p>
      <p>The president said: ‘I don’t know him very well. this is not a man I know well. Seems like a nice guy.’ Prosecutor Ken Starr, who impeached then-President Bill Clinton in 1999, told Fox News Wednesday that he now believes Trump committed bribery, and that the president will be impeached.</p>

      <p>Trump spoke out amid fresh questions over his health after he paid an unexpected visit to the Walter Reed Medical Center National Military Medical Center on Saturday.</p>

      <p>White House spokesman Stephanie Grisham claimed it was part of the president’s annual medical.</p>
      <p>However, Barack Obama’s ex-doctor Dr David Scheiner told CNN he suspects the president may be suffering from a series of small strokes.</p>
      <p>Scheiner said: ‘These aren’t words, these are slips of the tongue.</p>
      <p>‘These are words he can’t find and this is happening over and over again.</p>

      <p>‘Comedians joke about it, but it’s not a joking matter. I think there is a neurological issue that is not being addressed.</p>
      <p>‘And if he’s having an MRI of his head over there, I would be very pleased because I think he needs it.’</p>
