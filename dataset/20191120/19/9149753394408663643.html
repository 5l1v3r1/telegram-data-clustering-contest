      <h1>Nvidia releases a GPU hotfix to address stalling in Red Dead Redemption 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:11:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>In response to complaints of Red Dead Redemption 2 hanging on some systems equipped with a GeForce <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-graphics-cards/">graphics card</a>, Nvidia has come out with a hotfix to address the issue. In addition, it is supposed to fix a crashing bug when playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider as well.</p>
      <p>Nvidia's GeForce hotfix driver version 441.34 is based on the "Game Ready" 441.20 WHQL driver that I wrote about last week. The release notes for that driver mentioned a few RDR2 quirks that were supposed to be fixed, but apparently there are some lingering bugs.</p>
      <p>Here are the release notes for the 441.34 hotfix:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[Red Dead Redemption 2] Vulkan: Stalling on some systems with 4-core and 6-core CPUs</li>
        <li>[Shadow of the Tomb Raider] Game may crash when launched in DX12 mode</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rockstar Games also references the hotfix in the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360038342293/RDR2-Title-Update-1-14-Notes-PS4-Xbox-One-PC">patch notes for its 1.14 update</a> to RDR2, and advises players with Nvidia graphics cards paired with a 4-core or 6-core CPU to install it.</p>
      <p>While it's nice that Nvidia has made this hotfix available, it might not be a cure all. Jarred says he is still seeing issues, post-hotfix, on his test system equipped with a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti and Core i7-8700K. So, if you are need of this hotfix, don't forget to toss a bit of salt over your shoulder. Barring that, perhaps a bit of retail therapy is in order. With <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> around the bend, you could use this as a faux excuse to upgrade to an 8-core CPU (though the onus is really on Nvidia to fix this issue).</p>
