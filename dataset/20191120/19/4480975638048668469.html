      <h1>FOMC minutes: Most policymakers said rate cut was warranted due to global weakness</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:02:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>According to the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) October 29-30 monetary policy meeting, most policymakers said the rate cut was appropriate while noting that it was warranted due to global weakness.</p>
      <p>Markets largely ignored the FOMC's meeting minutes and the US Dollar Index was last up 0.12% on the day at 97.95. Below are some key takeaways from the statement, as reported by Reuters.</p>
      <h3>Key excerpts from the minutes:</h3>
      <p>"Most <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> policymakers judged that after October 30 rate cut, policy level would be appropriate barring material reassessment of outlook."</p>
      <p>"A couple of policymakers said Fed should reinforce statement with communications that another rate cut unlikely without signs of significant slowdown."</p>
      <p>"Some policymakers favored keeping rates steady, arguing outlook was favorable and inflation expected to rise."</p>
      <p>"A couple of policymakers said they supported October 30 rate cut but it was a close call."</p>
      <p>"A few policymakers said reasons for cutting reinforced by proximity of fed funds rate to effective lower bound."</p>
      <p>"Several policymakers expressed concern some banks had reduced capital buffers when they should be rising."</p>
      <p>"Policymakers divided on inflation outlook; a few saw sub-2% for some time; some others said weakness temporary; a couple saw it over 2% in 2020 due to tariffs."</p>
      <p>"Policymakers discussed risks to economic outlook which remained tilted to the downside."</p>
      <p>"In a review of strategy, all policymakers said negative interest rates not an attractive tool; could reassess if warranted."</p>
