      <p>Apple has now released the official Smart Battery Case for the latest iPhone 11 series devices (iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max). The Smart Battery Case can extend the battery life of your iPhone by up to 50% and has a soft microfiber lining to protect your iPhone. And on the outside, the silky, soft-touch finish of the silicone exterior feels great in your hand. The Smart Battery Case also supports wireless charging and it is compatible with Qi-certified chargers. You can charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously.</p>
      <p>The case also comes with a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video.</p>
