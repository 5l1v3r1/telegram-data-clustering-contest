      <h1>Logan Paul files official appeal in KSI loss, CSAC springs into action</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:40:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) to the rescue!</p>
      <p>Despite insisting his loss to KSI was water under the bridge, YouTube sensation Logan Paul has in fact appealed his split-decision defeat from <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/9/20956173/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-official-salaries-both-youtube-stars-set-to-bank-900000-dazn-live-stream-results">their six-round celebrity boxing match</a> earlier this month inside Staples Center in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight because we just don’t believe that the outcome was right,” Paul said (via <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/logan-paul-officially-appeals-ksi-boxing-loss/">TMZ</a>). “The two-point deduction was the reason I full out split decision lost the fight. By no means am I afraid of losing, but I truthfully 100-percent believe I did not lose this fight.”</p>
      <p>Watch the fight video highlights <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/10/20957336/ksi-vs-logan-paul-2-full-fight-video-highlights-dazn-mma-ufc-boxing-youtube-results-stream-replay">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Paul was docked two points in the fourth round after scoring a knockdown for making illegal contact as KSI hit the canvas. Had the blonde bomber only lost one point for the controversial infraction, the adjusted scorecards would have altered the final outcome.</p>
      <p>Rest easy, fight fans, CSAC is on the case!</p>
