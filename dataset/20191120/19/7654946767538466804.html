      <h1>Sterling Shepard in familiar spot awaiting return to Giants</h1>

      <p>Sterling Shepard has been here before and experienced a setback.</p>
      <p>The Giants receiver is back at the point in the five-stage NFL concussion protocol where he has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/sterling-shepard-takes-big-step-with-giants-return-uncertain/">cleared to fully participate</a> in practice by team doctors but is awaiting the final OK from an independent neurologist to return to games.</p>
      <p>It was just three weeks ago that Shepard cleared even the last hurdle and then reported a return of concussion symptoms the next morning. He went to Pittsburgh to see medical experts soon after, as concern grew he might have to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/giants-have-a-really-hard-sterling-shepard-decision-to-make/">shut it down for the rest of the season</a> – or longer – for his own safety.</p>
      <p>Now Shepard, who missed one game with a concussion early this season and the last five with his second concussion, is in line to return Sunday against the Bears, barring another setback.</p>
      <p>The Giants have three others recovering from concussions: Janoris Jenkins is at the same stage in the protocol as Shepard, practicing fully but not independently cleared. Nate Solder participated in non-contact parts of practice Wednesday. Rhett Ellison did not practice.</p>
      <p>“You are in the protocol until you are not,” coach Pat Shurmur said. “A lot of times what happens is they get cleared at the end of the week [and practice] with the anticipation that they will be cleared.”</p>
