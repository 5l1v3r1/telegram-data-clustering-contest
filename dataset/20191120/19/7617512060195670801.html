      <p>A 70-year-old Lake Cowichan man was still missing on Wednesday night, four days after his kayak was found floating in the lake near Little Shaw Creek.</p>
      <p>Colin Court celebrated his birthday with family last Thursday, saying he planned to go fishing the next day. He was reported missing on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“This past Thursday, Colin turned 70 years old and had a birthday party with his family and was excited to be heading out fishing the next day,” his son, Bill Court, said on social media. “We understand that he went out fishing Friday morning at this Shaw Creek location and has not been seen [since] Thursday night.”</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Court’s truck was found parked at a campground at Cowichan Lake. RCMP were contacted after his kayak was found floating unattended near Little Shaw Creek, said B.C. RCMP media officer Cpl. Chris Manseau.</p>
      <p>The RCMP immediately began searching for Court, said Manseau.</p>
      <p>Lake Cowichan RCMP also called Cowichan Search and Rescue and Ladysmith Search and Rescue to assist in “an extensive search of the area.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Cowichan Search and Rescue suspended its search until further notice. The B.C. RCMP Underwater Recovery Team then swept the lake, but failed to locate the missing man.</p>
      <p>“Dive teams came and spent the day searching, with no luck,” said Bill Court.</p>
      <p>Lake Cowichan RCMP Cpl. David Motley said Wednesday that the area of Cowichan Lake in which Colin Court went missing is challenging because of the significant depth a short distance from shore.</p>
      <p>RCMP have not stopped looking, however, said Motley.</p>
      <p>Family and friends continued to search on Tuesday with drones as well as boats with depth sounders. They were out again on Wednesday, thankful for a dry break in the weather and plan to continue until they find him.</p>
      <p>Bill Court said his father is well-known in the area; people in the community, throughout the Island and from other provinces have offered support in various ways. “We’ve had phenomenal support from people all over. Our dad had lots of friends.”</p>
      <p>Bill Court praised the work of the RCMP and volunteers, suggesting any donations to help find his father should go to search and rescue organizations. “It’s a very trying time for everyone,” said Bill Court. He described his father as an avid fisherman and a “happy, kind and caring person” who goes out of his way to help others. “He’s known for his honesty and good nature.”</p>
      <p>Bill Court said he is thankful for the person who called the RCMP upon spotting his dad’s truck at the campground and then his kayak on the shoreline about 300 metres away.</p>
      <p>Lake Cowichan RCMP asked anyone with additional information to call 250-749-6668 or go to the Lake Cowichan RCMP office at 70 Stanley Rd., Lake Cowichan and reference police file 2019-2000.</p>
