      <p>Los Angeles - <b>Brooks Koepka</b> announced on Wednesday he is withdrawing from the <b>Presidents Cup</b> with a knee injury, with US captain <b>Tiger Woods</b> promptly selecting <b>Rickie Fowler</b> for the vacant spot.</p>
      <p>"Today, I am announcing my withdrawal from the US Presidents Cup Team because of my knee injury," Koepka said in a statement that was posted on the PGA Tour website.</p>
      <p>"I notified captain Tiger Woods that despite constant medical care and rehab, I am not able to play golf at this time. I consider it to be a high honour to be part of the 2019 team and I regret not being able to compete."</p>
      <p>World No 1 Koepka, who had stem cell treatment on his left knee after the Tour Championship, pulled out of the CJ Cup in South Korea after aggravating the injury when he slipped on a cart path.</p>
      <p>He said he had been in constant contact with Woods since then, but now realised he needed "more time to heal."</p>
      <p>Woods wasted no time in selecting Fowler to a third Presidents Cup team. Fowler was undefeated - winning three matches and halving one - in the United States' win over the International team in the 2017 edition of the match play showdown at Liberty National in New Jersey.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to Rickie and he has agreed to join the US Team," Woods said in comments posted on the tour website.</p>
      <p>"Rickie has played on a couple Presidents Cup teams, was someone seriously considered for a pick and is well respected and liked by his team-mates."</p>
      <p>The United States will take on the International team captained by Ernie Els at Royal Melbourne from December 12-15.</p>
