      <p><a href="https://www.concisenews.global/news">Babcock University</a>, Ilishan-Remo, Ogun State, has described a viral sex tape of ex-students as a “sad commentary on the moral decadence that has assailed our society at large”.</p>
      <p>It added that it is a manner of behaviour that is alien and unethical to the values of the University.</p>
      <p>Social media users were shocked Wednesday morning when a leaked video of two young persons having sex surfaced on the internet. It got people talking with many condemning the act.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a statement later on Wednesday obtained by Concise News, Joshua Suleiman, Director, Communication &amp; Marketing, Babcock University, said that the young man and lady in the video were ex-students of the school.</p>
      <p>According to him, while the boy in the video was expelled by the University in February this year after investigations and due process proved he was into certain grievous misconduct which the school has zero tolerance for, his girlfriend in the same video was, until the video broke out, a third year student of accounting in the University.</p>
      <p>Suleiman said that after due process, she was promptly expelled from the university for violating its rules.</p>
      <p>He said that where the act took place according to the girl’s written statement was at St Bridget Hospital Abeokuta, Ogun State where the boy has been undergoing rehabilitation for different destructive addictions.</p>
      <p>“According to the girl, the incident took place in April this year during school vacation, when she visited the boy at the hospital. The act did not take place in the University,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>The University said that it remains committed to highest moral standards, and will remain a standard bearer for quality education in character, learning and service to humanity.</p>
      <p>It also adds, “We are happy to be saddled with this challenge as an institution because it propels us to contribute to the greatness of this nation, and the security of bright future for our children”.</p>
