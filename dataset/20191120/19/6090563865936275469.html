      <p>The Bulawayo City Council (BCC) water crisis has worsened with the local authority revising weekly water shedding hours from 72 hours to 92 hours.</p>
      <p>Last month the council increased weekly water shedding hours from 48 to 72. </p>
      <p>In a statement yesterday, Bulawayo Town Clerk Mr Christopher Dube said the new shedding schedule comes into effect on Monday.</p>
      <p>He warned that high lying areas are likely to be affected beyond the scheduled times.</p>
      <p>“The City of Bulawayo would like to advise members of public of the review of the current 72-hour weekly water shedding programme to 96 with effect from Monday 25 November 2019. The programme is being reviewed in a bid to stabilise the reservoirs and prevent them from depleting further. It is further being implemented in a bid to raise the raw water reservoir level to a comfortable buffer level of 5,5 metres. The current level of 0,76 metres (14 percent) is not safe for the city given the high demand being experienced,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Dube said the water shedding programme is subject to change if the raw water reservoir level improves or deteriorates beyond the critical level. </p>
      <p>“All the areas that are on high ground and are affected for more than 96 hours will be supplied with water by  council bowsers,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Dube said Zesa power cuts and increase in the water consumption levels have worsened the situation.</p>
