      <h1>Overwatch Voice Actors Hit BlizzCon Cosplaying as Their Characters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:05:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Back in March, <a href="https://cosplay.kotaku.com/when-an-overwatch-voice-actor-cosplays-as-her-overwatch-1833251462">we ran a little feature on Carolina Ravassa, the voice actor behind Sombra who spent a day cosplaying as the <i>Overwatch </i>hacker</a>. That was at Katsucon, but for BlizzCon 2019, she was joined by two other cast members, Anjali Bhimani (Symmetra) and Matthew Mercer (McCree).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mjasmine.design/">Cosplayer Melanie Jasmine</a> (below, left) made Ravassa and Bhimani’s outfits, while the incredible <a href="https://www.instagram.com/keltonfx/?hl=en">Kelton FX</a> – <a href="https://cosplay.kotaku.com/overwatch-cosplay-from-another-universe-1830086563">whose own <i>Overwatch </i>work we featured earlier in the year</a> – handled their prosthetics and make-up.</p>
      <p>As for that <i>other </i>guy not in costume, that’s Zenyatta’s voice actor Feodor Chin, just hangin’ out with some friends, maybe not feeling like spending the whole weekend wearing armour and floating around everywhere.</p>
