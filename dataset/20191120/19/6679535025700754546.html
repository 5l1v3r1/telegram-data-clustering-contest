      <p>Members of the Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Ernakulam, have made a fervent appeal for posting traffic police personnel in front of the school during the school opening and closing hours.</p>
      <p>The school, located at the busy crossroads leading to Ernakulam South railway station, witnesses heavy traffic in the morning and evening hours.</p>
      <p>“Especially after 3 p.m., students have to negotiate nightmarish traffic to board buses that more-often-than-not do not stop at the designated bus stop. There’s a tremendous increase in passenger traffic in the area thanks to Kochi Metro’s South station becoming fully operational. It’s all too commonplace for private buses to halt further ahead of the bus stop, accelerate forward even before the students board and to overtake from the left. This leads to accidents. While the police have posted their personnel in front of private educational institutions during peak traffic hours, repeated appeals made for a similar arrangement in front of this government-run school, where students from not-so-well-off families study, have fallen on deaf ears,” Shibu P. Chacko and Sumy Joy Oliapuram, PTA presidents in the higher secondary and upper primary sections, said.</p>
