      <p>NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- The Postal Service kicked off the 107th year of its iconic Operation Santa program Wednesday at the James A. Farley Post Office Building in Midtown.</p>
      <p>The goal of the campaign is to give kids who may not be able to otherwise the happy holiday they deserve.</p>
      <p>Started in 1912, Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock authorized local Postmasters to allow postal employees and citizens to respond to the letters, a program that eventually became known as Operation Santa.</p>
      <p>To celebrate 107 years, the USPS launched a <a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/">new Operation Santa website</a> that features letters from children across the country.</p>
      <p>To mark the event, second grade students from a local school participated in letter-writing and singing festive songs after special excerpts from letters written to Santa were read.</p>
      <p>Letter-writing kits were also being passed out in post offices across the boroughs.</p>
      <p><b>Letters for Operation Santa can be sent to:</b><br/>Santa Claus<br/>123 Elf Road<br/>North Pole 88888</p>
