      <h1>Egyptian man builds eco-friendly home using only recycled material</h1>

      <p>Taymour El-Hadidi grew increasingly wary of Cairo's clustered buildings and its alternatives in gated communities around the capital, so he brought to reality a dream of his own -- a house made entirely from recycled material.</p>
      <p>When he first started the project four years ago, Hadidi did not envisage how the building would look like. Now, the two-storey exquisite installation in the greater Cairo city of Sheikh Zayed stands witness to years of hard work and innovation.</p>
      <p>Specialised in business administration, Hadidi had no professional background in engineering or construction. He only wanted to implement his environmentally friendly idea when he started looking for a house following his marriage in 2012.</p>
      <p>Unable to find a suitable home, he gathered a small team of creative workers including builders, electricians, carpenters and painters, who helped him make his dream come true on a piece of land he owns.</p>
      <p>He collected discarded concrete blocks, red bricks and glass bottles to build the house walls, ceiling, and even beds. A recycled loader tyre that he turned into a window stands out as a centrepiece in his house.</p>
      <p>The building material was almost for free, but the bills for skilled craftsmanship had cost him nearly two million Egyptian pounds ($124,000), he said.</p>
      <p>He hoped that young Egyptians struggling to find suitable housing would follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>Egypt's government plans to pour tens of thousands of new housing units onto the market in each of the next few years, in a bid to reduce crowding in Egypt's congested cities and provide homes for the poor.</p>
      <p>But many analysts say the new residences are priced way beyond the means of most Egyptians and a good share of them will remain unsold.</p>
      <p>The government is undeterred, however, and moving full steam ahead on a new capital city 50 km east of Cairo, a project that will be designed to deliver 240,000 new housing units over the next five years.</p>
