      <p>A woman has shared a genius hack that makes de-icing your car at 7am slightly more bearable.</p>
      <p>There's little worse than having to get up even earlier in the mornings to defrost your car and make it to work on time.</p>
      <p>But, one clever motorist has come up with a cheap way to defrost your windscreen instantly - and it's really easy, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/money-saving/genius-hack-melts-windscreen-ice-17281072">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Posting a video and some photographs on Facebook, Angela Hickling wrote: "I'm a genius. Get yourself one of these bottles, fill it with warm water and you're sorted. No cold hands scraping anymore and it cleans your window screen too, the brush bit is ideal. Off to work now, have a great day people."</p>
      <p>The post quickly went viral, with over 3,400 people sharing it on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>"You are a genius," responded one Facebook user.</p>

      <p>Another said: "Nope, I would have never thought have that! honestly gonna buy one just for that reason."</p>
      <p>"That's amazing. I need some more of that so I will save the bottle after lol," wrote somebody else.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Angela revealed how she had come up with the savvy idea.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was just looking through my boyfriend's cupboard to find some sort of gadget as I really didn't want my fingers freezing off, and saw the bottle. I had a light bulb moment.. filled it with warm water and it worked perfectly. I was so happy."</p>

      <p>She added: "As you can see on the video it worked instantly, I didn't even need all the water in the bottle."</p>
      <p>To replicate the hack, you'll just need to buy yourself a bottle of Dr Beckmann Carpet Stain Remover.</p>
      <p>The cheapest one we can find is currently  <a href="https://fave.co/343o4I5">£2.80 from Wilko</a>  - though once you've bought it you'll be able to use it time and time again.</p>
      <p>Make sure you've emptied it and thoroughly rinsed it before using it on your car.</p>
      <p>Then you'll just need to fill it with warm water and watch the ice melt away. Don't use boiling water as it might crack your car windscreen. </p>
