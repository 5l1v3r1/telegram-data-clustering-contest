      <p>It seems that <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/nicki-minaj-will-be-honored-with-billboards-game-changer-award-341491/">congratulations are in order for rapper Nicki Minaj</a>! The Shade Room reveals that Young Money just said that Nicki is the very first artist in history to have hit number 1 in all of Billboard’s Hip-Hop/R&amp;B, Pop, Dance/Electric, Raggae, Gospel and Latin charts.</p>
      <p>People were happy for the queen, and the Barbz made sure to praise her. On the other hand, some other followers seemed shocked that Nicki is associated with gospel.</p>
