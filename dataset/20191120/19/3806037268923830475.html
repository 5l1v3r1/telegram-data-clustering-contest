      <h1>Uber May Begin Recording Audio During Rides</h1>
      <h2>For safety purposes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:49:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Rouse</a></address>
      <p>According to reports, rideshare app <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/uber">Uber</a> will begin recording audio during rides in the United States as a new safety precaution. The initiative will be pushed as a new feature which will inform riders that their ride may be recorded.</p>
      <p>The feature is slated to be tested in cities in Brazil and Mexico in December and will share recordings with the police upon their request, according to <i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-safety/uber-to-let-passengers-record-rides-in-effort-to-curb-crime-in-latin-america-idUSKBN1XG33I">Reuters</a></i>. The move comes following <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/uber-investigation-department-liability-info">several reports throughout the years of sexual assault</a> during Uber rides, which has resulted in several lawsuits against the company.</p>
      <p>Reports state neither riders nor drivers will be able to listen to these recordings and will be encrypted for privacy purposes. Following their trip, customers will be able to immediately report a safety incident and send their recording to Uber support, who will then look into the situation. Uber has yet to make a comment. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/5/uber-panic-button-dial-911">The company has also recently launched a panic button</a> for customers in the United States as another precautionary measure.</p>
      <p>In other Uber news, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/new-jersey-fines-uber-driver-classification-info">the company was recently fined $650 million USD for classifying drivers as independent contractors</a>.</p>
