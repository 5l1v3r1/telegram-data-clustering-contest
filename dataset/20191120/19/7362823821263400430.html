      <h1>Stephen Colbert, in New Zealand, says he misses feeling proud of his country</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/stephen-colbert">Comedian Stephen Colbert</a> has said he misses being proud of the United States while filming part of his "Late Show" in Wellington, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/new-zealand">New Zealand.</a></p>
      <p>In one segment, Colbert was riding around on a "crocodile bike" with actors Lucy Lawless and Bret McKenzie when he asked them whether they were proud of their country. When they said they were, Colbert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlI4IIVTA5Y">said</a>: "I miss that feeling."</p>

      <p>Colbert's comments were likely a jab at President Trump, whose administration he frequently criticizes.</p>

      <p>The segment, broadcast on Tuesday's show, came as Congress held public <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment</a> hearings over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump's</a> phone call with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">Ukraine</a> on July 11.</p>
      <p>Colbert has maintained that he's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/stephen-colbert-insists-hes-not-part-of-the-resistance">not part of</a> the anti-Trump "resistance" but said he would not invite the president on his show. In 2018, he also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/stephen-colbert-donald-trump-hurricane-florence-north-carolina">released a book</a> mocking President Trump's response to Hurricane Florence.</p>
      <p>While the comedian has been especially critical of the current administration, he's also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/colbert-bernie-sanders">brought up</a> uncomfortable aspects of Democrats' health care proposals. He asked both <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,</a> whether they would raise taxes to pay for "Medicare-for-All" when they appeared on his program.</p>

      <p>"Will their taxes go up?" Colbert pressed Warren in September. "But, here's the thing," Warren began in response.</p>
      <p>"But, here's the thing," Colbert grinningly interrupted. "I've listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion to you that you might defend the taxes perhaps that you’re not mentioning in your sentence."</p>
      <p>The former "Colbert Report" host also <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/biden-defends-himself-while-pressed-by-colbert-about-his-gaffes-i-dont-get-things-wrong-like-locking-kids-in-cages">asked</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">former Vice President Joe Biden</a> if he was "going nuts" amid a series of gaffes on the campaign trail.</p>
