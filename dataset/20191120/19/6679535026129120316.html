      <p>PMK founder Dr. S. Ramadoss on Monday urged the Central government to reassess its position and declare Keeladi a ‘protected archaeological site’.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said Union Minister Prahlad Singh Patel had said in the Parliament that though the Central government had no idea of declaring Keeladi a protected archaelogical site, it was planning to open a museum and expand the site.</p>
      <h3>‘15,000 artefacts’</h3>
      <p>“It is easier to take over lands in the area by declaring it a protected archaeological site. The excavation is happening in a small area of the land in Keeladi. In the five-phase excavations, only 110 pits have been excavated. But around 15,000 artefacts have been obtained. There has been a lot of difference between various artefacts,” said Dr. Ramadoss.</p>
      <p>H Ramadoss said the Keeladi excavations must be expanded and a extravagant museum should be built in the area.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Wednesday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Ministers Vijayabaskar and M.C. Sampath met Dr. Ramadoss, who was admitted to a city hospital and inquired about his health.</p>
