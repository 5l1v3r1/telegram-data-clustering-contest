      <h1>Dramatic finale for John McPhee in Moto3</h1>
      <h2>Scots rider John McPhee crashed out of the last race of the 2019 Moto3 championship in Spain but was fortunately unhurt. Back in the UK, Ashleigh Morris enjoyed MSN Circuit Rally success and the Scottish Borders Hill Rally provided plenty of challenges.</h2>

      <p>IT WAS a weekend of thrills and a few too many spills for Scots as John McPhee tumbled out of the last race of the Moto3 season in Valencia, Spain.</p>
      <p>The Oban rider was fighting at the front end of the pack after a restart when another bike crashed in front of him. With nowhere to go, John ended up in a four-bike collision, but luckily walked away with no injuries.</p>
      <p>It was a disappointing way to end the season, but John, pictured above right, finished fifth overall in the Moto3 Championship and helped Honda secure the Constructors’ Championship.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s an unfortunate end to a strong season because the crash was out of my control, but there are plenty of strong points to focus on from the weekend.</p>

      <p>“We are happy to be fifth in the championship and to have achieved a lot this year. We’ve learned a lot that will help us start next season even stronger, and I need to say a massive thanks to the team for all their hard work this year and for helping me grow as a rider. My focus is already on 2020.”</p>
      <p>Gordon Shedden also endured a tough weekend at Macau in the World Touring Car Series. Keen for a strong performance in an otherwise forgettable season, Gordon crashed his Audi RS3 LM during the Friday qualifying session and the car was too damaged to continue in any of the weekend’s races.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Flash was unhurt in the incident, but he was clearly disappointed at the outcome and said: “I feel terrible for the team as the car was going well and we were pushing for a much higher grid position than we’ve had recently. It’s a tough break but we just have to move on to the next round.”</p>
      <p>There was much better news for Ashleigh Morris and co-driver Jamie Mactavish. The Scots duo took their Ford Fiesta R200 to third in class and a very respectable 20th overall in the Cadwell Park round of the MSN Circuit Rally Championship.</p>

      <p>Ashleigh said: “It was misty and damp but we’re delighted with this finish and one of our best results to date. Jamie did a great job of pushing me on and the car ran perfectly, so a big thanks to the team.”</p>
      <p>A very different form of rallying was the Scottish Borders Hill Rally over 110 miles of rough terrain. Justin Birchall and Mason Kershaw emerged victorious after two long days of stages in their Lofthouse Prototype M3.</p>
      <p>The top Scots were David Brose and Graeme Morrison in a Land Rover in sixth position and first in Class B3, while Alistair Morton and Craig Lindsay finished 10th in their Polaris RZR XP Turbo for the Class C5 win. George Bryson and Wallace McKay took the Class E7 victory in their Kirkland Prototype.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Perth’s Rory Skinner has been confirmed as one of the riders for the Integro Team for the 2020 British Supersport Championship. Rory will ride the team’s title-winning Yamaha YZF-R6 bike next season.</p>

      <p>He said: “It’s great to be chosen by such a proven team with a well-developed bike. It means I can concentrate on refining my technique and racecraft next season.”</p>
      <p>Before then, Colin Noble and Tony Wells begin their 2019/20 Asian Le Mans Series campaign at the Shanghai International Circuit, China, in their Norma M30 this weekend.</p>
      <p>There’s also action in Scotland as the Roger Albert Clark Rally heads into Dumfries and Galloway on Sunday as part of this three-day event.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of Scots driver at the helm of classic Ford Escorts, as well as Alan McMorran in a Chrysler Avenger, Colin Smith in his Vauxhall Astra and Charles Campbell in a Davrian Mk8.</p>
