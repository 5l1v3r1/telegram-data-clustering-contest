      <h1>2020 Kia Niro Debuts In LA With Updated Styling And Tech</h1>
      <h2>Even Kia thought it was hard to improve a winning formula.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:25:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Kia has officially unveiled its updated <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/niro-hybrid">2020 Niro hybrid</a> at the 2019 LA Auto Show and though it is not a complete redesign, this mid-life refresh does a nice job of adding much-needed exterior styling improvements, one of the biggest complaints with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/niro">2019 Niro</a>. Kia focused specifically on giving this popular compact hybrid crossover new projector-type headlights and fog lights, a new diamond-pattern grille, and dual chevron-shaped LED daytime running lights.</p>
      <p>It's a bolder look than before though the Niro's overall silhouette and exterior dimensions remain unchanged. At the rear end, however, you'll find new LED lights with what's described as a "more technological appeal than before." Notice that the rear faux skid plate is wider and more pronounced than it was previously. There are also new 16- and 18-inch alloy wheel designs.</p>

      <p>The interior features a new display Kia claims is now more streamlined. It includes an updated 7-inch instrument cluster and an 8-inch touchscreen. Navigation with a 10.25-inch screen and a Harman/Kardon premium audio system are optional. For those who desire them, paddle shifters can be optioned as well, which Kia says will offer a sportier driving experience.</p>
      <p>Active regenerative braking control, electronic parking brake, and mood lighting with a total of six unique colors for a groovy-looking interior are additional options. Safety remains a top priority, so Kia continues to equip the Niro with its full safety suite of Kia Drive Wise Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.</p>

      <p>For 2020, two more features have been added to that: Lane Following &amp; Lane Keeping Assist and High Beam Assist. What has not changed is powertrain, as the 1.6-liter inline-four connected to a hybrid system returns, as does the six-speed automatic transmission which sends power to the front wheels. The 2020 Kia Niro Plug-in Hybrid, however, will apparently debut at a later date, but the automaker claims it will receive the same exact changes as the Niro Hybrid. Nothing was mentioned about the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/niro-ev">Kia Niro EV</a>.</p>
      <p>Both the 2020 Kia Niro and 2020 Kia Niro PHEV will go on sale in early 2020. Pricing will be announced at around that time.</p>
