      <p>The victory of Gotabaya Rajapaksa in the Sri Lankan elections has not come as a surprise to me.As one who had lived in Sri Lanka for more than 10 years as an expatriate banker during the real problem days, Sri Lankaâ€™s path over the years has been interesting. The Easter Sunday bombings did play a major role in a return of fear and perhaps resulted in the desire for a strong leader. Perhaps, in these circumstances, people chose to have a strongman rather than backing a sober, people-oriented democrat.</p>

      <p>It remains to be seen how Mr. Rajapaksa will address the concerns, worst apprehensions and fears of the minorities, which was reflected in their vote against him. They cannot be ignored. His declaration that he will be President for all Sri Lankans gives some room for comfort and hope. But it is of paramount importance that he walks the talk to the hilt. New Delhi has its task cut out in dealing with the return of the Rajapaksa regime.</p>
