      <p>Just this past summer, Kia revealed in India <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/say-hello-to-the-stylish-2020-kia-seltos">a new crossover called the Seltos</a>. Now it's not only confirmed that it's coming to America, but brought it to the LA Auto Show to display the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/seltos">Seltos</a> as part of its growing lineup of crossover SUVs for the North American market.</p>
      <p>Arriving as a 2021 model, the Seltos slots between the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/soul">Soul</a> and the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/sportage">Sportage</a> – not only in size, but also in terms of style, blurring the line between upright and boxy on the one hand and dynamic and strealined on the other.</p>

      <p>The subcompact crossover is closely related to (but slightly larger than) the Hyundai Kona, and arrives Stateside in five trim levels, with two engine options and the choice of front- or all-wheel drive. The base 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine provides 146 horsepower and 132 lb-ft of torque and comes mated to a continuously variable transmission. Though smaller, the 1.6-liter four-pot is turbocharged to deliver a (relatively) more ample 175 hp and 195 lb-ft, and comes with a dual-clutch transmission. Both versions ride on a MacPherson front setup, but front-drive models get a torsion beam rear axle while all-wheel-drive models get a multilink rear suspension.</p>

      <p>Buyers will also be able to choose (depending on the trim level selected) between 17- an 18-inch alloys, and select from options including a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, 8-speaker Bose audio system (a first for Kia), and a smattering of other infotainment and drive-assistance technologies, with prices starting below $22,000.</p>
      <p>All versions come with a flexible rear-seat setup that allows rear passengers to recline or fold the rear bench flat for added cargo space – an innovative feature for such a small crossover that's sure to attract its fair share of customers once it goes on sale early in the new year ahead.</p>
