      <h3>Taza Ayurveda Nourish Eladi Body Oil</h3>
      <h4>THE PROMISE:</h4>
      <p>For more than 5,000 years, Ayurveda has been a natural source for healing. With roots in India, the wellness practice is a distinct departure from western medicine; it encourages holistic healing through intentional daily habits for a balanced body, mind, and spirit. Taza Ayurveda co-founders Divya Viswanathan (who was born in India and grew up practicing Ayurveda) and Amy Engel (who discovered the healing power of Ayurveda as an adult dealing with stress) met in business school and have been on a quest since to create thoughtful, Ayurvedic science–backed products, including <a href="https://www.tazaayurveda.com/shop-online/nourish-kumkumadi-nighttime-facial-oil">facial oil</a> ($165), <a href="https://www.tazaayurveda.com/shop-online/nourish-eladi-body-oil">body oil</a> ($90), and <a href="https://www.tazaayurveda.com/shop-online/nourish-gandharvahastadi-digestive-supplement">digestive supplements</a> ($60). The aim: Make you feel good on the inside and out.</p>
      <p>The body oil is my favorite. It's made of 34 highly therapeutic ingredients, according to the brand, like Indian frankincense, pearl powder, and Himalayan cedar. The potent, pure ingredients will soothe all skin types and provide hydration that lingers for hours. The formula is so gentle that even babies can wear it.</p>
      <h4>WHY I'M OBSESSED:</h4>
      <p>You're either a lotion or a body oil person—I'm the latter. The sensorial experience of slowly lathering an oil on my skin is like therapy for me. It's made me a nighttime shower person. I light my candles, turn on music, and start my bedtime beauty rituals—oiling my body up is secretly my favorite step. Starting at my toes (yes, I give myself a thorough foot massage every night and I implore you to try it because it'll change your life), I work my way up being sure to leave no inch untouched. We all need to show our bodies a little more love, instead of always putting our faces first.</p>
      <p>Implementing this oil into my nighttime routine has been such a necessary moment of calm to end my stressful days. But Taza Ayurveda has actually made my mornings better as well: The oil comes with Rudraksha beads and mini book of meditations, included because "according to ancient tradition, each bead signifies one Mantra or positive affirmation." I've been wearing the bracelet and practicing affirmations during my daily commute. This is the first Ayurvedic beauty product I've tried, and let me tell you, I'm a believer.</p>
