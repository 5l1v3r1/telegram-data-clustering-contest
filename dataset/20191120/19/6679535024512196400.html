      <p>Water samples were lifted for testing from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), after a patient died following a sudden bout of vomiting and four others have been undergoing treatment for fever.</p>
      <p>A patient, who was at the institute for nearly 10 years, died following sudden vomiting and drop in pulse rate.</p>
      <p>“Patients from IMH are regularly admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) for different ailments and conditions such as seizures,” a hospital authority said. “Four patients from ward 5 are undergoing treatment for fever. There is no cholera outbreak on the campus. We have also sent water samples for testing,” he added.</p>
