      <p>The rumors we heard a couple weeks back were proven to be true today – the Huawei Nova 6 5G is coming on December 5th.

      <p>Huawei’s Nova 6 5G launch date has been confirmed by the Chinese phone maker in a teaser on Weibo. On the social, we can indeed find the image above, stating the device will be unveiled the 5th of December.</p>
      <p>The Nova 6 5G, as the name suggest, will be featuring 5G network support. This is possible due to the adoption of Huawei’s latest Kirin 990 chipset. The CPU does indeed integrate a 5G modem along with its flagship-grade performance.</p>

      <p>The smartphone will also be equipping a pill-shaped punch-hole design, within which we find two front cameras. Additionally, we also know one of the two cameras will boast an ultra wide-angle lens.</p>
      <p>Design wise, the Nova 6 5G should feature very slim bezels on top and sides, a high screen to body ratio and according to rumors also a side-placed fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>As we previously mentioned, the Huawei Nova 6 5G is officially coming in the first days of December; which is around six months after the launch of the Nova 5 series. A smartphone that took many of the features of Huawei flagship phones such as the high-end cameras and the Kirin 980 CPU and brought them to a lower price tag. Will it be the same for the Nova 6 series? We definitely hope so.</p>
