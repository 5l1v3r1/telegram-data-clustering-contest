      <h1>Olivier Giroud's demands too high for Inter Milan?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a> are currently against meeting the demands of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/chelsea/"><b>Chelsea</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/olivier-giroud/"><b>Olivier Giroud</b></a>, according to a report.</h2>

      <p>After falling down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, Giroud is expected to sign for a new club during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Inter are currently regarded as the World Cup winner's most likely destination due to the player having previously worked with head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-conte/"><b>Antonio Conte</b></a>.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>La Gazzetta dello Sport</i>, the Italian giants are some way from agreeing terms with the 33-year-old.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Giroud would need to take a pay cut in order to secure a switch to San Siro.</p>
      <p>The France international is also said to be keen on receiving a two-and-a-half year deal, 12 months longer than Inter are prepared to offer the frontman.</p>
