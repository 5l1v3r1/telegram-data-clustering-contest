      <h1>Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo, Colin Jost’s Fiancée to Visit <i>SNL</i> in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:41:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Megh Wright</a></address>
      <p>Just a few days before <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/snl-will-ferrell-beck-bennett-promo.html">Will Ferrell returns to host <i>SNL</i></a><i> </i>for its pre-Thanksgiving episode, the show has finally revealed the full lineup of hosts and musical guests for December. In a press release, <i>SNL </i>announced today that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/hustlers-movie-review-jennifer-lopez-is-a-star.html"><i>Hustlers </i>star Jennifer Lopez</a> will host the show for the third time on December 7, and she’ll be joined by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/dababy-kirk-album-review.html">musical guest DaBaby</a>. Following that, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/scarlett-johansson-says-she-has-the-right-to-play-any-person.html">Scarlett Johansson</a> — currently promoting <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/marriage-story-movie-review-noah-baumbach-divorce.html"><i>Marriage Story</i></a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/jojo-rabbit-movie-review-taika-waititi-as-hitler.html"><i>Jojo Rabbit</i></a>,<i> </i>and her <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/scarlett-johansson-and-colin-jost-are-engaged.html">recent engagement to <i>SNL </i>co–head writer Colin Jost</a><i> — </i>will host for the sixth (!) time on December 14, and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/review-niall-horans-album-flicker.html">Niall Horan</a> will perform as musical guest. As for the Christmas episode on December 21, <i>SNL</i> announced before the start of the season that former<i> </i>cast member <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/snl-season-45-premiere-date-hosts-eddie-murphy.html">Eddie Murphy would return to host the show</a>, but the musical guest had not been revealed until now: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/best-songs-2019.html">Lizzo</a>. Here’s hoping that when <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/eddie-murphy-snl-host-characters.html">Murphy stars in a new “Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood” sketch</a>, Lizzo offers to perform a very 2019 version of the theme song.</p>
