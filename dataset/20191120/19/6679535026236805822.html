      <p>She battled the odds to beat cancer. On Wednesday, Avani S.S.’s twin successes in the Kathakali Sangeetham and Malayalam recitation events in the high school category at the Revenue District School Arts Festival were a fitting reply to an illness that last year looked to debilitate her.</p>
      <p>It was in November last year that the disease was diagnosed. With treatment under way, Avani, a student of Government HSS, Venjaramoodu, could not take part in the sub-district arts festival last year. This year, she is compensating for the missed opportunity.</p>
      <h3>Scholarship</h3>
      <p>She has also received a scholarship of the Centre for Cultural Resources and Training. It was in the middle of her treatment that she travelled to New Delhi to present a concert for the scholarship. Learning classical music for the past eight years, Avani also presents programmes in Suraj Venjaramoodu’s stage shows.</p>
