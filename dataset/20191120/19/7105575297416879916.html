      <h3>Do a Book Exchange</h3>
      <p>Ever heard of the saying, “The best gift you can give someone is a book?” If not, consider this your gift-giving lesson of the day. Grab your favorite book (okay, maybe not your *favorite*), or a book you really enjoyed, and exchange it with one from your friend's collection. You’ll both get an idea of what genres you enjoy, and maybe next year you can <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g13793811/best-gifts-for-book-lovers/">buy them a new one</a> as a low-budget present.</p>

      <h3>Package Holiday Ingredients in a Jar</h3>
      <p>When you're not exactly skilled in the cooking department (or just don't have the time to whip up treats for Christmas) you can package some surplus ingredients into a giftable treat jar. Consider giving a mason jar filled with hot chocolate ingredients, a pretty five-bean soup mix, or oatmeal.</p>

      <h3>Record an Audiobook</h3>
      <p>A more personalized gift for audiophiles, or for your partner in a long-distance relationship, is an audiobook created by yours truly. Read some original poems or even chapters from their favorite books for this personal tribute.</p>

      <h3>Make a Calendar</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Rifle Paper Co., $26</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://riflepaperco.com/2020-wild-rose-appointment-calendar">BUY IT</a>
      </p>
      <p>Want to design a beautiful, custom calendar for a friend, family member, or S.O.? To get crafting, all you'll need to do is grab some extra computer paper from your printer and colored pencils. Tie it together with any leftover ribbon you have from gift-wrapping, and it'll be the perfect addition to their home as we approach the new year.</p>
      <p>(Note: If you’re totally in love with the calendar in this picture and are able to spare some extra cash, we've included a link to shop above *just* in case.)</p>

      <h3>Make a Sugar Scrub</h3>
      <p>While we wish every day was a spa day, you can give some TLC with a <a href="https://wellnessmama.com/3628/sugar-scrub/">homemade sugar scrub.</a> It takes under 10 minutes to make, and all it takes is two simple ingredients: granulated sugar and olive oil.</p>

      <h3>Prepare a Veggie Basket</h3>
      <p>If your well-stocked garden is your pride and joy, wrap up the literal fruits of your labor with a hand-selected basket of fresh goodies—from veggies to fruits or jams—for your foodie recipients to cook with on their own time (peas, potatoes, swiss chard, carrots, and asparagus are top picks for winter vegetable gardens, FWIW) .</p>

      <h3>Offer Flower Bulbs</h3>
      <p>Winter's a better season than ever to gift someone a budding bulb and it's an easy present for beginners to green-thumb gurus to use. You can either pluck them from your garden or source them for cheap from your local nursery, and the bulbs can grow anywhere in a garden where the ground is cool and the soil drains well.</p>

      <h3>Get The Knitting Needles Out</h3>
      <p>Your mom was always the OG on this one, but we have to give it to her: Nothing beats a hand-knitted or crocheted winter accessory (well, so long as it's tasteful). Gauge what your giftee's favorite colors are and then put in the time on a pair of soft woolen socks or a scarf. The only real expense here is the wool, but you can always shop budget options that will save you money on the real thing.</p>

      <h3>Offer to House-Sit</h3>
      <p>Whether they're wrangling a puppy or taking care of a child at home, offer your sitting services by gifting them a night out on the town or a weekend away without having to book a sitter.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Personal Cleaning Services</h3>
      <p>There's no better way to show appreciation for a hard-working parent than gifting an all-over house cleaning as a little stocking stuffer with whatever else you've got up your sleeve. Especially as the holidays get more hectic, the 'rents will appreciate you letting them put their feet up a bit and relax while you take care of the cleaning.</p>

      <h3>Beauty Counter Makeover</h3>
      <p>Cosmetic counter makeovers are free and *everywhere*. In case you want to go luxe, remember that high-end cosmetic boutiques like Chanel require a reservation.</p>

      <h3>Put Together Your Own Cookbook</h3>
      <p>Does your friend or family member like to cook? Bake? Mix drinks? If so, compile recipes you love, along with any treasured family recipes. Choose themes relating to his or her life and introduce each section of the cookbook with a little personalized note. If they went to school down South, include a Southern comfort food section. Do they love Roald Dahl? There's a whole trove of Roald Dahl-themed recipes <a href="http://www.roalddahl.com/create-and-learn/make/revolting-recipes">waiting for you to find them</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Make a Mixtape</h3>
      <p>Okay, so it doesn't have to be an <i>actual </i>mixtape (who even has a cassette player anymore?), but creating a custom playlist is a sweet gesture, especially when you choose songs that are meaningful and relevant to your relationship. Burn the playlist to a CD—yes, an actual CD—and decorate the case rather than just file-sharing the music. It's nice to have something physical to unwrap.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Food, Obviously</h3>
      <p>Yes, buying groceries costs money, but you probably have most of the ingredients you need already. Plus, cooking costs nowhere near as much money as dinner at a stuffy, expensive restaurant. Cook a romantic dinner or go full-on Martha Stewart and give baked goodies to all your friends. It's a gift everyone will appreciate.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Get Creative</h3>
      <p>Exercise your right brain and create some thoughtful art or flex your crafting muscles. Your friend probably doesn't want a cheesy art project with her initials on it, but she might appreciate a pillow cross-stitched with a quippy quote from her favorite movie, hand-painted mason jars to round out her hipster kitchen set, or a pair of hand-made earrings. Hint: Browse Etsy for inspiration!</p>

      <h3>Create a Photo Album</h3>
      <p>Give Instagram a run for its money with a good old-fashioned photo album. If you hold onto things like ticket stubs and mementos from times together, include them scrapbook-style.</p>

      <h3>Design a Scavenger Hunt</h3>
      <p>Have your S.O. relive your favorite moments together—and test their memory—by placing clues at your shared favorite spots across your city/hometown/wherever. Think: places where he or she made you laugh so hard you almost peed your pants, spot where you had your first kiss, your go-to coffee shop. Need inspiration? Think: <i>What Would Leslie Knope Do?</i></p>

      <h3>Make a Movie</h3>
      <p>Make your friend a movie they'll watch for years to come. Record all your mutual friends talking about why they love that friend. Ask their parents for adorable, vintage footage from their childhood years to include. Finish it off with your own personal message.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Write It Down</h3>
      <p>A simple concept that's priceless: writing out how you feel! Write a letter, poem, short story, or maybe even a comic (time to use those art skills) about the first time you met. In the age of digital, nothing stands out more than a message that was handwritten.</p>

      <h3>Find a Free Event</h3>
      <p>Every city has no-cost cultural events. Do your research on local gatherings and you could bring your friend to a concert, museum, festival, street market, lecture, or gallery.</p>

      <h3>Handmade Recipe Book</h3>
      <p>Nothing is better than a home-cooked meal, celebrate some of your favorite meals from when you were a kid with a recipe book of all your favorites dishes your family members make.</p>

      <h3>Framed Photograph</h3>
      <p>A gift as old as time: a photo in a frame. Spice it up with a vintage one from your local charity shop. I love writing secret messages on the back of the picture for the person to find later (think of it like two gifts in one!)</p>

      <h3>Memory Jar</h3>
      <p>Find a trusty mason jar and fill it with notes of some memories you and perhaps a special someone have shared. Sometimes we can’t remember everything, but it’s special when someone does.</p>

      <h3>Handwritten Family Tree</h3>
      <p>Before ancestary.com, a physical drawing of your family tree was the hot item at any family reunion. Well, we’re saying: BRING IT BACK! Nothing brings a family more together than reminding them of how they got together.</p>

      <h3>Netflix Night Punch Card</h3>
      <p>Always telling your friends you’ll watch that one show, but never actually do? Enter the Netflix punch card. You’ll watch a season or a certain amount of episodes of whatever show the other one wants to watch. Stream wisely!</p>

      <p>This <a href="https://www.mamamiss.com/blog/2015/02/26/paint-chip-bookmarks/">DIY from <i>Mama Miss</i></a> is the perfect little gift for every book lover. Head out to your local hardware store and find your paint chip of your choosing. If you're cool with spending a little extra, find a matching embroidery thread in the same color at your local craft store and get down to business.</p>

      <h3>Souvenir Box</h3>
      <p>Ever come home from a trip and find you have a lot of little things like restaurant matchbooks, a currency that’s kinda unusable, postcards too cute to pass up? Put it to use with a Souvenir Box. Cherish all the little details of your vacation in box form. It’s the little things sometimes (pun maybe intended.)</p>
