      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:42:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/entertainment/music/364334-copyright-infringement-danny-young-tiwa-savage-settle-out-of-court.html" target="_blank">Jayne Augoye</a></address>
      <p>A singer, Danny Young, has reached an out-of-court settlement with Tiwa Savage, whom he filed a N205 million copyright suit against over her song, ‘One.’</p>
      <p>Young revealed this in a statement he posted on his Instagram account on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by his lawyers, the singer commended Tiwa’s management “for committing in good faith, time and efforts towards finding an amicable resolution to the dispute.”</p>
      <p>The statement partly read, “Mutual efforts in this regard have been successful and our client and the defendants, Tiwa Savage and Mavin Records, have come to a common understanding and agreed on the terms for the discontinuation of the suit. Therefore we shall no longer be proceeding with the court action.”</p>
      <p>The singer had claimed that Tiwa copied his (Danny Young’s) 2009 single, Oju Tiwon, in her (Tiwa’s) 2018 single titled, ‘One’.</p>
      <p>In the suit filed in February, Danny Young also joined Tiwa’s former record label, Mavin Records, owned by Don Jazzy, in the suit.</p>
      <p>Both parties considered an out-of-court settlement for the first time at a Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos on November 6.</p>
      <p>Danny Young’s lawyer, Justin Ige, informed the court that the respondents (Tiwa Savage &amp; Mavin Records) reached out to his client and requested that the case be settled out of court.</p>
      <p>Danny Young, who has been in the doldrums in recent times, was a big player in the Nigerian music scene a few years back.</p>
