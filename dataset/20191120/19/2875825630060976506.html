      <h1>Tottenham fans will quickly forget Jose Mourinho's previous misdemeanours if he wins trophies</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho's arrival hasn't gone down well with Tottenham fans but the new manager has been appointed to win trophies</h2>

      <p>Whatever you think of Jose Mourinho, he can charm the cockerels from wherever.</p>
      <p>When he is officially presented to the world as the new Spurs manager, he will be speaking fluent Chas ’n Dave.</p>
      <p>If Danny Blanchflower, Bill Nicholson, Dave Mackay, Glenn Hoddle and Harry Kane don’t get a mention, it will be a shock.</p>
      <p>And no-one does fake humility quite like Mourinho.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, polls on social media suggested at least two-thirds of the Spurs fanbase prefer Mauricio Pochettino to Mourinho.</p>
      <p>That will not go unnoticed by Mourinho. He will be gushing in his praise of Poch and suitably humbled by the £15million-a-year chance to manage such a great club.</p>

      <p>People get Mourinho’s ego wrong. It is not the size you think. It is far bigger.</p>
      <p>His managerial office is always a shrine to himself. His son is named Jose.</p>
      <p>But as much as Tottenham supporters, quite understandably, adore Pochettino, as much as they might loathe the way Mourinho has behaved in previous incarnations, Jose will probably have them at "hello".</p>
      <p>And that is why Daniel Levy, for all the initial indignation, is not risking the club’s relationship with its supporters.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He is employing someone who will not talk in vague, holistic terms about the direction of the club.</p>
      <p>He will, pure and simple, talk about winning trophies - something Spurs have not been doing for some time.</p>
      <p>The loveliness of Pochettino will long be forgotten if, for example, the FA Cup is raised in Spurs colours next May.</p>
      <p>Is Mourinho the right appointment? Probably not.</p>

      <p>Will, after the initial shock of a favourite son being jettisoned, the Spurs faithful enjoy the trophy-hunting ride? Yes.</p>
      <p>Will they enjoy - despite being 14th in the Premier League table - being the centre of attention? Yes.</p>
      <p>And that is why Levy will not have had a moment’s worry about the reaction to this decision.</p>
