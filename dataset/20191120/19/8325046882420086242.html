        <li>Georginio Wijnaldum made a powerful anti-racism statement after scoring the first of his three goals for the Netherlands on Tuesday.</li>
        <li>The Liverpool FC midfielder ran to the touchline, held out his arm next to his teammate Frenkie de Jong’s, and pointed to the colors of their skin.</li>
        <li>The gesture was a response to the reported racial abuse on Sunday of Excelsior Rotterdam’s Ahmad Mendes Moreira, who said Den Bosch fans called him a “negro and cotton-picker,” according to the BBC.</li>
        <li>“It really hit me on a personal level,” Wijnaldum told reporters on Tuesday, according to the Liverpool Echo, adding, “It’s a problem in society.”</li>
        <li>The Netherlands beat Estonia 5-0 on Tuesday.</li>

      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum had an evening to remember for the Netherlands on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool FC midfielder not only captained his home country’s team in the absence of Virgil van Dijk, but scored his first international hat trick in a 5-0 win over Estonia.</p>
      <p>His biggest statement on the night, however, came in the sixth minute of the game, when he celebrated his first goal with a powerful anti-racism message.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old had just headed home from the edge of the six-yard box when he ran to the cameras on the touchline, held out his arm next to his teammate Frenkie de Jong’s, and pointed to the colors of their skin.</p>

      <p>The message was a response to reported racial abuse of a black player in the Eredivisie over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Mendes Moreira, who plays for Excelsior Rotterdam, said Den Bosch fans called him a “negro and cotton-picker” at the Van Donge &amp; De Roo Stadion on Sunday, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50457235">according to the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>The BBC reported that the game was stopped for 10 minutes and that Dutch authorities were now investigating.</p>
      <p>“It really hit me on a personal level,” Wijnaldum told reporters on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-gini-wijnaldum-makes-powerful-17280090">according to the Liverpool Echo</a>.</p>
      <p>“I never expected anything like this to happen in the Netherlands. I’m really shocked. It did happen, unfortunately, and the way people have talked about the incident really hurt me.</p>
      <p>“It’s a problem in society. As a player, you can’t really change anything about it. But I still think that players should try and support each other. It’s a problem in society and a problem that should be solved by our politicians.”</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman, the Netherlands’ national team manager, said that Wijnaldum told him about the gesture before the game and that it was “nice to see,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50486585">according to the BBC</a>.</p>

      <p>Wijnaldum became the first midfielder to score a trio of goals for the Netherlands since Johan Neeskens in 1972, the BBC said.</p>
