      <h2>Rain and delayed start play spoilsport, small stages for drama draw flak</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:26:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:26</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Thiruvananthapuram South sub-district led the higher secondary category at the Revenue District School Arts Festival on Wednesday, the second day of the competition.</p>
      <p>Kilimanoor sub-district was leading in the high school and upper primary categories.</p>
      <p>As many as 146 events have been completed in the first two days.</p>
      <p>In the higher secondary category, Thiruvananthapuram South was ahead with 220 points. Thiruvananthapuram North was in second position with 209 points, followed by Kilimanoor with 197 points.</p>
      <p>Kilimanoor, which led the high school segment, had 187 points, Thiruvananthapuram North 172, and Thiruvananthapuram South 169 points. Rain and delayed start played spoilsport on Day Two of the fete. Rain in the afternoon saw the main venue of the festival – Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Chala – become all slushy. Participants and parents had no small trouble heading from the dressing rooms to the stages. The school entrance was waterlogged, affecting people’s movement. The ‘pandal’ for serving food too was affected, forcing people to move away.</p>
      <p>The organisers also suffered anxious moments. The rain, however, did not last long, sparing further trouble. Delayed starts continued to plague the festival. Events scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. were yet to kick off two hours later.</p>
      <p>Complaints about venues continued into the second day. Stage size drew flak from participants and organisers. Apart from the main stage, the other stages did not offer enough space, they alleged. Events such as plays and group dances particularly require large stages. However, this requirement had been ignored, they said.</p>
      <h3>Dramatic scenes</h3>
      <p>Dramatic scenes unfolded at the venue of the drama event at Central High School, Attakulangara. Participants who had come early enough for the competition found a stage that was too small to accommodate their props. After protests from participants and parents, it was decided to move the competition to SMV School after consultations with the Deputy Director of Education. The competition that was to begin at 9 a.m. finally kicked off only at 1 p.m. after all arrangements were made at SMV School.</p>
      <p>Parents and teachers said valuable time could have been saved and the children spared much hardship if a decision to shift the venue had been taken at the outset itself, instead of nearly two-and-a-half hours later. On Thursday, the drama events and mime will be held at Theerthapada Mandapam.</p>
      <p>The Band Melam at Manjalikulam grounds too saw parents express resentment at the poor arrangement. Save for the ‘pandal’ for the judges, there was no shelter for the participants from the harsh sun.</p>
      <p>The participants spent more than two hours waiting for the event to begin, taking cover under trees or even a hotel lobby outside the grounds. Parents too had no option but to sweat it out in the sun as their wards awaited their turn to perform.</p>
