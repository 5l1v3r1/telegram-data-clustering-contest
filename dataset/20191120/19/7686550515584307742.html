      <p>Investors who say they are owed thousands of pounds from a luxury hotel in Cardiff fear they will never see their money again.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/coal-exchange">Exchange Hotel</a> opened to great fanfare in 2017.</p>
      <p>Liverpool-based <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mp-raised-serious-concerns-over-11160631">Signature Living took on the old Coal Exchange building</a> after Cardiff Council deemed the building unsafe and invoked emergency powers to make it safe.</p>
      <p>Bosses at the firm insist the venture has a bright future ahead.</p>
      <p>However, investors who have ploughed large sums of money into it said regular payouts made to them have stopped.</p>
      <p>One, from south Wales, who put £100,000 into the scheme said she not had a return on her money for around a year.</p>
      <p>The 61-year-old said the money was meant to fund her through retirement, but she is beginning to think her money "is in trouble".</p>
      <p>When she signed up to the scheme in August 2017, which promised her an 8% return on her money, it seemed like a surefire way to make the most of a lump sum she received after her father had died.</p>

      <p>She said: "I did lots and lots of research, learnt about what they were doing with the building and checked out the plans. I did as much as I could in terms of due diligence. It seemed like a good investment. Plus, I really liked the idea about bringing back old buildings to life."</p>
      <p>Initially, she was paid £2,000 for month, which was paid quarterly, but she said these payments "dried up" after November 2018.</p>
      <p>A 45-year-old investor from Taiwan also spoken to WalesOnline about how she is still waiting for her quarterly payments, having ploughed £94k into the company.</p>
      <p>She too bought a unit from The Exchange Hotel in Cardiff, in August 2017. She said: "Starting from the first payment, I had to chase them. Every time we had to chase them to get our payment.</p>
      <p>"Then, starting from last year, I didn't have any payment at all. I kept on chasing but I got nothing."</p>
      <p>In April, she received a letter from Signature Living saying it intended to buy back the unit and there would be no more payments, and she should instruct a solicitor.</p>
      <p>"I think it was just their strategy," she said.</p>
      <p>"They ask you to instruct a lawyer and then noting happens - there is no payment and there are no updates."</p>
      <p>The business woman said she was attracted to the Exchange Hotel because of it's history and had done all the back ground checks on the company before committing her money.</p>
      <p>"I thought they were safe and trustworthy," she added.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what to do now."</p>

      <p>Investors, many from around the world, put their money forward in exchange for a “zone” of the property while the company kept control of the communal areas.</p>
      <p>After three years, the company have an option to buy back control from their investors. People received a letter from Signature Living in April 2019 saying it had found a more favourable source of funds and the buy back would happen immediately.</p>
      <p>However, months on and investors, from both home and abroad, are getting twitchy and some have even flown to the UK to ask for their money back from the luxury chain, which also has the high-profile Shankly Hotel in Liverpool and the George Best-themed hotel in Belfast.</p>
      <p>One investor said: "They [Signature Living] are still there but there is no progress and it just goes on and on.</p>
      <p>"It's getting scary now because this is our little bit of nest egg. I'm beginning to consider that we might never get it back."</p>
      <p>In another letter, sent to Signature Living SPI Investors earlier in November, Signature Living said it was unable to unlock funds from the hotel sites straight away.</p>
      <p>The letter stated: "We cannot unlock your funds from these sites until they have been finished, but once they are finalized, we will either sell these hotels and re-finance them.</p>
      <p>"In the short term we have put two of our hotels up for sale (the Shankly Hotel and James Street Hotel) which have a combined value of £50 million with a retained equity of £22 million. We are actively progressing the sale and expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter of 2020."</p>
      <p>Signature Living founder Lawrence Kenwright has said investors would eventually get their money and "they have to trust me".</p>
      <p>Mr Kenwright, who also has his own YouTube channel, has reassured investors they would all be paid once the various hotels involved had been completed and sold.</p>
      <p>"I'm doing my best," he said. "They're going to have to trust me."</p>

      <p>Stephen Doughty - Labour's MP candidate for Cardiff South and Penarth - said he <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/mp-raised-serious-concerns-over-11160631">raised "serious about concerns"</a> about the financial model and record of Signature Living some years ago when their proposals for the Coal Exchange first came to light.</p>
      <p>He added: "Beneath the surface of the partial redevelopment remains many serious unanswered questions and I have been receiving complaints from those who invested in the business that they have not received their payments.</p>
      <p>"As well as a series of other concerns from local residents as to why no work appears to have been going on the Coal Exchange for the past few months.</p>
      <p>"Coupled with the news about the apparent intention to sell other Signature Living developments this is a worrying development and I will be keeping a close eye on this and taking up the case with those who have concerns."</p>
      <p>Signature Living insisted it had a <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/how-cardiffs-coal-exchange-could-11152830">significant hotel portfolio across the UK</a> and that its future was not under threat.</p>
      <p>"Our funding model has not been gained from high street banks or from funds but from sophisticated individual investors who have invested their funds into stand alone sites," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"Sadly due to Brexit we have seen a slow down in sales and funding of these units, coupled with the fact that we deal in old listed buildings that we look to re-purpose as hotels, which can often run foul of quite strict planning processes which can also cause delays.</p>
      <p>"It is our intention to sell or refinance many of these various sites over the coming months to ensure our investors gain their return in full. In the same way that we have with 30 James St and Signature Living Hotel, both these sites were fully funded by individual investors who have now been fully repaid with all of their return on investment intact.</p>
      <p>"As we have previously stated, we are reshaping the business by selling some of our assets to ensure all of investors are fully repaid and Signature Living can fund itself via its own profits.</p>
      <p>"Signature Living is a profitable business with a solid and secure future ahead."</p>
