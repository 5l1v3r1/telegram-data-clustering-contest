      <p>Friends of "Hollywood <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/superman/">Superman</a>" Christopher Dennis are organizing a fundraiser to try and cover the performer's funeral costs.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Dennis—widely known for his Hollywood Boulevard performances as the Man of Steel—<a href="https://www.cbr.com/hollywood-superman-christopher-dennis-has-died/">was found dead</a> in Los Angeles. Dennis, who bore an uncanny resemblance to <a href="https://screenrant.com/superman-arrowverse-crisis-kingdom-come-routh-reeve-canon/amp/">Christopher Reeve</a>, struggled with substance abuse and mental illness for years. Now, his friends are hoping his 25 years of recognition will help them raise money.</p>

      <p>Last week, friends of the late performer organized a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/funeral-service-for-hollywood-superman">Gofundme</a> to finance "funeral services, cremation, grave/niche plot, and a memorial plaque" at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. "Chris was a gentle soul who believed in the good and tried to live up to his Superman image by going far out of his way and helping countless people simply out of his kindness. He tried hard to be a better man. All of his life he was looking for rest and peace," the Gofundme page reads.</p>
