        <b>All Blacks' search for new coach slammed</b>
      </p>
      <p>New Zealand's quest to find a new coach has been branded 'embarrassing' as they prepare to make their big announcement.</p>
      <p>The All Blacks will reveal Steve Hansen's successor next month but the search has perhaps not gone as they might have hoped.</p>
      <p>Just a few weeks ago New Zealand rugby bosses announced there were 26 homegrown candidates to replace Hansen after the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>But in the intervening period those names on the list to take on arguably the plum job in world rugby have dropped like flies to leave the Kiwis with a very short list of two.</p>
      <p>For Kiwi rugby writer Gregor Paul the recruitment process put in by All Blacks bosses was simply not good enough.</p>
      <p>Writing <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=12286517">in the New Zealand Herald, he said:</a> "Something's gone horribly wrong in the quest to find a new All Blacks coach.</p>
      <p>"It's fast becoming the job no one really wants and in an age of unprecedented coaching riches, it's embarrassing how many of the best candidates have actively said no to even applying."</p>
      <p>He added: "Wales didn't muck about after Gatland told them he would step down after the World Cup.</p>

      <p>"If the process to replace Hansen had begun in January last year, how different things may have been.</p>
      <p>"Gatland would most likely have been a serious contender. He could have put discussions with the British and Irish Lions on hold until the All Blacks process had concluded.</p>
      <p>"He signed with the Lions in June not so much because it was his burning desire, more because they got to him quicker than the All Blacks did."</p>

        <b>Jonathan Thomas on the move</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Wales flanker Jonathan Thomas has developed quite a reputation as a coach in England's Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>The defence and forwards coach is on the move next season, leaving big-spending Bristol Bears after three successful years to join Worcester Warriors.</p>
      <p>Thomas has worked under Pat Lam at Bristol, helping them to top spot in the Premiership this season.</p>
      <p>But he will join Worcester this summer, the club he was playing for when he was forced to retire in 2015 on medical advice.</p>

        <b>Harri Millard escapes ban</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardiff Blues youngster Harri Millard has been cleared by a judicial panel after being cited for allegedly committing and act of foul play.</p>
      <p>He was accused of striking Calvisano full-back Kayle van Zyl with his foot in the Blues' Euro win last weekend, but the disciplinary committee deemed the act to be accidental.</p>
      <p>As such, the case was dismissed and Millard is free to play this weekend.</p>

        <b>Tom Curry admits he'll never get over World Cup heartache</b>
      </p>
      <p>England flanker Tom Curry was one of the standout performers at the Rugby World Cup in Japan this autumn but found himself on the losing side in the final.</p>
      <p>Eddie Jones' side were fancied heading into the final after thrashing the All Blacks but were stunned 32-12 by South Africa in the final.</p>
      <p>Curry admits the regret will live with him forever.</p>

      <p>"It will probably never go away but you don't want it to," he said.</p>
      <p>"That will definitely inspire and push you to better things and the experience gained was invaluable.</p>
      <p>"Obviously winning would definitely be better but you've got to take those experiences with you.</p>
      <p>"There will always be an emotional attachment to it but you've got to push it to one side, especially when you are playing for your club or you will do them a dis-service.</p>
      <p>"That's the challenge now, to push it to one side and definitely fully focus on getting better and playing well for Sale."</p>
