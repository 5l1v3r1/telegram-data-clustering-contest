      <p>The Early Intervention Centre under the Department of Neonatology, Jipmer and the Department of Adult Independent Living at the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities will organise a Continuing Medical Education (CME) programme on ‘Assistive Technologies for Children with Special Needs’ on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The CME will aim to raise awareness on the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools in addressing children with special needs and the availability of assistive technologies in early intervention such as visual stimulation, development of speech and language, cognitive and social skills.</p>
      <p>The target group includes those dealing with children with special needs — paediatricians, paediatric neurologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, special educators, child psychologists and nurses.</p>
      <p>S. Shankar Subbiah, an expert in assistive technologies in this health domain, will be the key speaker at the CME, a press note from Jipmer said.</p>
