      <p>Monica Dominguez, 38, and her husband Gerardo Zavala Loredo, 32, were arrested in February after police discovered the remains of their toddler, Rebecka Zavala, sealed in a five-gallon container containing acid that was hidden inside a closet, the <i>Laredo Morning Times</i> <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/local/crime/article/Laredo-woman-found-guilty-of-dissolving-child-s-14842832.php#photo-16935873">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Both parents pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence of a human corpse on Friday. A judge sentenced Zavala Loredo to 14 years in prison after he took a plea deal, KTRK <a href="https://abc13.com/parents-sentenced-for-dissolving-toddlers-body-in-acid/5707990/">reported</a>. Dominguez also pleaded guilty to child endangerment and abuse of a corpse and was sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison.</p>
      <p>The 20-year sentence will run consecutively with her 10-year sentence for violating probation in a prior child injury case in 2015 where her nine-month-old son suffered six fractures, two to his right arm, and two on each leg.</p>
      <p>The judge could not charge either parent with murder because authorities could not determine a cause of death from the state of Rebecka’s remains, Zavala Loredo’s defense attorney Abundio Rene Cantu <a href="https://www.kgns.tv/content/news/Mother-accused-of-dumping-childs-remains-in-acid-expected-to-enter-plea-564986212.html">told</a> KGNS.</p>
      <p>Dominguez told investigators Rebecka’s death was an accident because she was left unsupervised in a bathtub and drowned, authorities said.</p>
      <p>She added that she asked her husband for help in getting rid of the body.</p>
      <p>The couple’s four other children, ranging in ages between 1 and 11, were taken into custody by Child Protective Services, the <i>Morning Times</i> reported.</p>
