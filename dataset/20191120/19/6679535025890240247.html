      <p>The runway renovation project has got under way at Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL).</p>
      <p>As announced earlier, the airport was closed for flight operations at 10 a.m. and reopened for the same at 6 p.m. on Wednesday in view of the runway re-carpeting work, the second such work undertaken by the airport.</p>
      <p>As part of it, renovation work on the taxilink and taxiway was begun on Wednesday. Replacement of taxiway lights and milling to remove tarring from the surface of the taxilinks are in progress. Civil works on the runway have not been launched yet.</p>
      <p>Upgrade of electric wiring on the runway is being undertaken now. Once it is over, tarring and concrete works will commence. Concurrently, works to renew the stone drains on either side of the runway have also been undertaken.</p>
      <p>A press release from the airport said that coordination among agencies ensured smooth operations with little trouble to passengers. Check-in counters for domestic flights leaving after 6 p.m. were opened at 3 p.m. while those for international flights were opened at 2 p.m. All flights have been shifted to the renewed schedule. Accordingly, Kochi-Colombo service operated by Sri Lankan Airways will leave at 9.30 a.m., Kochi-Jeddah service by Air India will leave at 6.05 p.m., and Kochi-Kuwait services by Kuwait Airways will leave at 2.10 a.m. and 8.35 a.m.</p>
      <p>Other international services would remain as per the old schedule, the release said.</p>
