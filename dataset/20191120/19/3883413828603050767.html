      <p>Also known as the "eyes in the sky", <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/technology/aircraft/eyes-sky-rare-access-board-natos-awacs-aircraft">the fleet of E-3A aircraft has helped to protect NATO airspace</a> close to Russia since it annexed Crimea in 2014.</p>
      <p>Inside, the planes are kitted out with technology capable of pinpointing any ship or aircraft more than 250 miles away.</p>

      <p>The role of space in future operations was also discussed, whereby NATO's Secretary General said it would not be weaponised, but stocked with necessary assets for peace, war and conflict.</p>
      <p>Mr Stoltenberg said he hoped ministers would declare space an operational domain, alongside air, sea, land and cyber.</p>
