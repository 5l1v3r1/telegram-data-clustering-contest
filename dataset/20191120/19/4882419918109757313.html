      <p>Former Argentine international Juan Roman Riquelme announced on Monday that he will run for the vice president role at Boca Juniors.</p>
      <p>Riquelme is part of Jorge Amor Ameal and Mario Daniel Pergolini's campaign and will become the club's second vice president if the campaign wins.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy, I feel like I have a chance to return to my club," he told reporters. "I will run as second vice president. I am someone who thinks a lot and I know that I am not prepared to be president of my club. In these four years (if we get in) I will try to see how things are and then we will see if I am prepared &amp;rdquor;.</p>
      <p>"My son told me that I had to go back to the club and my head changed. I know I will have less time (in my personal life), but I will be in the place where I am the happiest. I want to take care of the football, which is where I think I can help."</p>
      <p>Asked which players he would like to bring in, he joked: "(Kylian) Mbappe, (Leo) Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo... they told me there's money to spend so I am going to dream. Later we will see."</p>
