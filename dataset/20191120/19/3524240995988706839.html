      <p>The All Progressives Congress has condemned the post-election violence reported in Kogi State, which led to the death of a Peoples Democratic Party woman leader, Salome Abuh; and destruction of property.</p>
      <p>The party, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja on Wednesday, condoled with the family of the deceased and others affected by the post-election violence.</p>
      <p>Issa-Onilu, who quoted the state Police Command as saying that the killing was as a result of a reprisal attack, urged Kogi people to ensure that the violence is not allowed to escalate.</p>

      <p>“We are aware that Governor Yahaya Bello has already directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“The APC abhors violence and other criminality which, sadly, have continued to plague our election process.</p>
      <p>“We urge people to see election as a democratic contest and not a do-or-die for which we should pay with our lives.</p>
      <p>“We pray that the culprits are caught and the full weight of the law brought to bear on them.</p>
      <p>“President Muhammadu Buhari has advised those who are not satisfied with the results of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa to seek redress in court and shun violence.</p>
      <p>“We must all heed this call,” the APC spokesman said.</p>
