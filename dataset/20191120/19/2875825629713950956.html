      <p>Emmerdale looks set to be rocked by another pregnancy scandal involving Jacob Gallagher.</p>
      <p>Stunned viewers were horrified to discover that Maya Stepney is pregnant as she left prison on Tuesday night's episode.</p>
      <p>The paedophile teacher, who groomed schoolboy Jacob for months, walked free while cradling a big baby bump.</p>
      <p>It is unknown whether Jacob or dad David Metcalfe is the father of the unborn child - but if it is the teen then he could become a second time dad very quickly.</p>
      <p>Jacob may have another baby on the way after sleeping with Leanna Cavanagh without using protection.</p>

      <p>Still unable to contact Maya, dejected Jacob confided in Leanna about his feelings and apologised for his behaviour towards her.</p>
      <p>The pair leaned in for a passionate kiss before having sex together for the first time - with Leanna losing her virginity.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Jacob started acting very distant and shocked Leanna with his cold attitude as he zipped up his trousers and left.</p>
      <p>Leanna looked worried when she got a text from Jacob, which read: "Just checking you're on the pill."</p>

      <p>Some viewers are confused by the latest twist as there have been no confirmed plans for Maya to return to the soap.</p>
      <p>However, actress Louisa Clein hinted that a return to the Dales was on the cards for Maya while speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/emmerdale-star-opens-up-how-20539789">Mirror Online</a> last month.</p>
      <p>She told us: "I think the storyline will almost certainly continue. There are repercussions, no doubt, for years for those characters."</p>
