      <p>Robots or high-tech machines have integrated into many types of industries and jobs, and that includes operating rooms as well.</p>
      <p>In Monday's episode of "The Good Doctor," doctors use a robot during a surgery, while in real life, doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian are perfecting that practice at their own Center for Robotic Surgery.</p>
      <p>Wanda Ortiz is back to work and ramping up her exercise every day after recently undergoing heart surgery.</p>
      <p>"Pretty much four weeks after the surgery, I was back to work, so that speaks for itself," Ortiz said. "I was very fortunate."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nyp.org/physician/smick">Dr. Stephanie Mick</a> is the cardiac surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center who operated on Ortiz. Her mitral valve, which sits between the left atrium and left ventricle, was stretched out and leaking.</p>
      <p>The standard option for surgery would require a sternotomy, cracking open Ortiz's chest, but she was an ideal candidate for robotic surgery.</p>
      <p>"The whole point of the robot is to miniaturize our hands to get in there," Dr. Mick said. "What you lack in tactile, you make up in additional visualization."</p>
      <p>Robotic surgery allows for incisions that are mere centimeters, compared to six to eight inches for a traditional surgery.</p>
      <p>The quicker recovery time is what makes it so appealing to patients -- two to three fewer days and a month at home before returning to work, compared to two months after traditional surgery.</p>
      <p>In "The Good Doctor," robotic surgery is used to remove a tumor from the patient's lung, an astronaut preparing for a moon mission. Robotic surgery may sound like sci-fi, but for Ortiz it was the real deal.</p>
      <p>"The ability for her to be able to get into such a small space with these instruments and to do the job that she did, she did a fabulous job," she said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Mick said that one of the best things about being a heart surgeon is that patients are always very grateful.</p>
      <p>"If you can offer them something, maybe they couldn't get elsewhere, that's what makes it even more special," she said.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to watch "The Good Doctor," every Monday at 10 p.m. on ABC7.</p>
