      <h2>Humiliating move reflects damage caused by his links to Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:20:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Barker</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew agreed to withdraw from public duties “for the foreseeable future” on Wednesday in a humiliating move reflecting the deep damage done to his reputation by the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.</p>
      <p>In a statement that sought to limit harm to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5b7bb760-0ae8-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">charitable causes he supports</a>, the Duke of York also offered to help US authorities with any investigations relating Epstein, the late financier and sex offender.</p>
      <p>The decision to withdraw from public duties is a rare and historic step for a member of the royal family that underlines how seriously Buckingham Palace is viewing the fallout from the affair.</p>
      <p>It comes after a brutal week of press coverage that followed the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/230530e0-094f-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">Duke’s weekend interview with the BBC</a>, where he failed put to rest questions about his friendship with Epstein and allegations that he had sex with a teenager. The Duke has denied the claims.</p>
      <p>The Duke’s announcement on Wednesday came as supporters of his charitable causes — including companies such as KPMG, BT and Standard Chartered — began to distance themselves from him to protect their own reputations.</p>
      <p>“It has become clear to me over the past few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.”</p>
      <p>The Duke’s interview with BBC Newsnight was widely criticised for its tone and for the manner in which the royal addressed allegations that he had sex with a teenager coerced by Epstein.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to address some of the objections raised, the Duke said in his statement on Wednesday evening that he continued “to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein” — a stronger form of words than he used in the BBC interview.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a34f9e1e-bb77-11e9-b350-db00d509634e">His suicide</a> has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure,” the Duke said.</p>
      <p>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency.”</p>
