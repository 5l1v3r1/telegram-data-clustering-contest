      <h1>Paula Radcliffe takes on coaching role with former Oregon Project runner Jordan Hasay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:18:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tom-morgan/" target="_blank">Tom Morgan</a></address>
      <p>Paula Radcliffe is to become the new coaching adviser for a former Nike Oregon Project runner just weeks after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/10/02/bbc-impartiality-storm-failing-inform-viewers-paula-radcliffe/">drawing criticism over her response to the Alberto Salazar ban</a>.</p>
      <p>Britain’s former marathon world record holder – who is sponsored by Nike – had faced scrutiny after suggesting the US Anti-Doping Agency was “trying maybe to ­regain a little bit of face” by throwing Salazar out of athletics for four years following <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/09/02/christian-coleman-free-compete-worlds-usada-drops-case/">its failed pursuit of sprinter Christian Coleman</a>.​</p>
      <p>In fact, the investigation into the coach had begun years before it emerged Coleman had missed three drugs tests. On Wednesday Jordan Hasay, 28, the second-fastest American woman over the marathon, ­announced on her Instagram page that she was “excited and honoured to have Paula Radcliffe as my coaching adviser”.​</p>
      <p>Hasay, who has left the disbanded Nike Oregon Project, added: “I look forward to working with Paula, whose expertise in ­being the former world record holder in the marathon is unparalleled. I have always looked up to Paula as a pioneer for what is possible in the marathon, and most ­importantly in being a kind and ­inspiring person in life. I hope to follow in her footsteps as I continue my journey in the sport.”​</p>
      <p>Radcliffe held the world record for the marathon for 16 years <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2019/10/13/kenyas-brigid-kosgei-demolishes-womens-marathon-world-record/">until it was broken by Kenyan Brigid Kosgei in Chicago this year</a>, where Hasay failed to finish.​</p>
      <p>Nike ended its NOP training programme for elite athletes in October after leading coach Salazar was banned by the US Anti-Doping Agency. Salazar was given a four-year ban for doping offences. His appeal against the ban is unlikely to begin before March at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.​</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, London 2017 world para athletics long jump champion Stef Reid has been appointed vice president of UK Athletics. The 35-year-old, who has also won two Paralympic T44 long jump silver medals for GB, replaces former sprinter Donna Fraser in the role.</p>
