      <h2>Event to be led by experts from Microsoft, industry leaders</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:17:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft will organise a technology workshop with business mentoring and networking sessions on Friday in a bid to guide and select firms that are looking for incubating innovative ideas.</p>
      <p>Organised in association with the Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM), the event is part of the company’s Highway to a Hundred Unicorns project that aims to strengthen start-ups in cities beyond metros. Led by Microsoft experts and industry leaders, the day-long event at the KSUM’s Integrated Startup Complex at Kalamassery will enable entrepreneurs to interact with senior officials of the State government as well.</p>
      <p>Startups in cities beyond metros faced the challenge of keeping operations cost-effective amid a lack of support and dearth of mentorship. Considering these aspects, Microsoft has launched a comprehensive global programme designed to support start-ups in tier-2 cities.</p>
      <p>The event will host Emerge X, which will be a competition to identify the State’s top technology start-ups. The selected firms will get a chance to present their projects in front of a jury of prominent investors, venture capitalists and industry leaders. Selected start-ups will get Microsoft for Startups offers, and mentorship by Microsoft.</p>
      <p>The top three start-ups from Emerge X will be invited to a national-level event in 2020 that will bring together the country’s best start-ups.
