      <p>If you didn't get an invite to Willow Smith's cute (and slightly creepy) 19th birthday party, don't worry. <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/Smith-His-Family-Aladdin-Premiere-2019-46188581">Her dad, Will,</a> caught the fun on camera for his YouTube channel, so everyone can enjoy the festivities. Willow entered her last teenage year on Oct. 31, and two weeks later, Will shared a behind-the-scenes look at exactly what went down.</p>
      <p>In the video, Will revealed he and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Jada-Pinkett-Smith">Jada Pinkett Smith</a> wanted to give Willow a major party to celebrate the end of her teens. In fact, this is the first party Willow has had in five years! Keeping with the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Halloween">Halloween</a> theme, the parents used Haus of Creep LA to put on an eerie haunted house for guests, which Willow appeared to love. "Thank you guys so much for coming," Willow said after hugging her mom. "I'm so grateful for you guys, so grateful for all the love and support and the community that I have in my life." Watch the full video above get a glimpse of the bash — including <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/will-smith-his-family-at-gemini-man-premiere-photos-46725169">her brother Jaden</a>'s sweet "Happy Birthday" rendition.</p>
