      <h1>Chelsea's 2012 Champions League winners: what happened next and where the players are now</h1>
      <h2>In our latest end of the decade piece, a look at what happened to the heroes of Munich seven years on</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <h3>Petr Cech</h3>
      <p>The goalkeeper was appointed Chelsea's technical and performance advisor after retiring at the end of last season. He spent four seasons at Arsenal, for whom he signed in the summer of 2015 in a deal worth £10million, before returning to Stamford Bridge. Cech is also occasionally turning out on the hockey rink for Guildford Phoenix.</p>
      <h3>Jose Bosingwa</h3>
      <p>One of several players told less than a week after the final that he was free to leave at the end of his contract. The Portuguese right back signed a three-year deal at nearby Queens Park Rangers a couple of months later, becoming Mark Hughes’s eighth summer signing for a team that ended up being relegated.</p>
      <p>From there Bosingwa headed for Trabzonspor, where he spent three campaigns before retiring. This was his second Champions League title having won the trophy at Porto before following Jose Mourinho to Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <h3>David Luiz</h3>
      <p>The Brazilian centre back was surprisingly sold by Frank Lampard to Arsenal this summer, bringing an end to his second spell at the club.</p>
      <p>After the 2012 final he signed a five-year deal but was sold two years later to Paris Saint-Germain in a £50million deal, at the time a world record for a defender. He spent a little more than two seasons in the French capital before Chelsea decided that they wanted him back for a fee of about £34million.</p>
      <p>Won a second Europa League, the Premier League and FA Cup in that second spell but has endured a difficult start to life at the Emirates.</p>
      <h3>Gary Cahill</h3>
      <p>Left in unhappy circumstances after being told that he would not be given a new contract last season. Maurizio Sarri decided early on that the veteran defender would not be part of his plans, making his eighth campaign at the Bridge a sour one. Won eight major trophies at the club and is now doing well at Crystal Palace having moved to Selhurst Park as a free agent.</p>
      <h3>Ashley Cole</h3>
      <p>The former England left back recently joined Chelsea’s academy coaching staff having retired from playing in the summer. Finished his career under Frank Lampard at Derby County and enjoyed spells at Roma and LA Galaxy having been released by the Blues at the end of the 2013-14 campaign.</p>

      <h3>John Obi Mikel</h3>
      <p>Nigeria midfielder is still playing for Trabzonspor in Turkey and yet another who was told he would not be given a new contract by Chelsea in the summer of 2017. From there he went to China, spending a brief spell at Tianjin, before returning to England and enduring a mixed time at Middlesbrough in the second half of last season. Retired from international football after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <h3>Frank Lampard</h3>
      <p>Whatever happened to Chelsea’s No8? For starters he became the club’s record goalscorer, overtaking Bobby Tambling’s long-standing record, before moving to Manchester City, New York City and retiring as a player in 2017.</p>
      <p>He then expressed his desire to go down the coaching route, ended up with the Derby job thanks, in part, to a call from uncle Harry Redknapp and is now back at Stamford Bridge overseeing a remarkable youth movement.</p>
      <h3>Salomon Kalou</h3>
      <p>Left immediately after the final, joining Lille as a free agent. The attacker spent three seasons in north-east France before heading to Hertha Berlin. Is now in his sixth season in the German capital but, at 34, does not have a prominent role. Out of contract this summer.</p>
      <h3>Juan Mata</h3>
      <p>Spanish No10 enjoyed his most prolific campaign a season later, scoring 20 goals in all competitions, before becoming Manchester United’s then record signing in 2014 when he went to Old Trafford for £37million. He has not hit the heights imagined at a club that has gone through a recurring identity crisis since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.</p>
      <h3>Ryan Bertrand</h3>
      <p>The surprise inclusion in Munich, he never managed to hold on to a starting role long enough at Chelsea and was sent back out on loan in 2013-14 to Aston Villa. At the end of that spell he was sent to Southampton, impressed on the south coast and was signed permanently for about £10million in 2015.</p>
      <h3>Didier Drogba</h3>
      <p>Scorer of the winning penalty, it was announced three days later that he would be leaving the club when his contract expired at the end of June. Ended up in Shanghai for 11 games before switching to Galatasaray.</p>
      <p>The striker remained prolific in Turkey and was given a homecoming when Mourinho brought him back to Stamford Bridge for the 2014-15 campaign. After that he headed for North America, retired in 2017 and recently turned down a coaching role at Chelsea with an eye on a job at the top of the Ivory Coast federation.</p>

      <h3>Florent Malouda</h3>
      <p>He asked to leave later that summer but no suitor was willing to match his £80,000 weekly salary so spent a campaign training with the reserves. Joined Trabzonspor for the 2013-14 season and went on to play in France, India, Egypt and Luxembourg before retiring in 2018.</p>
      <h3>Fernando Torres</h3>
      <p>The Spain striker went to Milan on loan in 2014, joined them permanently but was almost immediately sent to former club Atletico Madrid on loan. Eventually joined his boyhood club permanently once again in the summer of 2016 and has spent the past two years playing in Japan.</p>
