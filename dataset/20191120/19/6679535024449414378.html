      <h1>Oppn. parties, BJP slam govt. over switch to indirect polls</h1>
      <h2>Move tantamount to CM admitting AIADMK’s defeat in civic polls, says Stalin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:35:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu, as well as the ruling AIADMK’s alliance partner, the BJP, slammed the State government after it issued an ordinance for holding indirect elections to the posts of Mayors of Corporations and Chairpersons of Municipalities and Town Panchayats.</p>
      <p>DMK president M.K. Stalin alleged that the AIADMK government had taken the decision in a “dictatorial manner”. In a statement, he said holding indirect elections was tantamount to the Chief Minister admitting the AIADMK’s defeat in the local body elections. “He has realised that the people will reject the AIADMK candidates for the posts of Mayors and Chairpersons of Municipalities and Town Panchayats. The ruling party is in chaos over the conduct of the local body polls,” Mr. Stalin said.</p>
      <p>Even the BJP, an alliance partner of the ruling party, slammed the move, with leaders of the national party saying it will lead to horse-trading and intimidation of nominated members. “We cannot accept this. Till now, they haven’t discusses this with anyone. In 2018, you said direct elections will be held. Why has a decision like this been taken suddenly?” BJP leader and former Union Minister Pon. Radhakrishnan asked. He claimed that the moment the counting is over, the nominated members will come under pressure and be intimidated to vote for the ruling party’s choice of leaders.</p>
      <p>Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri also condemned the move, terming it anti-democratic. “This is a murder of democracy. This move will lead to horse-trading and the AIADMK has resorted to this move as it is afraid of losing the local body elections and believes that it can buy councillors and get into power,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>MDMK general secretary Vaiko said the move will deprive the voters of their democratic right to choose their leaders. “For the local bodies to function efficiently, only those chosen by the voters should be nominated to these posts,” he said. CPI(M) State Secretary K. Balakrishnan said the move will lead to the kidnapping of councillors, horse-trading, and even manipulation of the election results in collusion with officials.</p>
      <p>Describing the move as a retrograde step, activist M.G. Devasahayam said the root cause of what he described as dismal urban governance in the country was urban politics not having evolved. “This is particularly so in Tamil Nadu, which is the most urbanised State in India,” he said, adding that direct elections could lead to “good and participatory governance”.</p>
      <h3>AIADMK defends move</h3>
      <p>The AIADMK defended its decision, saying it was made as per law and in consonance with the basic features of Parliamentary democracy. D. Jayakumar, the Fisheries Minister and the party’s organising secretary, told reporters that it was through indirect election that the Prime Minister of the country and the Chief Ministers of States were chosen. He recalled that even the DMK, while in power during 2006, adopted the indirect system of election.</p>
