      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas — About 20 bigwigs from major-league teams wore orange vests and hard hats here in a hotel lobby Wednesday morning, preparing for their field trip of the Rangers’ new ballpark, Globe Life Field, next door.</p>
      <p>Astros owner Jim Crane didn’t ask to keep his hard hat. He might live to regret that.</p>
      <p>Just as they were at last month’s World Series and at last week’s general managers’ meetings, the Astros find themselves dominating baseball discussion at the owners’ meetings for all of the wrong reasons. They are under investigation for a pair of transgressions, first their actions following<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/astros-fire-assistant-gm-brandon-taubman-for-outburst-at-reporters/"> the Brandon Taubman mess</a> and second for allegations that they illegally, electronically stole signs in 2017 and perhaps later. Commissioner Rob Manfred <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/rob-manfred-wants-us-to-think-astros-were-alone-and-hes-ready-to-hammer-them/">briefly discussed the latter investigation</a> Tuesday at a news conference and is expected to delve into more details in a Thursday news conference at the conclusion of these meetings.</p>
      <p>Crane, encountering a small group of reporters Wednesday, politely declined to take questions.</p>
      <p>“If you want to talk about baseball, I’ll talk about baseball,” he said. “What else do you want to talk about? Any other issues…”</p>
      <p>At that juncture, an off-duty police officer working for the hotel escorted Crane out of the scrum.</p>
      <p>While owners and team bigwigs generally avoided public comment, the fury held by other teams toward the Astros remains as palpable as it was last week among the GMs.</p>
      <p>Rays president Matt Silverman, whose team lost to the Astros in the 2019 American League Division Series — a series in which the Astros won all three home games and lost their two road games — smiled when asked about the Astros and reiterated a comment he made to the Tampa Bay Times last weekend.</p>
      <p>“We lost. We don’t cheat,” Silverman said. “Nothing will change that.”</p>
