      <h1>Cop who wields pen and baton with equal elan</h1>
      <h2>The Facebook postings of Sunil P. Jaleel have a good number of followers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:33:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-P-Praveen-536/" target="_blank">M.P. Praveen</a></address>
      <p>Sunil P. Jaleel, a senior civil police officer attached to the Central police, is as adept in writing as he is in policing.</p>
      <p>The followers of his Facebook page, where he has been posting both his personal and policing experiences for the past five years, will vouch for that. And his posts, shared under the unique name of Controlormakal, in memory of his over three years of service at the police control room when he started making those posts, have quite a few followers.</p>
      <p>No wonder, Mr. Jaleel, who has been in service for 16 years, keeps looking at issues beyond the policing perspective.</p>
      <p>He initially started penning his travelling experiences in Malayalam for an online group and then started sharing it on his Facebook page as well, which began to draw a good response. Shortly, thereafter, he turned his attention to the subject of accident deaths and the reasons behind themt. “Accident deaths always haunted me, especially the premature death of young victims and I had to encounter quite a few of them during the course of my career,” Mr. Jaleel recalled his early writing days.</p>
      <p>But long before, the topics began to expand and now it varies from his recollection of memorable and touching anecdotes on and off duty and travelogues to even topics such as snake catching.</p>
      <p>“When I started writing, the whole idea was to break the stereotype of a policeman. I wanted to convey the message that men in uniform were also made of flesh and blood like the rest of human beings and that we also go through the emotional traumas and mental conflicts in our line of duty. For instance, when deployed at the scene of a protest, we may personally sympathise with the cause but are forced to set aside it in keeping with our duty to maintain order,” Mr. Jaleel said.</p>
      <p>He keeps small notes on his mobile phone when he gets a spark and later develops it into a post. From haunting news articles to a touching experience, anything could trigger that spark.</p>
      <p>Having penned quite a few posts by now, Mr. Jaleel is now planning to compile them into a book.</p>
