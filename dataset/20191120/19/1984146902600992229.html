      <p>A woman at the centre of a love triangle has told a court how an attempt by a man she was having an affair with to murder her was "horrific".</p>
      <p>Louise Pearce had been cheating on her partner of 18 years with another man when matters are said to have come to a "violent head" just after Christmas last year.</p>
      <p>She was at home with long-term boyfriend Gareth Mallaburn when lover Brett Fenwick and his brother Blaine Fenwick turned, up, allegedly armed with knives.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court has heard all three knew each other from working at Alnwick Garden - the two men as kitchen porters and Miss Pearce as a cleaner - and Mr Mallaburn and Brett Fenwick had been friends until the affair.</p>
      <p>The Fenwick brothers deny wounding with intent on Mr Mallaburn, with prosecutors alleging he stabbed him in the neck.</p>
      <p>Brett Fenwick has admitted attempting to murder Miss Pearce and, giving evidence at Newcastle Crown Court, she spoke of the attack on Boxing Day night.</p>
      <p>She admitted she had still been seeing Brett last December, after confessing to Mr Mallaburn about the affair on Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>Miss Pearce confirmed that earlier on Boxing Day, she had spent some "intimate time" with Brett Fenwick.</p>
      <p>Later that night, after she returned home to Mr Mallaburn after a night out with friends, prosecutors say the Fenwicks turned up at the home of the couple on Howling Lane, Alnwick.</p>
      <p>Miss Pearce told jurors she answered the door to them and "naturally stood back", adding that they knocked her to the side with their shoulders when they ran upstairs.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say they confronted Mr Mallaburn about threatening messages he had sent and he barricaded himself in a bedroom before arming himself with a shelf to fight off the alleged knifemen.</p>
      <p>It is claimed at the bottom of the stairs, with Mr Mallaburn believing the Fenwicks were going to leave, Brett plunged a knife into his neck.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, Mr Mallaburn fled out of the back of the house and sought help at his mum's home.</p>
      <p>Miss Pearce said the Fenwicks followed him out the back and she went out too but said Mr Mallaburn and Blaine Fenwick then disappeared.</p>
      <p>She told jurors: "I pulled on Brett's arm and shouted at him and he shouted back at me."</p>
      <p>Miss Pearce said she went back in the house and was heading for the front door to go and find Mr Mallaburn when Brett "punched me and sent me into the living room".</p>
      <p>She added: "Then the next few minutes were just horrific. It was just horrific after that."</p>
      <p>Brett Fenwick, 36, of Lower Barresdale, Alnwick, denies wounding with intent and having a bladed article and Blaine Fenwick, 25, also of Lower Barresdale, Alnwick, denies wounding with intent and two counts of having a bladed article.</p>
      <p>The trial continues</p>
