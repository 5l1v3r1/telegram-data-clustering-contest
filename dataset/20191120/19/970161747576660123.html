        <b>After everything that happened at the christening and the crane disaster, things were looking pretty hopeless for Luke Morgan (Gary Lucy) and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring) in Hollyoaks but tonight, the pair were looking to the future as Cindy made it clear that she was done with just being friends with benefits.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pair have been forced to take stock of everything that has happened and of how short life is and it’s clear that what started off as a fun and passionate affair has flourished into something more. Expecting Luke to not take it seriously, Cindy was prepared to have her heart broken.</p>
      <p>But Luke took her by surprise by getting down on one knee and proposing marriage, agreeing that it was time they got serious. As they look to the future and begin planning a wedding, they both finally have a reason to smile but will this allow them to put their demons and recent troubles to bed?</p>
