      <h2>Little change in incidence of viral fever, say paediatricians</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:29:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Serena-M-Josephine-121376/" target="_blank">Serena M. Josephine</a></address>
      <p>In the last fortnight, many government hospitals in the city have witnessed a decline in the number of patients reporting with fever. There is also a “significant drop” in the number of persons testing positive for dengue, doctors say.</p>
      <p>Though the incidence of dengue among children has dipped slightly, paediatricians say there is not much decline in fever among the paediatric population. “We continue to receive schoolchildren with different kinds of viral fever and respiratory infections. This may be due to the weather and the presence of different viruses. This is the fever season. But there are not many sick children. We admit children with three to four days of fever,” a paediatrician in a government hospital said.</p>
      <p>At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, dean R. Jayanthi said the number of fever cases had reduced by at least half since the last week of October. “As of now, we have 113 inpatients, undergoing treatment for fever, and about 20, who have tested positive for dengue. The number of patients reporting with fever at the outpatient unit has also come down,” she said.</p>
      <p>A similar drop was witnessed at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. Dean P. Vasanthamani said generally, they had 180 patients getting admitted for fever in a day. “Now, we have 80 inpatients for treatment of fever, and 10 patients who have tested positive for dengue. This includes both adults and paediatric cases. The cases have declined in the last 15 days,” she said.</p>
      <h3>Situation stabilising</h3>
      <p>At the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, officials said 150 children were admitted for fever and 48 children with dengue. “Earlier, we used to get around 230 to 240 patients with fever. Now, the numbers have decreased. Dengue incidence is stabilising,” a hospital authority said.</p>
      <p>The breeding of Aedes aegypti has reduced in the city, officials of the Chennai Corporation said.</p>
      <p>“Last year, dengue cases peaked in November. This year, the number of cases was normal in October, and we expected it to peak in November, but this is not the case till now,” an official said.</p>
      <p>With a lull in the northeast monsoon activity, he said they were continuing to observe the situation.</p>
