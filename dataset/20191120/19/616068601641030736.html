      <p>The Penticton RCMP has responded to the city’s <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/270829/Penticton-19th-in-Maclean-s-national-crime-rankings#270829">19th place ranking</a> in the Maclean’s “Most Dangerous Cities in Canada” feature published this week.</p>
      <p>The ratings are based on the Stats Canada 2018 crime severity index, which takes into account the weight of more serious offences.</p>
      <p>The index takes per capita crime rates into account, which the Penticton RCMP says is useful for establishing trends, but doesn’t work well when comparing cities of different sizes. Local police say the index also ignores the impact prolific offenders could have on a smaller city. </p>
      <p>“A few incidents in a smaller community, such as Penticton, can dramatically impact the ranking for that community. A single prolific offender in a smaller centre has the ability to increase that town’s crime severity rating, as compared to a larger city,” the detachment said in a news release. </p>
      <p>Violent crimes most often involve individuals known to each other “and can be considered isolated events,” the detachment continued. </p>
      <p>“The RCMP in Penticton and throughout the South Okanagan have seen tremendous success in arresting prolific offenders in each of our communities, who are believed to be responsible for the majority of the crimes taking place. Our officers remain committed to these efforts of solving crimes and improving our community’s sense of safety, security and overall well-being,” said Const. James Grandy.</p>
      <p>Penticton slid in the rankings since the previous year when it was 17th. The violent crime ranking fell even further, down to 104th from 42 the previous year.</p>
