      <p>“<i>When we decided to call Lewis in on that final Safety Car, we had seen that the Ferraris had collided,” he said in a video published by Mercedes. “One of them was off at turn four and reasonably clear of the track</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>Vettel was making his way around with a puncture, that was dropping a bit of debris, but we thought he would get back to the pits. At the point the Safety Car was called, Lewis was at turn 12, so there wasn’t long for us to discuss this decision</i>."</p>
