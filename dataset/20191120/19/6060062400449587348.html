      <p>By now you've probably glimpsed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-ukraine-talking-points-photo-sharpie-2019-11">President Donald Trump's handwritten note</a> about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11">Gordon Sondland's impeachment testimony</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Trump held a statement on a pad of paper, written in black Sharpie in Trump's signature scrawl, that said: "I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo."</p>
      <p>The president also had a printed copy of a tweet from Jeff Mason, a Reuters White House correspondent, that backed up his claim that a quid pro quo was not at the center of his decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine.</p>

      <p>The president's large, caps-lock-y handwriting struck many, and the phrase <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22I%20WANT%20NOTHING%22&amp;src=trend_click">"I want nothing"</a> trended on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Of course, the internet did what the internet does best: turned images of the note into a meme.</p>
      <p>There were Eminem jokes ...</p>

      <p>So why was the note so ... big? Trump <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/what-if-donald-trump-is-just-blind.html">reportedly has poor eyesight</a> but refuses to wear glasses in public. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-dislikes-tweeting-publicly-reading-glasses-2019-11">According to The New York Times</a>, he rarely tweets in front of other people because he doesn't want them to see him with his glasses on.</p>
