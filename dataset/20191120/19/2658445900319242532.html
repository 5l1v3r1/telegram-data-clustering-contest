      <p>The family of late former Bayelsa State Governor, Chief Diepreye Alameisegha, Wednesday said it worked assiduously with other stakeholders to end the reign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because the incumbent state Governor, Seriake Dickson disappointed the people of the state.</p>
      <p>Speaking under the auspices of Alamcoism Movement(AM), the family said Dickson insulted the late Alameisegha and disrespected Ijaw elders in most of his dealings and utterances.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Yenagoa, the Director-General, Alamcoism Movement, Ziriworiten Alameisegha, who said the movement started 1999, lamented that the PDP abandoned the template of development and empowerment laid down by the late governor.</p>
      <p>“The PDP government disappointed Alameisegha’s family. The Alamcoism endorsed Seriake Dickson but at the end of the day what did he do? He disappointed the family, insulted Alamcoism. So, we decided that since he failed to respect elders, we should teach him a lesson”, he said.</p>
      <p>Alameisegha, who was flanked by principal members of the movement such as the Student Representative, Oyeindoubra Amantari and Director of Planning, Strategy, Abosi Felagha, warned Lyon against breaking his social contract with the people.</p>
      <p>He advised Lyon to learn from the past governments, desist from listening to rumours and to focus on human capital development to address the endemic poverty in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>Alameisegha further appealed to the governor-elect to pay attention to the infrastructural development of the state especially the construction of a seaport in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p>He also called on Dickson and the PDP to shelve the idea of going to court to challenge the victory of Lyon saying instead of wasting the state money on litigation, they should channel the resources to infrastructural development.</p>

      <p>Also speaking, Ebilade, the second son of the late Alameisegha, commended the people for rejecting all the offers made to them by the PDP and opted to vote Lyon as the right candidate.</p>
      <p>He said: “I told the PDP that their money can’t counter the Alamcoism. We are around the eight local government areas and they saw the result in the eight local government areas. We won six local government areas but in Sagbama, Dickson’s local government area, there was no election.</p>
      <p>“In my mother’s village at Ogoibiri, there was no material. It was hijacked by the Sagbama PDP Government. So, Douye Diri only won one local government area and even in that council, we divided the votes.</p>
      <p>“People should know that Bayelsans are behind David Lyon and even the court will do nothing when everybody is on the same page. The court is not bigger than Bayelsa State. The whole state has decided and has chosen a candidate.</p>
      <p>“We want to advise all the PDP people to reserve that money that they want to use for case and come and build one industry to employ more citizens because we need more development in this state. They should forget about that court.”</p>
