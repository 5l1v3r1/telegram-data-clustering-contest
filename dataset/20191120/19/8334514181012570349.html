      <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary hopes to reach a NATO defense spending target in 2023, a year ahead of the deadline agreed by allies who are facing strong pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to invest more in European security.</p>
      <p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Reuters that Budapest would spend 2% of economic output on its military ahead of the NATO target date of 2024, up from less than 1% just a few years ago, buying weaponry and equipment from Turkey, France, Germany and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>“I really understood the position of President Trump because he wanted Europeans to spend more, to put more emphasis on their security,” Szijjarto said in the margins of a NATO foreign ministers meeting.</p>
      <p>“We have been implementing a very significant and robust modernization strategy of our armed forces, which will last until 2026. We will hit the 2% (level) in 2023,” he said.</p>
      <p>Hungary, which joined NATO in 1998, has traditionally spent less on defense than other eastern European members such as Poland, but Szijjarto said Budapest was “very determined to modernize the army”.</p>
      <p>Only seven NATO countries currently meet or exceed the 2% target - the United States, Britain, Greece, Poland and the three Baltic states, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p>
      <p>But European allies, Canada and Turkey are projected to collectively invest more than $100 billion in defense between 2017 and the end of 2020, according to NATO projections.</p>
      <p>Germany’s Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said earlier this month Berlin would spend 2% of its economic output on defense by 2031, belatedly reaching the goal set by NATO leaders at a 2014 summit, months after Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula.</p>
