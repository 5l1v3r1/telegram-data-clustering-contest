      <h1>Analyst Calls Out College Football Playoff For Its “Alabama Privilege”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:21:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The latest College Football Playoff rankings were released on Tuesday night and Alabama continued to sit at No. 5 overall. The Crimson Tide don’t really have any impressive wins and they’re now without quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, but the selection committee decided to not drop Nick Saban’s team.</p>
      <p>Alabama will most likely drop in the weeks to come, barring a blowout win over Auburn with Mac Jones at quarterback.</p>
      <p>Still, there are some who think Alabama is unfairly getting the benefit of the doubt from the selection committee. Namely, Tim Brando is not happy.</p>
      <p>The college football analyst thinks the committee has an “Alabama privilege.”</p>
      <p>He doesn’t think Alabama is alone in that category, either.</p>
      <p>“Teams that are considered blue bloods,” <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Alabama-Crimson-Tide-college-football-playoff-Tim-Brando-Tua-Tagovailoa-Nick-Saban-privileged-138896663/">Brando said today</a>. “Teams that have had success in the last 30, 35, 40 years, multiple conference championships. This cabal of teams that have made this event the great Sun Belt Invitational. If I can tell you in July that these are your teams and I’m gonna be right on at least 3 out of the 4 that I name, then we’ve removed all of the joy of the regular season of college football.”</p>
      <p>Brando had tweeted about Alabama’s ranking earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>“The CFB Playoff Committee has all their cronies on TV all day preparing everyone for Alabama privilege tonight,” <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/tim-brando-calls-out-playoff-committee-for-alabama-privilege">Brandon tweeted</a>. “There’s no doubt they’ll drop only 1 or 2 spots. Committee will claim “eye test” and forget their non Conference schedule. An embarrassment! I dropped em’ 5 spots.”</p>

      <p>While it’s fair to be somewhat upset with Alabama’s ranking right now, the odds suggest it won’t really matter. The Crimson Tide can’t win a conference championship and, barring a shellacking of Auburn, won’t have a resume worthy of a top-four seed. They’ll likely get jumped by Oregon or Utah or maybe even Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Alabama will take on Western Carolina this weekend in its first game of the post-Tua era.</p>
