      <h1>Disney says past breaches at other companies to blame for hacked Disney+ accounts</h1>
      <h2>The company says that only 'a small percentage' of accounts were compromised</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:36:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Disney has said that previous breaches at other companies are responsible for a number of hacked Disney+ accounts.</p>
      <p>Hours after the service launched on November 12th, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/18/thousands-disney-plus-accounts-hacked-sale-dark-web/">thousands of Disney+ accounts</a> were being sold on the dark web for as little as $3 USD (approximately $4 CAD). A subscription to Disney+ costs $8.99 CAD per month.</p>
      <p>“Billions of usernames and passwords leaked from previous breaches at other companies, pre-dating the launch of Disney+, are being sold on the web,” the company said in a statement issued to <i>MobileSyrup</i> regarding users recycling passwords.</p>
      <p>Since users often reuse passwords for several different services, a breach of one account allows hackers to gain access to others. Hackers are able to lift a password from a site that was previously hacked.</p>
      <p>The stolen accounts on the dark web displayed the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/18/thousands-disney-plus-accounts-hacked-sale-dark-web/">type of subscription</a> the user signed up for and when the account expires.</p>
      <p>The company says that only a small percentage of people were in this situation. Disney also reiterated that it has not found any evidence of a security breach.</p>
      <p>“We continuously audit our security systems and when we find an attempted suspicious login we proactively lock the associated user account and direct the user to select a new password,” the company said.</p>
      <p>Disney is encouraging users who have been impacted to reach out to its customer support department.</p>
