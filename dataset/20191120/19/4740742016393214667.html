      <p>Stevenage's caretaker manager Mark Sampson has been charged by the FA for using racist language, after an allegation by a former coach at the League Two club.</p>
      <p>The FA launched an investigation in September on the former Bristol Academy coach, with Stevenage stating at the time that the allegations had 'no foundation'.</p>
      <p>Sampson has been charged with an "aggravated breach" of FA rule E3 and has until 6 December to respond. According to PA Media, it is alleged the remark was aimed at a player during a conversation about transfer targets.</p>
      <p>It marks another incident for the 37-year-old boss, who was sacked by England in 2017 following 'inappropriate and unacceptable' behaviour with female players in his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mark-sampson-sacked-england-womens-532047">previous role in Bristol</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the FA agreed a settlement with Sampson in January after an unfair dismissal case but, prior to his departure in 2017, he was also cleared of any wrongdoing following discrimination allegations made by England players.</p>
      <p>The FA then apologised to Eni Aluko and England team-mate Drew Spence for Sampson's racially discriminatory remarks after an independent barrister ruled he made unacceptable "ill-judged attempts at humour" on two occasions.</p>
      <p>During Sampson's time in Bristol, he led the club to runners-up in the Women's Super League in 2013 as well as taking the club to FA Cup finals in 2011 and 2013.</p>
