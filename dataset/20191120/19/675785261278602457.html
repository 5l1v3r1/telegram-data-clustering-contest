      <h2>Prince Andrew, The Duke Of York, received approval from Her Majesty The Queen to release an extraordinary statement this evening after his car-crash Newsnight interview over his links to paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:01:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew has released an extraordinary statement this evening announcing he will be stepping back from public duties amid the fall-out from his BBC Newsnight interview.</p>
      <p>Companies and charity partners have deserted the Duke of York amid the public furore over his responses to questions about his relationship to  paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>And in his statement the prince said this had "become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here is his statement in full -</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</i>

      <p>
        <i>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Pressure has been mounting in recent days over the royal role of the Queen's second son after his high-profile interview about his links with the disgraced financier.</p>

      <p>Firms including telecoms giant BT and bank Barclays are among a number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which have distanced themselves from Andrew in the wake of the BBC interview.</p>
      <p>He told Newsnight's Emily Maitlis his relationship with Epstein was “seriously beneficial” because it gave him the opportunity to meet people and help prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>The comment led Green Party co-leader Sian Berry to suggest he was “not a very empathetic interview” and Catherine Mayer, founder of the Women’s Equality Party, to say he was “too stupid to even pretend concern for his victims."</p>
      <p>Andrew's initiative for tech entrepreneurs, Pitch@Palace, has removed its web page listing corporate supporters as they distance themselves from the Duke.</p>
      <p>Epstein was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges when he died in prison earlier this year, having previously pleaded guilty to paying to have sex with a girl below the age of 18.</p>
