      <p><b>Target</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/"><b><u>TGT</u></b></a>) earnings for the retail company’s <a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2019/11/target-reports-third-quarter-2019-earnings">third quarter of 2019</a> have TGT stock soring on Wednesday. This is thanks to its adjusted EPS of $1.36, which is well above Wall Street’s estimate of $1.19. Revenue of $18.67 billion also handily beats out analysts’ estimates of $18.49 billion for the quarter.</p>
