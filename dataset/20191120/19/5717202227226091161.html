      <h1>Jamie Carragher explains concerns behind Tottenham’s appointment of Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:45:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11865709/spurs-will-be-concerned-by-jose-style">Jamie Carragher has told Sky Sports</a> that there are concerns regarding Jose Mourinho’s appointment as Tottenham Hotspur manager, and believes the contrast in styles of Mourinho and Spurs could become an issue.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has agreed a deal that will keep him at Tottenham until the summer of 2023, replacing Mauricio Pochettino who was sacked on Tuesday evening after a poor start to the 2019-20 campaign. It has caused a split decision among Spurs fans.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager is renowned for playing defensive-minded football, sitting deep and looking to retain possession. Under Pochettino, Spurs played with a free-flowing attack and a high press.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if Mourinho will adapt his usual, cautious approach to allow Tottenham’s flair players to express themselves. Carragher believes that if things turn sour during Mourinho’s reign, a difference styles is likely to be the cause.</p>

      <p>“There will be concern over the style,” <a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/11865709/spurs-will-be-concerned-by-jose-style">Carragher said.</a> “That’s not just after Pochettino, Tottenham are known for playing in a certain way. It is a similar concern to what Manchester United supporters spoke about. That could be a problem.</p>
      <p>“Jose has his way of doing things. He’s not going to change. Tottenham hired Mourinho because he can win trophies and he will do it his way. I’m sure come Christmas, Tottenham will be challenging for the top four.</p>
      <p>“But if he isn’t successful at Tottenham, that is the sort of thing pundits and Tottenham supporters will throw back at him.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Mourinho needs to adapt to be Tottenham success</h3>
      <p>Tottenham’s squad of players are not specialised in playing defensive football. The likes of Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele and the rest of Spurs’ holding midfielders like to dominate possession, and feed the attackers.</p>
      <p>With Harry Kane as a focal point, Spurs play off the England skipper. Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela all look to profit when the ball is played to Kane.</p>
      <p>Changing that methodology would not only see Spurs struggle because they are not used to it, but they will also become frustrated with Mourinho for not adhering to their preferred style.</p>
