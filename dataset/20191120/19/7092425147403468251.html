      <p>A woman has gone viral after risking her own life to save a poor koala from burning in an Australian bushfire.</p>
      <p>Identified as Toni, the woman literally took the shirt off of her own back to help carry the animal to safety.</p>
      <p>The video shows the koala letting out squeals of pain as Toni douses it with cold water.</p>
      <p>The incident happened near Long Flat in New south Wales. Speaking to Nine News, the heroic woman said she would transport the inured animal to Port Macquarie Koala Hospital.</p>
      <p>Bushfires have ravaged areas across South Australia in recent weeks. Six people have died since last month, with a further 500 houses being destroyed.</p>
      <p>Australia's koala population has also been majorly impacted by the flames. More than 350 of the marsupials are feared dead as a result of the blazes.</p>

      <p>A GoFundMe page has since been set up to help the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital try to nurse the injured koalas back to health.</p>
      <p>The page reads:</p>
      <p>"The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital is an animal welfare, scientific research and education facility that will send out and conduct search and rescue exercises in the hope of finding surviving koalas</p>
      <p>"Any surviving koalas will be brought into the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital for assessment and treatment.</p>
      <p>"One way to help surviving koalas and other wildlife is to provide access to water to reduce further deaths from dehydration.</p>
      <p>"The Port Macquarie Koala Hospital would like to raise money to purchase and distribute automatic drinking stations which will assist in helping koala and wildlife survival."</p>
