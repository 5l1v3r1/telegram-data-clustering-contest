      <h1>Sling adds support for voice control and Google Assistant smart displays</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:45:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/mark-koegel/" target="_blank">Mark Koegel</a></address>
      <p>Cutting the cord is a difficult decision, but Sling makes it easier. Its service offers live TV so there's no need to give up on football, your local stations, or the 24-hour news cycle. Sling has supported Chromecast for <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/03/sling-tv-adds-support-for-chromecast-streaming/">some time now</a>, and today the company is adding voice control options as well as the ability to stream on your Google Assistant smart displays.</p>
      <p>Setting up Sling to work with your Google Assistant devices is similar to adding any other streaming service: you must first find the "Videos and Photos" section in Google Assistant settings (a somewhat easier task since the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/04/google-home-app-2-15-gets-a-simpler-ui-new-media-playback-cards-and-event-history/">Google Home app redesign</a>) where you can link your Sling account. As this is a server-side change, it may take some time until you see Sling as a video provider while the new service rolls out. Having linked your account, you can ask an Assistant speaker to play any Sling content on your TV or Smart Display.</p>

        <i>The Videos and Photos section of the Home app, accessible via Home -&gt; Settings -&gt; TV &amp; video. Note that it isn't available for me above, as it hasn't rolled out to everyone just yet.</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you'd like to try the new viewing and control options but you don't have a Sling account, Sling is offering new customers a free 3-day trial. After that, subscriptions start at $25 a month.</p>
