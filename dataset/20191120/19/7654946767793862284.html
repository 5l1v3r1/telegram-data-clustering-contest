      <h1>GM accuses rival Fiat Chrysler of bribe scheme in lawsuit</h1>

      <p>General Motors sued Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Wednesday, accusing its rival automaker of corrupting labor negotiations with a long-running union bribery scheme.</p>
      <p>The suit — filed on the heels of a monthlong strike against the nation’s largest automaker — says GM has suffered “massive monetary damage in the form of higher costs” because of Fiat’s bribes to top United Auto Workers officials.</p>
      <p>“This lawsuit is intended to hold FCA accountable for the harm its actions have caused our company and to ensure a level playing field going forward,” Craig Glidden, GM’s executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Fiat got an upper hand in the negotiation, administration and implementation of labor pacts by paying millions of dollars in bribes to UAW officials going back to 2009, GM alleges. The automaker says the scheme corrupted bargaining agreements from 2009, 2011 and 2015.</p>
      <p>The 95-page complaint filed in a Michigan federal court names three former Fiat Chrysler officials whom federal prosecutors charged in their criminal probe of the union bribery scheme. Alphons Iacobelli, Jerome Durden and Michael Brown were all sentenced to prison time last year following their guilty pleas.</p>
      <p>GM filed the suit less than a month after the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/25/uaw-workers-accept-deal-with-gm-after-40-day-strike/">end of a 40-day strike</a> by the company’s 47,000 UAW workers that cost the firm about $2 billion.</p>
      <p>Fiat said it was “astonished” by both the content and timing of GM’s lawsuit. The company is trying to merge with the French automaker PSA, home to the Peugeot and Citroën brands, and is also negotiating with the UAW, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-fiat-chrysler-lawsuit/gm-sues-fca-alleging-bribery-corruption-of-union-bargaining-process-idUSKBN1XU29V?il=0">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
      <p>“We can only assume this was intended to disrupt our proposed merger with PSA as well as our ongoing negotiations with the UAW,” Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. “We intend to vigorously defend against this meritless lawsuit and pursue all legal remedies in response to it.”</p>
