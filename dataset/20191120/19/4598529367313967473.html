      <p>Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) got a round of applause after delivering a dig against President Trump during the public testimony of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After Rep. Mike Conway (R-TX) brought up a Washington Post article, which mentioned that House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff’s (D-CA) claim that “the whistleblower has a statutory right to anonymity received three Pinocchios,” Speier said that “the President of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis — so let’s not go there.”</p>
      <p>Speier’s remark prompted laughs and applause.</p>
