      <p>Over 600 people came out to the first North Okanagan-Shuswap Job Fair in March, and organizers for next year's event are expecting even bigger numbers.</p>
      <p>"This is the only job fair of its kind and the overwhelming success of the first event last year told us this is something both job-seekers and employers value, so we’re looking forward to building on that momentum and hosting another successful job fair this year,” says Connie Viszlai, the Business Services Advisor for Community Futures North Okanagan.</p>
      <p>The second fair will be held on March 9 at the Splatsin Community Centre in Enderby, which was where the first one was also held.</p>
      <p>"The fair was created to bring together employers and job-seekers from across the region that might not otherwise have a chance to connect, and it was wonderful to see those connections being made last year,” says Patti Noonan, Manager of Armstrong Spallumcheen Chamber of Commerce. "Some job-seekers were hired on the spot and nearly 60 organizations had a chance to showcase their services and products."</p>
      <p>Noonan says they've already received requests from many businesses and schools, and she encourages employers to book a table soon.</p>
      <p>Early bird table registration is $100 until Dec 1, and Dec 1 to Feb 29 registration is $130. To register, you can go online to the <a href="http://www.aschamber.com/">Armstrong Chamber of Commerce</a> or <a href="http://www.futuresbc.com/">Community Futures Okanagan</a>.</p>
