        <b>Microsoft unveiled its new Office app for Android and iOS, combining the power of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint into one package.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Up until now, if you wanted to use Microsoft Office on your mobile device, you’d have to download three separate apps. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-Apps-Blog/Introducing-Office-Your-new-go-to-mobile-app-for-getting-work/ba-p/977172">Microsoft’s new Office app</a> (currently in public preview only) combines the power of all three in a single download, becoming the central hub for your Office needs.</p>
      <p>The new app also makes it easier for Microsoft to showcase individual features in each app, like the ability to transfer files from computer to phone, convert images into text or tables, scan pictures into PDFs, and even scan QR codes.</p>
      <p>In the past, these features have been hidden among the plethora of capabilities available in each app, but now the company can highlight them as key quick wins for mobile use. This also helps provide Office users with a truly mobile experience whenever they need it.</p>

      <p>While the apps themselves are identical in terms of features and functionality, a single download means a lot less storage needed on a user’s device. On top of that, users can access all of their recent documents (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) from a single location. No more searching for files across different apps.</p>
      <p>As Microsoft’s Bill Doll explains, “The new Office mobile app represents our vision for what a productivity solution would look like if first built for mobile devices. In designing this new experience, we first considered how people’s expectations differ when using a phone versus a computer, so we set out to optimize for simplicity, efficiency, and common mobile needs.”</p>

      <p>You can now download the Office app on for Android (public preview), but the public preview for iOS apps has reached its maximum capacity of 10,000 users. Microsoft says it “saw extraordinarily strong interest in the Office app and reached the capacity limit for iOS within a few hours” of its announcement.</p>
      <p>Currently, the new Office mobile app is available for public preview. Access the Android public preview <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-Apps-Blog/Office-app-for-Android-How-to-access-the-public-preview/ba-p/976713">here</a> and iOS <a href="https://aka.ms/OfficePreviewforiOS">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Note though, that as of right now this new app is strictly available to phone users. Microsoft has yet to launch iPad or Android tablet versions.</p>
