      <p>There’s no word on where <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> films will go once <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a> arrives in theaters next month. But some big names might shape the future of the franchise. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357">The Hollywood Reporter</a> recently posted an article discussing the future of the series. And it may mean that Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni could play a huge part in shaping <b>Star Wars</b>‘ destiny.</p>
      <p>Favreau is currently the showrunner on the Disney+ series <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-mandalorian"><b>The Mandalorian</b></a> and he’s already planning <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/457637-jon-favreau-shares-more-details-about-the-mandalorian-season-2">the second season</a>. Filoni helped revive <b>Star Wars</b> with the animated series <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-clone-wars"><b>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</b></a> and <b>Star Wars Rebels</b>. Filoni also directed the debut episode of <b>The Mandalorian</b>, and produces the series with Favreau.</p>
      <p>Although the report didn’t specify what their roles might entail, it does say that Favreau and Filoni will have “a lot of say over the future of <b>Star Wars</b>.”</p>

      <p>However, the report shoots down rumors that Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige will takeover for Kathleen Kennedy. Even though Feige <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/467433-kevin-feige-developing-star-wars-film">has a <b>Star Wars</b> project in the works</a>, he’s staying the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following his promotion to chief creative officer.</p>
      <p>Finally, the report indicates that the next <b>Star Wars</b> movie, due sometime in 2022, has a new director. There’s no official announcement yet, but a reveal will reportedly come early next year. The report also noted that <b>The Last Jedi</b> director Rian Johnson is still working on his own <b>Star Wars</b> project.</p>
