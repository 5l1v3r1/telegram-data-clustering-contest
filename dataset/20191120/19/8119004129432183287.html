        <b>The first consignment of onion by air has arrived in Bangladesh as the government grapples with skyrocketing prices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A cargo plane hauling the consignment of 82 tonnes touched down at Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 7:15pm on Wednesday, AHM Touhid-ul Ahsan, a director of the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh for the airport, told bdnews24.com.</p>

      <p>Saad International brought the onion from Karachi by an Azerbaijan-based Silk Way Airlines plane, Dhaka Customs House Assistant Commissioner Sazzad Hossain said.</p>
      <p>Onion prices have continued to surge since Sept 29 when India banned exports to control domestic prices, prompting the government to take several measures to tame the spiralling price.</p>
      <p>Prices rose to Tk 180 a kg, which is a Tk 30 jump in two days, after Cyclone Bulbul that struck the coastline on Nov 9 squeezed supplies. The prices continued to rise and hovered around Tk 250, a record in Bangladesh, over the weekend.</p>

      <p>To deal with the situation, the government decided to import onions from Egypt, Turkey, China and other countries.</p>
      <p>It later decided to import onion through airways for faster shipments.</p>
      <p>The government has also decided to waive cargo handling charges on onion imports on the flights of flag carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines.</p>
