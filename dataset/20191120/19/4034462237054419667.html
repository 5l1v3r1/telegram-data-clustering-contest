      <p>A new era for Mercedes has begun. Last year, the all-electric <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/eqc-suv">Mercedes-Benz EQC</a> made its public debut at the Paris Auto Show and is the first of many new electric models that will form part of the new Mercedes EQ family. Trying to steal some spotlight from the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e">Ford Mustang Mach-E</a>'s LA Auto Show debut, Mercedes has confirmed the all-electric EQC will arrive in US dealers in early 2020 with a starting price of $67,900, plus a $995 destination and delivery charge.</p>
      <p>This makes the Mercedes EQC cheaper than its electric SUV rivals such as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-x">Tesla Model X</a>, which starts at $84,990, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/e-tron-suv">Audi e-tron</a>, which starts at $74,800, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/i-pace">Jaguar I-Pace</a>, which starts at $69,850.</p>

      <p>Powering the Mercedes EQC 400 4MATIC, to give the SUV its full name, are two electric motors with one driving the front wheels and the other driving the rear wheels. This setup produces a combined 402 hp and 564 lb-ft of torque, enabling the electric SUV to sprint to 62 mph 4.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 112 mph. Under the floor is an 80 kWh lithium-ion battery that provides an estimated driving range of 200 miles on a single charge. Using DC fast charging, the EQC can be recharged from 10-80 percent in just 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>As standard, the Mercedes EQC comes equipped with the Mercedes-Benz User Experience (MBUX) infotainment system that displays EQ-specific functions such as range, charge status, and energy flow.</p>
