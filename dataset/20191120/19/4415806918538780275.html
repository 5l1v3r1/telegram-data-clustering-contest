      <h1>Plain packaging of cigarettes credited with drop in number of smokers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:22:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Plain packaging of tobacco products is being branded a success, with the number of smokers here dropping by 165,000 in the last five years.</p>
      <p>Changes to packaging were introduced by the government last year to encourage people to stop smoking.</p>
      <p>17% of the population now smoke, down from 23% in 2015.</p>
      <p>One in four who took part in the Healthy Ireland survey said plain packaging had encouraged them to give up.</p>
      <p>Minister for Health Simon Harris said: "I welcome the findings of this year’s Healthy Ireland Survey and in particular the continued drop in the smoking rate.</p>
      <p>“This shows that our multi-pronged approach, with legislation, support for smoking cessation and policies to denormalise smoking in our society, is bearing fruit and we are heading in the right direction to being a tobacco-free Ireland.”</p>
