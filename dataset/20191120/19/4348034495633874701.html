      <p>Following last year’s Grammy nomination for <i>DAYTONA</i>, Pusha-T has been a Rap role-player in 2019. He appeared on lauded albums by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Ssx21OFFRNJMMvlG2xeWV?si=0aURd8l5RJ2jS78MhjPabw">Freddie Gibbs &amp; Madlib</a>, <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/06/pusha-t-benny-griselda-18-wheeler-audio/">Benny The Butcher</a>, GoldLink, and <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/11/pusha-t-ybn-cordae-nightmares-video/">YBN Cordae</a>. At the same time, Push’ released <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/08/pusha-t-lauryn-hill-show-what-hip-hop-sounds-like-if-they-rule-the-world/">a collaboration with Lauryn Hill</a>, plus <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/10/kanye-west-clipse-use-this-gospel-audio/">reunited with brother NoMalice for Kanye West’s “Use This Gospel”</a> less than one month ago.</p>
      <p>As Pusha’s output begins ramping up to a <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/12/best-rap-album-2018-pusha-t-vs-evidence/"><i>DAYTONA</i></a> follow-up that’s been in the works, he drops two grabbing feature verses with DJ Shadow. “Been Use Ta” is a tandem collabo’ on Shadow’s just-released double-album, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4ATB4gtjhqILtvNRQsTPrh?si=wMZdbDd9R2CbFNbe_fReRw"><i>Our Pathetic Age</i></a>. As he’s done before on <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/11/pusha-ts-untouchable-video-makes-it-crystal-clear-how-cold-his-wordplay-is-video/">“Untouchable,”</a>  the Virginia vet honors Biggie Smalls. “<i>It’s the N-O-T-O-R-I-O / U-S You just lay down slow / The flows are being copied at Kinkos / Kinda like Vegas did to Reno / But it’s only one Push Tarantino / The only gun in the room held by a gringo / Cinco de Mayo, powder to the pyro’ / Sing a lullaby to you stans like I’m Dido / It’s proven suicidal when you turn your idols into rivals / My brother turned a brick into a</i> Bible <i>/ Hov turned Apple into Tidal / Tom Brady still throwing spirals / The Bulls legacy is all Michael’s / Kawhi blacking out in the Finals / You witnessing the best of both cycles,</i>” he begins.</p>

      <p>For his part, the accomplished producer uses an elaborate chunk of pianos, hard drums, and vocal accents. The turntablist also stabs in screwed Rap vocals that say, “<i>I been used to playin’ in the shadows.</i>” That sentiment applies to Pusha Ton’s past as well as the Bay Area producer/DJ’s rap sheet of accomplishments that date back to the early 1990s.</p>
