      <h1>Netanyahu and Gantz Both Failed to Form a Governing Coalition. What Happens Now?</h1>
      <h2>The next 21 days will determine whether Israel is headed to a third election cycle within a year, as the nomination of a leader to form a government now goes to the Knesset floor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:38:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968265" target="_blank">Jonathan Lis</a></address>
      <p>After two failed rounds of unity talks, the first led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately after the September 17 election and the second by Kahol Lavan leader Benny Gantz, Israel is entering uncharted political territory. </p>
      <p>Following <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-gantz-meet-lieberman-israel-election-unity-government-1.8136896">Gantz's announcement </a>Wednesday night that he was unable to form a governing coalition, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-reuven-rivlin-1.5599274">President Reuven Rivlin</a> released a statement saying that he will officially inform Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein on Thursday that the nomination will now go to the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-knesset-1.5599215">Knesset </a>floor. </p>
      <p>The Knesset now has 21 days to back a candidate. Any Knesset member with the backing of at least 61 out of 120 lawmakers would be tapped to form a coalition on a first come, first serve basis. </p>
      <p>The Knesset's legal adviser Eyal Yinon said lawmakers could back more than one candidate. He also stated that backing a candidate in a petition to President Rivlin doesn't necessarily require support for that candidate's coalition in a Knesset vote.</p>
      <p>The selected nominee, who would be officially tasked by Rivlin within two days of him receiving a signed petition by a majority of Knesset members, will then have 14 days to form a coalition.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers may nominate any Knesset member, including Netanyahu and Gantz.</p>
      <p>The deadline for the Knesset to tap a candidate is December 11. If no nominee is selected, or if the nominee also fails, Israel's third election in less than a year will be held within 90 days.</p>
