      <p>Meghana Suraj Nair was in for a pleasant surprise when she made a request to city football club Bengaluru FC (BFC) on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Tagging BFC’s Twitter handle, Ms. Nair asked if she could carry hot water from home to Sree Kanteerava Stadium for BFC’s highly anticipated ISL match against Kerala Blasters on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ms. Nair explained that she needed to stay hydrated and take medications as she was 33 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>Tournament rules generally do not permit spectators to carry bottles into the venue.</p>
      <p>Ms. Nair was delighted to read a positive reply from BFC. The club offered her a complimentary seat in the owner’s box, where all her requirements would be met.</p>
      <p>“Never expected such a humble gesture!! Thank you so much @bengalurufc,” a grateful Ms. Nair tweeted.</p>
