      <p>ET <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jojo-siwa-defends-north-west-over-rocking-a-nose-ring-and-wearing-makeup-exclusive-136665">recently spoke with JoJo Siwa</a>, who spent some time with Kim and her oldest daughter on this season of <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i>, about North's fashion statements</p>
      <p>"North is six, right? She's six years old, she's a little, tiny peanut," she continued. "If she wants to wear a nose ring and play dress up, [let her]. You know, when you were a little kid, you used to [do that]."</p>
