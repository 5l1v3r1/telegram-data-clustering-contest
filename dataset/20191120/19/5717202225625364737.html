      <p>Everton fans believe Anthony Gordon deserves his chance in the first-team.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1497669/grounded-teenager-gordon-explains-explosive-start">Gordon has told evertontv</a> that he will continue to improve and wait for his chance. He is not taking anything for granted and wants to get into a position where Marco Silva calls him up.</p>
      <p>Gordon has been the standout performer in the Everton academy team this season. Offering goals, assists and excitement, the 18-year-old is also making a name for himself at youth level for England. He now wants to add to his one first-team outing.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.evertonfc.com/news/1497669/grounded-teenager-gordon-explains-explosive-start">Gordon told evertontv</a>: “I just try to enjoy myself and get better every day. You never sit down and think, ‘I have a chance’. That is for other people to say. I am just trying to keep getting better and progressing.</p>
      <p>“To be around it shows I am progressing well. But I am not there yet. I am not starting for the first team and I still have so much to do.”</p>
      <p>Everton posted an infographic showing Gordon’s comments. Fans are impressed with his attitude and hope he sticks around at the club and gets his chance soon. Here are the best tweets.</p>
