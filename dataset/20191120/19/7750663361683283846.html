      <p>After being brought in as a replacement for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, Mourinho is expected to be handed significant funds to strengthen his first-team squad.</p>
      <p>According to <i>AS</i>, that could result in an approach being made for Bale, who will be allowed to leave the Bernabeu for the right price.</p>
      <p>The Wales international enjoyed a hugely impressive spell with Spurs before linking up with the Spanish giants in 2013.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Mourinho is motivated to get the best out of the 30-year-old after witnessing the attacker fall out of favour under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Bale still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract at Los Blancos.</p>
