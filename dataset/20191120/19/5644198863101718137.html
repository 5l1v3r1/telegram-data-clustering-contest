      <p>COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's prime minister will announce his resignation to the nation later Wednesday (Nov 20), bringing his government to an end following his party's presidential election debacle, officials told AFP.</p>
      <p>Ranil Wickremesinghe's move will clear the way for new President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/gotabaya-rajapaksa-storms-to-victory-in-sri-lanka-election-12101248">elected on Saturday in a landslide</a>, to appoint a replacement of his choice and a new government.</p>

      <p>"The prime minister will have a final meeting with his cabinet as well as other leaders of his coalition before addressing the nation to announce his resignation," the official said on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Wickremesinghe's party put forward Sajith Premadasa in the presidential election but was soundly beaten by Rajapaksa in a highly divisive election in the island nation of 21.6 million.</p>

      <p>He and brother Mahinda Rajapaksa, are adored by the Sinhala-Buddhist majority - but loathed among minority Tamils - for spearheading the brutal crushing of Tamil Tiger separatists 10 years ago to end Sri Lanka's civil war.</p>
      <p>Around 40,000 Tamil civilians were allegedly killed by the military in the closing stages of the conflict when Gotabaya Rajapaksa effectively ran the security forces and his brother was president.</p>
      <p>During the three-month election campaign held in the shadow of Islamist extremist attacks in April, Rajapaksa had promised to make his charismatic and popular brother Mahinda his prime minister.</p>
      <p>Wickremesinghe came to power in 2015 on a promise to prosecute members of the outgoing Rajapaksa regime who were accused of corruption and even murder, but failed to bring any perpetrators to justice.</p>
      <p>He ended up facing accusations of cronyism and incompetence and was also implicated in several financial scandals himself.</p>
      <p>His government also presided over major security lapses that were blamed for the suicide bombings on three churches and three hotels that killed 269 people on Easter Sunday.</p>

      <p>Soon after Wickremesinghe's party lost Saturday's election at least 10 of his senior ministers, including finance minister Mangala Samaraweera, resigned.</p>
      <p>The current parliament was elected in August 2015 for a five-year term and cannot be dissolved by Rajapaksa until March, six months before its term ends.</p>
      <p>However, legislators through a majority resolution could ask for a snap poll.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa's party does not enjoy a majority in the 225-member assembly and must depend on Wickremesinghe's United National Party to form a minority government until the next parliamentary election.</p>
