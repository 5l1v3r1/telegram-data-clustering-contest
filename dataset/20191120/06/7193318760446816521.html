      <p>Ahead of that game, Coale talked about the lessons of the loss, the morning game atmosphere and Gabby Gregory’s performance so far:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What did you gain from the performance in the Preseason WNIT, including the 96-90 loss to Missouri State?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> "Two of the best quarters of basketball — one for them, one for us — that I’ve seen in a long, long time. For us, it’s defensive discipline. That when another team does things that are really good, you have to have the mental focus and ability to concentrate and believe in the process. Because sometimes teams are going to make plays and you can’t splinter away from the way you know you want to play, so they got to feel that. … That was a very real example for our guys. I think they walked away from it going, ‘Man, that was a really good team. We should’ve won.’"</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s the best thing about playing the field trip game?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I love it because there’s so much energy in the gym. You don’t have to manufacture anything. For our players on both teams there’s such an opportunity with a platform to influence another generation for participating in sports. It’s an opportunity that we need to make sure that we seize by playing the right way."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gabby Gregory scored 10 points in the opener but has scored just three combined in the last two. What do you think of how she’s performed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Tough as any kid I’ve ever had. She’s had pneumonia, and nobody knows. She just keeps playing. … We haven’t had a chance to see her at all in what she can do and what she’s going to be. She’s been playing sick, and she’s better now so I expect her to be really good this week."</p>
