      <p>Ward 5 Councilman David Greenwell says he opposes MAPS 4, citing a lack of data on how success of most projects will be measured.</p>
      <p>Greenwell made his comments during Tuesday's council meeting.</p>
      <p>In an interview later he said he intended to vote 'no' Dec. 10 but remained open should sufficient information on "measurable outcomes" be forthcoming before election day.</p>
      <p>Mayor David Holt, who missed Tuesday's meeting, said later by text that he was "always open to assisting Councilman Greenwell with whatever he needs."</p>
      <p>Like the mayor and other council members, Greenwell voted in August to put MAPS 4 on the ballot.</p>
      <p>But he had telegraphed his desire for information on how the 16 projects would be measured and circulated a questionnaire seeking specifics from the city's likely partners, particularly those aiming to address social ills, such as drug addiction, homelessness and mental illness.</p>
      <p>Greenwell said the MAPS 4 animal shelter was an example of a project with a clear goal — earning designation as a "no-kill" shelter, releasing at least 92% of animals alive.</p>
      <p>"We do, we're successful, we don't, we're not successful," he said. "That's when we're allowed to question what's wrong."</p>
      <p>For the OKC Fairgrounds coliseum, the stadium for soccer and other outdoor events, and the downtown arena, he said, "We should be provided with measurable outcomes in terms of revenue, expenses, both direct as well as indirect."</p>
      <p>For Chesapeake Energy Arena, built by the original MAPS, upgraded thanks to the Big League City vote, and now home of the NBA's Thunder, "We should be able to see how much revenue that facility is generating, expenses we're incurring to maintain that facility and, then, what can we expect in the future."</p>
      <p>Greenwell said it would be fair to factor into projections the possibility of the Thunder leaving Oklahoma City unless the MAPS 4 renovations and expansion are completed.</p>
      <p>Dan Straughan, executive director of The Homeless Alliance, said Tuesday that his organization received the questionnaire, completed it, and returned it Aug. 22.</p>
      <p>"To date," he said in an email, "our team hasn’t received any feedback or requests for additional information."</p>
      <p>Holt said the council "heard 26 hours of data-driven presentations over the summer."</p>
      <p>"That data ranged from the defined economic impact that comes from our facilities to the high rates of domestic violence in our community," he said.</p>
      <p>Holt said every MAPS 4 project was "meeting a critical need in our community that is not only acutely felt by our citizens in their daily lives but was also demonstrated by data."</p>
      <p>At Greenwell's request, he said, the MAPS 4 resolution specified projects would have measurable outcomes.</p>
      <p>"MAPS has always been led by the people," Holt said, adding that a citizen advisory board would conduct oversight and ensure MAPS 4 projects attain measurable outcomes.</p>
      <p>Greenwell said he was hearing rumblings from residents regarding MAPS 4 and how taxpayers would know whether dollars are being spent effectively.</p>
      <p>In MAPS 3, he said, there are examples of projects that "have not proceeded as we anticipated."</p>
      <p>The council lacks metrics, though, to be able to make a judgment, Greenwell said.</p>
      <p>He referred in part to the MAPS 3 whitewater park, which has received authorization for $11.4 million in the past 18 months to add revenue-enhancing amenities and make up budget shortfalls at the Oklahoma City Boathouse Foundation, the city's operating partner.</p>
      <p>The foundation saw a steep decline in private support after the death in 2016 of Aubrey McClendon, a key benefactor.</p>
