      <p>SHAWNEE — Siblings of slain Tecumseh police officer Justin Terney confronted the man who killed their brother Tuesday, telling Byron Shepard he broke their hearts and changed their lives forever.</p>
      <p>"I still don't know why people choose to take a life. I don't know if we ever will," a tearful Corey Terney told jurors who will decide whether Shepard lives or dies. "I do know that I cannot forgive the person who took my brother's life."</p>
      <p>Tonisha Rapp cried while she recalled standing by her brother's hospital bed and hearing the words "there's nothing more that we can do."</p>
      <p>"I watched the life drain out of him while we all stood there, talking, crying, begging him not to go," she testified. "I watched his body turn ashy as he died."</p>
      <p>Rapp said her brother "took the burden of interacting with dangerous people" and was executed "for no real reason."</p>
      <p>"Justin did not die in vain, he died a hero," she said. "And a hero that this heinous criminal will never take away from him."</p>
      <p>Nicole Marks said her baby brother dreamed of becoming a police officer.</p>
      <p>"Byron Shepard ended Justin's life, ended Justin's dream," Marks told jurors.</p>
      <p>The victim impact statements were entered into evidence during the penalty phase of Shepard's trial, which continues Wednesday in the courtroom of Pottawatomie County District Judge John G. Canavan Jr.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty as punishment for Shepard, 38, of Okemah. He was convicted Monday of killing Terney, 22, on March 26, 2017, following a traffic stop and chase on foot.</p>
      <p>They allege Shepard is a "continuing threat to society."</p>
      <p>"Doing what's right isn't always easy, but it's always right," prosecutor Pattye High told jurors. "At the conclusion of this case, I submit to you there will be one sentence that represents justice. And jail isn't an option for Byron Shepard."</p>
      <p>In her opening statement, public defender Rayven Sealy told jurors they deserve to know more about Shepard before making such a "heavy decision."</p>
      <p>"There are things that you will hear in mitigation. They are not offered as an excuse for what happened," Sealy said. "It's an explanation. An explanation of what happened and an explanation of who that person is sitting in front of you."</p>
      <p>Also Tuesday, a convicted felon and two former love interests testified about physical abuse they suffered at the hands of Shepard.</p>
      <p>The felon, Christopher Buxton, said Shepard beat him with a pipe or an aluminum bat in 2011. Prosecutors alleged Shepard lured Buxton to a woman's house by sending him a text message from her phone.</p>
      <p>"His exact words were 'the only way you are leaving here is in a body bag,'" said Buxton, who is serving a prison sentence for manslaughter in Missouri.</p>
      <p>Two women, including an ex-wife, told jurors Shepard routinely beat them when he used methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>One of the witnesses recalled Shepard choking her until she "passed out" and said he once kicked her so hard "I went down the stairs" while holding the couple's baby.</p>
      <p>A third woman testified about Shepard pointing a rifle at her during a dispute in 2007 when the woman was pregnant.</p>
