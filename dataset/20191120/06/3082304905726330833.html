        <b>Tottenham’s decision to sack manager Mauricio Pochettino came as a surprise to defender Ben Davies.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham defender Ben Davies described the Premier League club’s decision to sack manager Mauricio Pochettino as a “big shock”.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday after five and a half years at the helm, departing following a poor start to the 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>Champions League runners-up in June, Tottenham have won just three of their opening 12 Premier League games and are 14th in the table.</p>
      <p>Davies, who has made just five league appearances for Spurs this season, said he was surprised.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t really know about it until after the game,” he said after Wales’ win over Hungary secured their spot at Euro 2020 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“But it was a big shock. He’s been amazing to work with for the last five years and it’s a shame to see him go.”</p>

      <p>Davies played 90 minutes during Wales’ victory against Hungary as they progressed from Group E.</p>
      <p>Tottenham, meanwhile, are reportedly set to appoint Jose Mourinho as manager ahead of visiting West Ham on Saturday.</p>
