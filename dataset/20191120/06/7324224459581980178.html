      <h1>Legal ‘flaw’ over travellers’ site parking at Wolverhampton Science Park</h1>
      <h2>Land earmarked for a travellers’ car park on Wolverhampton Science Park is protected by a High Court injunction, it can be revealed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:05:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/thomas-parkes/" target="_blank">Thomas Parkes</a></address>
      <p>The site was plagued by illegal traveller camps until it was made a no-go zone for them by law.</p>
      <p>Nigel Babb, commercial director of the Science Park, said he was gobsmacked to learn the city council now wants to use the Park and Ride car park in Showell Road for travellers’ cars and vans labelling it a flawed plan.</p>

      <p>He said: “A High Court injunction was put in place that protects the facility from illegal traveller incursions and this has had a positive impact.</p>
      <p>"It therefore appears counter-intuitive that the council would then chose to use this protected site as part of the solution to temporarily re-locate travellers.”</p>

      <p>More than 100 objections have piled up against the proposals for the entire scheme, which would see travellers being able to stay for up to 28 days while they are living at a transit site in nearby Gorsebrook Road.</p>
      <p>The transit site is planned on green space which backs onto residents' homes next to the Dunstall Hill Trading Estate, just down from the Winning Post pub.</p>

      <p>Mr Babb warned: “It would have negative first impressions for visitors to the Science Park, often conference delegates or tenant clients, preventing potential future business.”</p>
      <p>Some firms <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/2019/11/05/firms-quit-threat-over-travellers-site/">have threatened to leave the Science Park if the plan goes ahead.</a></p>

      <p>The Science Park, which hosts more than 80 businesses and is run by the University of Wolverhampton, is 500 metres away from the planned transit site, which will cater for up to 13 traveller families for up to a month at a time.</p>
      <p>Planning chiefs at the council have asked for more time to consider the application for the travellers site, <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/2019/11/05/decision-on-travellers-site-in-wolverhampton-moved-to-next-year/">with a decision currently set to be made in January.</a></p>
      <p>The authority was heavily criticised for its handling of a public meeting in October, where <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/wolverhampton/whitmore-reans/2019/10/08/watch-fury-over-traveller-transit-site-plan-laid-bare-at-meeting/">neighbours loudly voiced their opposition to the £1 million scheme</a> and complained about council communication on the issue.</p>
      <p>Ross Cook, director of city environment at Wolverhampton Council, said: “We are taking the time to consider the application and will address any legitimate concerns.”</p>
