      <p>Laiza Musakara (43) appeared before Mbare magistrate Ms Elizabeth Magomore facing charges of sending offensive messages via mobile phone to Sibusisiwe Dube (48)</p>
      <p>In her ruling, Ms Magomore said the court took into consideration that Musakara was a first offender who pleaded guilty to the offence of sending offensive or false telephone messages.</p>
      <p>“The court does not support Musakara’s behaviour of using abusive messages via the cellphone, which the national law of sending and receiving messages does not support at all,” she said.</p>

      <p>“However, the court takes into consideration that the matter is not criminal in nature, hence suitable to be given a light sentence.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Mr Allan Mandishona alleged that on August 14 2019, Dube was in Mberengwa when Musakara send text messages insulting her, saying she was a witch doctor, as well as a prostitute.</p>
      <p>Musakara went on to threaten Dube that she would come to her residence and work place to embarass.<a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/abusive-messages-lands-woman-in-court/"><b> The Herald</b></a></p>
