        <b>The story dates back to February 2018 when a handful of audio tracks were reportedly added to the list. Currently, the playlist, dubbed "worst songs to have sex to" comprises 13 melodies which are not recommended by netizens for lustful pleasures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mashable drew attention to the playlist earlier this week, originally created on Spotify. The playlist, what netizens <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201909121076786158-france-twitter-death-sex-work-accident/">describe as containing 'anti-sex' music</a>, instantly went viral.</p>

      <p>The playlist includes such tracks as "Peanut Butter Jelly Time," "Everything is AWESOME!!!", and the Law &amp; Order theme song. Netizens instantly mocked the list.</p>

      <p>​According to Mashable, the playlist appears to have been created only two days after Valentine's Day 2018 but new songs have been occasionally added.</p>
      <blockquote>"The original playlist actually started from an article that I saw (I can’t even remember the media platform) that talked about the top <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201907101076207521-german-mp-like-hard-core-porn-twitter/">10 worst songs to have sex</a> to [...] In my head, I was like 'Oh there are way worse' so I started the playlist with those few and started to add to it", said Veronica, a hopefully-old-enough student in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who created the playlist, according to Mashable.</blockquote>
