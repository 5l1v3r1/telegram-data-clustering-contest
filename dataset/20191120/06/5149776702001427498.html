      <p>Two people in Nottinghamshire are celebrating after bagging a £1,000 cash prize thanks to their lucky postcode.</p>
      <p>The Lambley Road neighbours pocketed the cash when their postcode was announced as a Daily Prize winner with People’s Postcode Lottery on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to the winners and said: “This is such a great surprise for our players in Nottingham! I’m so happy for them and I hope they enjoy their winnings.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/three-beeston-winners-bag-cash-3218647">Postcode Lottery</a> said: "A minimum of 32% of ticket sales goes directly to charities and players of People’s Postcode Lottery have raised £486 million to date for thousands of good causes in Britain and beyond.</p>
      <p>"This draw was promoted by Friends of the Earth, which has received over £7.2 million in funding from the players of People’s Postcode Lottery.</p>
      <p>"This support helps it campaign for environmental and social causes around the world."</p>
      <p>Many good causes close to the winners have also benefitted from players support, and the next opportunity local charities will have to apply for funding will be early next year.</p>
