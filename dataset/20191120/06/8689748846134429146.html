      <p>Rapper Joey B has blamed his friend and colleague D-Back for signing too many artists onto his record label which resulted in a mass exodus.</p>
      <p>Rapper and business mogul, D-Black had the likes of Wisa, Dahlin Gage, Freda Rhymz and Koblah Jnr leaving his Black Avenue Muzik citing lack of progress for their decision.</p>
      <p>The other artists left are not flourishing and from the look of things, they could all leave sooner than later.</p>
      <p>On this note, Joey B believes the avoidable problem started when D-Black decided to sign a lot of artists at the same time.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s where he fell short. He should have done it one or two at a time. He did too much with too many artists, unless he had some serious funding from somewhere but Ghana is hard,” he revealed to Nana Adwoa Sarkodie on Citi TV.</p>
      <p>“I feel like it’s something he should not have done. I feel he bit more than he could chew. Sometimes you need to take your time</p>
      <p>Joey also noted that it appeared D-Black was wasting the artistes’ time.</p>
      <p>“What you said you would do and what you promised them you could not do it because you are busy yourself.</p>
      <p>He didn’t really interpret what he wanted to do properly. We are all human beings and everyone wants to move nobody wants to be stagnant,” he further stated.</p>
