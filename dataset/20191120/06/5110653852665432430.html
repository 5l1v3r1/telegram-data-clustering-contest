      <h1>Vegas Golden Knights' Marc-Andre Fleury makes mind-blowing glove save, earns 450 career wins</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:04:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:04</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>Marc-Andre Fleury saved the Vegas Golden Knights' game against the Toronto Maple Leafs Tuesday with one of the best saves of the season — and quite possibly Fleury's career.</p>
      <p>Caught out of position after Toronto forward Ilya Mikheyev's shot rang off the post, Fleury had to dive across the crease in a desperate attempt to stop Nic Petan's backhand rebound from going in the net.</p>
      <p>Stop it, he did . . . and in mind-boggling fashion, snatchingthe puck out of mid-air before it could reach the net's top-left corner.</p>

      <p>The save prevented the Maple Leafs from tying the game with just minutes to play in the third period and helped Vegas secure a 4-2 win.</p>
      <p>Fleury made 31 shots on 33 saves in the victory and <a href="https://twitter.com/PR_NHL/status/1197026863404716033">earned his 450th NHL win</a> in the process — making him just the seventh goalie in league history to do so.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old currently trails his peer Henrik Lundqvist (453 wins) on <a href="https://records.nhl.com/records/goaltender-records/wins/most-wins-career">the all-time wins list</a> andwill soon surpass Curtis Joseph (454).Martin Brodeur (691) holds the league's all-time record for most wins by a goaltender.</p>
