        <b>They had argued over a horse racing bet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And when they saw each other in a Singapore Pools outlet in Rangoon Road later, Hong Mee Yong, 70, got angry at Mr Lim Eng Pueh, 61, for staring at him.</p>
      <p>Hong then bought a 30cm-long slicer and slashed Mr Lim, leaving him with an open fracture to his right shoulder blade and wounds to his right elbow and forearm, all requiring surgery.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Hong was jailed four years after he pleaded guilty to causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon.</p>
      <p>He will serve two more days in prison as he was unable to pay the $4,019 in compensation ordered by the court.</p>
      <p>Hong, a flyer distributor at the time, first argued with Mr Lim on Aug 11.</p>
      <p>His lawyer Richard Siaw said Mr Lim was a bookie and his client was provoked by Mr Lim's refusal to pay out winnings on a bet.</p>
      <p>They did not interact when they saw each other in the following three days, but the lawyer said Hong felt disturbed by Mr Lim's fierce stares.</p>
      <p>The court heard that a week later on Aug 18, Hong bought the slicer in an Ang Mo Kio general store at about 10am.</p>
      <p>Hiding it in a plastic bag, he went to the Singapore Pools outlet in Rangoon Road, knowing Mr Lim would be there in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>Hong saw him watching a horse race on TV at the fourth storey.</p>
      <p>Contemplating whether to slash him, Hong sat at a nearby chair for over an hour before attacking him at about 1.40pm.</p>
      <p>He stopped after a member of the public intervened, Deputy Public Prosecutor Derek Ee told District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim.</p>
      <p>Fleeing the scene, Hong dumped the slicer in a dustbin at a third-storey staircase landing and went to Golden Mile Tower, where he bought a 7pm bus ticket to Hatyai, Thailand.</p>
      <p>But the police nabbed him before he could leave.</p>
      <p>Mr Lim was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and given 26 days' hospitalisation leave.</p>
      <p>His medical fees came up to over $4,500, mostly paid out from his Medisave account.</p>
      <p>DPP Ee said Hong acted with premeditation, deliberately arming himself with a highly dangerous weapon to exact a vicious attack on Mr Lim.</p>
      <p>Taking place in broad daylight and in a crowded area, the attack endangered the public and caused public alarm and fear, said the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>Hong's attempt to abscond was also an aggravating factor.</p>
      <p>Citing Hong's long rap sheet for other offences, the DPP said there had been an escalation in the nature and severity of Hong's criminal behaviour.</p>
      <p>He also disagreed with the defence's appeal for judicial mercy in light of a medical condition Hong suffered as it was not terminal.</p>
      <p>For causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon, Hong could have been jailed for life or jailed for up to 15 years, and also fined or caned.</p>
