      <h1>Rangers points predictor for defining December duel with Celtic</h1>
      <h2>Former Ibrox defender Hugh Burns has his say on how the games will go in the build-up to December derby.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers face a seven match spell that could leave their title challenge in a magnificent place.</p>
      <p>The Light Blues haven’t lifted the biggest prize in the Scottish game since 2011, but hopes are high that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> can derail Celtic’s dominance.</p>
      <p>The game at Hamilton Accies this weekend kick starts a run of key Premiership matches before the winter break, with only two of them at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Will <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> head to Dubai for a warm weather training camp in January with more than the glow of the sun on their backs?</p>
      <p>Former Ibrox favourite Hugh Burns tells Gary Ralston about the games that matter over the next five weeks - and how he reckons Rangers will cope.</p>

      <h3>Hamilton Accies v Rangers November 24</h3>
      <p>Rangers have never particularly enjoyed playing on that 4G surface but, with respect to Chipper Rice, they won’t need to be at their best to win.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> is in the form of his life and he’s likely to pop up with the goal that makes the difference.</p>
      <p>It’s a case of winning ugly and moving it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-0</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Rangers v Hearts December 1</h3>
      <p>Rangers have saved some of their best form for Europe this season and face the Jambos after their trip to Feyenoord.</p>
      <p>Rangers haven’t always been at their best in the league - Livingston at Ibrox springs to mind - but this is a must-win if they have serious title ambitions.</p>
      <p>Rangers saw off <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> comfortably in the Betfred Cup and are winning games this season, particularly at home, they were drawing last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 3-1</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Aberdeen v Rangers December 4</h3>
      <p>I don’t go with the Dons lying down to Celtic, but they always raise their game against Rangers.</p>
      <p>It’s always a war up there and Aberdeen’s players and fans seem more spurred on by this fixture than any other.</p>
      <p>However, Rangers have discovered an inner strength this season under Steven Gerrard that will stand them in good stead. The Dons aren’t as good as last time around and Rangers have improved. A tight one, but they’ll win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-0</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Motherwell v Rangers December 15</h3>
      <p>This will be the most difficult match of them all to this point and Rangers could be going into the match on an ultimate high or a bit of a downer.</p>
      <p>They could have qualified for the last 32 in Europe and have become Betfred Cup winners by the time this match is played.</p>
      <p>But even if they haven’t achieved those goals, Rangers know the Premiership is the most important competition they will play this season and that will inspire them to a narrow win against an impressive Well side.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-1</b>
      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Hibs v Rangers December 20</h3>
      <p>Rangers absolutely battered Hibs at Easter Road in March and could only come away with a 1-1 draw, but they’re a different animal these days.</p>
      <p>Hibs will be galvanised under Jack Ross, but they will also have a go - and Rangers have the players to exploit the gaps that open up on that big pitch.</p>
      <p>Rangers are enjoying playing at Easter Road these days more than at any other time in their recent history and will be too strong.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 3-1</b>
      </p>

      <h3>Rangers v Kilmarnock December 26</h3>
      <p>Angelo Alessio has turned it around and the players have finally bought into the philosophy he has introduced at Rugby Park.</p>
      <p>They will be defensive and well organised, but there will be a great atmosphere at Ibrox on Boxing Day and that will spur on the players.</p>
      <p>Let’s face it, Rangers have too much quality 11 against 11 and that will tell again, as it so often does.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-0</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Celtic v Rangers December 29</h3>
      <p>Collectively, Celtic have a lot of class and Neil Lennon is getting the best out of his team.</p>
      <p>I’ve said for years and been slaughtered for it, but if Scott Brown was a Rangers midfielder my old club would have won more often against their arch rivals.</p>
      <p>Celtic will only take Rangers seriously as title contenders the day they go to Parkhead and come away with a win, but the championship is also won and lost against the other clubs. It’ll be a blockbuster, but Rangers are good enough to get a point.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 1-1</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>TOTAL POINTS: </b>19 out of 21 available</p>
