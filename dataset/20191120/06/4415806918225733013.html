      <p>Emilia Clarke has revealed she felt uncomfortable with some of her nude scenes in Game Of Thrones.</p>
      <p>The British actress played queen Daenerys Targaryen in HBO’s sprawling epic, which became notorious for its explicit portrayal of sex and violence.</p>
      <p>Clarke, who was 23 when she started filming Game Of Thrones, said she would be in tears before shooting certain nude scenes.</p>

      <p>Speaking on actor Dax Shepard’s podcast, she said: “I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was like, ‘Oh, there’s the catch!’</p>
      <p>“But I’d come fresh from drama school and I approached it as a job, if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m going to make sense of it. Everything’s going to be cool.”</p>
      <p>Clarke, 33, added: “I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do, and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want, and I don’t know what I want.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of there being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I’m not worthy of requiring anything; I’m not worthy of needing anything at all.”</p>
      <p>However Clarke, who credited her Game Of Thrones co-star Jason Momoa with encouraging her to speak up about her reservations, said she became more “savvy” in her later roles.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, ‘No, the sheet stays up,’ and they’re like, ‘You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.’ And I’m like, ‘F*** you.'”</p>
      <p>Representatives for HBO and Game Of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss have been contacted for comment.</p>
