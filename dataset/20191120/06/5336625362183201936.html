      <p>Tuesday's episode of <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i> took to the streets to ask Trump supporters whether they felt the U.S. president should be impeached for his controversial actions. Unsurprisingly, they didn't, disagreeing across the board.</p>
      <p>However, the facts put to the public weren't actually about Donald Trump. Instead, they were very clear and obvious references to Richard Nixon. You know, that other U.S. president who also faced impeachment for doing crimes. The one who gave us the suffix "-gate" for every public scandal since the '70s. The one who resigned rather than drag everyone through further mud-slinging and suffering.</p>
      <p>None of the people interviewed twigged, though, even at the mention of "Vice President Gerald Ford." Instead, the interviewees gave their earnest opinions on why breaking into the DNC and stealing sensitive documents shouldn't be an impeachable offense, why the whistleblower is codenamed Deep Throat, and why it's all just "a distraction from the fighting in Vietnam." </p>
      <p>"I like Trump, I don't listen to the news, so..." shrugged one woman, displaying a confidence shockingly disproportionate to her knowledge.</p>
      <p>It seems you can slap the Trump brand on anything — even Watergate — and some people will eat it up.</p>
