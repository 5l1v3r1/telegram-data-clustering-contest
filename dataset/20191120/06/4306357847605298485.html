      <h3>Arsenal are set to scout Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai as a potential replacement for Granit Xhaka, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p>Website <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-arsenal-on-tuesday-transfer-mission-for-player-lined-up-to-replace-xhaka/">Football Insider</a> is reporting that Arsenal view Szoboszlai as a “genuine contender” to fill Xhaka’s void in midfield amid uncertainty over the Switzerland international’s future at the north London side.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Arsenal boss Unai Emery is eager to secure reinforcements in the middle of the park in the January transfer window as Xhaka looks set to leave The Emirates.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Gunners dispatched scouts to watch the 19-year-old represent Hungary in their clash against Wales in Euro 2020 qualifying on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p><i>Football Insider</i> go on to add that the north London side are long-term admirers of Szoboszlai after Arsenal expressed an interest in signing the Hungarian playmaker in the summer.</p>
      <p>The report lists Serie A giants Juventus and Inter Milan as potential rivals for the Hungary international signature.</p>
      <p>Szoboszlai has scored two goals and has made two assists in 10 games in the Austrian Premier League so far this season.</p>
      <p>The teenager moved to Red Bull Salzburg two years ago after the Austrian club signed the midfielder from FC Liefering.</p>
      <p>Xhaka hasn’t featured for Arsenal since his fall-out with Gunners fans in a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace at The Emirates last month.</p>
