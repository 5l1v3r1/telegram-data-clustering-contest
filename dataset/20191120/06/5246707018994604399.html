      <p>At the start of this year, Activision <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/02/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy_cracks_10_million_sales_mark">revealed</a> the <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_n_sane_trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a></b> had shifted more than 10 million units worldwide. <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a></b> followed this and managed to finish in <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/uk_charts_crash_team_racing_takes_the_chequered_flag_once_more">first place</a> on multiple occasions.</p>
      <p>The success of these classic games led to Activision's CEO Robert "Bobby" Kotick stating how there were "a lot of opportunities" to <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/activision_eager_to_revive_more_classics_after_the_success_of_crash_bandicoot">grow</a> existing IPs such as Crash and Spyro, and even consider "new content" after the remasters. It should come as no surprise then to hear that there's potentially another Crash Bandicoot game in the works.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/New_WabiSabi/status/1196957943758897155">@New_WabiSabi</a> – a leaker with a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/08/gamestops_internal_database_lists_multiple_new_skus_for_switch">good track record</a> – Activision has a "new" Crash game in the works:</p>

      <p>As noted in the tweet above, this is not believed to have links to the unconfirmed project "Crash Bandicoot Worlds", which is also now believed to be fake. In a follow-up tweet, Sabi notes how the "new" rumoured Crash game is likely being made by Vicarious Visions and possibly Toys for Bob.</p>
      <p>Adding to these rumours is a PlayStation ad from earlier this month that featured what is believed to be a new Crash Bandicoot mask. You can get a better look at the 11-second mark in the trailer below.</p>

      <p>Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled was revealed at last year's Game Awards on 6th December, so perhaps we'll hear something about a possible new game at the 2019 event.</p>
