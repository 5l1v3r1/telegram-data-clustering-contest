      <p>Parishioners at St Milburga’s Church in Beckbury, near Shifnal, pulled together to host a Christmas craft fair to raise money, and well-wishers turned out in force to support it.</p>
      <p>The church desperately needed £10,000 after bad weather broke its roof, and within weeks of launching an appeal, those who attend the church have managed to raise £7,500.</p>
      <p>The money came from a variety of sources, including stallholders offering to double what they had made at the fair, which took place on Saturday, and a very generous anonymous donor.</p>
      <p>David Tooth, of Beckbury, said: "We had a fantastic day on Saturday. It was very cold but we had some mulled wine going and everybody enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"One of the stall holders had raised £125 on her stalls, and she decided to double the figure.</p>
      <p>"Then some of the parishioners chipped in. The vicar received a telephone call from a lady anonymously saying she had read about the broken roof and offering a cheque for £1,000.</p>
      <h3>Outstanding</h3>
      <p>"We are over the moon. It is outstanding."</p>
      <p>Additional items not sold at the craft fair were later donated to Compton Hospice.</p>
      <p>The £1,212 raised from the craft fair, as well as the £1,000 cheque, have taken the churches total beyond the £7,500 mark.</p>
      <p>Fundraising events will pause for a month now while the church carries out its festive events, but Mr Tooth said they would be back with more events in 2020.</p>
      <p>Parishioners said the 13th century church was already showing its age, and that there had already been efforts going on to fix issues with the roof.</p>
      <p>But heavy wind and rain suddenly caused even more damage, leaving those who still use the listed building to pick up the pieces.</p>
