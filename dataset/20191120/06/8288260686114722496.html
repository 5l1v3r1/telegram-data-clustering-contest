      <p>The president of The Oxford Union has resigned his position after a blind student was forcibly removed from a debate event by a security guards.</p>
      <p>Postgraduate student Ebenezer Azamati was taken from the venue by a security guard when he tried to return to a seat before the debate last month.</p>
      <p>Union president Brendan McGrath wrote in a statement posted to Facebook late on Tuesday that he had resigned because it was his "job to ensure that every Member feels welcome at the Oxford Union".</p>
      <p>"For all of my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly," he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Azamati, an international relations scholar from Ghana, said his treatment left him feeling "unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country".</p>
      <p>He successfully appealed on Saturday against what he told the BBC were claims of "false violent disorder" by the union.</p>
      <p>The society operates independent of the university and has hosted speakers and debates since 1823.</p>
