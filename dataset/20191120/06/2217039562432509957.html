        <b>Argentina's Lionel Messi scored an added-time penalty to salvage a 2-2 draw with Uruguay, as they twice came from behind in an entertaining friendly match in Israel yesterday morning (Singapore time).</b>
      </p>
      <p>Argentina, now unbeaten in six games since a disappointing Copa America where they finished third, had the better of the early play, but fell behind in the 34th minute when Edinson Cavani stabbed home from close range after a nice build-up play by Luis Suarez and Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>The crowd in Tel Aviv cheered Messi throughout and it was the forward who helped Argentina draw level in the 63rd minute.</p>
      <p>Messi's free-kick from the left was nodded home by Sergio Aguero but, just five minutes later, Suarez restored Uruguay's lead when he scored from a free-kick.</p>
      <p>But the last word went to Messi who, three days after he missed from 12 metres against Brazil, made no mistake by coolly side-footing home from the spot to secure a deserved draw.</p>
      <p>The fixture was the last international for both teams before they begin their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign in March. - REUTERS</p>
