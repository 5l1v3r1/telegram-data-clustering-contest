      <h1>Pro-Black Lives Matter Official Forced To Stand Down From The Kumanjayi Walker Inquiry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:19:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:19</time> by <a rel="author">Rachael Conaghan</a></address>
      <p>The Northern Territory’s anti-corruption commissioner will no longer investigate the police shooting of Indigenous teenager <a href="https://junkee.com/northern-territory-shooting/229263">Kumanjayi Walker</a> after being criticised for publicly supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
      <p>Apparently, believing that people of colour are valuable members of society, and being able to impartially investigate a police shooting are mutually exclusive.</p>

      <p>The man at the centre of the controversy is Ken Fleming, the Northern Territory’s Independent Commissioner Against Corruption.</p>
      <p>Last week he attended a rally alongside thousands of people in Alice Springs (<a href="https://junkee.com/northern-territory-shooting/229263">and wider Australia</a>) as they protested the death of Kumanjayi Walker, who was shot in his NT home by police who came to arrest him for breaching bail.</p>
      <p>Ken told people at the rally “one of the most important messages today is ‘Black Lives Matter’”.</p>
      <p>“Anybody who says contrary to that is guilty of corrupt behaviour.”</p>

      <p>After the rally Fleming’s office received complaints from people who believe the former judge was too biased. Former Attorney-General, Daryl Manzie also called for him to stand down.</p>
      <p>In a statement yesterday Ken conceded, announcing he would not be taking part in the investigation.</p>

      <p>“From the moment this tragic incident occurred, I have set out to give my time to both the NT Police and the Central Australian and Warlpiri Aboriginal communities, in a balanced manner,” Fleming said.</p>
      <p>“My intention when participating in the community meetings in Central Australia was to explain our ability to independently look into these matters to the communities who are upset and seeking the truth.”</p>
      <p>“I accept that some of my comments have led to the perception among some observers that I am closer to one side than another on this matter, and so I will no longer be involved in it.”</p>
      <p>Fleming will remain the NT ICAC Commissioner, but will have no involvement in the Walker investigation.</p>
      <p>The ICAC’s involvement in the police investigation will instead be led by a team of specialist investigators, lawyers and technical experts.</p>
      <p>The officer involved in the shooting of Kumanjayi Walker has been charged with his murder, but has indicated he will plead not guilty.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://junkee.com/money-raised-kumanjayi-walker/230210">fundraiser</a> has been set up to support the community, who are pushing for a wider independent investigation into Kumanjayi’s death. It has so far raised more than $87,000.</p>
