      <p>STILLWATER — As other potential contenders begin to fall by the wayside, Oklahoma State running back Chuba Hubbard’s Heisman train is picking up steam.</p>
      <p>The nation’s leading rusher was No. 4 on ESPN’s Heisman Trophy projection after bumping his yardage total to 1,726 in Saturday’s win over Kansas. He came in behind a trio of quarterbacks, Joe Burrow of LSU, Jalen Hurts of Oklahoma and Justin Fields of Ohio State.</p>
      <p>Hubbard also joined those three QBs on the Twitter campaign for the Nissan Heisman House poll that allows fans to tweet the name of the player they vote for. Hubbard got a first-place vote in the Athletic’s Heisman straw poll, though he ultimately ranked sixth overall.</p>
      <p>While he might be too far behind to win the award, the Cowboy star seems to at least be in the mix to get an invitation to New York for the trophy ceremony.</p>
      <p>“The fact that people are questioning if he should go to New York or not is ridiculous in my opinion,” OSU receiver Dillon Stoner said.</p>

        <b>Twenty Cowboys get academic Big 12 honors</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oklahoma State had 20 football players named to the Academic All-Big 12 team, the league announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>OSU has had 20 or more players on the list in three straight seasons. The Cowboys’ 112 overall honorees in the past five years ranks OSU second in the league during that time span, behind only Kansas State.</p>
      <p>Of Oklahoma State’s 20 honorees, 16 were selected as first-team members, which marks the second-highest total in school history.</p>
      <p>Several Cowboys have received recognition multiple times in their careers, highlighted by Matt Ammendola who became just the eighth player in school history to earn four academic all-conference honors and the sixth to earn four first-team honors.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full list of Cowboys on the Academic All-Big 12 teams:</p>
      <p>First team: Matt Ammendola; Jarrick Bernard; Logan Carter; Braden Cassity; Amadou Fofana; Alex Hale; Matt Hembrough; Marcus Keyes; Carson Kropp; Brock Martin; Tanner McCalister; Amen Ogbongbemiga; Relijah Sherman; Dillon Stoner; Landon Wolf; Hunter Woodard.</p>

        <b>Gundy offers thoughts on Mason Rudolph situation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy shared the shocked feelings of many who saw former OSU quarterback Mason Rudolph get hit on the head with his own helmet, which had been pulled off by Cleveland’s Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>The situation involving Rudolph, the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, has been a viral topic since it happened late Thursday night.</p>
      <p>“I guess I just agree with everybody,” Gundy said in his weekly Monday press conference. “I don’t know if I’ve ever even seen anything like that ever in football. Very disappointing. I tried to think back when I’ve even seen a guy get his helmet yanked off. I remember two or three, but they throw it down the field or something, you know, like, ‘Oh, I didn’t know this would happen.’”</p>
      <p>Gundy said he has communicated with Rudolph, though the coach didn’t share the details of that conversation. Rudolph was the Cowboys’ starter from the final three games of the 2014 season through 2017, setting nearly every meaningful quarterback record at OSU.</p>
      <p>Over the last several weeks, Rudolph was named the Steelers’ starter in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, knocked unconscious in a game against Baltimore, and threw four interceptions against Cleveland prior to the helmet-swinging incident.</p>
      <p>“He’s had a lot of things happen to him in a short time in two months, so he’s getting accustomed to the NFL real quick,” Gundy said. “He’s taken a lot of hits. The only guy that’s ever been hit with a helmet, I think, on top of the head in the NFL.</p>
      <p>“And he’s handled it right. He’s competitive. He’s trying to hold his own up there.”</p>
      <p>Gundy offered some advice for Rudolph should he find himself in a similar situation ever again.</p>
      <p>“If (your helmet) comes off, you go the other way,” Gundy said. “But, you know, the heat of the moment for that situation, and I’m sure for Myles, too. But that’s just a hard one to swallow.”</p>
