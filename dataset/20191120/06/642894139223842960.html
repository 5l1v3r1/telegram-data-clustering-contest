      <p>Leading provider of ICT solutions Syrex is proud to announce its participation as a silver sponsor in the Gauteng leg of the annual Futurum Financial Group (FFG) Summit at the Centurion Theatre in Pretoria on 20 November 2019.</p>
      <p>This is a must-attend event for entrepreneurs, business leaders and managers because it will provide a forum to discuss the challenges, risks, changes and questions that need to be addressed for businesses to survive.</p>
      <p>The theme is, aptly, Navigating Your Life's Journey<i> </i>and the event will focus on issues that continue to shape the South African business landscape.</p>
      <p>This year’s FFG Summit will present fresh perspectives from a stellar line-up of SA's current thought leaders, including Jannie Putter, Quinton Douman, Tertius Nieuwoudt, Brand Pretorius, Marnus Broodryk and Chantell Ilbury.</p>
      <p>Ralph Berndt, Director of Sales and Marketing at Syrex, says that as a recognised specialist in the installation and support of mission-critical enterprise technologies with regard to connectivity, security and Microsoft, Syrex will use this unique event as a strategic platform to demonstrate its technical acumen and its growing influence.</p>
      <p>“FFG is an important industry partner of ours, and has been for many years. We are proud to be associated with this event as a sponsor. The value of participation for us is, in part, down to the insight we all gain from recognised thought leaders about how to deal with change, strategy and international best practices in handling the fallout of socio-economic and political developments in business,” says Berndt.</p>
      <p>Established in 1995, Syrex’s core service offerings include stable, customisable security and connectivity management solutions, as well as tailored IT support.</p>
