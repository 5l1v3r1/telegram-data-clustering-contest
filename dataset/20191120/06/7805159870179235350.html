      <h1>OPPO announces ColorOS 7 based on Android 10</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:08:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer OPPO has finally launched ColorOS 7 at a recent event in Beijing, China. The latest Android skin from the company offers a completely redesigned UI that draws heavily from the changes introduced in Android 10 in order to offer users a better user experience compared to previous versions of ColorOS.</p>
      <p>ColorOS 7 packs in a new visual design concept that is expected to reduce visual fatigue and offer users a more comfortable color system. Icons in ColorOS 7 are completely customizable and will allow users to change the shape and size of the icons on their home screen. On top of that, the company has added new Art+ wallpapers to the software to offer a high-quality desktop experience. OPPO has partnered with Episound, a renowned Danish sound company, to completely redesign the sound effects included in the software. Much like the sound changes introduced in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/miui/">MIUI</a> 11, OPPO’s ColorOS 7 aims to emulate the sound of the physical world around you to provide users with a more soothing experience.</p>

      <p>While the audio-visual design change is quite impressive by itself, ColorOS 7 also packs in some background optimizations to improve system performance. OPPO claims that with ColorOS 7, devices will get better RAM optimization capabilities and reduce app startup time by up to 40%, with a system resource efficiency of 30%. On top of that, the software includes improvements for the in-game frame rates and touch response to enhance the overall gaming experience. ColorOS 7 also includes improvements to the camera app, with Portrait Mode 2.0, an enhanced night mode and a super-steady mode for video capture. There are changes to the gallery app as well to allow for faster capture, editing, and sharing.</p>
      <p>At the event, OPPO also shared the release timeline for ColorOS 7, with phase 1 of the rollout to begin on November 25. During phase 1 the software will be released for the OPPO Reno, Reno Inspiration Edition, Reno 10x Zoom, Reno Barcelona Custom Edition, Reno Ace, and Reno Ace Gundam Edition. Phase 2 is expected to begin later this year in December, pushing the software to the OPPO Reno 2. Here’s a list of the remaining OPPO devices that are scheduled to receive the update next year:</p>
