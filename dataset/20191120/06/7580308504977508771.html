      <p>Olive oil is derived from olives and is a staple of the Mediterranean diet. The oil has many nutritional benefits when consumed, but it is also frequently applied to the skin and hair, according to Medical News Today.</p>
      <p>Below are some of the benefits of Olive oil to the skin.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Antioxidant</b>
      </p>
      <p>Olive oil acts as an antioxidant, which is a substance that prevents oxidation. Oxidation is a process that can produce free radicals, which are chemicals that can potentially damage cells and may contribute to cancer development.</p>
      <p>When Olive oil is applied to the skin, antioxidants may prevent premature aging. Also, some research suggests that putting olive oil on the skin after sun exposure may fight off cancer-causing cells.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Vitamin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Olive oil contains the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Some of these vitamins may be beneficial for the skin. For example, people have used vitamin E oil topically throughout history to treat a variety of skin conditions, including psoriasis and eczema.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Antibacterial</b>
      </p>
      <p>Olive oil has been shown to have antibacterial properties. However, there are very few studies on olive oil’s ability to control bacteria on the skin.  However, olive oil may sometimes be used to treat bacterial infections of the skin. It may also improve healing in people with foot ulcers caused by type 2 diabetes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Moisturiser</b>
      </p>
      <p>Olive oil is a popular natural moisturizer that is often used to soften both skin and hair. However, there is very little research on its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>However, Steer clear of lower quality olive oils for skin, and avoid those missing the all-important E and V letters on the bottle. They are too acidic for your skin.</p>
      <p>Note that you only need a couple of drops. Using too much oil will lead to clogged pores and may trigger acne in some skin types.</p>
