      <p>Ever since stepping into the spotlight hand-in-hand with Prince Harry, the Duchess of Sussex has continued to reign not just in her new Royal life, but also the fashion world.</p>
      <p>From her unwavering penchant for  covetable coats to the former actor’s ability to send Strathberry bags flying from the shelves, her sporty yet sophisticated look has inspired many, reported <i><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com.au/duchess-sussex-named-most-influential-fashion-icon">Marie Claire. </a></i></p>
      <p>So it comes as no real surprise to learn that the Royal has been crowned the fashion world’s most influential dresser recently.</p>

      <p>According to Lyst’s Year in Fashion report,  there was a 216% increase in people frantically Googling similar outfits every single time the 37-year-old stepped out for a public engagement.</p>
      <p>When the new mother donned five different shirt dresses for her and Prince Harry’s Royal tour of Africa in September, the fashion category grew by 45% in total.</p>

      <p>Recent research further demonstrates how Meghan has taken the reigns from the Duchess of Cambridge as Windsor’s most influential style icon.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, global fashion search platform Lyst pitted their Kensington Palace closets against each other and found that the ‘Meghan Effect’ is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>
      <p>The gold brocade dress she wore to the 50th anniversary of Prince Charles’ Investiture at Buckingham Palace came in as the new mother’s most powerful fashion moment of the year – triggering a 500% increase in online demand within 24 hours.</p>
