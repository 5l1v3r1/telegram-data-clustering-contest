      <h1>Miami GP plans get six-month reprieve</h1>
      <h2>Hopes that Miami will be able to host a Formula 1 race in 2021 will stay alive for at least another "three to six months", according to local mayor Carlos Gimenez.</h2>

      <p>F1 has reached a deal in principle for a race at and near Hard Rock Stadium, but preparations hit an early snag when opposition groups made key blocking moves at the Miami-Dade commission.</p>
      <p>Mayor Gimenez used his veto to block the opposition earlier in November.</p>
      <p>And this week, an effort to override that veto failed as commissioners only voted 5 to 7.</p>
      <p>"This race isn't until May of 2021," Gimenez told CBS Miami.</p>
      <p>"Sustaining my veto buys three to six months so that we can at least get the parties that are involved together and we can continue to work toward a solution," he added.</p>
      <p>Formula One Management as well as Hard Rock Stadium CEO Tom Garfinkel said in similarly-worded statements that they will now use the extra time to work "very hard to address community concerns in a meaningful way".</p>
