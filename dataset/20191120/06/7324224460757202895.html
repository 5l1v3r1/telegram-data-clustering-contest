      <h2>Wolves have won the race to secure the services of Ryan Douglas as their first signing for next season.</h2>

      <p>Aussie ace Douglas captured the attention of every Premiership club with a string of fine performances for Wolves last term – particularly on the road.</p>
      <p>And Parrys International Wolves promoter Chris Van Straaten admitted a sense of relief at getting his man. “I think every Premiership club was interested in signing Ryan,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He came in mid-way through last season and was a catalyst in our recovery up the league table, ultimately reaching the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“His performances away from home were good and I do believe with more experience on the Monmore track he will become more effective at home.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good starting point for our team building plans.”</p>
      <p>Douglas himself agrees with Van Straaten’s assessment of his performances.</p>
      <p>“The track is a tough one to start off with but I felt the more laps I had the better I got round there,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Having a full season and starting with everyone else will be a big help for me. I never really wanted to go anywhere else.</p>
      <p>“The promotion are a pleasure to deal with and it’s a well run club and I’m sure the team they are putting together will be a competitive one.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t do ourselves justice at the end of the season in those play-offs against Swindon.</p>
      <p>“The weather played a huge part in that home leg and we want to put things right next season.”</p>
      <p>Wolves are currently in talks with several other riders and hope to have more signing news soon.</p>
      <p>They have already ruled out a return to Kyle Howarth who has since agreed a deal at Sheffield who have just been promoted to the Premiership for their first taste of top flight racing in 30 years.</p>
