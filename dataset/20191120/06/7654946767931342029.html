      <p>Ten Democratic White House hopefuls will once again take the debate stage on Wednesday night, vying to make an impression on a national television audience as polling and fundraising restrictions continue to narrow the field.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know before the candidates square off in the fifth round of Democratic debates.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How to Watch</b>
      </p>
      <p>The debate kicks off at 9 p.m. EST, and will air on MSNBC and stream on washingtonpost.com. The two outlets are co-sponsoring the debate, which is expected to run until 11 p.m.</p>
      <p>The debate will be held at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. The Peach State and its 16 electoral votes went for President Trump in 2016 by a 5.1-percent margin, and it’s expected to be a key battleground state in 2020.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Lineup</b>
      </p>
      <p>Progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will look to maintain momentum as she duels former Vice President Joe Biden, who was long considered the frontrunner but has hit a polling wall in recent months.</p>
      <p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will look to try to pull out of what’s become a comfortable third place, while South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg hopes to continue setting himself apart as a youthful, yet moderate voice among the field.</p>
      <p>The field is rounded out by California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.</p>
      <p>Two participants in October’s debate will be missing in former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. The former has <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/beto-orourke-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race/">ended his flagging campaign</a>, while the latter is trudging forward, but failed to meet the polling and fundraising requirements.</p>
      <p>The highest-polling candidates will take center-stage. From left to right, the order will be: Booker, Gabbard, Klobuchar, Buttigieg, Warren, Biden, Sanders, Harris, Yang and Steyer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How the Candidates Qualified</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each of the candidates had to tally donations from at least 165,000 unique donors, plus reach a certain threshold in a number of approved national or early-state polls: three percent in four polls, or five percent in two polls.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who Will Moderate</b>
      </p>
      <p>A panel of four moderators will try to keep order among the field: MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and Andrew Mitchell, NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker, and Washington Post White House reporter Ashley Parker.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What to Watch For</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wednesday night’s tilt will mark the first installment since <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/trump-impeachment-hearings-live-watch-day-1-of-house-testimony/">public hearings began</a> in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, marking an opportunity for his prospective 2020 opponents to offer their takeaways to a national audience. The proceedings may be of particular interest to Biden, who along with son Hunter was targeted for investigation by the Trump administration over alleged impropriety in Ukraine. Biden largely <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/15/democratic-debate-joe-biden-dodges-question-on-hunters-ukraine-ties/">kept quiet on the subject</a> during the last debate.</li>
        <li>Biden will be under pressure, however, to turn in a more forceful performance than he did last month, with Warren gaining more and more traction as the possible eventual nominee. Warren, conversely, may again have to fend off an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/16/democratic-debate-surging-elizabeth-warren-main-target-of-rivals-jabs/">inordinate number of broadsides</a> as trailing candidates team up to try to drag her back to the pack.</li>
        <li>Harris will be speaking on a national platform for the first time since a mass shooting rocked a high school in her home state last week, leaving three teens dead including the gunman. The now-sidelined O’Rourke had previously served as the field’s most forceful voice on gun-control, and the recent tragedy may open a window for Harris to take up the mantle to re-energize <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/kamala-harris-fires-entire-new-hampshire-campaign-field-team/">her stalled campaign</a>.</li>
        <li>The unpredictable Gabbard — who failed to make the cut for September’s debate, only to rally and qualify in both October and November — will seek to hang tough in the face of bipartisan flak. during the last debate, she <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/15/democratic-debates-tulsi-gabbard-rips-hosts-cnn-new-york-times/">accused hosting outlets</a> CNN and The New York Times of warmongering. In the eventful month since, she’s also <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/tulsi-gabbard-pushes-saudi-arabia-9-11-coverup-theory/">pushed a 9/11 coverup theory</a>, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/18/tulsi-gabbard-calls-hillary-clinton-the-embodiment-of-corruption/">gone after Hillary Clinton</a> for implying that Gabbard was being groomed as a Russian asset.</li>
