        <b>Tottenham Hotspur have announced the appointment of Jose Mourinho as head coach of the club on a three-and-a-half-year contract. The announcement comes just hours after former boss Mauricio Pochettino was given the sack late night on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs sacked the Argentine tactician after a disastrous start to the 2019/20 season which saw the club go down to the 14th spot on the English Premier League table. Mourinho was the front-runner for the job, as various reports stated and has now been confirmed as the club’s next head coach.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted to announce the appointment of Jose Mourinho as Head Coach on a contract that runs until the end of the 2022/23 season,” an official statement from the club read.</p>
      <p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho on his appointment: “I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
