      <p>Michelle Chan, who works for Soccer Manager, a football games studio, spent almost three weeks volunteering at a school and orphanage in Tetrem, Ghana and says the experience has changed her outlook in life.</p>
      <p>She raised £1,00 by taking part in a 10k, selling food at work and a £750 donation from stake.com.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, who commutes to Preston twice a week from her home in Huddersfield, said: “For the past few months I’ve been fund-raising to help a village school in Tetrem. “Working for a mobile game studio, I understand the importance of technology, so I raised £1,000 to purchase eight computers and a printer for the school and arranged for Kappa to donate 40 football jerseys by Soccer Manager to donate some footballs.</p>
      <p>“I paid for the flights and accommodation myself, rather than going through an agency.</p>

      <p>“One of my friends had travelled there to volunteer before, so I then spoke to the principal of the school directly.</p>
      <p>“The school is also an orphanage, giving children a home and a place to learn.</p>
      <p>“It is built with wooden planks which have holes in, so when it is the wet season, sometimes the school cannot teach.</p>
      <p>“I believe education is the way to get out of poverty, but some children don’t have that chance, as their villages are left behind.</p>
      <p>“My volunteering taught me so much about being grateful about what we have in life. The conditions over there are really bad. People in Ghana don’t have a toilet, shower, cooker, a bed and so on. They wash with cold buckets of water daily, urinate in a bucket, eat with their hands, and hand wash their clothes with soap.</p>
      <p>“They don’t have a proper doctor, and the village has no water and drainage systems so the children have to fetch over 10 buckets of water daily and much more.</p>
      <p>“I was teaching kindergarten children the basic ABC song and nursery rhymes. I also taught children how to use the material I’ve brought over to earn programming.”</p>
