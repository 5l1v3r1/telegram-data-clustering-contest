      <p>Final preparations are being made as a Wishaw woman gets set to fight fire with fire in her ongoing cancer battle.</p>
      <p>In June last year, just 16 months after giving birth to baby daughter Luana, Sam Shing’s world was turned upside down when she found out she had been diagnosed with Choriocarcinoma – a cancer affecting one in 50,000 pregnancies.</p>
      <p>Sam is now on immunotherapy and is fundraising for the Harris &amp; Trotter Charitable Trust, a charity which provides funding for the treatment to cancer patients when the treatment cannot be obtained from the NHS.</p>
      <p>To give something back to the charity, Sam, who also has a 17-year-old son Kyle, has organised a charity fire walk to take place at Wishaw Bowling Club on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sam said: “We have over 30 people doing the fire walk which is brilliant.</p>
      <p>“People are still able to come along and be part of it if they wish.</p>
      <p>“I have already smashed my target of £5,000 so I am pleased with that but would love to raise more money for the charity.”</p>
      <p>Sam, who works as a social worker, has already had three different types of chemotherapy as well as a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>She is continuing her treatment down in London at the Charing Cross Hospital.</p>
      <p>And she continues to display a positive attitude as she continues her battle against the disease.</p>
      <p>She added: “I am down in London this week for treatment. It’s tough but having to organise something like this has helped me take my mind off it.</p>
      <p>“I try to be as positive as I can be whenever I can be. There have been some false dawns before so I don’t want to get too ahead of myself.”</p>
