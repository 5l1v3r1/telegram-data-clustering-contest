      <h1>Duggar Drama: ’19 Kids And Counting’ Family Deny Report Claiming Homeland Security Agents Raided Their Home</h1>

      <p>U.S. Homeland Security agents were said to have raided the Arksansas home of Jim Bob Duggar and his expansive brood, stars of TLC’s once-popular reality series “19 Kids and Counting”.</p>
      <p>A rep for Homeland Security confirmed to NBC affiliate <a href="https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/knwa/homeland-security-investigations-raid-duggar-home/">KNWA</a> that agents raided the Duggars’ home last week.</p>
      <p>“[I do not dispute the information that] HSI was present [at the Duggar home] pursuant to an ongoing federal criminal investigation,” the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>However, a rep for the Duggar family has since told <i><a href="https://people.com/tv/duggar-family-home-raided-by-homeland-security-investigations/">People</a></i>, “We were shocked to see a news report today state that our home was raided by federal law enforcement agencies. This is not true. To the best of our knowledge, it’s also not true that any member of our family is the target of any investigation of any kind.</p>
      <p>“Living a life in the public’s eye has taught us that it is best not to reply to every rumour and piece of ‘fake news’ that is circulated online. It would be a full-time job if we attempted to do so.</p>
      <p>“However, because of tonight’s media coverage we thought it is important to address this rumour with you. Thank you for the love and support that we can always count on in you our fans and friends.”</p>

      <p>According to KNWA, neither HSI nor the U.S. District Attorney for Western Arkansas would comment on the incident.</p>
      <p>Duggar progeny Josh Duggar, who was accused of <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/27086/jessa-and-jill-on-josh-duggar-molestation-scandal-weve-all-forgiven-weve-all-moved-on/">molesting two of his younger sisters</a> before admitting to a porn addiction and cheating on his wife, is reportedly being sued for real estate fraud. That trial is set to begin next year.</p>
      <p>Youngest Duggar child, 20-year-old Jedidah, told KNWA he wasn’t aware of anything taking place at his parents’ home. “I don’t live there and I am not aware of any investigation,” he said.</p>

      <p>Back in 2015, Josh Duggar confessed to the allegations of molestation. “Twelve years ago, as a young teenager, I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends,” he said in a statement posted to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/duggarfamilyofficial/posts/653931128073873?fref=nf&amp;pnref=story">family’s Facebook page</a>. “I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing, and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life.”</p>
      <p>That scandal led to the cancellation of “19 Kids and Counting” after <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/19-kids-counting-more-advertisers-798369">numerous advertisers bailed on the show</a>.</p>
