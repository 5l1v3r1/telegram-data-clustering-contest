      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/ecbs-lane-we-dont-see-a-recession-in-the-euro-area-201911200543">Further comments</a> are hitting the wires from the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) Chief Economist Lane, delivered in an interview with La Repubblica.</p>
      <blockquote>Creation of ESM was "act of solidarity", risky but successful.<br/><br/>ECB does not expect recession in the eurozone where economy is growing less than hoped.<br/><br/>Sees Eurozone economic recovery in next year or two.<br/><br/>Current inflation rate at 1% is "unsatisfactory", trusts that ECB’s monetary stimulus will allow it to grow.<br/><br/>Low interest rates are opportunity for Eurozone countries to cut debt not for new expenses or tax cuts.<br/><br/>There are margins for negotiations to complete banking union and find a compromise.</blockquote>
