      <p>Lowe's Companies Inc. says it will close 34 underperforming stores across six provinces, including one in the Okanagan, as part of a restructuring of its Canadian business.</p>
      <p>The stores include 26 Ronas, six Lowe's and two Reno-Depots spread across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. The B.C. closures include stores in Osoyoos, Prince George and the Newton area of Surrey.</p>
      <p>"Closing underperforming stores is a necessary step in our plan to ensure the long-term stability and growth of our Canadian business,” said Tony Cioffi, interim president of Lowe's Canada in a statement.</p>
      <p>He said the restructuring also includes investment in its supply chain capabilities, web platforms, and existing corporate stores and affiliated dealer network.</p>
      <p>The closures, set for early next year, add to its announced closure of 31 Canadian locations, including 27 stores and four other facilities, in November last year.</p>
      <p>North Carolina-based Lowe's bought Rona in 2016 in a deal valued at $3.2 billion.</p>
      <p>Lowe's did not say how many staff would be affected by the latest round of closures, which will see stores close in January and February.</p>
      <p>The company says eligible employees will be offered jobs at nearby stores, given its need for workers throughout its network.</p>
      <p>In Canada, the company has more than 28,000 employees, while its independent affiliate dealers operating under the Rona and Ace name have another 5,000 employees.</p>
      <p>The Canadian division of Lowe's has more than 600 corporate and independent affiliate stores under the Lowe's, Rona, Reno-Depot, Ace and Dick’s Lumber brands.</p>
