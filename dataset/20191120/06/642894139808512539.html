        <b>The reality:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cloud-based e-mail is a top attack vector for phishing:</p>
      <p>Cloud applications, and Office 365 by virtue of its popularity, are the top targets for phishing attacks. Attackers are finding that taking advantage of human error is a lot more effective than targeting system vulnerabilities, with over 99% of attacks targeting end-users.</p>
      <p><b>Poor user experience is hurting MFA adoption:<br/></b>According to Microsoft, less than 10% of users have enabled MFA in their enterprise accounts. When users have to switch focus to another device or have to type in cumbersome codes, they choose to avoid MFA.</p>
      <p><b>High costs hurting IT budgets:<br/></b>When IT enforces cumbersome authentication methods, the helpdesk gets inundated with support calls that create high costs and poor ROI.</p>
      <p><b>The answer:<br/></b>YubiKeys provide a highly secure and easy-to-use authentication solution for Office 365.</p>
      <p><b>Modern authentication for Office 365:<br/></b>YubiKeys offer the most advanced authentication for protecting Office 365 accounts, leveraging the latest standards-based protocols with the highest levels of security.</p>
      <p><b>Phishing-resistant and proven:<br/></b>Proven to stop account takeovers from phishing attacks, YubiKeys offer the best peace of mind for IT leaders and end-users alike. Hardware-backed cryptography combined with origin binding of credentials ensure that while a user could be tricked, the YubiKey is never fooled.</p>
      <p><b>Frictionless user experience:<br/></b>With a simple touch, the YubiKeys log a user in without having to shift focus to different screens or having to enter cumbersome one-time codes. Logins are 4x faster, and end-users love the ease of use.</p>
      <p><b>High ROI via user self-service:<br/></b>YubiKeys are easy to deploy and manage as users can self-register their security keys, self-administer their credentials, and self-recover accounts. As a result, Yubico customers have reduced help-desk costs by over 90%.</p>
      <p>Multiple options for securing Office 365 with YubiKeys</p>
      <p><b>Integrated with leading IAM solutions:<br/></b>YubiKeys integrate out-of-the-box with Office 365 accounts federated via identity and access management solutions such as Okta, Ping Identity, RSA and Duo.</p>
      <p><b>Native passwordless support with Azure AD:<br/></b>YubiKeys can authenticate directly with Azure Active Directory accounts using passwordless logins (currently in public preview).</p>
      <p><b>Works with Azure MFA and Active Directory:<br/></b>Multiprotocol support built into every YubiKey 5 Series security key enables logins using OTP via Azure MFA, as well as using smart card infrastructure to Active Directory accounts.</p>
      <p><b>Works with desktop Outlook clients on Windows and Mac:<br/></b>YubiKeys can be used with popular desktop clients to provide phishing-resistant authentication across all major platforms.</p>
