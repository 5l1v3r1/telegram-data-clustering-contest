        <b>Singapore's economy in the third quarter is expected to have expanded much more than initially thought and is likely to stabilise in the coming quarters, helped by a recovery in manufacturing, a Reuters poll found yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Final gross domestic product (GDP) is forecast to have grown a seasonally adjusted and annualised 2.1 per cent from the second quarter, a Reuters poll of 13 economists showed, much more than the 0.6 per cent growth in the Government's advance estimates. The economy contracted 2.7 per cent in the quarter earlier.</p>
      <p>"Final third quarter GDP is expected to be materially upgraded," said Maybank Kim Eng economist Lee Ju Ye.</p>
      <p>"Manufacturing came in much stronger than expected in September and services growth likely picked up speed, particularly in finance, business and tourism-related services,"she added.</p>
      <p>Singapore has been hit hard by the US-China trade war and a broader global slowdown.</p>
      <p>From the year earlier, economic growth is expected to be revised to 0.5 per cent, higher than the 0.1 per cent seen in advance estimates and the quarter earlier.</p>
      <p>Singapore's growth is also likely to stabilise in the fourth quarter and recover next year.</p>
      <p>"The tension between the near-term stabilisation if not modest pick-up in trade and lacklustre global capex remains, limiting the upside to final demand," JP Morgan economist Sin Beng Ong said, adding weakness in electronics output could complicate outlook.</p>
      <p>Singapore exports last month shrank for the eighth straight month as shipments of electronics continued to slide, official data showed on Monday.- REUTERS</p>
