      <h1>Pete Buttigieg slammed on Twitter for 'insensitive' Holocaust memorial photo: 'This guy'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:21:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:21</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> is being slammed – and also defended – after a 2017 Instagram post of him at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/holocaust">Holocaust</a> memorial in Berlin, with the caption "This guy," resurfaced Sunday on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The Democratic presidential candidate’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, posted the photo of Buttigieg at what appeared to be the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, in Germany's capital.</p>

      <p>Users on Twitter called the photo and caption “tone-deaf,” “inappropriate, “tasteless” and “disrespectful.”</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I think it's more the, uh, caption than the picture itself," one Twitter user wrote. "Something about implying how dreamy your husband is with a Holocaust memorial as the backdrop comes off as a bit tone-deaf, so it's actually a decent microcosm of the Buttigieg campaign."</p>

      <p>NBC reporter Ben Kesslen first tweeted a screenshot of the post, writing “is this....at the holocaust memorial in berlin....” on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Although considered disrespectful, tourists frequently take photos at Holocaust memorials and concentration camps like Auschwitz.</p>

      <p>Not everyone was offended by the photo. Some Twitter users saw the picture as harmless and the criticism politically motivated.</p>
      <p>"He looks more respectful than most people who visit the memorial nowadays," one user wrote. "Anyone who's been there can attest."</p>
      <p>"As someone who lost relatives in the Holocaust, including my great grandparents, your using this to smear Pete is absolutely appalling to me. Try a little self-reflection," another user commented on Kesslen's post.</p>
