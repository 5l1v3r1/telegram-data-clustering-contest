      <h3>Manchester United could sign Bruno Fernandes as Sporting Lisbon look to raise funds to clear their debts of around £57m, according to a report.</h3>
      <p>Portuguese media outlet <i>O Jogo</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7698463/Man-Utd-handed-boost-pursuit-Bruno-Fernandes-Sporting-Lisbon-look-clear-debt.html">Daily Mail</a>, is reporting that Sporting Lisbon are prepared to sell Fernandes in a £65m deal in order to clear their debt.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Manchester United are keen to sign a creative midfielder to fill the void left by Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini over the past year.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the Red Devils could face competition from Tottenham Hotspur, given that Spurs are facing the prospect of losing Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p>Fernandes has scored five goals and has made five assists in 10 appearances in the Portuguese top flight this season to maintain his prolific form for Sporting.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old was linked to Manchester United and Tottenham in the summer after the Portugal international netted 20 times and created 11 goals in 33 games.</p>
      <p>Manchester United and Tottenham have both made disappointing starts to the Premier League season to leave them well off the pace in the race to secure a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>Champions League runners-up Spurs are in 14th place in the Premier League table and 20 points adrift of runaway leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are two points better off than Spurs but find themselves in seventh position in the Premier League.</p>
