      <p>Brendan Maher has described the CPA’s withdrawal from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Task Force as a “huge worry”. <br/><br/>The Tipperary star was one of the several players representing their clubs at a press event ahead of the AIB Munster hurling and Connacht football club finals this weekend, with Maher lining out for Borris-Ileigh against Ballygunner. <br/><br/>Describing the task force as a “Trojan horse”, the CPA has said it “will not be an accomplice to the entrenchment of the status quo”. <br/><br/>Maher commented: "I've no idea what's going on with those negotiations but when something as big as that happening you would start thinking, 'This must not be progressing the way that they see as progress'. <br/><br/>“It's a huge worry and I suppose time will tell what's going to happen. I don't know what the solution is but something has to happen and changes have to be made. <br/><br/>“We need to start thinking together rather than fighting each other.” <br/><br/>Former Waterford hurler Shane O’Sullivan, who will line out against Maher on Sunday, expressed fears around club players dropping out. <br/><br/>He said: “For the club players who's training away and there isn't a proper match for two or three months and he's a family and the partner or wife is asking him, 'Why are you training on a Friday night? Sure, you don't have a match. When is your match?' And he says, 'I don't know'. <br/><br/>“The practical sense of this is a bit crazy. Definitely, something needs to happen because the club is the cornerstone of the organisation and it's where you spread out participation and people develop and grow. <br/><br/>“It's brilliant to have the inter-county scene but you have to look at that. That has to be sorted as soon as possible with all the sponsorship that's coming in and the money. <br/><br/>“If you don't look after that we're going to be under serious pressure because we will lose players in terms of participation.” <br/><br/>Former Galway footballer Kieran Fitzgerald, representing Corofin, advocates two distinct club and inter-county seasons. <br/><br/>He said: “I don’t think it’s working for a lot of club teams. Height of the summer and you are twiddling your thumbs. <br/><br/>“Even if you have from July, August and September are good months, you could play in October even. Right now I don’t think it’s working.”</p>
