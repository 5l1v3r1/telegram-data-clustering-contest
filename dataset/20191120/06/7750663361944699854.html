      <h1>Both Ferrari drivers to blame for crash - Villeneuve</h1>
      <h2>Both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> drivers are to blame for their Interlagos crash.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:34:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>That is the view of outspoken 1997 world champion <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jacques-villeneuve/"><b>Jacques Villeneuve</b></a>, after team boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-binotto/"><b>Mattia Binotto</b></a> said of the incident: "It's not for me to blame them".</p>
      <p>Villeneuve, however, told Sky Italia: "Vettel and Leclerc are allowed to fight among themselves, but they should not abuse this freedom.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, they are both to blame. Leclerc was too aggressive, and Vettel should not have immediately slammed the door when overtaking his teammate.</p>
      <p>"They both made a mistake," Villeneuve insisted.</p>
      <p>"It was unnecessary, as they were fighting for third place at most. I think they just wanted to show everyone that they are the better one."</p>
      <p>Italy's Corriere della Sera newspaper reports that Binotto will meet with Ferrari CEO <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/louis-camilleri/"><b>Louis Camilleri</b></a> at Maranello on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The report said they will discuss potential penalties for repeat incidents, including driver fines and other "disciplinary measures".</p>
      <p>Former Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, who was at Interlagos last Sunday, told Bild newspaper: "It was a misunderstanding between the two drivers and a sad day for Ferrari."</p>
      <p>As for 2020, both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> are staying put, but Sky Deutschland commentator Sascha Roos says Ferrari needs to plan ahead.</p>
      <p>"I think they would be well advised to set a deadline," he said. "For example, after the first four races of the season, a number 1 driver is made."</p>
