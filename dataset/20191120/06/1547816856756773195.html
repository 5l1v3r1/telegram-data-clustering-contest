      <p>Fitness Enthusiast Mandia Bedi is quite active on social media. The actress, who is also an entrepreneur, recently revealed how she was treated in society when she had decided to delay her pregnancy. Mandira Bedi, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/push-ups-in-a-saree-why-not-mandira-bedi-shows-you-how-it-s-done/5a7da03948dd9a2016212767">who often posts inspirational videos on her Instagram</a>, is hosting OTT’s web show Shaadi Fit. Mandira is married to filmmaker Raj Kaushal for two decades now. At the launch of the show, Madira stated that it was her support system who made it easy for her to face struggles in her career</p>
      <p>At the event, Mandira revealed that she was looked at differently when she had decided to delay her pregnancy due to work commitments. She said, “Living in Indian society, as a woman you tend to face several stereotypes. When I decided to delay my pregnancy due to work commitments, it was the most difficult decision I had to make. I was looked at differently, and people perceived me as a woman who is career-oriented. You would think that is a good trait to have, but our society thinks differently of a married woman. In fact, even after my child was born, I was always divided between my personal and professional lives.” <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/photos/photo-gallery/tusshar-kapoor-mandira-bedi-talk-cricket-over-juice-shots-with-rajeev-khadelwal-on-juzz-baatt/5b61801ad95e0b7b827a242b">Tusshar Kapoor &amp; Mandira Bedi Talk Cricket Over Juice Shots With Rajeev Khadelwal On Juzz Baatt</a>)</b></p>

      <p>She later concluded saying, “I think my message to every married woman is to believe in yourself and your capabilities, rather than focusing on societal beliefs and norms. My career has made me into the person I am today. I have struggled and carved my niche in the entertainment industry and I feel very proud of it.”</p>
