      <p>TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made history by becoming Japan’s longest-serving political leader, though he hasn’t achieved his biggest goal of revising the nation’s pacifist constitution.</p>
      <p>Abe marked his 2,887th day in office Wednesday, surpassing Taro Katsura from the early 20th century.</p>
      <p>Following his disappointing 2006-2007 term, Abe returned to office in 2012 and has since bolstered Japan’s defence role but hasn’t yet been able to change the constitution to allow a full-fledged military.</p>
      <p>Abe has been stepping up his effort for a change before his party leadership ends in September 2021, despite the lack of public interest.</p>
      <p>Abe on Wednesday renewed his pledge to beat deflation, tackle Japan’s aging and declining population and achieve a constitutional revision.</p>
