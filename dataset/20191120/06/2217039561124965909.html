        <b>A Singaporean boy died aboard a cruise ship in Langkawi, Malaysia, on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alan Heng Kai Lun, 10, was found unresponsive in a swimming pool on the Genting Dream, a ship operated by Dream Cruises.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly on the ship with his mother Madam Chang Lei Ling, 40, and her friend.</p>
      <p>The cruise ship, which can accommodate 4,500 passengers, left Singapore on Sunday for a four-day, three-night cruise to Langkawi and Phuket.</p>
      <p>According to the itinerary, it left Singapore at about 5pm, reaching Langkawi around 3pm on Monday, docking at the Star Cruise Jetty.</p>
      <p>Langkawi District Police Chief Superintendent Mohd Iqbal Ibrahim told Malaysian news site MyMetro that police received a call from the ship at about 7.30pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>"During the incident, there were others at the pool, including pool attendants," he said.</p>
      <p>"The case has been classified as a sudden death while police are awaiting autopsy reports."</p>
      <p>He added that the police also took statements from several passengers and staff on the ship.</p>
      <p>A Dream Cruises spokesman told The New Paper it is fully co-operating with the authorities.</p>
      <p>"The on-board responding medical team immediately provided medical and resuscitation assistance," she said.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the deceased and we offer our sincerest condolences."</p>
      <p>The boy's body was taken to the Sultanah Maliha Langkawi Hospital.</p>
      <p>The ship left for Phuket at about 10.30pm on Monday, and is expected to be back in Singapore around 6pm today.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Singapore High Commission in Kuala Lumpur is in contact with the family and will continue to provide the necessary consular assistance.</p>
      <p>This is the third reported incident this year involving a Singaporean passenger on the Genting Dream.</p>
      <p>A 74-year-old man went missing after boarding the ship on Aug 4 for a four-day, three-night cruise to Penang and Langkawi. Surveillance cameras captured a "whitish figure" falling into the sea at about 3am on the second day of the trip.</p>
      <p>Last month, a 76-year-old man who boarded the ship on Oct 13 for a six-day, five-night trip died while snorkelling. His body was found floating in the South China Sea, and he reportedly died due to medical complications at a beach resort while on shore in Redang Island.</p>
