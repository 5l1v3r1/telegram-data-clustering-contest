      <p>China's foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned a top US diplomat over the Senate's passing of a Hong Kong rights bill, warning of "strong" countermeasures against the United States should the legislation be signed into law.</p>
      <p>Vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu called in acting charge d'affaires William Klein to lodge a "strong protest", the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We strongly urge the US side to immediately take effective measures to prevent this bill from becoming law" and stop meddling in China's internal affairs, the statement said.</p>
      <p>"Otherwise, the Chinese side will take strong measures to resolutely counter it, and the US side must bear all the consequences," it said.</p>
