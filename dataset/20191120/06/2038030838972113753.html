        <b>THE NUMBERS:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Average viewer numbers per episode have outshone not only local shows in all genres on M-Net Channel 101 but also international audience favourites such as <i>Game of Thrones, Big Little Lies, Chernobyl, The Big Bang Theory</i> and <i>The Enemy Within</i>.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most impressively, <i>Trackers</i> has attracted more eyeballs than a much-loved M-Net institution â€“ the Sunday night blockbuster movie premiere.</p>
      <p>The show is also currently trending at the top of the charts on both DStv Now and Showmax.</p>
      <p>"We are over the moon about <i>Trackers</i>' phenomenal performance to date," says Yolisa Phahle, CEO of General Entertainment. "With this first co-production between M-Net, HBO's sister channel Cinemax and Germany's ZDF, we set out to create a trailblazing, high-end production that would enthral our MultiChoice customers as well as global audiences.</p>
      <p>"It's wonderful to know that <i>Trackers</i> will soon also be shining the spotlight on our magnificent actors, behind-the-scenes talent and breathtaking landscapes to a wider audience."</p>
      <p>
        <b>BEHIND-THE-SCENES:</b>
      </p>
      <p>More than a 1000 television professionals ensured that <i>Trackers</i> raised the bar in terms of cinematic excellence. Sisanda Henna's chilling performance as Inkunzi, a snazzy but ruthless villain, has already landed him a leading role opposite Megan Fox in the forthcoming film <i>Rogue</i>.</p>
