      <h2>According to a study conducted by the National Health Insurance data set in Taiwan, there was a three-fold increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer and leukemia associated with CT scans.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:58:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/author/ani/" target="_blank">ANI  </a></address>
      <p>Individuals exposed to the radiation emanating from a CT scan are at an elevated <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/news/control-your-weight-now-study-says-obesity-may-cause-eight-more-types-of-cancer-ag0816-429906/">risk of developing thyroid cancer</a> and leukemia, a new study says.</p>
      <p>Moreover, researchers concluded that patients receiving CT scans had in general marked increases in the <a href="https://www.thehealthsite.com/news/childhood-cancer-survivors-at-an-increased-risk-for-developing-hormones-disorders-ag0618-579228/">risk of developing thyroid cancer</a> and leukemia, especially in female patients and patients younger than 45.</p>
      <p>“Our study found that CT scans are associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and leukemia in adults in all ages and with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young adults,” said Yu-Hsuan Joni Shao, one of the paper’s authors.</p>
      <p>The study conducted from a National Health Insurance dataset in Taiwan between 2000 and 2013 has highlighted.</p>
      <p>Published in the journal JNCI Cancer Spectrum, it followed 22,853 thyroid cancer, 13,040 leukemia, and 20,157 non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases.</p>
      <p>Researchers consulted data from the National Health Insurance program to study demographic and medical information on disease diagnoses, procedures, and drug prescriptions, and the enrollment profiles of all patients.</p>
      <p>Patients were excluded if they were under 25 years at the time of the cancer diagnosis, had less than three years of follow-up before cancer diagnosis, or had a history of cancer before the year 2000.</p>
      <p>Results showed that patients who developed thyroid cancer and leukemia had a significantly higher likelihood of having received CT scans.</p>
      <p>In studies that combined patients across age groups, exposure to medical CT scans was not associated with increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
      <p>However, in patients between 36 and 45 years of age, there was a three-fold increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with CT scans.</p>
      <p>In older patients, the association between exposures to CT scans and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was not evident.</p>
      <p>“The risk is stronger in patients who have higher cumulative doses from multiple scans. The increased numbers of people undergoing CT scans have become a public health issue,” Shao explained.</p>
