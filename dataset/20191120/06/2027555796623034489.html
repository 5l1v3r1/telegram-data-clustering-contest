      <h1>Maharashtra guv was wary of horse-trading</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:03:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/shemin-joy" target="_blank">Shemin Joy</a></address>
      <p>Maharashtra Governor B S Koshyari decided against the “misadventure of having a floor test” to avoid the “eminent possibilities” of horse-trading and corruption in the state. And he chose not to invite the Congress to stake claim to form the government as it was “almost impossible” for the party to do so.</p>
      <p>These are some of the observations made by the Governor in his report recommending President’s rule in the state, where a prolonged political drama finally ended with a bitter divorce between saffron allies, the BJP and the Sena, and central rule being imposed.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) officials had claimed that Koshyari had not expressly mentioned any concern about horse-trading. Koshyari also made a reference to poaching before the elections, saying this “cannot be simply overlooked” if one goes for a floor test.</p>
      <p>The report, accessed by DH and sent on November 12, brings out facts that are not in the public domain, such as Devendra Fadnavis seeking “additional one day time” to respond to the Governor’s letter asking him to inform in two days whether the BJP was willing to form the government. Fadnavis’ request was rejected by Koshyari.</p>
      <p>On the floor test, the report said it was “neither feasible nor practical and would largely be an academic exercise” as the ground situation revealed.</p>
      <p>“Moreover, I am alive to the fact that in case of such a misadventure of having a floor test there are eminent possibilities of horse-trading, corruption and other illegal means being adopted by concerned persons to garner support, which in my view must be ruled out under any circumstances and at any cost. In this regard, the developments that have occurred on the eve of the aforesaid election of shifting prominent political leaders from one political party to another cannot simply be overlooked,” it said.</p>
      <p>This runs contrary to the claims of MHA officials, who said the Governor had not expressly mentioned any concern about horse-trading, and that his conclusions were based on the fact that no party was in a position to form the government.</p>
      <p>The 13-page report also refers to an apparent goof-up by Sena leaders. On November 11, Sena leaders met Koshiyari to apprise him about their intention to form the government by handing over a letter seeking his appointment. The letter, the report said, appeared to have been prepared for delivering to him in advance but was submitted in person and it didn’t have the reference to “claim to form the government”.</p>
      <p>On the NCP, the Governor said it had categorically told him that it was “not able and willing” to stake a claim for forming the government by November 12 and wanted three more days for consultations. However, Koshiyari noted, “already more than 15 days was available even with NCP.”</p>
      <p>Giving reasons for not inviting the Congress, he said the BJP, the Shiv Sena, which claimed support of eight independents, and the NCP together had 223 MLAs in the 288-member Assembly. Of the remaining 65 MLAs, Congress had just 44 and it was “obvious and crystal clear” it “can never form a majority government”.</p>
      <p>“It is needless to mention here itself that the difference between 65 and 145 (majority mark) is too large and too vast, which is almost impossible to bridge unless of course illegal and unconstitutional means are adopted as also recourse is taken to unethical, unlawful and therefore forbidden methods,” it said.</p>
      <p>The Congress also through a press statement had remarked that it was neither staking claim nor supporting any party, it said.</p>
      <p>The report, which is a blow-by-blow account of the unravelling of the Maharashtra crisis, said that all his attempts to explore the formation of a government had "unfortunately...failed".</p>
      <p>Even after the lapse of 17 days, none of the parties made a claim, "much less a stable government by demonstrating even prima facie that they enjoy the support of at least 145 newly elected members", the report said.</p>
