      <p>ISLAMABAD: Former finance minister Asad Umar <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1517451">made his way back</a> to the federal cabinet on Tuesday as he was sworn in as the minister for planning and development.</p>
      <p>President Dr Arif Alvi administered the oath to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA from Islamabad at a ceremony at Aiwan-i-Sadr.</p>
      <p>His predecessor in the planning ministry Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar was given the portfolio of minister for national food security, which was previously held by Sahibzada Mehboob Sultan, sources said.</p>
      <p>Mr Sultan has now been made the federal minister for States and Frontier Regions, the ministry that was previously headed by Shehryar Afridi as a minister of state.</p>
      <blockquote>Khusro Bakhtiar made minister for food security</blockquote>
      <p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan had stated in a tweet on Monday that Mr Umar would replace Mr Bakhtiar as minister for planning and development while the latter would be given the portfolio of petroleum minister.</p>
      <p>Mr Umar served as the finance minister for about eight months, from Aug 20 last year to April 18 this year.</p>
      <p>At the time of his <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1477146">removal</a> from the finance ministry, the prime minister had offered him the portfolio of petroleum minister, but he had declined, saying he would work for the party from outside the cabinet.</p>
      <p>According to the sources, more changes are expected to be made in the cabinet in the next few days.</p>
