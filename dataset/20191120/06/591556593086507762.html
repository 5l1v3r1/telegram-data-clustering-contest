        <b>Only avenue of recourse for robo-debt victims is legal action, Shadow Minister for Government Services Bill Shorten has said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The number of complainants taking part in a class action against Centrelink's robo-debt scheme has hit 4,000 as the writs for the action were filed, Shadow Minister for Government Services Bill Shorten said on Wednesday. <br/><br/>Announced in September, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/class-action-launched-into-centrelinks-robo-debt/">action</a> brought by Gordon Legal is seeking repayment of what is alleged to be "unlawfully claimed debts", as well as compensation for victims of the government scheme. <br/><br/>"This is a drastic but unfortunately necessary move for the victims of robo-debt -- Australians who have been hit with harsh, inaccurate and almost certainly illegal -- debt claims from the government," Shorten said. <br/><br/>"Labor has repeatedly called for the Liberals to scrap this scheme and address the shortcomings in it that saw innocent Australians have the robo-debt hounds sicced on them. <br/><br/>"But through disaster after disaster they have arrogantly refused to admit any issues, stonewalled, obfuscated and misled the public."</p>
      <p>The former Labor leader said up until this week, the government has refused to budge. <br/><br/>"In the face of such recalcitrance the only avenue of recourse for victims acting in good faith is the courts," he said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the government announced it was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/government-backflip-as-robo-debt-income-automation-paused/">pausing the automated parts</a> of the debt recovery process <br/><br/>Minister for Government Services Stuart Robert, who previously justified robo-debt by saying the government has a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/government-to-continue-robo-debt-in-the-name-of-mutual-responsibility/">lawful responsibility</a> to claw back money from welfare recipients, said he asked his department to identify the "small" cohort of Australians who have a debt raised solely on the basis of income averaging to discussions on seeking "further points of proof" can begin. <br/><br/>Last week, Robert was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/robert-defends-robo-debt-averaging-as-entirely-appropriate/">still defending the project</a>. <br/><br/>"Using averaging as the basis to say to a citizen, 'There may be a debt, can you please engage with us?' is entirely appropriate," Robert said on Thursday at the National Press Club. <br/><br/>"And that process of using averaging -- using ATO tax receipts or end of the year assessments -- to say to Australians, 'There may be a problem, please engage with us' is absolutely appropriate and we have responsibility to do that." <br/><br/>Gordon Legal said on Wednesday that it will be alleging that from July 2015, robo-debt caused "significant and unnecessary detrimental impact on thousands of lives". <br/><br/>"The stoppage of further robo-debt claims by Centrelink and the government is just the beginning of the battle," said Gordon Legal senior partner Peter Gordon. <br/><br/>"Our mission now is to ensure that Australians harmed by this predatory scheme are returned to their original position." <br/><br/>Questioned on the legal action at the National Press Club, Attorney-General Christian Porter said the government took legal advice relating to the class action and another litigation, but did not say explicitly the government had changed robo-debt due to the advice. <br/><br/>"You could imagine that any government, depending on where those matters are in the process of litigation, seeks advice on those individual matters, and that's fed in, obviously, to decision-making in the Department of Human Services and in the minister's office," he said. <br/><br/>"But again ... this is an issue that pertains to a group of people -- the number of which is unknown, but obviously that's the work that's being done -- who were sent a notice to respond to the Department of Human Services based on the data income matching to explain a discrepancy but who made no effort to engage and did not engage with the department." <br/><br/>On the issue of defamation and online platforms, Porter said during his speech on Wednesday that he believes social sites and media should be covered by the same law. <br/><br/>"My own view is that these online platforms should be held to essentially the same standards as other publishers but that how this should occur requires a sensible measured approach to reform taking into account the differences in the volume of material hosted between Twitter or Facebook and a traditional newspaper, for instance," he said. <br/><br/>"But what is clear is the playing field is not at all fair at the moment."</p>
