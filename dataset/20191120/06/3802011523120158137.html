      <h1>China says Zimbabwe aid almost 40 times higher than govt figure</h1>
      <h2>China on Tuesday refuted a claim by Zimbabwe´s government that it only received $3.6 million in aid from Beijing this year, saying the actual figure was almost 40 times higher.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:58:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:58</time> by <a rel="author">Zimbabwe´s government that it only received $3.6 million in aid from Beijing this year, saying the actual figure was almost 40 times higher.</a></address>
      <p>The Chinese remarks came after Zimbabwe’s Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube listed bilateral aid figures while presenting Zimbabwe’s 2020 budget last week.</p>
      <p>Ncube said China’s contribution was significantly lower than amounts Zimbabwe received from other international donors.</p>
      <p>The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe responded by saying the $3.6 million (3.2 million euros) figure was “very different” from reality on the ground.</p>

      <p>“According to our record, from January to September 2019, the actual bilateral support provided to Zimbabwe by China is $136.8 million,” an embassy statement said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It asked the Zimbabwean government to “make comprehensive assessments on the statistics of bilateral supports” and “reflect its actual situation” when making budget statements.</p>
      <p>China is Africa’s largest trading partner.</p>
      <p>Beijing promised $60 billion in loans and aid to the continent at a major summit with African leaders last year — a pledge that came of top of another $60 billion made at a similar event in 2015.</p>
      <p>The country has maintained strong diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe since its independence from Britain in 1980.</p>
      <p>Under former president Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe adopted a “Look East” policy after a fallout with the US and the EU over rights abuses and controversial land reforms.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s government said it had “noted the query” raised by the Chinese embassy.</p>
      <p>“Necessary consultations are underway to establish a common accounting position,” tweeted the information ministry.</p>
      <p>Ncube’s $3.6 million figure was pale compared to the $50 million he said Zimbabwe received from both Britain and the United States, the $41 million donated by the European Union and the $28 million received from Sweden.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s economy has been crippled by decades of mismanagement under Mugabe.</p>
      <p>Galloping hyperinflation has wiped out savings and sent the cost of living soaring.</p>
      <p>Unemployment is estimated at around 90 percent and even basic goods such as bread and fuel are hard to come by.</p>
      <p>Ncube said the economy was expected to contract by 6.5% in 2019, with prospects of up to 3% recovery in 2020 — spurred by a better farming season and a marginal reduction in value-added tax.</p>
      <p>China has been a major partner in most of Zimbabwe’s projects, including the building of a new parliament and a school of intelligence. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7703061/China-says-Zimbabwe-aid-40-times-higher-govt-figure.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
