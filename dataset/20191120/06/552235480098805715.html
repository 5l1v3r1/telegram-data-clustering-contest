      <h1>Film Rangers and Celtic dressing rooms before powderkeg clash, Scottish football needs Netflix-style drama - Michael Gannon</h1>
      <h2>Michael reckons the madness of our game would benefit from an access-all-areas approach.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gannon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-gannon/</a></address>
      <p>American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron said the revolution will not be televised but that was before the big man could devour box sets on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a>.</p>
      <p>The small screen has never been bigger, where hundreds of channels are still not enough for us so we top up our viewing with streaming stations for a few quid a month.</p>
      <p>The couch has never been more comfortable and we can bombard our eyes with millions of hours of shows, films and every kind of sport.</p>
      <p>Broadcasters are determined to tap in to whatever branch of entertainment sees a surge. Right now it’s true crime documentaries and fire-breathing dragons.</p>
      <p>But it’s also behind-the-scenes sports docu-dramas, where fans have been able to peek around the curtains at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a>, Sunderland, Leeds United and the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>BBC’s look at David Robertson’s Real Kashmir was unmissable TV, even if some of the language would make a brickie blush. We lap all this stuff up – but it’s time for Scottish football to tap in to the market.</p>

      <p>New Hibs boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> has admitted he won’t miss the cameras poking around after going through it all at Sunderland but that’s exactly what we need.</p>
      <p>What we might lack in quality we make up for in drama and a warts-and-all look behind the scenes would make Narcos look a bit like Emmerdale. Get the cameras in the dressing room before an Old Firm clash. Let’s see training bust-ups, the magic worked on shoestring budgets, rows with refs, players stepping out of line and those in dodgy clobber. Get the Go-Pro on an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arbroath-fc">Arbroath</a> player to see Dick Campbell react to losing.</p>
      <p>Opening up the doors and letting everyone see the madness would be box office and could drive more to actually watch the games.</p>
      <p>The Scottish football revolution should be televised. Fly on the wall? We’d be on to it like flies on a s****.</p>
