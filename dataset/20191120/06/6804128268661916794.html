      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have announced Jose Mourinho as their new head coach.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino at the helm in north London on a contract until the end of the 2022/23 season after Pochettino was sacked on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Spurs announced the news of Mourinho's appointment at 6.30am on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: â€œI am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked as manager at Spurs after picking up just three wins in the 2019/20 season but also only five and a half months after leading the team to the Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool in Madrid in May.</p>

      <p>Spurs haven't won away from home in the Premier League since January this year. Reports have claimed that the former boss had lost the dressing room and that a meeting was held earlier this week with chairman Daniel Levy where Pochettino was given his marching orders.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the decision, chairman Daniel Levey said: "In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room."</p>
