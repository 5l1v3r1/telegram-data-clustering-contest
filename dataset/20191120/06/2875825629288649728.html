      <h1>Young Offenders star Alex Murphy says naked botched sex scenes with Demi Isaac Oviawe are fun</h1>
      <h2>Viewers watched open-mouthed as Chris stripped down to his birthday suit in the school principal’s office</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eoin Murphy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/the-young-offenders">Young Offenders</a> star Alex Murphy said his naked, botched sex scenes with co-star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/demi-isaac-oviawe">Demi Isaac Oviawe</a> are old fashioned fun.</p>
      <p>The return of the cult comedy series for a second run attracted 370,000 on its opening night on RTE Two and is already the comedy hit of 2019 for the national broadcaster.</p>
      <p>And while the focus of episode one was the storyline of Jock and Siobhan’s teenage pregnancy, it is the blossoming romance between Conor (Alex) and Linda (Demi) that earned the biggest belly laughs.</p>
      <p>Viewers watched open mouthed as Chris stripped down to his birthday suit in the school principal’s office as the pair attempted unsuccessfully to ‘go all the way’.</p>
      <p>And Alex, 21, admits that this is a running theme for series two and that his embarrassing scenes with Demi, 18, get more frequent as the series progresses.</p>

      <p>“We would love to do a series three but in all honesty that means that the embarrassing stuff will get much worse”, he told The Irish Mirror.</p>
      <p>“I have kind of hit rock bottom in this series anyway, but I am sure they can find something worse.</p>
      <p>“Those scenes are fun or they can be awkward, and you just have to make them fun otherwise it is just me being naked and embarrassed all day.</p>
      <p>“The scenes with Demi have to be fun, and she is so great and professional which is really hard, when you have this eejit in front of her taking his clothes off.</p>
      <p>“Those moments aren’t awkward because we are both there to do a job.</p>
      <p>“There is no point getting nervous or awkward so we get on with it and just have fun with it and hopefully the audience comes on the journey with us.”</p>
      <p>Both Conor and Jock are no stranger to embarrassing situations stripping off together in front of the Principal in a memorable classroom scene during season two.</p>
      <p>And while Conor has broken up with Linda, Alex hinted that the future might be bright for the pair.</p>

      <p>“I can’t say too much but let’s just say there are far more embarrassing and compromising situations ahead for Conor and Linda.</p>
      <p>“I think people are bizarrely behind Conor and Linda and want them to get back together.</p>
      <p>“Maybe they just want to see me in the most humiliating situations on the planet, who knows?”</p>
