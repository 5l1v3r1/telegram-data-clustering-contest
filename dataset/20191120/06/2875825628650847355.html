      <h2>Now fully back in the Munster fold, Ireland's no 9 is long enough in the tooth to know what was coming after the latest disappointment on the world stage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Conor Murray has no problem with the public inquest that has been conducted since Ireland's World Cup quarter-final collapse. <br/><br/>Now fully back in the Munster fold, Ireland's no 9 is long enough in the tooth to know what was coming after the latest disappointment on the world stage. <br/><br/>"I understand it," said Murray. "I've been around long enough now to understand how people react. <br/><br/>"It's because this team has been really, really successful over the past five years. We hadn't seen that success in an Irish team, or been involved in it. <br/><br/>"So I hadn't seen the spin-off when things don't go that well - the spin-off from the heights. <br/><br/>"When things are going so well, I genuinely don't see much media - hand on heart, I don't -  but you get a feeling of it, that people are building you up to this massive thing. <br/><br/>"I didn't see the other side of it or expect it because we hadn't been at that level of the past four or five years. <br/><br/>"People are probably upset. They do want us to go well. So when it doesn't happen, people are looking for reasons. There are all sorts of opinions. <br/><br/>"We were really confident about what we were trying to do. Our game plan was brilliant. It was just a shame we didn't execute because we created chances, but we didn't finish. <br/><br/>"New Zealand were brilliant that day. Out of the top six teams, anyone can beat each other. <br/><br/>"You saw it with England, dominating New Zealand and then being beaten by South Africa. Obviously, our defeat was quite heavy. But you process it, try to get over it. <br/><br/>"You'll carry it for a while and there are certain motivational things...but the best is to be positive, try to get back out there, play the game you love and enjoy it."</p>

      <p>Murray will even be giving Joe Schmidt's self-penned memoir 'Ordinary Joe' - which hits the shelves tomorrow - a wide berth, at least until he gets word that he's not on the receiving end of criticism. <br/><br/>"It might be really damaging to read it for yourself...I might leave it off until I finish playing," he laughed. <br/><br/>"I'm sure it will be brilliant, a great insight into his mind, if it's going to be a coaching book or whatever way he wants it to come across. <br/><br/>"It will be fascinating. I think he wrote it himself, so I'll get someone to read it first and if there's anything bad about me, I'll wait until I finish playing!" <br/><br/>Murray wants to bounce back from Japan by having a successful season with Munster, who face Racing on Saturday in their second Champions Cup pool game. <br/><br/>"First of all, get over the World Cup, enjoying playing and being part of a really determined and motivated group," he remarked. <br/><br/>"The aim is to win trophies with this club. It's just being back in here trying to get better, enjoy rugby, improve your craft." <br/><br/>Attack coach Stephen Larkham claims it's not a frustration that Joey Carbery returned from the World Cup with an ankle problem that originated in August. <br/><br/>"It’s not at the moment because Tyler (Bleyendaal) and JJ (Hanrahan) are playing really good footy," said Larkham. <br/><br/>“It’s a World Cup, comes around once every four years. It’s something that’s very special. <br/><br/>"Joey wanted to push himself, the coaches wanted him out there because he’s such a talented player. I can understand the situation. <br/><br/>“We want to make sure that we rehab this properly, give him a good chance to get back to peak fitness".</p>
