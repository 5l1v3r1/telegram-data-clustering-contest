      <p>From the looks of it, Hina seems to be playing the role of a modern woman in the movie. She had earlier revealed the name of her character on Instagram stories. Her character is called Sameera Khanna. The film also stars Rohan Shah and Mohit Malhotra in pivotal roles.</p>
      <p>Hacked explores the dark underbelly of the web and deals with the issue of cybercrime. Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt earlier said, “Hacked is not a horror film but a thriller film. The film is about the perils of our online lives and talks about how in today’s time everything about everyone is just a click away, nothing remains exclusive or private.”</p>
      <p>Apart from Hacked, the fans of TV’s reigning queen Hina Khan are waiting for the release of her Bollywood debut Lines. She will also be seen in Hungama Play’s original web series Damaged 2, where she will share the screen with Adhyayan Suman. She has also shot for a short film titled Smart Phone.</p>
