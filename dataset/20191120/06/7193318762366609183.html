      <p>A dark money group associated with Republicans is financing television and digital ads that began running in the Oklahoma City area this week attacking U.S. Rep. Kendra Horn.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for American Action Network, which is sponsoring the ads, said the group is spending $250,000, with most of that going to broadcast stations.</p>
      <p>Horn, D-Oklahoma City, is a top target of state and national Republicans since she represents a district that President Donald Trump won in 2016 by 11 points. Horn upset a Republican incumbent in last year’s election.</p>
      <p>The new ad includes photos of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, of New York, and Adam Schiff, of California — all unpopular Democratic figures with many Republicans.</p>
      <p>“Their partisan impeachment is a politically motivated charade,” the ad’s narrator states. “Kendra Horn promised to be different but she’s not. Instead of working to secure our border, fix health care and pass a new trade deal with our neighbors that creates real jobs, she supported the partisan impeachment investigation.”</p>
      <p>Ward Curtin, spokesman for Horn’s campaign, said "Congresswoman Horn remains committed to a transparent, public process for the House's investigation.</p>
      <p>“She is dedicated to doing the work she promised the people of Oklahoma, which includes a record number of town halls and community conversations to hear directly from Oklahomans. No amount of dark money spending from Washington, D.C., groups will change her mind."</p>
      <p>American Action Network is organized under the federal tax code as a social welfare organization. Nonprofit groups organized in that way do not have to report their donors. According to a news release from the group, the Horn ad is part of a $7 million campaign targeting Democrats in 20 districts.</p>
      <p>The group’s chairman is former U.S. Sen. Norm Coleman, a Minnesota Republican, who is now a lobbyist in Washington, D.C. The group’s board includes business people and other former GOP elected officials now lobbying in Washington.</p>
      <p>Several Republicans have announced their intention to run for the 5th District congressional seat. The district includes most of Oklahoma County and Pottawatomie and Seminole counties.</p>
      <p>Horn voted to expand the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump into a public phase. She has insisted that she has not made up her mind about whether Trump should be impeached. At a town hall meeting on Sunday she said she has been working on issues like prescription drug prices, student loans and military policy and not focusing on impeachment.</p>
      <p>However, she said Congress’ authority to conduct oversight is important.</p>
      <p>“I did not seek out and did not call for an impeachment inquiry, and I was not one of those that was there saying, ‘We’ve got to do this,’” Horn said Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Because I think it’s important that we continue to do our work. And at the same time, I think it’s important that information come to light. We are a country and a nation of laws. … And no one is above the law.”</p>
