      <h1>Celtic points predictor for defining December duel with Rangers</h1>
      <h2>The big game outcomes predicted ahead of a huge month for the Scottish champions.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic and Rangers will share the same world class training facility in Dubai for the winter break but who will be feeling the heat in the title race when they arrive in the Middle East?</p>
      <p>Both clubs face a mammoth month in December in the league - not to mention the small matter of a Betfred Cup final showdown between the bitter rivals - with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>’s side facing a seven-match spell and Neil Lennon’s men eight games.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> goes into cold storage after the Glasgow giants clash at Parkhead and here former Celtic full-back Mark Wilson gives his verdict to Gavin Berry and ex-Ibrox defender Hugh Burns to Gary Ralston on the games that matter.</p>
      <h3>Celtic v Livingston November 23</h3>
      <p>Livi have a certain system that can frustrate - you saw that Ibrox where they were good for long periods despite losing 3-1 - and Celtic’s defeat at Almondvale in October will be on their mind.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But Livi are a different proposition on their own pitch and Ryan Christie was sent off so there certain factors and on the big pitch where gaps open up when Celtic move the ball quickly I expect them to exploit that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 3-0 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Ross County v Celtic December 1 (After Rennes)</h3>
      <p>An early kick off in Dingwall brings its own dangers. I know people say it’s only three hours away and English teams have to travel that distance all the time and they’re right but it can be a bit of a comedown after a European game.</p>
      <p>The Staggies have been hit or miss this season but it is one I see as potentially being a problem but I still see <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> winning it by the odd goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-1 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Celtic v Hamilton December 4</h3>
      <p>Rangers travel to Pittodrie on the same night and this is easier on paper and could be the night Neil Lennon makes changes just a few days before the Betfred Cup final.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article20828927.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0__GFMP_SDR_061119-Celtic-V-Lazio-fans-Rome-053.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>No disrespect to Hamilton but they’ve found it difficult going to Parkhead and I can see the likes of Greg Taylor and even Olivier Ntcham, who hasn’t had a lot of game time, coming in and I expect them to win by a clear margin.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 4-0 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Celtic v Hibs December 15 (After Betfred Cup final and Cluj)</h3>
      <p>If Paul Heckingbottom had still been in charge of Hibs then I’d have gone for a comfortable evening for Celtic but Jack Ross will have them playing a better style of football.</p>
      <p>Managers usually get a bounce but this will be a few weeks down the road from Jack’s appointment, however, they will make it tough but Celtic will play at a good temp and get over the line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 3-1 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Hearts v Celtic December 18</h3>
      <p>This is the one I’d be concerned about. When people were tipping a resounding <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> win before their 1-1 draw in October I went the other way because Tynecastle is always a tough place to go regardless of their form.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hearts raise their game for the Old Firm and we don’t know who will be in charge. I expect them to play direct to Uche Ikpeazu and if they are to drop points in December then this could be the night.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 1-1 draw</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Celtic v Aberdeen December 21</h3>
      <p>I was at Parkhead when Aberdeen finally won there on the final day a couple of seasons ago but their record in the east end of Glasgow had been poor up until then.</p>
      <p>James Forrest and Tom Rogic have been particularly good against them but Celtic will realise the importance of this and I’m sure they’ll be fine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-0 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>St Mirren v Celtic December 26</h3>
      <p>You never know what you’re going to get in a Boxing Day fixture. St Mirren, a bit like Livingston, can make it hard for you on the small pitch.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But I’m looking at my mate Jim Goodwin’s side and the amount of goals they’re conceding is concerning and up against one of the top strikeforces in the country I can only see one outcome.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 3-1 win</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Celtic v Rangers December 29</h3>
      <p>I don’t expect Steven Gerrard to go with the same system as the derby defeat at Ibrox in Septemher. He gave Celtic too much time on the ball, there was no width and Celtic’s full-backs probably won’t have an easier day.</p>
      <p>They didn’t test Celtic’s backline but that will be different and we could be in for a cracker. I don’t like to sit on the fence but I’m going for a scoring draw.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: 2-2 draw</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>TOTAL POINTS: 20 out of 24</b>
