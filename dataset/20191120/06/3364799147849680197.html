      <p>Two of WeWork's biggest rivals are cashing in on its public meltdown.</p>
      <p>"We're in a hypergrowth stage at the moment," Mark Dixon, the CEO of IWG, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432498/inside-the-meeting-thatll-determine-weworks-fate-plus-the-eventual-return-of-cofounder-adam-neumann">told Fast Company</a>. The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">collapse of WeWork's initial public offering</a>, the coworking startup's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/softbank-agrees-to-rescue-wework-in-a-bailout-deal-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">rescue by SoftBank</a>, and its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-layoffs-began-on-monday-sources-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">ongoing overhaul</a> are helping IWG — which boasts 3,500 global locations to WeWork's 625 — to expand and acquire smaller competitors, he said.</p>
      <p>WeWork's troubles have "led to more demand for us" and "created an even brighter spotlight on the industry," Dixon said during a trading update this month. "The knowledge of the industry went up by many notches during that whole period."</p>
      <p>IWG is weighing several acquisitions and expects more prospects next year "as the market inevitably consolidates in the post-WeWork scene," he added.</p>
      <p>"Our strategy has been greatly helped by the focus that they have put [on flexible office leasing], so we are grateful to them for that," Dixon told Fast Company. "Thank you, WeWork."</p>
      <p>CBRE has also benefited from WeWork's bad press. The world's largest commercial real-estate services firm has received more interest in Hana, a coworking business it launched in Dallas last quarter and plans to expand to California and London by early next year.</p>
      <p>"We're seeing some incremental inquiries from occupiers of Hana," CEO Robert Sulentic said on an earnings call this month. "Landlords are considering going in our direction that maybe weren't before."</p>
      <p>CBRE may be winning from the fallout, but Sulentic argued in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-11-19/the-wework-story-got-overtold-cbre-group-s-ceo-video">Bloomberg interview this week</a> that WeWork had attracted a disproportionate amount of attention in the first place.</p>
      <p>"I think that story got a little overtold for a bunch of reasons," he said. "WeWork was doing a lot of leasing in New York and London and some other markets, but we're the biggest leasing company in the world."</p>
      <p>Sulentic added that coworking generated only 4% of CBRE's leasing revenue over the past year but that he expected the industry segment to grow from about 2% of multi-tenant office space today to as much as 10% in the coming years.</p>
