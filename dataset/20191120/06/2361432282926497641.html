      <h1>Nickelodeon Renews 'Blue's Clues and You!' for Season 2</h1>
      <h2>Series premiered Nov. 11</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/margeauxsippell/" target="_blank">Margeaux Sippell</a></address>
      <p>Nickelodeon has renewed “Blue’s Clues &amp; You!” for a second season.</p>
      <p>The children’s network ordered an additional 20 episodes of the preschool series, which premiered on Nov. 11. A remake of the 1996 classic “Blue’s Clues” series, “Blue’s Clues &amp; You!” follows new host Josh (Josh Dela Cruz) and Blue on new adventures.</p>
      <p>In Season 2, original “Blue’s Clues” host Steve (Steve Burns) will make an appearance, as will the show’s second host, Joe (Donovan Patton), and Dela Cruz’s grandmother. Season 2 will also feature “even more singing and dancing, exploration, celebration, and of course clues that empower preschoolers to help their friends,” according to the network.</p>
      <p>Nickelodeon also has plans to debut a new “Blue’s Clues &amp; You!” inspired float at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, on which Dela Cruz will perform alongside a 22-foot tall Blue covered in 13 pounds of glitter.</p>

      <p>The original “Blue’s Clues” aired on Nickelodeon from 1996 to 2006. The remake features a modern take on beloved “Blue’s Clues” hallmarks, like the Handy Dandy Notebook, which is now a smartphone that Josh can have video calls and receive emails. Blue and his pal Magenta have been updated with CG-animation, and original characters Tickety Tock, Slippery Soap, Shovel, Pail, Mr. Salt, Mrs. Pepper, Cinnamon, Paprika, Felt Friends, Sidetable Drawer and Mailbox will all return — plus the original Thinking Chair. New additions include Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper’s twins, Sage and Ginger, and an all-new Handy Dandy Guitar.</p>
      <p>New episodes of “Blue’s Clues &amp; You!” are currently airing weekdays at 11 a.m. ET/PT on Nickelodeon.</p>
