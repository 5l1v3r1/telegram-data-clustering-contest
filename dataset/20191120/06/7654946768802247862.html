      <h1>CM Punk talks wrestling future, ‘garbage’ WWE creative in ‘Backstage’ debut</h1>

      <p>CM Punk didn’t drop any major pipebombs in his first official appearance on “WWE Backstage, but it didn’t stop him from being critical of WWE and addressing whether he’d be back competing in the ring. It’s going to take some work to get him to put on trunks for WWE again – but there is a chance.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of what my answer is, there’s always going to be someone that’s upset with it,” said Punk, who has not wrestled since January 2014. “As I’ve stated I work for Fox. I haven’t talked to anyone in WWE. It’s nothing that I’m actively pursuing and interested in. But I’m 41 years old and I’ve lived and experienced life where I know to not say no, but that’s gonna be a bridge that is gonna have to be built and it might take as long as The Great Wall of China because there’s some hurdles there.”</p>
      <p>One of the WWE stars who have already called out Punk on Twitter for a potential match is Seth Rollins. The former WWE champion wasn’t having any of it and gave Rollins some advice.</p>
      <p>“Seth needs to stop tweeting a realize that sometimes it’s better to be viewed at as the fool when you shut our month [or] you open your mouth and remove all doubt,” Punk said.</p>

      <p>It was all part of and appearance that included a 10-plus minute interview with host Renee Young on the FS1 studio show. Punk touched on his standing with Fox and WWE, his role on “WWE Backstage” and his feelings on WWE’s current product. Punk said he would be critical of the product like he “always has” and can be because his job on the show does not come with ties to WWE. He called it “strictly a me and Fox thing.”</p>
      <p>“Nobody is gonna fire me,” Punk said. “I’m not gonna get jobbed out, suspended, sent to TV but told I’m not needed. All these things don’t exist in my world anymore.”</p>
      <p>He called WWE’s current product “overproduced” and “micromanaged” and called it “the same as when I left it.” Punk applauded what women’s division has done but said it didn’t need to be called a revolution or need a hastag.</p>
      <p>“Just let the women be the women,” he said. “They’ll show you why they kick ass.”</p>
      <p>Punk was able to get into more specifics about WWE later in the show.  He called turning the Universal championship from red to blue “stupid” and went off on Baron Corbin bringing out a mascot dog as part of his rivalry with Roman Reigns, labeling it as “garbage” while egging on Paige into agreeing with him. She eventually gave a thumbs down.</p>
      <p>“You can’t possibly defend that,” Punk said of the segment.</p>
      <p>He did put over the Survivor Series match between Brock Lesnar and Rey Mysterio calling it “a diamond in the rough” for the show because of the talent of the two performers and the story behind it.</p>
      <p>All in all Punk appeared to enjoy the debut — <a href="https://twitter.com/WWEonFOX/status/1197017067779690496/video/1">even cutting a promo on Tom Arnold.</a></p>
      <p>“I’m at a point in my life were I get to pick and choose what I do and I don’t have to work with Jerks,” he said. “It’s crazy man.”</p>
