      <p>Do you find yourself eating less meat and more plant-based foods than you did a few years ago?</p>
      <p>If so, you're not alone. Retail sales of plant-based foods in the U.S. are up 11 percent in the past year.</p>
      <p>A vegan diet – with no animal products, including no eggs or dairy products – is also growing in popularity.</p>
      <p>"With that transition and going completely plant-based, you have less of an intake of saturated fat, you have a lot of fruits, you have a lot of vegetables, whole grains, legumes, soy products, nuts, seeds, all of those are rich fiber and phytochemicals,” said Amy Kimberlain, a spokesperson for the <a href="https://www.eatright.org/">Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics</a>.</p>
      <p>A vegan diet can help lower your cholesterol level, improve blood sugar and reduce the risk of some forms of cancer.</p>
      <p>Because they don’t eat any meat, fish, poultry, eggs or cheese, vegans need to make sure they’re fulfilling their nutritional needs.</p>
      <p>"Certain key nutrients that you would want to pay attention to when going vegan would be overall protein intake, iron, calcium, vitamin D, vitamin B-12, zinc and omega 3s,” Kimberlain explained. “When planned properly and consumed throughout the day, you're able to receive enough, but it takes careful planning."</p>
