      <p>COLOMBO: Sri Lanka captain and veteran pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Lasith-Malinga">Lasith Malinga</a> has had a rethink on his decision to retire after next year's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/live-cricket-score">Twenty20</a> World Cup, saying he can carry on for another two years.</p>
      <p>Malinga, in March, had stated that he wanted to retire after the Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia next year. But the 36-year-old, who captains Sri Lanka in the shortest format, now says he can play on beyond that.</p>
      <p>"T20 is four overs and I feel with my skill, I can manage T20 as a bowler. As a captain, because I've played so many T20s around the world that I feel I can manage that period for maybe another two years," Malinga told 'ESPNCricinfo'.</p>
      <p>The veteran said he is waiting to hear from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sri-lanka-national-cricket-team">Sri Lanka Cricket</a> on whether he would be leading the side in the Twenty20 showpiece.</p>
      <p>"(Sri Lanka Cricket) said for the World Cup I have to be lead there but you never know in Sri Lanka," he said.</p>
      <p>The only bowler with 100 T20 International wickets said Sri Lanka need continuity in leadership for a lasting change of fortunes after a period of slump.</p>
      <p>"Sri Lanka are lacking that skillful bowler, they lack those consistencies. We can't get one year, one and a half years, all fixed, it might be that we need to get patience, maybe two or three years," he said.</p>
      <p>"Consistency is very important. I feel whoever is doing the next selection have to understand that (for) people (to learn), they have to be there. If he's on the bench, nobody can learn," he added.</p>
      <p>Malinga said the only way he can contribute to the game in the country is by continuing to play.</p>
      <p>"If I believe I can give something for the youngsters, then I need to be there. I can tell, but now I can show them 'this is the way how you do it.' But if I don't play then I can't do that," he said.</p>
      <p>Since his reappointment as captain, Sri Lanka have won one, tied one, and lost eight of their last 10 T20 Internationals.</p>
