      <p>The non-league side scored a 96th minute equaliser in the 2-2 draw in the Black Country to earn a replay against the Saddlers.</p>
      <p>Clarke’s men now face a 320-mile round trip to the North East and the boss wants his side to focus on a game that he says no-one will want them to win.</p>
      <p>“We go there, the TV cameras are there and everyone wants the underdog to win,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Our backs are against the wall in that aspect.</p>
      <p>“For me, it’s about going up there and doing a job professionally and try and get ourselves in the second round.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had both ends of the spectrum in the FA Cup where I’ve been the underdog and the ones that are expected to win.</p>
      <p>“Both of them are not easy things to do, but it’s always hard when everyone is willing Darlo to go through.</p>
      <p>“If we’re professional and approach the game as we have done in the last couple of games then I’m sure we’ll do alright.</p>
      <p>“It’s 11 men vs 11 men with two goalkeepers a referee and two linesmen, that’s all it is.</p>
      <p>“Take all the rubbish away, the team names, and that’s football isn’t it.</p>
      <p>“Yes we’re expected to win because we have better players, because they’re playing higher up the pyramid.</p>
      <p>“But it counts for nothing.</p>
      <p>“If they raise their game 10 or 15 per cent and we dip below that – that’s why you see non-league teams beat Premier League teams.</p>
      <p>“The focus has got to be on winning the football game, don’t worry about the occasion.</p>
      <p>“Go out there and win a game of football.”</p>
      <p>And for the club, progressing in cup competitions also means bringing in extra revenue.</p>
      <p>Clarke says it makes a difference as the money earned from the cups can go towards new player signings.</p>
      <p>“It is (big) when you bring in a pound and spend a pound, that’s what we do,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Even progressing in the EFL Trophy is big.</p>
      <p>“People belittle that competition and I get that with the Premier League teams in it.</p>
      <p>“But for financial rewards it’s a big competition for us.</p>
      <p>“And the FA Cup is a big competition for us.</p>
      <p>“The more money you can gain through revenue, the more I can buy myself some new toys.”</p>
