      <h4>Who is leading the interest?</h4>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">the Sun's report,</a> Everton are understood to have sent scouts "to watch [Cash] on several occasions already this season".</p>
      <p>His versatility is said to be one of the reasons for the Toffees' interest.</p>
      <p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/everton-matty-cash-nottingham-forest-3553610">the figure of £12m is quoted</a> as the fee Marco Silva is lining up to take Cash to Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>Palace and Southampton are also credited with "keeping an eye on Cash" as they plan their January transfer business.</p>
      <h4>What Lamouchi has said on January</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>After defender Alexander Milosevic left the club "by mutual consent" in October, the Forest boss was asked whether that departure could free up space in the squad or funds for the January window.</p>
      <p>Discussing January plans, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Lamouchi</a> <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-january-transfer-news-3537390">said at the time:</a> "You are talking about the next window.</p>
      <p>“We have 11 or 12 games to play until then, so I just want to focus on Luton (who were the club’s next opponents).”</p>
      <h4>'Really tough to turn that down'</h4>
      <p>Forest legend Kenny Burns has had his say on the Cash speculation.</p>
      <p>"It didn’t come as a huge surprise to see Matty Cash linked with a move away from Nottingham Forest when the transfer window opens in the New Year," <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-cash-3549393">Burns told Nottinghamshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>"In all honesty, seeing your players linked with other clubs can be seen as a good thing because generally, it means they’re playing well and so is the team.</p>
      <p>"Cash has been a revelation at right-back since being played there by Sabri Lamouchi, following injuries to Tendayi Darikwa and then Carl Jenkinson.</p>
      <p>"I’ve said before that I’d much rather see a round peg in a round hole and that would always be the case, although in fairness to Cash, he’s let nobody down and has stuck manfully to his task.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"He’s great for a manager to have around the squad.</p>
      <p>"Cash is willing to learn, he’s eager, works tirelessly, never stops running and, I’d imagine, he would do anything his manager asks of him, and that can sometimes be a rare commodity.</p>
      <p>"While it might just be speculation, when you’re talking about the money that’s been reported, it would be really tough to turn that down.</p>
      <p>"The fact of the matter at clubs like Forest that don’t benefit from the Premier League riches is that to remain competitive and stay within Financial Fair Play rules, you have to sell players.</p>
      <p>"Granted, £12m would seem to be a lot of money, but we all know there’s a premium attached to young British players and at the age of 22, Cash still has the prime of his career to come."</p>

      <h4>What fans are saying</h4>
      <p>Plenty of Forest supporters reacted to the report linking Everton with a January move for Cash.</p>
      <p>Some felt the supposed £12m valuation was too low, while there was a suggestion that the interest is an indirect result of Forest's impressive Championship form so far in 2019-20.</p>
