      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): theedgemarkets.com has highlighted ten stocks with momentum at Bursa Malaysia’s afternoon close today. Two stocks displayed positive momentum while eight displayed negative momentum.</p>
      <p>The stocks with positive momentum were:</p>
      <p>Alam Maritim Resources Bhd – up 2.5 sen to 12.5 sen</p>
      <p>Gunung Capital Bhd – up 2.5 sen to 33 sen</p>
      <p>The stocks with negative momentum were:</p>
      <p>Dagang Nexchange Bhd – up 0.5 sen to 28.5 sen</p>
      <p>Euro Holdings Bhd – up 4 sen to 17.5 sen</p>
      <p>Fintec Global Bhd – up 1.5 sen to 9.5 sen</p>
      <p>Foundpac Group Bhd – down 2.5 sen to 57 sen</p>
      <p>Guan Chong Bhd – down 21 sen to RM2.80</p>
      <p>Naim Holdings Bhd – up 6 sen to RM1.09</p>
      <p>Omesti Bhd – down 0.5 sen to 50 sen</p>
      <p>Solution Group Bhd – unchanged at 12.5 sen</p>
      <p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
      <p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendations. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
      <p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally persists for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.</p>
