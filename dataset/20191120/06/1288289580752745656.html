      <p><b>Share Market News Today | Sensex, Nifty, Share Prices LIVE: </b>The headline Sensex soared to a fresh record high on Wednesday morning, led by a rally in index heavyweight <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/reliance-industries-ltd-stock-price/">Reliance Industries</a>. The Sensex gained more than 295 points to hit a new all-time high of 40,769, while the Nifty reclaimed the crucial 12,000-mark. Sensex’s surge to record high came after Reliance Industries shares soared to a fresh record high on Wednesday morning, after the firm announced yesterday that Reliance Jio will also hike tariffs. Reliance Industries share price gained by more than 3.5% to hit the day’s high at Rs 1,569 on BSE. The firm is now kissing distance away from the Rs 10 lakh crore mcap figure. Billionaire <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/mukesh-ambani/">Mukesh Ambani</a>-led Reliance Jio will join telecom rivals in raising tariffs. Telecom tariffs are finally set to rise with Reliance Jio stating that to strengthen the industry it will take measures like increasing tariffs in the next few weeks. On Monday, <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/vodafone-idea-ltd-stock-price/">Vodafone Idea</a> and <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/bharti-airtel-ltd-stock-price/">Bharti Airtel</a> had said that they will increase tariffs from December. This will be the first time since September 2016 — when Reliance Jio launched its services — that tariffs will be revised upwards by the telecom companies. However, none of the companies have said by how much will the tariffs be raised and whether the hike will be an increase in headline rates or realisations will improve by way of reducing the validity of pre-paid vouchers, etc. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea tariff hikes come as the Indian telecom industry posted a record quarterly loss. Vodafone Idea posted a loss of Rs 50,921 crore for the July-September quarter, owing to provision for the Supreme Court’s ruling on payment of AGR dues, even as ongoing brutal pricing war continued to hurt. This was the highest ever quarterly loss posted by any company in India. In the year-ago period, the telco recorded a loss of Rs 4,947 crore. Even Bharti Airtel recorded a loss of Rs 23,044 crore for the quarter ended 30 September 2019 due to Rs 28,450 crore provisions towards AGR. We bring to you LIVE updates.</p>
