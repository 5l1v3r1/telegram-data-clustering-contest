      <p>When it comes to addressing homelessness, service providers believe Oklahoma City is at a tipping point.</p>
      <p>Housing costs are rising. Serious mental health disorders are a continuing problem. Substance abuse plagues communities. Social services are strapped for funding.</p>
      <p>If left unaddressed, these factors bring about long-term crises comparable to the significant housing and homelessness issues in cities like Denver and San Francisco, said Ian Colgan, assistant executive director of the Oklahoma City Housing Authority.</p>
      <p>“In those cases, the government wasn’t quick enough to get ahead of those issues,” Colgan said. “But we are in a position where we can still get ahead, which is really unique in American cities.”</p>
      <p>And to get ahead, organizations like the housing authority, the Homeless Alliance and Mental Health Oklahoma plan to take a $50 million investment from MAPS 4, leverage over $400 million in outside funding and reshape public housing in Oklahoma City.</p>
