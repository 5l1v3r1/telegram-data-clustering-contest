      <h1>For the first time, Apple is planning an awards event for apps</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:04:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p>Apple usually hands out awards to the best apps of the year in press releases, but this year, they’re doing things a little differently. On December the 2nd, an Apple Special Event will be held in New York City to “honour” their favourite apps and games of 2019.</p>
      <p>Unlike many of their Special Events, Apple isn’t expected to launch any new products, although it is possible that some announcements may be made. As it is, they’ve already made announcements on the new 16″ <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/macbook-pro">Macbook Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/airpods-pro">AirPods Pro</a> recently, so it seems that we should take Apple’s explanation for the event at face value here.</p>

      <p>This could also be part of a continued focus on the development of the app ecosystem by Apple, with the recently launched <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> receiving generally good reviews. It seems that the company is moving more towards an approach that would also centre around curating better content/apps for the Apple ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Regardless, it’s nice to see app makers receive more recognition for their fine work. Most, if not all of us rely on a multitude of apps on a daily basis, with professional circles increasingly dependent on app-based systems in today’s age as well.</p>
