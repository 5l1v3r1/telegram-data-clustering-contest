      <p>A Wishaw busker suffered a panic attack after being threatened by a beggar in the town centre.</p>
      <p>Brian Hamilton was forced to contact police following the worrying incidents on Friday, November 8.</p>
      <p>Brian, from Cambusnethan, said: “I came out to busk around 9.15am and no one was on the street so I pitched in front of Card Factory to protect myself incase the rain started.</p>
      <p>“I was there for maybe half an hour when I saw three of the beggars walking up past Bar 6.</p>
      <p>“One of them went up towards Poundland and another went down toward Lidl. The third beggar crossed the road and walked over to me and while I was in the middle of a song he switched my microphone off and tried to grab my guitar and told me: ‘This is my spot, move’. I ended up calling the police.</p>
      <p>“Around 11am I stopped for a quick break and I looked across the round to the PDSA charity shop and the beggar was standing there on the phone while pointing at me.</p>
      <p>“He then moved his finger across his neck and pointed at me again so I ended up calling the police again.</p>
      <p>“Around 1.30pm I packed up so I could go to Greggs and I was talking to one of the staff outside while she was on her break and I turned around to go back over to where I was and the beggar was where I was sitting and from across the road he was shouting at me to f*** off and calling me all sorts of things.</p>
      <p>“I ended up leaving my guitar and amp in Bar 6 and went to the council building where I was told to go to the police station and put another complaint in.”</p>
      <p>The ordeal brought back painful memories for Brian, who is a regular in Bar 6 on a Friday night, as he was the victim of a vile assault two years ago and has suffered from anxiety since.</p>
      <p>After posting his experience on social media, Brian has received messages from a number of people stating they have also had problems in the town centre.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve been busking for around two years and I’ve had people ask me for money, people try to rob me and I’ve had a knife pulled on me.</p>
      <p>“I got jumped a while ago and my anxiety has been through the roof since then. I had my first big panic attack in a good few months after the incident.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had a lot of messages from people wishing me well and telling me similar stories.</p>
      <p>“The police told me they are getting more and more complaints each day as the beggars are walking up to people, grabbing their arms and asking for money all the time.”</p>
      <p>Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident and revealed they had taken steps, along with the local authority, to help those on the streets.</p>
      <p>Inspector Martin Spiers, from Motherwell Police Office, said: “While begging itself is not a crime, the behaviour associated with it can sometimes constitute an offence, for example if there was an aggressive or anti-social aspect to it.</p>
      <p>“Local officers accompanied by officials from North Lanarkshire Council have attended at a number of incidents in local town centres where people have been begging.</p>
      <p>“They have ensured that the persons involved are not in a vulnerable predicament and have offered help and advice regarding support available.</p>
      <p>“However, if anyone encounters someone begging in an aggressive manner they should contact the police on 101.”</p>
