      <h1>5 Sweet &amp; Savoury Combos That Are Tasty Whether Your Snob Ass Likes It Or Not</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:18:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:18</time> by <a rel="author">By Louis Costello</a></address>
      <p>PEDESTRIAN.TV has teamed up with Red Rooster for their new Chicken Waffle Cones.</p>
      <p>Joke’s on all of you, I have suspiciously low standards when it comes to food, so these sweet and savoury combinations are selfishly designed for me, and me only.</p>
      <p>Don’t discount my suggestions entirely though, I feel there’s enough rationale behind each combo to at <i>least </i>warrant a taste-test – it just depends on whether you’re a big ol’ snob who can’t look past the unconventional pairings.</p>
      <p>Is that a dare? A threat? An insult? <i>You’ll</i> never tell. Idiots.</p>
      <h3>1. Hash Browns &amp; Nutella</h3>

      <p>I shit you not, sometimes it’s worth being hungover just so you can shamelessly spread some chocolate on a greasy potato rectangle (or “hash browns” for you purists out there).</p>
      <p>What’s not to love? Everything about this combo screams high blood pressure and a shorter life-span, which is exactly how I determine if anything’s gonna be tasty.</p>
      <h3>2. Minced Beef &amp; Whipped Cream</h3>

      <p>Admittedly, I did get this idea from an episode of <i>Friends</i>, where Rachel accidentally makes half a trifle and half a shepherd’s pie.</p>
      <p>But having officially trialled the formula, I can attest to the credibility of this glorious food combo.</p>
      <p>Woah, I’m just having one of those epiphanies where I’ve realised the single life <i>might not </i>be my choice.</p>
      <p>Interesting.</p>
      <h3>3. Chicken &amp; Waffles</h3>

      <p>Alright, let’s get back to basics for a hot sec.</p>
      <p>The chicken and waffle combo has been floating around for years now. It’s a classic.</p>

      <p>However, have you considered throwing some chicken bites in a waffle <i>cone</i>? Outrageous. It simply can’t be done.</p>
      <p>Or can it?</p>
      <p>Red Rooster has been hard at work making your wildest dreams come true, and the bloody buggers have done it. They’ve created a Chicken Waffle Cone.</p>
      <p>We tried it out on some hungry bruvs and bruvettes the other night, and it went down like this:</p>

      <p>If you wanna get your food chute around one, hit up your nearest Red Rooster before they’re a thing of the past.</p>
      <h3>4. Tuna &amp; Pineapple</h3>

      <p>This is actually not as disturbing as it seems – and I have an entire family to prove it.</p>
      <p>Mum has always made this tuna curry that tastes a tonne better than it sounds on paper. To prove it, I’ve attached a text exchange we had many moons ago:</p>

      <p>Go ahead and disagree with my sweet Ma. Go on, do it. See what happens.</p>
      <h3>5. Chocolate Deviled Eggs</h3>

      <p>I consider eggs to be what you would call a ‘neutral’ food – they can go in quite literally anything.</p>
      <p>But, as most people would consider them savoury, I’m happy to rock your world. Gotta rock something, right?</p>
      <p>Get this: chocolate mousse deviled eggs. You’ve got your choccy fix, you’ve got your protein hit, you’ve got everything a confused soul would ever want.</p>
      <p>And for the naysayers out there, no, the taste of egg does not detract from the sugary goodness. Get outta here.</p>
