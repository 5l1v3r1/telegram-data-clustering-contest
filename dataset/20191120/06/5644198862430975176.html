      <p>FRANKFURT AM MAIN: Serge Gnabry hit a hat-trick as Germany finished top of their Euro 2020 qualifying group after brushing Northern Ireland aside 6-1 on Tuesday (Nov 19).</p>
      <p>Having already booked their berth at the Euro 2020 finals on Saturday by beating Belarus, the emphatic win in Frankfurt means Germany finish their qualifying campaign top of Group C ahead of the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>The Dutch also qualified last weekend. Northern Ireland finish third and will go into the play-offs for the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Gnabry reached 13 goals in as many internationals as the Northern Irish were given a masterclass in finishing.</p>
      <p>Another Bayern Munich player Leon Goretzka also finished with two goals before Dortmund winger Julian Brandt grabbed Germany's sixth goal late on.</p>
      <p>This was Gnabry's second hat-trick for Germany. He also scored three goals on his 2016 debut in an 8-0 mauling of minnows San Marino.</p>
      <p>Gnabry also hit four goals in Bayern's 7-2 romp at Tottenham in the Champions League last month.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland took a shock lead when a poor clearance header by Toni Kroos fell to Michael Smith who drilled home his shot from outside the area after only seven minutes.</p>
      <p>The Germans quickly recovered and Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan hit the post just before Gnabry claimed his first goal.</p>
      <p>He took a touch on the edge of the area before spinning and firing past Irish goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell on 19 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Germans went into the break 2-1 up after Goretzka poked the ball over the line via the upright on 42 minutes.</p>
      <p>Germany maintained their impressive pace and Gnabry grabbed his second just 66 seconds after half-time.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal winger slipped his marker and fired home after a good cross from wing-back Lukas Klostermann.</p>
      <p>The Germans were cruising and Gnabry claimed his hat-trick on the hour by holding off Irish centre-back Tom Flanagan before coolly slotting the ball home from a tricky angle.</p>
      <p>Not to be out-done, Goretzka notched his second as yet another Germany move left the Irish defence clutching at straws.</p>
      <p>Northern Irish midfielder Paddy McNair intercepted a ball from Kroos, but knocked it only as far as Goretzka who picked his spot in the back of the net on 73 minutes.</p>
      <p>With time almost up, Brandt completed the rout by finishing off a Kroos pass with the Northern Irish defence again exposed to delight home fans.</p>
