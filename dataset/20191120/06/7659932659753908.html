      <p>A fractured spine, paralyzed leg, hole in the back: Hamza took to the streets of Iraq's capital to demand a better life but now he has even less than ever.<br/><br/>"This is my sacrifice for Iraq," said the 16-year-old, his strained voice barely audible over the phone in Baghdad.<br/><br/>"If I could walk, I would be back in the protests now,” he told Agence France Presse.<br/><br/>Hamza is one of at least 3,000 people who have been maimed in Baghdad and southern Iraq since anti-government protests erupted on October 1, according to the NGO Iraqi Alliance for Disabilities Organization (IADO). <br/><br/>The staggering number is the latest burden for a country already struggling with one of the highest disability rates in the world, according to the United Nations.<br/><br/>After decades of back-to-back conflicts, Iraq is in the thick of its largest and deadliest grassroots protest movement, with more than 300 people dead and 15,000 wounded.<br/><br/>To disperse protesters, security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets, flash bangs, live rounds and even machine-gun fire -- all of which can seriously maim or even kill, as Hamza learned. <br/><br/>On November 4, the teenager was among around 20 protesters wounded by live fire in Baghdad.<br/><br/>A bullet pierced Hamza's stomach and exited through his back, leaving a gaping hole. <br/><br/>Two others hit his legs.<br/><br/>By the time he arrived at a nearby hospital, he had lost liters of blood and his heart was failing, said his father, Abu Layth.  <br/><br/>Doctors revived the boy with a defibrillator, injected him with four units of blood and rushed him into surgery.<br/><br/>"He was basically dead. The doctors brought him back to life," he said.<br/><br/>CT scans and medical reports shared by Hamza's family revealed multiple fractures to his lower spine, leading to paralysis in his right leg.<br/><br/>After more than a week in hospital, the teenager has gone back home and is on steady doses of anesthetics.<br/><br/>"Sometimes he screams from pain at night," his father said.<br/><br/>The government's Central Statistical Organization says that in the wake of decades of conflict, more than two million of Iraq's 40-million population are disabled people entitled to state support.<br/><br/>But IADO and other rights groups say the real number sits at more than three million -- and counting.<br/><br/>"The number of disabled people continues to grow... We exit one crisis and enter another," said IADO head Muwafaq al-Khafaji.<br/><br/>He told AFP his group's estimate of 3,000 maimed since October 1 is an approximation, as the government is either not documenting or not releasing precise figures. <br/><br/>To fill the gap, IADO members have been contacting hospitals and reaching out to families in Baghdad and southern cities.<br/><br/>Although Iraq is party to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, disabled people suffer from poor health services, lack of job opportunities and social exclusion.<br/><br/>They have organized their own rallies in Baghdad as part of the larger protest movement, demanding more support from the government.</p>
