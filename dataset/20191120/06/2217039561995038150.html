        <b>Under the guise of offering her a job, Iqmal Haziq Othman asked to pay to see the 15-year-old girl in the nude and to have sex with him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They did not have sex but Iqmal, 20, later committed indecent acts with her at his home.</p>
      <p>A month later, he again contacted the girl for sex, this time posing as someone else, but she refused his requests and reported him to the police.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Iqmal pleaded guilty to three offences under the Children and Young Persons Act (CYPA).</p>
      <p>A fourth CYPA offence and one other charge under the Protection from Harassment Act were taken into consideration.</p>
      <p>District Judge Seah Chi-Ling called for both probation and reformative training suitability reports in light of Iqmal's youth and this being his first offence.</p>
      <p>The girl, who cannot be named due to a gag order protecting her identity, made a post on online marketplace Carousell looking for a part-time job in November last year.</p>
      <p>Iqmal contacted the girl to procure sex from her, initially saying he had an administrative job for her.</p>
      <p>He then told her he would pay her $100 if she showed him her naked body and $800 to have sex with him.</p>
      <p>The girl only agreed to the first offer and did not agree to having sex.</p>
      <p>Iqmal was aware she was 15, Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew told the court.</p>
      <p>On the afternoon of Nov 16, 2018, the girl went to Iqmal's home after he helped to book a private-hire ride for her.</p>
      <h3>UNDRESS</h3>
      <p>He took her into his bedroom and instructed her to sit on the bed and to undress herself.</p>
      <p>She complied and Iqmal undressed as well.</p>
      <p>He then touched the girl and told her to perform an indecent act, offering to pay her an extra $100 to do so.</p>
      <p>He also offered her an extra $50 for him to touch her private parts.</p>
      <p>She agreed and went home after he had paid her.</p>
      <p>She did not know Iqmal had secretly filmed these acts with his mobile phone.</p>
      <p>On Dec 12, 2018, Iqmal contacted the girl again, this time on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Pretending to be someone else, he told her he had seen a sexual video of her online on the pretext of trying to help her.</p>
      <p>He claimed he bought the video for $100 and the person who had the video wanted to have sex with her before he would delete it.</p>
      <p>When the girl refused, Iqmal asked for oral sex and then asked her to show her naked body to him over live video chat. She declined and lodged a police report on her family's advice.</p>
      <p>In mitigation, Iqmal's lawyer John Koh said his client understands the gravity of the offences and urged the court to give him a chance to rehabilitate himself.</p>
      <p>Now in remand, Iqmal will return to court next Tuesday.</p>
