        <b>SHANGHAI : Chinese private companies are shunning the US in their overseas expansion, and generally prefer a home listing to a US initial public offering (IPO), a private survey showed yesterday, highlighting the trade war's impact on executive decision-making.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The survey is released at a time when US politicians are calling for tighter scrutiny over Chinese investment and capital-raising, while Beijing is encouraging domestic listings by Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>Chinese chief executives remain committed to global expansion, but have shifted their focus from the US to South-east Asia, Europe and Africa, showed a survey conducted jointly by China's Tsinghua University and Marcum Bernstein and Pinchuk (MarcumBP), a leading auditor for US-listed Chinese companies.</p>
      <p>The survey found that 66 per cent of the respondents see China as the most attractive listing venue, compared with just 18.7 per cent who favour the US market.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong, even with the city's violent protests, is also ahead of the US as a preferred IPO destination.</p>
      <p>Mr Drew Bernstein, co-managing partner of MarcumBP, predicted that US investors' interest in fast-growing Chinese tech unicorns won't diminish, and many Chinese companies still need access to the deep and liquid US capital markets for funding. - REUTERS</p>
