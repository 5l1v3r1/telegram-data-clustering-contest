      <p>A motorist was caught behind the wheel of a car just two months after he was disqualified from driving.</p>
      <p>Graham Eden was banned from the roads on September 10 for an offence of drink driving and was ordered not to drive for 14 months.</p>
      <p>However the 29-year-old was stopped in a Vauxhall Corsa on Northumbrian Way, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cramlington">Cramlington</a>, on November 7.</p>
      <p>At South East Northumberland Magistrates' Court, Eden, of Southway, South <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/denton">Denton</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a>, pleaded guilty to two charges - driving whilst disqualified and without insurance.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Laura Lax said: "Officers saw a Vauxhall Corsa being driven on Northumbrian Way. They spoke to the driver.</p>
      <p>"At the time, he was arrested on suspicion of an unrelated offence and taken to custody.</p>
      <p>"The following day, checks showed he was a disqualified driver and had no insurance for that vehicle."</p>
      <p>When he was interviewed by a probation officer, Eden said "his head was all over the place" at the time of the offence.</p>
      <p>The defendant "fully understood he did wrong" and showed remorse for his actions, the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">court </a>heard.</p>
      <p>It was also said he had been feeling stressed over personal problems and had struggled with mental health difficulties. </p>
      <p>Magistrates banned him from driving for 16 months and handed him a 12-month community order with rehabilitation activities.</p>
      <p>Eden was also ordered to pay a £120 fine and £175 in court costs.</p>
