        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 20 – Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) has lifted the suspension of Silverstone Air’s Dash 8 aircraft fleet citing the budget airlines compliance to safety regulations following an audit conducted after two midair mishaps within a span of three weeks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>KCAA had ordered the grounding of Silverstone’s Dash-8 aircraft on November 12.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday, KCAA Director General Gilbert Kibe said the airline had aligned itself with standards set by the authority and is now safe to continue with its services within the country’s airspace.</p>
      <p>“KCAA confirms that the Airline has provided satisfactory corrective measures as per the requirements of the Civil Aviation Regulations 2018, following comprehensive compliance audits on the operations and procedures of Silverstone Air Services conducted between 24th October and 15th November 2019,” said Kibe.</p>
      <p>He however said the authority will scale up surveillance for the Dash 8 aircraft in the Kenyan airspace to monitor compliance to safety regulations.</p>
      <p>“KCAA will continue to undertake its continuous surveillance on the operator as they resume normal operations for the Dash 8 series Aircraft effective 19th November 2019. All other aircraft in the fleet of Silverstone Air Services remain operational,” the DG noted.</p>
      <p>The airspace regulator assured the public it had put measure in space to safeguard the integrity of commercial aviation.</p>
      <p>“The Authority in its capacity undertakes operational surveillance on the Kenyan aviation industry and reassures the public that safety and security within the Kenyan airspace is of paramount priority,” Kibe said.</p>

      <p>KCAA had early this month launched investigations into Silverstone after it had two emergency landings by one of its aircraft.</p>
      <p>On October 28, one of the rear wheels of a Silverstone aircraft fell off as it took from Lodwar Airstrip in Turkana County.</p>
      <p>The slight accident forced the aircraft which was en route from Lodwar to Nairobi to make an emergency landing at Eldoret International Airport.</p>
      <p>It had four passengers and five crew members.</p>
      <p>Another incident occurred on October 11 where a Silverstone Airplane crushed just as it lifted off from Wilson Airport in Nairobi.</p>
      <p>This flight had 5 crew members and 50 passengers on board. Two of the passengers sustained injuries.</p>
