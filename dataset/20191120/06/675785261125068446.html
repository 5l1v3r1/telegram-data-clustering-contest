      <h1>Tottenham appoint Jose Mourinho as new manager on three-and-a-half year deal</h1>
      <h2>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:35:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is the new Tottenham Hotspur manager.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss has taken over in North London on a three-and-a-half year deal after Mauricio Pochettino was sensationally sacked on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been out of work since leaving United in December, and his representatives held positive talks with Spurs on Tuesday following the sacking of the Argentinean.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> are currently 14th in the Premier League, and take on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked after a disjointed start to the season that has seen seen Spurs stutter since reaching June's Champions League final, which they lost to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>

      <p>A Spurs statement read: "We are delighted to announce the appointment of Jose Mourinho as Head Coach on a contract that runs until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>

      <p>"He has won a domestic title in a record four different countries (Portugal, England, Italy and Spain) and is one of only three managers to have won the UEFA Champions League twice with two clubs, FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010.</p>
      <p>"He is also a three-time Premier League Champion with Chelsea (2005, 2006, 2015)."</p>

      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy added: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician.</p>
      <p>!He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: “I am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>Spurs sacked Pochettino on Tuesday, with Levy saying: “Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history.</p>

      <p>"I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>"I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
