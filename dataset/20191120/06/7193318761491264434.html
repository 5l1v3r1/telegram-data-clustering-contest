        <b>Antonio Brown apologizes to Patriots</b>
      </p>
      <p>Antonio Brown has apologized to the Patriots and team owner Robert Kraft for any negative attention he brought to the team during his brief stint in New England. The four-time All-Pro receiver posted his apology on Instagram Tuesday, writing: "All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama!"</p>
      <p>The apology comes on the heels of past posts in which he indicated he'd fight the Patriots' decision to withhold a $9 million signing bonus. He also reportedly met with NFL officials last week to discuss various sexual assault allegations against him that could make him subject to a possible suspension under the league's personal conduct policy if he's signed by another team.</p>
      <p>The Patriots cut ties with Brown in September following just one game after a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct.</p>

        <b>Tomlin calls brawl 'ugly for the game of football'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin accepted his team's role in the now-infamous fight last Thursday night that ended with Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett hitting Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head with Rudolph's own helmet.</p>
      <p>Just don't expect Tomlin to use the video of a brawl he called "ugly for the game of football" as a teachable moment. He doesn't think one is required.</p>
      <p>"I don't know that we did anything to make it happen in the first place," Tomlin said Tuesday. "That's why I said we didn't have anything to learn from it."</p>
      <p>Garrett and Rudolph became tangled up after Garrett took Rudolph to the ground shortly after the quarterback let go of a pass in the final seconds of Cleveland's 21-7 win.</p>
      <p>In the chaos that ensued, Rudolph grabbed the back of Garrett's helmet and pulled. Garrett responded by snatching Rudolph's facemask and ripping Rudolph's helmet off. Steelers guard David DeCastro attempted to intervene, pushing Garrett away. Rudolph gave chase and Garrett swung Rudolph's helmet, connecting with Rudolph's head in the process.</p>

        <b>Dolphins cut running back following arrest</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Miami Dolphins released suspended running back Mark Walton on Tuesday, hours after he was arrested on charges of punching his pregnant girlfriend in the head.</p>
      <p>Police in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Davie said in a report that officers went to a home at 4:15 a.m. Tuesday, where Walton’s girlfriend told them he had pushed her against the wall and punched her several times in the face and head, leaving her with a swollen left eye. The woman told officers she is five weeks pregnant with the couple’s child and had told Walton about the pregnancy on Sunday. Walton, 22, was charged with aggravated battery on a pregnant person, a felony with a 15-year maximum sentence. It was his fourth arrest in less than a year.</p>

      <p>Kickers across the NFL are struggling to put the ball between the uprights this season. The 79.7 percent conversion rate through Week 11 is the league’s lowest number since 2003 when kickers hit 79.2 percent, missing 198 field goals, according to SportRadar.</p>
