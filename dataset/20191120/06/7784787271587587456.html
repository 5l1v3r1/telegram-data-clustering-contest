      <h1>One of biggest AFL names off-contract at the end of 2020 just signed a new deal with Geelong</h1>

      <h3>Geelong has locked away arguably its biggest name that was out of contract at the end of 2020, with star midfielder Mitch Duncan signing a long-term extension.</h3>
      <p>The Cats confirmed on Wednesday that Duncan had added another four years to his contract, which expires at the end of next year.</p>
      <p>It means Duncan is now contracted to the Cats for another five years, tying him to the club until the end of 2024 and, essentially, making the 28-year-old a Cat for life.</p>

      <p>Duncan was the second Cat to sign a new deal on Wednesday, with forward Gary Rohan signing until the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>“The club is delighted to see Mitch commit to the club,” Geelong football boss Simon Lloyd said.</p>

      <p>“Mitch has been a mainstay of our team over 10 seasons, a dependable, intelligent teammate and a quality player.</p>
      <p>“Our members and supporters have watched Mitch’s career unfold and we all look forward to it continuing over the next five seasons.”</p>
      <p>Amid a star-studded on-ball brigade, Duncan has often played second fiddle at the Cats behind the likes of Patrick Dangerfield, Gary Ablett, Joel Selwood and, most recently, Tim Kelly.</p>
      <p>But Duncan has still established himself as a star of the AFL, becoming renowned for his excellent kicking efficiency and workrate that allows to win ample uncontested possessions.</p>
      <p>Duncan joins a long list of Cats who are contracted beyond 2020.</p>

      <p>It means Geelong will now turn its attention to the likes of Jack Henry, Quinton Narkle and Brandan Parfitt, whose respective deals expire next year.</p>
      <p>Veteran Tom Hawkins, also contracted until 2020, is expected to re-sign, but interesting decisions loom around Sam Menegola, Nakia Cockatoo, Rhys Stanley and Zach Tuohy, whose deals all expire at the end of next season.</p>
      <p>After being drafted with Pick 28 in the 2009 national draft, Duncan has been one of Geelong’s most durable players, registering 203 games, including the successful 2011 Grand Final.</p>
