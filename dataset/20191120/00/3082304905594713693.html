        <b>Tottenham will appoint a big-name manager to replace Mauricio Pochettino, says Toby Alderweireld, amid links to Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Toby Alderweireld is sure Tottenham will appoint a “big” manager after the Premier League club elected to relieve Mauricio Pochettino of his post.</p>
      <p>Just six months after reaching the Champions League final, Spurs sit 14th in the Premier League following a dismal start to the campaign, winning just three games.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are just a win away from the top six, but are 11 points adrift of the Champions League places with 12 matches played.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has emerged as a front-runner to take over and Spurs defender Alderweireld – whose relationship with Pochettino was reportedly strained – is confident Tottenham will have a new manager in place quickly, and one with the credentials to take charge of a club aiming to compete on both the domestic and European fronts.</p>
      <p>“Spurs are a big club, there will be a big manager for us. Hopefully we know quickly,” Alderweireld told Sky Sports on Tuesday, after playing in Belgium’s 6-1 Euro 2020 qualifying win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p>“It is a difficult situation, I don’t know really the right thing to say. It needs a couple of days to sink in.</p>
      <p>“I’m 30, and it’ll be the first time in my career there’s been a change of manager [at my team] so it’ll be strange for me. I can’t say how it feels. We have to work hard and I think there will be a new manager quickly.</p>
      <p>“We have to stay together, change things as quickly as possible together. The strength of our team is the work rate – that won’t be changing.”</p>

      <p>While Alderweireld has been linked with a move away from Spurs in recent seasons, he is proud of what the team achieved under Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“I am surprised,” Alderweireld said.</p>
      <p>“We came a long way together, with a lot of players, achieved big things, you can see from where we’ve come from before my time at Spurs, we achieved a lot of things together and I think he took the club to the next level.”</p>
