      <h1>Canyon Springs appeals forfeits; case to be heard Thursday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:50:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/jason-orts/" target="_blank">Jason Orts</a></address>
      <p>An appeal will be heard Thursday to determine whether Canyon Springs will be reinstated into the Class 4A football playoffs.</p>
      <p>The Pioneers defeated Arbor View 24-20 Friday in the Mountain Region quarterfinals, but were disqualified Monday and forced to forfeit their wins this season after using a player who had been ruled ineligible.</p>
      <p>According to the NIAA handbook, this will be a Level 2 hearing with the decision being made by a hearing officer who is “appointed by the (NIAA’s) executive director and approved by the board.”</p>
