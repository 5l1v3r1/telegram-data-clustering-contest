      <p>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Jare Patterson ran for a career-high 192 yards and four touchdowns and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s defense won the day as the Bulls became bowl eligible with a 49-30 win over Toledo on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The two teams came in at the top of Mid-American Conference in rushing, led by the Rockets’ 245.7 yards with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> at 226.5.</p>
      <p>With Kevin Marks contributing 118 yards and a touchdown, the Bulls ran up 331 of their 503 yards on the ground. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a>’s run defense, seventh in the country at 88.4 yards, limited Toledo to 154.</p>
      <p>Marks got the Bulls (6-5, 4-3) on the board by capping an 80-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run. Two snaps later Matt Otwinowski intercepted an Eli Peters pass and on the next play Kyle Vantrease and Patterson combined on a 24-yard pass play for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Toledo (6-5, 3-4 MAC) tied the game but Patterson’s first two rushing touchdowns helped <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/buffalo/">Buffalo</a> take a 28-17 lead at the half.</p>

      <p>After a field goal for the Rockets early in the third quarter, Patterson capped two long drives and Vantrease another with short touchdown runs. Patterson, who never ran for more than two touchdowns in a game before, moved into fifth on the school rushing list.</p>
