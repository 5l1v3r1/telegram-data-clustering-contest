      <p><b>(SNO) –</b> Awardees from Saint Lucia who received the Order of Chivalry of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire has received high praises from the Prime Minister Allen Chastanet.</p>
      <p>Recently the Governor General of Saint Lucia, His Excellency Sir Emmanuel Neville Cenac, hosted the Investiture of eight, of the 11, recipients who received the prestigious award.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing as rewarding as service to humanity and service to country and this is what these awards are designed to honour; to give back in some measure to those who have served and distinguished themselves through such service,” Chastanet said.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that over the years Saint Lucia has produced large numbers of men and women who took on the mantle of serving and providing service in every single field of endeavor, in both the public and private sectors.</p>
      <p>“It is mainly on the shoulders of these people that the development and progress of Saint Lucia has always and continues to depend today. As a country we must not allow our heroes to go unrecognized,” he stated. “We must continually thank them for their services and in some cases their sacrifices. In their pursuit of noble professions or in service to the community they have given us a piece of themselves.”</p>
      <p>He said Saint Lucia “owes a debt of gratitude to those awarded today and even more Saint Lucians who are committed to their profession and country.”</p>
      <p>“It is my sincere hope that the example set by these honorees will motivate and inspire others to step up and serve their communities and country as well,” Chastanet said.</p>
      <p>Of the 11 recipients, eight received their awards in Saint Lucia.</p>
