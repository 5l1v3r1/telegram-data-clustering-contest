      <p>ASHBURN — There are throws Dwayne Haskins would have liked back against the New York Jets. Specifically, the Redskins quarterback said Wednesday he found himself pressing at times when he watched the film of the team’s 34-17 loss.</p>
      <p>In the second start of his career, Haskins went 19 of 35 for 214 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. But he didn’t find a rhythm largely until the fourth quarter, when he found Derrius Guice and Jeremy Sprinkle for scores.</p>
      <p>“As a young quarterback, you have to let the game come to you,” Haskins said at his weekly press conference. “You can’t try to be explosive and make the plays that you see on Sunday every day, that you get get the opportunity to get out there.</p>
      <p>“Those plays will come as the game continues to flow, and as I continue to play in those situations and know the scenarios in the game for me to be better when to and when not to take shots.”</p>
      <p>Haskins said he took some of the shots he did because of the scenario the Redskins found themselves in. Washington trailed for the entire game, including by 31 points in the fourth. The Redskins were disappointed by their performance, with interim coach Bill Callahan saying he felt “bad” for the fans.</p>

      <p>Haskins, though, said the important thing is to try to avoid the same mistake twice.</p>

        <p>“There isn’t a thing on the film that I think is uncorrectable,” Haskins said.</p>
