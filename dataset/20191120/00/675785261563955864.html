      <p>A cruel man has been jailed after he was caught on camera repeatedly punching his own dog.</p>
      <p>Evil Robert Black was seen on CCTV striking his mixed-breed pet five times as it tussled with another of his dogs in a park, before putting it on a lead and walking away.</p>
      <p>Black, 51, was jailed for 23 weeks at Reading Magistrates' Court yesterday, after he was convicted of one count of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.</p>
      <p>Investigating officer, PC David Burleigh, based at Abingdon police station, said: "Black demonstrated significant cruelty to his dog by punching it several times in the face, with no concern for its welfare.</p>

      <p>"This behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable for a pet owner and I am pleased that not only has he received a prison sentence for his actions, but that he has been banned from owning animals for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>"We take reports such as these seriously and will look to investigate and take action against anyone who carries out this type of offence."</p>
      <p>Black, from Newbury, Berkshire, was seen attacking his dog by a member of the public, who reported the beating to police officers.</p>

      <p>The shocking attack happened when Black was walking his dogs in Victoria Park on December 21 last year.</p>
      <p>He was arrested soon afterwards and has now been banned from owning animals for ten years.</p>
      <p>Both dogs have since been rehomed.</p>
      <p>It comes after Brendan Murphy was handed a suspended prison sentence for stabbing and drowning his dog.</p>

      <p>The 52-year-old claimed his Japanese Akita dog Tara died of natural causes and he buried the body in woodland.</p>
      <p>But Tara’s body was found floating in a canal and chained to a breeze block, prompting the RSPCA to launch an investigation into the death of the dog.</p>
      <p>Chester Magistrate's Court handed Murphy a ten-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, banned him from keeping animals for ten years and ordered him to pay £300 costs and a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
