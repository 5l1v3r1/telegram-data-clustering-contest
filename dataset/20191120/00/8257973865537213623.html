      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <i>Frozen</i> stars <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Idina_Menzel/?tps=1">Idina Menzel</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kristen_Bell/?tps=1">Kristen Bell</a> received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame simultaneously on Tuesday. The sequel <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2019/09/30/Frozen-II-asks-how-Elsa-got-her-powers/4191569613049/"><i>Frozen II </i></a>opens Friday.</p>
      <p>Each recipient of the star had two speakers introduce them at the unveiling at the corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Argyle Ave, near the Pantages Theater where Menzel has performed on stage. Actor Jackie Tohn and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/Blog/2019/09/25/Ted-Danson-Cast-knew-it-was-right-to-end-Good-Place/4341569260218/"><i>The Good Place</i></a> creator Michael Schur introduced Bell. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Disney/?tps=1">Disney</a> co-chairman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Alan_Horn/?tps=1">Alan Horn</a> and <i>Frozen</i> co-star Josh Gad introduced Menzel.</p>
      <p>Bell recalled meaningful moments of her life like singing an aria to her father as a child, learning the first twist in <i>The Good Place</i> season 1, being cast by her husband, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dax_Shepard/?tps=1">Dax Shepard</a>, in a movie based on their love story and her mother dropping her off at auditions.</p>
      <p>"This star will really only know its true value when inevitably someone is mugged in that very spot," Bell concluded. "As they clutch their purse the assailant screams, 'Let it go!' and the victim will look up and say, 'That's not even her song ...' Only then will I know I've truly made it."</p>
      <p>"Let It Go" is Elsa's signature song in <i>Frozen</i>. Bell plays Anna, Elsa's sister.</p>
      <p>Menzel lamented that her father was injured and could not make it to Hollywood from Florida, and her sister also could not be present. She thanked her mother in the audience for not allowing her to have a fallback career, and credited her 10-year-old son, Walker, for inspiring her and husband Aaron Lohr in the audience for giving her a sense of peace.</p>
      <p>"In the words of Jonathan Larson who is the composer of <i>Rent</i> and the very first job that I ever had in my life, I'm humbled and honored to be here," Menzel said. "I'm going to try to take in the moment as he would say, 'Savor this moment because there's no day but today.'"</p>
