      <h1>Lagos Assembly Challenges Court’s Jurisdiction Stopping Ambode’s Probe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>The Lagos state house of assembly has reinstated its commitment to investigate the 820 buses procured during the administration of former Governor <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/30/just-in-court-orders-lagos-state-assembly-to-stop-ambodes-probe/"><u>Akinwunmi Ambode</u></a>.</b></p>
      <p>It will be recalled that the former governor approached a Lagos High Court earlier last month seeking to stop the probe of his administration over procurement of 820 buses for public transportation.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> understands that the<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/30/820-buses-ambode-drags-lagos-speaker-assembly-members-others-to-court/"><u><b> Lagos State House of Assembly</b></u></a> filed a preliminary objection challenging the suit amongst other things challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the suit.</p>
      <p>At today’s proceeding, lead counsel for the state assembly, Lawal Pedro, SAN, informed the court that Ambode’s lawyer, Taiwo Oyetibo, has served his team with a copy of his client counter affidavit to the preliminary objection.</p>
      <p>He, however, asked for time to react to the process served on him in court by the claimant’s legal team.</p>
      <p>In response, the claimant’s counsel, Tayo Oyetibo (SAN) confirmed the receipt of the preliminary objection but informed the court that the defendants were yet to file a defence to the suit.</p>
      <p>At the instance of both counsel especially the need to put in all necessary processes, the matter was adjourned to January 16, 2020 for hearing.</p>
