      <p>Major demonstrations last year left some 300 people dead. Protests - including two hunger strikes by mothers of detained activists - have started up again in recent days, leading to clashes with Ortega supporters and arrests.</p>
      <p>The report by a commission of the Washington-based OAS followed United Nations criticism earlier in the day of the arrest of 16 anti-government protesters on charges it said seemed “trumped-up.”</p>
      <p>The OAS recommended a special session of its general assembly be convened immediately to review affairs in the country.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that Nicaragua is experiencing a critical human rights situation that urgently demands the attention of the Inter-American community and the world at large,” the OAS said.</p>
      <p>The Nicaraguan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has previously dismissed the creation of the OAS commission, viewing it as an attempt to interfere in its affairs.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Nicaraguan authorities said the 16 detainees were suspected of planning terrorist attacks in the Central American country.</p>
      <p>Those detained include prominent student protesters such as Nicaraguan and Belgian national Amaya Coppens, who has been arrested previously.</p>
      <p>Rupert Colville, a spokesman in Geneva for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters the arrests looked like an attempt to silence criticism of the government.</p>
      <p>“We are very concerned that these apparently trumped-up charges may constitute a renewed attempt to stifle dissent,” said Colville.</p>
      <p>He also urged the government to respect the rights of a separate group of hunger strikers in Managua’s cathedral.</p>
      <p>The Roman Catholic Church on Monday accused groups linked to the government of beating a priest and violently taking control of the cathedral.</p>
      <p>“We condemn these acts of desecration, harassment and intimidation, which are not contributing to the peace and stability of the country,” the Church said in a statement.</p>
      <p>On Monday, seven mothers of people detained earlier by authorities had said they would begin a hunger strike in the cathedral to demand the release of their children before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Colville said everyone who may have been “arbitrarily detained” in the country should be released.</p>
      <p>“The government must end the persistent repression of dissent and the ongoing pattern of arbitrary arrests,” he said.</p>
