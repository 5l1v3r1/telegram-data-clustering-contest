      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/andrew-blake/" target="_blank">Andrew Blake</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-trump/">Eric Trump</a>, President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-trump/">Trump</a>’s middle son, promoted wine sold by his family’s business Wednesday in the heat of public impeachment proceedings playing out against his father.</p>
      <p>The younger <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-trump/">Trump</a>, who is the executive vice president of his family’s <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/trump-organization/">Trump Organization</a> business operation, advertised the company’s wine on Twitter amid his father’s ambassador to the European Union, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Gordon Sondland</a>, testifying on Capitol Hill during a lengthy public hearing held as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Tweeting from his verified @EricTrump account, the president’s son shared a photograph of a hand holding a bottle of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/eric-trump/">Trump</a>-branded red wine.</p>
      <p>“It is a perfect day for a nice bottle of this. These people are — insane…. @TrumpWinery,” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>The president’s son did not explicitly mentioning the impeachment proceedings in his tweet, though his remark came more than five hours into <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Mr. Sondland</a> appearing before members of the House of Representatives during a lengthy public impeachment hearing held on the heels of two back-to-back sessions yesterday with several other witnesses.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Mr. Sondland</a>, the ambassador to the E.U., testified during the hearing about his knowledge of the Trump administration’s handling of Ukraine and whether he believed the president sought a “quid pro quo” with his Ukrainian counterpart – an allegation at the heart of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>The president’s son did not otherwise weigh in on Wednesday’s hearing from Twitter except to share another user’s tweet that included a video of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gordon-sondland/">Mr. Sondland</a> testifying that the president told him “no quid pro quo.”</p>
