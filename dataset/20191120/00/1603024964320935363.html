      <p>Japan's exports tumbled at their quickest pace in three years in October, threatening to tip the trade-reliant economy into recession as weakening demand from United States and China darkened the outlook.</p>
      <p>Official data out on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 9.2% year-on-year in October, a bigger decline than the 7.6% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.</p>
      <p>The feeble results, driven by plummeting shipments of cars and aircraft engines to the United States and plastic materials to China, marked the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch from October 2015 to November 2016.</p>
      <p>"The main impression from the figures is that exports to the United States are getting weaker," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.</p>
      <p>The data comes after a preliminary reading of gross domestic product last week showed Japan's economy post the worst growth in a year in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers have called on the government to boost spending by as much as 10 trillion yen ($92.08 billion) for the current fiscal year to support the economy, which many fear is facing additional pressure from a sales tax hike that took effect in October.</p>
      <p>The government has said it plans to compile a stimulus package as soon as possible as a pre-emptive measure against heightening overseas risks.</p>
      <p>Some analysts have warned that the sales tax hike could damage the world's third-largest economy, as the last such increase did in 2014, especially if domestic consumption cools sharply.</p>
      <p>While fiscal stimulus could help offset risks, such measures are unlikely to support the economy until next year, said Minami.</p>
      <p>"There's a lag before fiscal stimulus measures come into effect and it's unclear how much effect they will have."</p>
      <p>The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy steady last month but gave its strongest signal that it may cut interest rates in the near future.</p>
      <p>The export slowdown was partly due to strengthening of the yen in October and a typhoon hitting Japan, said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.</p>
      <p>"There was a large fall, but it isn't so bad when taking the impact of the typhoon into account," Saito said.</p>
      <p>Exports in volume terms, which excludes the exchange rate impact, slumped 4.4% in the year to October, the third consecutive month of declines and the largest fall since a 6.0% drop in August, the finance ministry said.</p>
      <p>By destination, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, slipped 10.3% year-on-year in October, down for the eighth month as shipments of plastics and car parts declined.</p>
      <p>Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, tumbled 11.2% in the year to October, down for the 12th month.</p>
      <p>Japan's exports to the United States dropped 11.4% in the year to October, hurt by reduced shipments of 2,000 to 3,000 cc cars, aircraft engines and car parts.</p>
      <p>Japan's lower house of parliament approved on Tuesday a limited trade deal Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed with the United States, clearing the way for tariff cuts next year on items including U.S. farm goods and Japanese machine tools.</p>
      <p>The nation's overall imports sank 14.8% year-on-year, a smaller decline than the median estimate for a 16.0% decrease.</p>
      <p>That pushed the trade balance to a surplus of 17.3 billion yen, from a deficit of 124.8 billion yen and against a 301.0 billion yen surplus expected by economists.</p>
