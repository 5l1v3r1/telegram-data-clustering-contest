      <p>The social media bill on Wednesday passed the second reading in the Senate. The bill is expected to restrict cyberspace falsehood against Nigerians if passed into law.</p>
      <p>The Senator representing Niger East Senatorial District, Musa Mohammed Sani, had proposed the bill in the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Senator Chimaroke Nnamani while speaking on the bill stated that cyberspace laws were enough to take care of the bill, saying that other advanced countries never established such laws.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Yes, fake news has done a lot in America, but they have not legislated on restricting their citizens when it comes to social media contents.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Senator representing Kebbi North Senatorial district, Bala Ibn N’allah, coming on Order 39(1)(3) said the social media law would support the right to Freedom of expression which was stated in the Constitution.</p>
      <p>He noted that he has been vindicated after someone else brought the bill he was persecuted for when sponsored in the 8th Assembly.</p>
      <p>“<i>I am not so happy standing here, but have been vindicated when I sponsored the bill in the 8th Assembly and I was persecuted.”</i></p>
      <p>The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, while speaking on the bill referred the bill to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters.</p>
      <p>The committee is expected to present its report on the bill in four weeks.</p>
