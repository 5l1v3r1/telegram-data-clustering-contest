      <p>There has been a much warranted and heightened awareness about the inherent dangers and severe health complications among men and women with <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/eating-disorders">eating disorders</a>. This is triggered by the staggering growth of the issue in the US. It’s estimated that thirty million American people suffer from an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/eating-disorders">eating disorder</a> such as; <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/anorexia-nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/bulimia-nervosa">bulimia nervosa</a> or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/binge-eating-disorder-compulsive-overeating">binge eating</a>. Worldwide the figure is more than double, approximately 70 million.</p>
      <p>The demographic most affected by the increase in eating disorders are young women, 15 – 24 years old, especially anorexia. An ongoing study in Minnesota found the incidence of anorexia has increased over the last 50 years only in females aged 15 to 24. Young women with anorexia are twelve times more likely to die than women of the same age without anorexia. Ninety one percent of women surveyed on a college campus have tried to control their weight by <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/diet">dieting</a>. A quarter of them reported dieting all the time. Without treatment, 20% of people suffering from anorexia will die prematurely from eating disorder related health complications.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The complicated position of being a roommate to someone with a health-related eating habit</b>
      </p>
      <p>This alarming trend has also caused an increase of concern amongst women who are friends/roommates and live in college dormitory settings with women who may be suffering from an eating disorder. These women are caught in complicated positions with questions about how they can help and be supportive. Understandably, they’re becoming anxious, scared and confused about their own eating habits.</p>
      <p>As a result, my own practice has been affected by an onslaught of calls that I receive regularly from girls living with friends whose health they <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> for because of restricted eating habits. Typically, I receive a call when a roommate is either</p>
      <p>a) barely eating</p>
      <p>b) eating small amounts in combination with exercising more than she’s eating (this is called exercise bulimia)</p>
      <p>c) barely eating and purging</p>
      <p>d) super skinny, barely eating and often ill.</p>
      <p>In some cases, my clients are being misinformed by their roommates who are trying to hide the severity of their eating disorder. In some instances, they have conveyed concerns that their roommate’s parents are also being misinformed or may be completely in the dark. Their question to me is always, “What should I do?”</p>
      <p>What they really asking is, “What can they to help their roommate? And, “What can they do for themselves? The answers are complicated.</p>
      <p>Young girls witnessing someone with an eating disorder can become susceptible to developing an eating disorder themselves. As indicated in the earlier statistics, an enormous number of girls in college diet. Some in excess or when they’re around other girls modeling restricted eating habits. It can make their already challenged (albeit not as complicated) feelings about food even more challenging. I have one client who went from having no issue at all with food, to counting calories after living with a roommate with anorexia.</p>
      <p>Roommates also may experience feelings of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anxiety">anxiety</a> and fear that something terrible health-wise is going to happen under their “watch.” They may have learned in health class or read in a magazine about the severe health-related consequences that are caused by eating disorders. One of my clients has been supporting a friend in an “end stage” treatment center. These young women know a lot about the complications of disordered eating. They are vulnerable to becoming preoccupied with concerns for their friends, which can adversely cause loss of sleep, mood changes, impaired concurrent focus, their schoolwork and other areas of their lives.</p>
      <p>Typically, young women with eating disorders want to keep their disorder secret, and they will deny it if confronted. On the flip side, if too much <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> is paid to it in the form of concern, that can backfire as well. The problem with eating disorders is that the brain is not operating rationally. So, rational conversations about healthy eating from well-meaning friends rarely have the impact one would hope for and desire.</p>

        <b>Tips on how to be a supportive roommate without losing sight of your own life</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is no proven formula that you can follow, but I’ve recommended a few approaches to my clients that may work for you.</p>
      <p>The first step is to try to unburden the roommate from feeling responsible, while simultaneously trying to get help for the person with the eating disorder. I recommend the roommate should attempt to contact the parents (singularly or in a group) to express her concerns. She can request anonymity in the hopes that the parents will protect their <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/friends">friendship</a>. This may not be possible to do, but the priority needs to be on the health needs of the friend, which is more important than how it may impact the friendship.</p>
      <p>If there is a group intervention, all the friends would have to suppress each other after they delegate the responsibility of care to the parents. It’s important for them to unburden</p>
      <p>themselves so they can begin to re-focus on their own lives and studies. They should work together to reinforce healthy eating habits with each other. It will be difficult, but they need to try stop worrying about their friend’s health and safety and avoid getting caught up with any similar eating behaviors themselves.</p>
      <p>It’s important to remember that as alone as you may feel, you’re not. There are adults around and no one person is ever your personal responsibility, no matter how scary the situation may seem. There are also <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a> centers for every compass who employ qualified counselors who can help people with eating disorders and their friends and roommates who care about them.</p>
