      <h1>NASA Will Test Beautiful Spaceship That Looks Like Space Shuttle</h1>

      <h3>Dream Chaser</h3>
      <p>Space company Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) is developing the “Dream Chaser,” a sleek reusable spacecraft that’s meant to shuttle cargo to and from the International Space Station and beyond — and it looks like a sleek version of the space agency’s classic Space Shuttle.</p>
      <p>A test version of the spacecraft’s 15-foot cargo module, called “Shooting Star,” is already on its way to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center for testing, according to a <a href="https://www.sncorp.com/press-releases/snc-shooting-star-arrives-nasa-kennedy-space-center/">press release</a>. The company’s Dream Chaser is under contract with NASA to launch six times to the ISS in the fall of 2021, carrying a total of 10,000 pounds of pressurized and unpressurized payloads inside its cargo module.</p>
      <h3>Cargo Carrier</h3>
      <p>The contract follows Boeing and SpaceX’s attempts to ferry astronauts to and from the ISS in the coming years.</p>
      <p>SNC’s spacecraft is extremely versatile: it will have the ability to dispose of its cargo upon re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, offloading the space station’s unwanted material. Thanks to a specialized self-inflating module attachment, Dream Chaser can even turn itself into an orbital satellite. Like the Space Shuttle, it’ll land on a runway.</p>
      <p>SNC has big plans in store for Dream Chaser. It wants the spacecraft to support other missions in low-Earth orbit and even as far as NASA’s planned <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-maxar-lunar-gateway">Lunar Gateway</a>, an outpost in the Moon’s orbit.</p>
