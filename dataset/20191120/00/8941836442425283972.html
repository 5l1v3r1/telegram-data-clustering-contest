      <h1>Bears’ Trubisky expects to play against Giants if he’s ready</h1>

      <p>LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) - Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky says his right hip is improving and he expects to play Sunday against the New York Giants if he’s ready.</p>
      <p>That’s a big “if.”</p>
      <p>Trubisky is day to day after suffering a hip pointer in the loss at the Los Angeles Rams on a sack near the end of the second quarter.</p>
      <p>He said Wednesday he is feeling “day and night” better than he was following the game. Trubisky got treatment at halftime after taking a knee from Michael Brockers as Troy Hill sacked him. He played most of the second half, but his hip tightened along the way. Chase Daniel worked the final drive and would likely start if Trubisky is unavailable.</p>
