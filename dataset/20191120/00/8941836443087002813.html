      <p>SALEM, N.H. (AP) - New Hampshire high school students and the National Guard are teaming up for a cooking competition using Meals Ready to Eat as their inspiration.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Chopped Challenge on Wednesday at Salem High School is in the style of “Chopped” or “Iron Chef America.” Students from six high school Career and Technical Education programs are participating.</p>
      <p>Teams of three culinary students will be paired with an administrator from their home school and a New Hampshire Army National Guardsman. The teams will be tasked with writing a menu in 15 minutes and creating four plates for judging that they will create from three different MRE’s supplied to them.</p>
