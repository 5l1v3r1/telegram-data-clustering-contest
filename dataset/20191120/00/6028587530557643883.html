      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has gone. José Mourinho is here.The last 24 hours have been the most tumultuous at Tottenham Hotspur in five years. The chairman Daniel Levy has decided, after a run which has seen Spurs pick up just 25 points from its last 24 Premier League games, that the time is right for a change of manager.</p>
      <p>Not everyone is happy with the decision. Many fans on the Lillywhite side of north London feel that the Argentine deserved more time to rebuild after all he had achieved with Tottenham. There is certainly a case to be made that Pochettino has paid the price for the club and Levy's failure to move on players that had come to the end of their natural cycles at Spurs and bring in younger, hungrier replacements.</p>
      <p>Yet rather stick patiently with his man, Levy has turned to ex-Chelsea, Manchester United and Real Madrid boss José Mourinho, whose new contract runs until the end of the 2022-23 season. The brief is clear: steer the club back towards the top four in the short term and, over the next 18 months, secure some silverware.</p>
      <p>Given the current issues at Spurs, that is far easier said than done. Mourinho will have his work cut out if he is to win over the fans put off by his Chelsea past and record of acrimonious exits at other clubs. Here are five issues he needs to address going forward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reinvention</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first and most important matter is not to do with Tottenham but with Mourinho himself. He was once considered one of the finest managers on the planet, but there is a reason he's been out of work for almost a year since being sacked by Manchester United.</p>
      <p>His reign in Manchester came to a bitter end. He openly fell out with several players, something for which he has become notorious. And despite winning two trophies with the Red Devils, their form during the latter part of his spell in charge was atrocious.</p>

      <p>José Mourinho needs to get his spark back. If they are searching for a little hope that this might be possible, Spurs fans could look towards Mourinho’s early years at Porto and his first spell at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>At that time, he had yet to gain the reputation his has latterly curated as a dour, attritional coach. In his early years he was a far more charismatic, positive figure than the one seen of late. That, of course, is ancient history in football terms. But if we are to be optimistic, we might hope that a period out of the dugout will have restored a little of his playfulness, audacity and positivity.</p>
      <p>Pochettino built his side’s success based on the belief that they were all working towards a common goal. Mourinho needs to continue that legacy if he is to succeed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Style</b>
      </p>
      <p>Linked to that change in temperament is the style of soccer he has come to play. Towards the end at United, it was dour and defensive in the extreme.</p>
      <p>But harking back to his early successes once more, his Champions League-winning Porto side was capable of scintillating performances, as was the Chelsea team he led to the title in 2005.</p>
      <p>With the players currently at his disposal, and given the sort of high-intensity soccer they were used to under his Argentine predecessor, Mourinho would be best off trying to bring back a little of the attacking flair he once possessed.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me,” he has said since the confirmation of his arrival, “Working with these players is what has attracted me.” Spurs fans will hope that those words are sincere and that he maintains the positive mentality and youth focus that were the hallmarks of Pochettino’s spell.</p>
      <p>It is more a case of the manager needing to adapt to his club than the club needing to adapt to him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Deadwood</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most pressing issues facing Tottenham is the number of senior players who need to be moved on. This, in effect, is what did for Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Danny Rose has recently come out to say that he is happy to see out the last 18 months of his contract, giving the impression that whether he plays or not is irrelevant. Meanwhile, Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen will all be able to leave on a free next summer after their current contracts run out.</p>

      <p>Mourinho should, alongside Levy, make every effort to move these players on as quickly as possible, with the January window fast approaching. Having want-away squad members is unbalancing for the team and Spurs would be better off using the ones – like Ryan Sessengon, Kyle Walker-Peters, Juan Foyth and Giovani Lo Celso – who are invested in the club’s mid-to-long-term future.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Recruitment</b>
      </p>
      <p>The other side of that same coin is the players he needs to bring in to replace them. Mourinho has, according to reports, been promised a substantial amount of money to spend in the transfer market, something that Pochettino was denied for years.</p>
      <p>He needs to invest it wisely, but his track record at Manchester United on this front was poor. As Premier League recruitment guru Steve Walsh told <i>The Athletic </i>this week, “Pep Guardiola was asked in an interview with a newspaper how he accounted for his success. He said 80 per cent of it was recruitment. I think Jose may have lost sight of that fact [at Manchester United].”</p>
      <p>Walsh, who worked with Mourinho at Chelsea, is currently unemployed and the new Spurs boss could do worse that to rekindle that relationship. Most pressingly, the squad is in need of a at least one new center back and new full backs on both sides of the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Harry Kane</b>
      </p>
      <p>This season, Tottenham’s star attraction and the leader of its frontline is managing half as many shots per game as he was at his peak in the 2017-18 season. Thanks to penalties, he has still managed six Premier League goals this season, but nobody can deny there is something wrong.</p>
      <p>In the difficult recent spell, the Spurs No.10 has been trying to do it all, coming deep to link play in an attempt to create more chances. Mourinho needs to convince him to get back to doing what he does best; occupying defenders, lurking in the box and putting the ball in the back of the net.</p>
