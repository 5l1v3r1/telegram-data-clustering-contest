      <p><b> Mikel Obi </b>is unfazed by Frank Lampard’s success in management, according to <i>61 Saat</i>.</p>
      <p> Mikel shared the dressing room with Lampard for all of his 11-year stay at Chelsea.</p>
      <p> Blues legend, Lampard, was appointed as Chelsea manager at the start of the season following Maurizio Sarri’s exit and despite a sloppy start to his reign, things took a dramatic turn as he finally settled in with the side currently on a six-game winning streak in the Premier League.</p>
      <p> “I am very happy for Frank, he will be successful at Chelsea for many more years,” told Turkish media outlet <i>61 Saat.</i></p>
      <p> Mikel joined Trabzonspor on a two-year deal with an option of a one-year extension after a six months spell with Middlesbrough last season in the English Championship.</p>
      <p> The 32-year-old has played in six games in all competitions for his new club.</p>
