      <h1>‘Great singer, good bastard’: Meet the new Wallabies coach</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:06:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Worthington</a></address>
      <h3>A scroll through the photo archives would suggest Dave Rennie is a very serious man.</h3>
      <p>Shot after shot catches the New Zealand coach with his game face on, a stern look on his face as he watches players warming up or running drills like a hawk.</p>
      <p>He is a former schoolteacher, after all.</p>
      <p>But away from the cameras a different picture emerges.</p>
      <p>Good natured and deeply caring with a wicked sense of humour and will whip out a guitar in the dressing room after a good win.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great singer, you should get him to sing you a song,” laughed former All Blacks lock Ross Filipo, who has known Rennie since he was 14.</p>
      <p>“Very honest, he loves a laugh, he’ll sit there and have a joke.</p>
      <p>“He’s very charismatic, he’s just a good bastard, to be honest.”</p>

      <p>And he is also the new Wallabies coach.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old is currently in charge of Glasgow Warriors but with two Super Rugby titles under his belt it is time to step up to the Test arena.</p>
      <p>So what can Australian fans expect?</p>
      <p>Filipo — who Rennie tried to recruit to his Upper Hutt club as a teenager — also played under him for Wellington and the Chiefs, winning back-to-back titles in 2012-13.</p>
      <p>“He played for Wellington, a handy midfielder back in his day with really silky skills,” Filipo told foxsports.com.au, before the Wallabies move was confirmed.</p>

      <p>“That has transferred into his coaching in terms of what he tries to grow in his players — whether it be technical skills, vision, decision making — he’s a class act in that area.</p>
      <p>“The teams he coaches have really amazing skillsets and keep the ball alive.</p>
      <p>“Those types of skills are always on display in teams he coaches — a very positive type of rugby.</p>
      <p>“And that’s probably a fit for Australian rugby.</p>
      <p>“When I look back at the times I got to play Australia and in Super Rugby for a number of years, my memories are very much ruck and run with really high skillsets.</p>
      <p>“Run, catch, pass, kicking, offloading — all those types of things were a real feature of Australian rugby for a number of years.</p>
      <p>“So that side of things seems like a match.”</p>
      <p>But of course it will be no cakewalk.</p>

      <p>He is inheriting a Wallabies side ranked sixth in the world on the back of their quarterfinal humbling at the hands of England in Japan.</p>
      <p>One could argue the only way is up and the expectation is that Rennie will usher in a youth movement and four year plan for 2023 World Cup glory in France.</p>
      <p>Australia’s runners-up finish in this year’s under-20 world championship is no guarantee of a golden generation but it was certainly a promising sign.</p>
      <p>Rennie becomes Australia’s second New Zealand coach after Robbie Deans, who had a 58.1% winning rate in 74 Tests in charge from 2008-13.</p>
      <p>But Deans was never fully embraced by large sections of the Australian rugby community, who understandably would prefer one of their own guiding such a proud sporting nation.</p>
      <p>Cheika said as much after falling on his sword while former Wallaby Greg Martin led the howls of disapproval on Fox Sports News.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want another Kiwi coaching the national team,” Martin said.</p>
      <p>“I’m hearing a terrible rumour Dave Rennie has already been virtually signed.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I want an Australian to coach the Australian team, someone to bring on the Junior Wallabies who beat the Kiwis and obliterate this Cheika era of being outcoached and out-strategised.”</p>
      <p>Filipo — now working as a coach for the Waikato Rugby Union in New Zealand — has strong insight, having been coached by both Deans and Rennie.</p>
      <p>“He’s a great mentor and if he gets that Wallabies job he’ll be making sure that he has an impression down at grassroots level — schoolboys, club and under-20s rugby,” Filipo said.</p>
      <p>“I’m just thinking what do Australians want right now because there’s a lot of chat on this side of the ditch around Australians calling for an Australian coach.</p>
      <p>“Could he end up with the same fate that Robbie did?</p>
      <p>“Robbie also coached me and is one of my favourite coaches but things didn’t necessarily match up there because he wasn’t Australian.</p>
      <p>“I completely understand the Australian standpoint.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I’m not saying Robbie didn’t get a fair crack because Australians are obviously hugely competitive and want to grow it from their own culture.</p>
      <p>“So there’s always going to be that elephant sitting in the corner of the room.</p>
      <p>“Because we do think about the game slightly differently.</p>
      <p>“Michael Cheika’s said he’d like to see an Australian coach come in and that’s awesome — I don’t disagree with that point at all.</p>
      <p>“It would be weird for us to have a foreigner coaching the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>“I can completely understand that view so it’s just a question of how is this going to work and is it going to work?</p>
      <p>“I don’t know, it could because he’s great at pulling a team together and delivering a great team culture, getting everyone going in the same direction.</p>
      <p>“But so was Robbie, those were huge strengths of Robbie’s as well.</p>
      <p>“So it’ll be interesting to watch.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to see him go there and succeed.</p>
      <p>“It’d be cool to have a really strong Australian side again.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got the athletes to do it.”</p>
      <p>Apart from his technical and tactical nous, Filipo said one of Rennie’s great strengths was building meaningful relationships with his players and knowing how to press each individual’s buttons.</p>
      <p>“He makes that personal connection, he’s very much a relationships man,” Filipo said.</p>
      <p>“He drives very high standards and that’s a good thing if you want to be winning consistently.</p>
      <p>“He’s a very genuine man — I’ve got a lot of respect for him.</p>
      <p>“He’s not a ranter and raver at all.</p>

      <p>“He’s a teacher, he’s a discoverer.</p>
      <p>“He’s great at man managing and tends to deal with people on a case-by-case basis, depending on their personality and whatnot.</p>
      <p>“Obviously every team is going to have their non-negotiables, dos and don’ts, you have to have those outlined.</p>
      <p>“But outside of that he deals with every individual differently.</p>
      <p>“It’s not like a copy and paste program, he builds his whole program around individuals and then works on those relationships really hard.”</p>

      <p>One question mark hovering over Rennie’s CV is that his Super Rugby titles were achieved with the great Wayne Smith by his side.</p>
      <p>Rennie ran the attack, Smith the defence but Filipo said the former was very much the Chiefs’ chief.</p>
      <p>“Very smart coaches but it was clearly Dave’s cutter to run and Smithy complemented him.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what went on in the offices, there could have been a bit of mentoring going on with Smithy in the background.</p>
      <p>“You’d be silly not to, you know, your first time running a Super Rugby team and you’ve got someone of his calibre sitting in the room, you’d want to ask questions and pick his brain and learn as much as you can.</p>
      <p>“He’s not an ego driven coach at all, he’s very much about the team, about the cause, what they’re trying to achieve.</p>
      <p>“He just wants to see his players succeed more than anything else.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good man and I think the Australian boys, if he did get the job, would really enjoy him.”</p>
