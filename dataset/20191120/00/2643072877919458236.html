      <p>He said: <i>“May Allah grant you the strength to bear the irreparable loss. May Allah grant his family the strength to absorb the impact of this death, forgive his shortcomings and reward his good deeds in the hereafter.”</i></p>
      <p>Also, the Nationa Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, sent his condolences to Atiku.</p>
      <p>Tinubu, a close friend to Atiku, prayed that the soul of the late Pariya finds repose.</p>
      <p><i>“My condolences to Vice President Atiku Abubakar over the loss. May VP Atiku, family, friends and associates of the late Pariya find the strength to live through this sudden and untimely demise,”</i> Tinubu said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m deeply saddened by the death of Umar Pariya. I knew him very well. He was very cerebral.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“An excellent human being, Umar Pariya had a welcoming and accommodating spirit. May his soul rest in the bosom of the Lord.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that Pariya died on Tuesday, November 19 and has since been buried in accordance with Islamic rite.</p>
