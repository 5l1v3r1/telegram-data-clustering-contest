      <p>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - A Rhode Island city employee has been terminated and another suspended after someone reported finding a noose in a vehicle on a job site.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza says that the report is under investigation by the Department of Human Resources and a hearing with union officials is planned.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if the vehicle found Monday belonged to the employee or the city.</p>
      <p>President of the NAACP Providence Branch James Vincent says he was contacted by a city employee who wanted to make sure the organization was aware the noose was found and had been reported.</p>
