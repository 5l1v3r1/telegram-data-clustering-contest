        <b>Fifa secured a mandate from the 54 African nations to sell their rights centrally, promising to double the revenue.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fifa said in a statement on Monday on their official website: “Fifa has opened an invitation to tender (ITT) for the centralised media rights to all matches in the second round of qualifying, as well as the third-round play-offs, which will determine the final five teams from Africa that will play at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.</p>
      <p>“Following an agreement with all 54 member associations of Caf in August, the media rights to all African qualifiers for the Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 are being managed under a centralised sales model by Fifa.</p>
      <p>"The media rights will cover TV, internet, mobile and radio transmissions."</p>
      <p>Fifa promised “new elements that will substantially improve the African qualifying competition for audiences and broadcasters alike.</p>
      <p>“Fifa aims to make more matches available to global viewing audiences than ever before, devoting extra attention to production quality, with commentary available in French and English, a unique brand identity, and a comprehensive on-screen graphics package for the centralised feeds.</p>
      <p>“The centralised model brings improved distribution and coverage of all matches across free-to-air, pay-TV and digital platforms, as well as a better viewer experience thanks to enhanced standard match production, with media rights revenues generated for investment directly back into African football.</p>
      <p>“In particular, this tender process will allow Fifa to select the media companies that are best-placed to secure the required transmission commitments and to achieve the objectives of reaching the widest possible audience and providing a high-quality viewing experience for fans.”</p>
      <p>In November Caf also cancelled their $1-billion coverage contract with French broadcast company Lagardere for the Caf Champions League, Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and finals tournaments, and junior tournaments such as the current Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>This followed separate court judgments that the deal had not undergone the tender process.</p>
      <p>The cancellation of the Lagardere contract has led to South African pay-channel SuperSport blacking out its coverage of all Caf games, including the U-23 Afcon and 2021 Nations Cup qualifiers, encompassing Bafana Bafana’s away matches.</p>
