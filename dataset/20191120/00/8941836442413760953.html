      <p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - A small Alaska city struggling with reduced state ferry service is considering using a private vessel, but the cost is problematic.</p>
      <p>The Juneau Empire reported Wednesday that Angoon held a community meeting Nov. 15 to discuss chartering a private vessel for transport north to Juneau.</p>
      <p>Officials say supplies arrived in the city on Admiralty Island each week using the Alaska Marine Highway System ferry before those services were cut back due to state budget cuts.</p>
      <p>Angoon officials have proposed chartering a catamaran owned by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/goldbelt-inc/">Goldbelt Inc.</a>, but large numbers of tickets need to be purchased to keep prices affordable.</p>
      <p>Angoon Mayor Joshua Bowen says in a social media post that only 18 passengers were registered for a Nov. 24 trip, making the cost of a single ticket more than $300.</p>
