        <b>Rodrygo Goes played just 21 minutes across two friendlies for Brazil, and Tite explained the reason behind his decision.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tite rejected criticism of his decision to play Rodrygo Goes for just two minutes in Brazil’s 3-0 win over South Korea on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Brazil coach said on Monday he would be patient with the teenage forward, who has made an impressive start to life at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo has scored twice in four LaLiga appearances for Madrid and notched a hat-trick in their 6-0 Champions League demolition of Galatasaray this month.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old got 19 minutes on his debut in the 1-0 loss to Argentina on Friday and received even less playing time in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>“It’s one thing to throw Rodrygo into a system that’s already structured, like Real’s. It’s another thing to put him in a team that is being reassembled, even if he was doing the same job in the same position,” said Tite.</p>
      <p>“It was so hard to organise for the team for today and they responded well. They were close to scoring a fourth and a fifth.</p>
      <p>“It was a chance for Fabinho, Renan Lodi and Militao. They earned the chance and asserted themselves. Could it have been Rodrygo? Yes, but I preserved the continuity and the good moment of the team in the game.”</p>
