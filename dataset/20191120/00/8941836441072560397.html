      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A man was stabbed to death Tuesday during a fight between two men on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train, an official said.</p>
      <p>Authorities began receiving 911 calls around 1 p.m. about the fight, Interim BART Police Chief <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-alvarez/">Ed Alvarez</a> told reporters at a news conference.</p>
      <p>Transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding and possibly the victim of a stabbing. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-alvarez/">Alvarez</a> said the man died.</p>
      <p>Transit officers searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-alvarez/">Alvarez</a> said. Both men in the fight were in their 40s, though no other details were given about the victim or suspect.</p>
      <p>The stabbing came after the high-profile death in July of 18-year-old Nia Wilson, who was stabbed in an unprovoked attack on her and her sister in an Oakland BART station.</p>

      <p>John Cowell, a 27-year-old parolee, was found competent to stand trial but his case is in legal limbo. A judge in October agreed to seal a motion by Cowell’s attorney to dismiss the case.</p>
      <p>The family of Wilson claims BART failed in its duty to ensure its customers are safe and that BART has failed to sufficiently address crime on its transit lines</p>
      <p>There was no threat to other riders during the incident Tuesday because the fight involved “two individuals that engaged each other,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-alvarez/">Alvarez</a> said.</p>
      <p>“This is something that’s very tragic. It’s rare on BART,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-alvarez/">Alvarez</a> said. “I do want to assure our ridership that BART is safe and we’re continuing to reassure them by providing a presence in our system.”</p>
