      <p>Former Government Statistician, Mrs. Grace Bediako, says staff of the Local Government Service should not expect promotion soon as they hit the minimum years in service.</p>
      <p>Mrs Bediako, who is the National Development Planning Commission’s (NDPC) Representative on Local Government Service stated that, persons due for promotions have to write examinations and pass interviews to prove they deserved to be promoted, the GNA reported.</p>
      <p>“We do not solely focus on the years of your service to promote you, we check your capabilities for the new position through series of tests and interviews that we conduct before promoting you,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mrs Grace Bediako who was speaking at this year’s consultative meeting of the Local Government Service Council in Sogakope in the Volta Region, therefore, asked civil servants to be more concerned about equipping themselves with more experience and knowledge in their fields instead of focusing on meeting the years of service for promotion.</p>
      <p>“…he that much is given, much is expected, if you are asking us to promote you, you have to prove to us you have gained more knowledge and experience from your current position that we can trust you with more responsibilities and assignments,” she said.</p>
      <p>She said the Local Government Council had never declined a promotion of a staff who was due for promotion and passed through the various assessments and interviews successfully, saying, “it is our joy to see you make progress in the various levels of your field and we will not take delight in refusing anyone promotion”.</p>
      <p>Nana Rex Owusu Ansah, the Chairman for Local Government Service Council (LGSC), added that promotions went with additional responsibilities and that if employees were not able to handle their current responsibilities, they should not expect to be promoted with additional responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Some civil servants told Ghana News Agency they were happy their leaders were with them to address their concerns and complained that their promotions delayed in general and some departments overrated and asked that something was done about it.</p>
