      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:41:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Have you tried out Disney’s new streaming service and decided it’s not for you? Or maybe you’ve realized you want a different plan? Read along for how to switch plans or cancel Disney+ before your free trial ends.</p>
      <p>Disney+ offers a free 7-day trial and then goes to $7/month or $70/year for the base subscription.</p>
      <p>Below we’ll cover how to switch plans or cancel your Disney+ subscription if you signed up via the iOS/Apple TV app as well as direct through Disney.</p>
      <p>You can also cancel your subscription anytime during your free trial and keep watching for the full 7 days. If you want to switch to the Disney+ Bundle that includes Hulu and ESPN+, you’ll need to do that <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">directly through Disney</a>.</p>
      <p>And if you’ve got a unique case not covered below, you can reach a Disney+ customer service agent <a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp">24 hours a day through the help page</a>.</p>
