      <h1>Cheap shared rides arrive at New York’s LaGuardia Airport</h1>

      <p>Travellers at LaGuardia International Airport can now get a shared ride to anywhere in the five boroughs of New York City for $20 or less.</p>
      <p>Conde Nast Traveler <a href="https://www.cntraveler.com/story/laguardia-airport-now-has-dollar15-flat-rate-rides-to-manhattan-and-brooklyn">reports</a> that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates LaGuardia, has partnered with the ride-sharing app Via to offer low-cost ground transportation from the airport.</p>
      <p>For $20, travellers can get a carpool ride to the Bronx and Staten Island. Rides to Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn are just $15.</p>
      <p>The new LGA Connect service, currently being pilot tested, is available to passengers arriving in terminals C and D.</p>
      <p>LGA Connect will appear as an option in the Via app; riders enter their destination information and the app matches them to other travellers at the airport heading to nearby destinations and arranges for a pickup.</p>
      <p>Via promises a car and driver will be available within 10 minutes of entering a request, and passengers will be dropped off on a corner no more than two blocks from their destination.</p>
      <p>Rides are available between 0800 and 0100, seven days per week.</p>
