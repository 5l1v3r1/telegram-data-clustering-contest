      <p>The son of former German president, Richard Von Weizsaecker has been stabbed to death by an assailant in an attack at a Berlin hospital that left one other person seriously injured.</p>
      <p>The police noted that the motive for the attack on Fritz von Weizsaecker, 59, on Tuesday evening was unclear.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman noted that the victim, who happens to be a doctor had just delivered a lecture on liver diseases at the Schlosspark hospital in the western Berlin neighbourhood of Charlottenburg when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>A further report had it that the former German president’s son died at the scene despite efforts to save him.</p>
      <p>Other people present overpowered the suspect, one of whom was severely injured by the attacker.</p>
      <p>Investigation have been opened on the case and the police are expected to release information about the assailant and the possible motive.</p>
      <p>Chief of the liberal FDP party, Christian Lindner, voiced his grief about his friend on Twitter, saying that “once again we ask ourselves what sort of world are we living in.”</p>
      <p>He was married with four children.</p>
      <p>His father, Richard von Weizsaecker, was considered one of Germany’s great post-war political figures.</p>
      <p>The elder Weizsaecker was president of West Germany from 1984 to 1990 and then held the same position in united Germany from 1990 to 1994.</p>
      <p>He was previously a deputy in the lower house of parliament for the CDU now led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, and mayor of West Berlin.</p>
      <p>He died in 2015.</p>
