      <h1>Bayern Munich Reportedly Keeping Eye On Troy Parrott</h1>

      <p>In wake of the news that Jose Mourinho is the new Spurs boss - <a href="https://www.balls.ie/football/will-jose-mourinhos-appointment-affect-troy-parrotts-development-420529">and the questions it throws up about Troy Parrott's future at the club</a> - comes word that Bayern Munich are supposedly keeping an eye on the Dubliner.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703739/Bayern-Munich-prepare-shock-Tottenham-striker-Troy-Parrott-eye-Dean-Henderson-swoop.html">Daily Mail</a> reports that the Bundesliga champions are "monitoring his situation having noted his continual progress this season".</p>
      <p>Parrott made his Spurs senior debut earlier this season in the League Cup against Colchester - that was a game which the Premier League club lost on penalties.</p>
      <p>He made his Ireland senior bow in last week's friendly against New Zealand, being credited with the assist for Seani Maguire's goal.</p>
      <p>After remaining seated for Ireland's 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday night, the 17-year-old was dropped into the Ireland U21 team for Tuesday's crucial Euro 2021 qualifier against Sweden.</p>
      <p>After a frustrating opening 45 minutes, Parrott was influential in the second period and scored Ireland's third goal as they came from one down at the break to win 4-1.</p>
      <p>Parrott, who turns 18 in February, signed his first pro contract with Spurs earlier this year.</p>
