      <h1>Growth In U.S. Natural Gas Production Should Slow In 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jude Clemente</a></address>
      <p>A 60% rise in U.S. natural gas production since 2008 is has been the primary factor keeping domestic gas prices so low. Since the shale boom took flight in 2009, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdM.htm">monthly Henry Hub prices</a> have averaged $3.39 per MMBtu, as compared to $5.67 the decade prior.</p>
      <p>Averaging $3.00 since 2014, natural gas has been stuck in a bearish market for years now.</p>
      <p>Yet, even with low prices and a gas-directed rig count that has plummeted from 202 to start 2019 to 129 last Friday, output has continued to rise to record highs.</p>
      <p>Compared to $3.27 per MMBtu last year, Henry Hub gas prices in 2019 have averaged <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/natgas.php">just $2.71</a>, but our gas production this year has been 8-10% higher.</p>
      <p>Looking forward, more of a maintenance mode approach is expected for 2020: balance sheets and dividends over more and more production.</p>
      <p>In 2020, CAPEX spending is expected to slow down, especially in Appalachia, which holds the Utica and Marcellus shale plays that account for nearly 40% of all U.S. gas output.</p>
      <p>Appalachian gas production growth in 2020 is expected to be at 2-3% year-on-year, versus 8-9% growth this year.</p>
      <p>Just some of the thinking out there.</p>
      <p>The largest gas producer in the region and country, EQT, expects 2020 to see “<a href="https://media.eqt.com/investor-relations/news/news-release-details/2019/EQT-Reports-Third-Quarter-2019-Results-and-Preliminary-2020-Outlook/default.aspx">roughly flat to 2019 expected sales volumes</a>.”</p>
      <p>EQT puts 2020 CAPEX to range from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, a $30% year-over-year reduction compared with prior guidance.</p>
      <p><a href="http://investors.cnx.com/~/media/Files/C/CNX-Resources-IR/documents/presentations/third-quarter-2019-earnings-call-slides.pdf">CNX Resources</a> has cut expected 2020 CAPEX by 8-10%, with slightly lower production volumes coming as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/25/range-resources-rrc-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcri.aspx">Range Resources</a> was more vague in its Q3 Earnings Call but says that for 2020 the “first priority is operating the business with organically generated cash flow,” not production growth.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.cabotog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Cabot-Oil-and-Gas-November-Presentation-vFINAL.pdf">Cabot Oil &amp; Gas</a> puts 2020 production growth at 5%, down from 7% in 2019.</p>

        <figcaption>Despite prices being ~17% lower, U.S. gas production is up another 8-10% this year as compared to ... [+] last.<cite>Data source: EIA; JTC</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For the U.S. gas industry, maintaining financial strength and flexibility is an essential goal to become even stronger and more sustainable.</p>
      <p>But to be sure, growing less slowly is not the same thing as declining, a fact that regularly gets conflated by those opposing shale.</p>
      <p>U.S. gas production is still at all-time records.</p>
      <p>With a constant deployment of more efficient technologies and operations, much of the U.S. gas resource base can be had even with $2.25 gas prices.</p>
      <p>Further, although spending less, companies could still increase output by tapping their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs), just like we saw in 2016.</p>
      <p>And hedging output will help: EQT puts plans at 87% of 2020 gas production hedged at a weighted average floor price of $2.71.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Energy sees domestic production rising another 2.8 Bcf/d next year, even with prices at $2.58.</p>
      <p>Slower growing 2020 production amid a burgeoning export business especially could lift prices and ultimately expand output even more down the road.</p>
      <p>Higher crude oil prices could also bring a flood of associated gas in the Permian basin, already yielding almost 20% of domestic gas.</p>
      <p>More bullish in the longer term, an additional 20-25 Bcf/d at least is widely expected for the country through 2040.</p>
      <p>This high optimism around U.S. gas output is why NYMEX futures contracts sit below $3.00 per MMBtu for many years to come.</p>
      <p>The December 2019 contract closed today at $2.51, and December 2025 is just $2.79.</p>
      <p>Truly remarkable.</p>
      <p>Americans should realize that our gas market requires a fair price for both producers and consumers.</p>
      <p>It’s not complicated.</p>
      <p>Too low prices can push our energy companies beyond the brink to bankruptcy, as we saw in the price collapse of 2014-2017.</p>
      <p>Especially with <a href="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fjudeclemente%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FScreen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-9.34.57-AM-1200x862.jpg">gas being locked-in</a> as our go-to fuel to lower CO2 emissions and support intermittent renewables, without new domestic supply we will very easily be forced to expensively import from a precarious global supply chain that Russia’s Gas Exporting Countries Forum seeks to dominate.</p>
      <p>The anti-shale business should heed the same warning.</p>
