      <p>TORONTO (AP) - Fred VanVleet scored 24 points, Pascal Siakam had 18 points and 11 rebounds and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-raptors/">Toronto Raptors</a> beat Orlando 113-97 on Wednesday night to snap the Magic’s winning streak at three.</p>
      <p>Orlando lost center Nikola Vucevic and forward Aaron Gordon to right ankle injuries in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Vucevic came in as the reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week after after averaging 21.7 points, 14.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 1.33 blocks during Orlando’s winning streak.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/toronto-raptors/">Raptors</a> rookie Terence Davis scored a career-high 19 points, Chris Boucher had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Norman Powell scored 15 points. Defending champion Toronto improved to 6-0 at home and won for the eighth time in 10 meetings with the Magic.</p>
      <p>Forward Jonathan Isaac started for Orlando after missing the previous two games because of a sprained right ankle. Isaac splayed 33 minutes, scored 16 points and matched his career high with 13 rebounds.</p>

      <p>Evan Fournier scored 21 points, Terrence Ross had 14 and Markelle Fultz added 12 for the Magic. They are 0-5 on the road.</p>
      <p>Toronto’s OG Anunoby left Monday’s win over Charlotte after he was hit in the right eye for the second time in eight days. Anunoby wore protective glasses to begin the game, but removed them midway through the first. He did not attempt a shot while wearing the glasses.</p>
      <p>Gordon checked out with 8:27 left in the first half, seconds after ending up on the floor while trying to block Anunoby.</p>
      <p>Vucevic went down along his own baseline with 5:29 left in the half after injuring his right ankle while trying to defend Norman Powell’s drive to the basket. Vucevic had to be helped to the locker room, unable to put weight on his right leg.</p>
