      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation’s road-safety regulator is under fire again for what critics call lax oversight of tests involving autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>The nation’s top transportation safety investigator said Tuesday that the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> doesn’t give enough direction to companies developing more automated cars.</p>
      <p>And a member of the Senate Commerce Committee quizzed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/">NHTSA</a>’s acting administrator on why the agency hasn’t confronted Tesla about widely shared hacks that let drivers take their hands off the wheel.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/">NHTSA</a>’s acting administrator, James Owens, says the agency is assessing autonomous vehicle technology and researching how people interact with it.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The hearing comes a day after the National Transportation Safety Board accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/">NHTSA</a> of failing to adequately regulate the testing of autonomous vehicles. One board member said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/">NHTSA</a> puts technology advancement above saving lives.</p>
