      <h1>LSU stays on top as CFP Rankings face an Alabama decision</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:31:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:31</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>The College Football Playoff rankings were unchanged at the top this week, with LSU first followed by Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia.</p>
      <p>The selection committee’s third weekly rankings had little movement in the top 10, with Alabama fifth followed by Oregon, Utah, Penn State, Oklahoma and Minnesota.</p>
      <p>The committee could face an interesting decision with Alabama in the coming weeks. The Crimson Tide <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/tua-tagovailoas-injury-dashes-more-than-alabamas-dreams/">lost quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the season</a> to a hip injury Saturday. Alabama faces Western Carolina this weekend, so playing backup Mac Jones shouldn’t make much difference. On Thanksgiving weekend the Tide will face Auburn with its No. 2 quarterback, which should give the committee a better read on what kind of a team Alabama is now.</p>
