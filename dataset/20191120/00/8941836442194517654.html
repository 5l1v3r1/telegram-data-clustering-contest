      <p>The fight broke out Tuesday afternoon on a BART train pulling into a station in Hayward.</p>

        <p>A California transit chief says a man has been stabbed to death on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train during a fight.</p>
        <p>Interim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that officials began receiving 911 calls Tuesday afternoon about a fight aboard a train between two men.</p>
        <p>He says transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding, who was possibly the victim of a stabbing. He says the man died.</p>
        <p>Alvarez says transit officers quickly searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect.</p>
        <p>He said there is no threat to the public because it was a fight between two people who engaged each other.</p>
        <p>Officials did not immediately provide any other details.</p>
