      <h3>The Apprentice Episode 8: The Task</h3>
      <p>The teams have to host a corporate away day onboard the iconic Belmond British Pullman Train. The candidates will have to lay on food, drink and entertainment while securing a good ticket price from the corporate clients to ensure a large profit—a task that requires the teams to showcase their organization and hospitality skills.</p>
      <p>The two archetypal “posh” kids get made into project managers—thank goodness, because it didn't appear as though they ever intended to put themselves forward in earnest or that they would be chosen by their fellow team members.</p>
      <h3>The Apprentice Episode 8: Key Skills</h3>
      <p>This task required a number of key skills that are essential in business—below I have articulated each skill and its relevance in real life business scenarios.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1) Choose your team wisely</b>
      </p>
      <p>Think of who can do what and how, but be clear on what they should be doing, how and when. Whilst considering that, there can be a fine line between leadership and dictatorship.</p>

      <p>I feel like I shouldn't have to say this again but here we are... if we are looking at team work, an effective leader needs to understand how to lead. Part of being an effective leader is also being part of the team and showing a willingness to get ones hands dirty with the team. Thus delegation and team work are a necessary and desirable element of leadership.</p>
      <p>Realistically, in real life, this may be more simple as your team leader isn’t also vying for £250,000.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2) Sales</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>There are various elements to selling;</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask the right questions—if they want a party and you offer a luxury afternoon tea then you have missed the problem the client has asked you to solve. Think about what the client wants and plan accordingly. If your attention is on selling and budget, then remember your job is to deliver great solutions that fit the client and still ensure that you are in profit.</li>
        <li>Art of silence—in negotiation, I have said it before and I will say it again: the first to speak loses. So if you put an offer on the table, say it and wait. The candidates seem to be afraid of silence so they jump in offering further discount.</li>
        <li>Pricing—Do not pluck the cost out of thin air, think about who the client is and ask the right questions, whilst keeping your price point in mind. In real life, you would have mapped out all of the costs and you would know your price point and margin for negotiation—or at least I hope so.</li>
        <li>Once the deal is done—Ask the right questions again - i.e. are there any dietary requirements. It is your job to know your customer really well and a factual brief taking exercise is an essential part of that.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>3) Under promise, Over Deliver</b>
      </p>
      <p>You cannot over promise on alcohol and suggest an event wide bottomless scenario. If you are offering bottomless alcohol, then offer it for a condensed period of time.</p>

      <p>If you choose to say a service is luxury or Michelin starred, make sure that you are offering just that. Saying a service or product is luxury heightens expectations so be aware of this.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4) Listening is a vital communication skill</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <i>Apprentice</i> is tough. As a viewer, I am shouting at the screen, saying “the PM says no, so do not book an act! Why would you book the act?” But I also know that if they lost on lack of entertainment, Lord Sugar would ask why they didn't use their common sense.</p>
      <p>We all want our staff to have the freedom of thought, but when budget is a factor and can push an event into or out of profit, then do the right thing and listen. If the manager says alcohol was important, why did spend that allocation on an act they explicitly said they do not want?</p>
      <p>In short, if your manager says do not do something but you think they are wrong, then put a case forward in the right way with the right evidence or listen.</p>
      <h3>The Apprentice Episode 8: The Reality</h3>
      <p>There are a few things to think about from this task in addition to the above, so here is a round of quick fire bullet points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes your vision has to be tweaked to suit the needs of the client</li>
        <li>Don't underestimate the importance of building your team morale, their confidence and knowledge is an important facet in business.</li>
        <li>Honesty is important is business. No one likes a person who is dishonest enough to throw someone under the bus to protect themselves.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Apprentice Episode 8: Who Deserved to be Fired?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>*Spoiler Alert* If you haven't watched this episode, stop reading now.</b>
      </p>
      <p>£15.50—Yhat is an unfortunately tight loss.</p>
      <p>An <i>Apprentice</i> first: Thomas offers to come back to the boardroom instead of Pamela - that is a very brave move, quite chivalrous but also a very confident and respectable move. It could have also been the end of the road for him.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark should have been fired last week, so his firing this week comes as little surprise, to be frank.</p>
      <p>I feel Pamela might be in the final 5. It starting to get to the point where I should start guessing the final 5 isn’t it?</p>
      <p>Ok, I will guess another one next week.</p>
