      <p>VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) - Georgia lawmakers studying the possibility of expanding gambling in the state are taking their show on the road.</p>
      <p>A House committee held a meeting Tuesday in Valdosta, noting that tax revenues on casinos, sports betting or horse racing could bolster the state’s HOPE scholarship program for college students. It was the first in a series of meetings scheduled around the state.</p>
      <p>Expanding gambling would require a state constitutional amendment. Two thirds-of each chamber of the General Assembly must approve, followed by voters in a referendum. Georgia could also allow each county’s voters a separate referendum on local gambling.</p>

        <p>Committee members tell news outlets they’re looking most favorably at resort-style casinos. Lawmakers say Valdosta and smaller cities are unlikely to get casinos unless lawmakers back multiple gambling halls across the state.</p>
