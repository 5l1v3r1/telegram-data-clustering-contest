      <p>A 17-year-old Junior High School (JHS) graduate, identified as John, is in a critical condition after a hit-and-run accident at Dawhenya.</p>
      <p>According to his mother, a private car driver knocked him off from a motorbike and bolted.</p>
      <p>“The accident happened on Wednesday after we went to drop his things at Tematech where he has gained admission,” she bitterly lamented.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Adomonline.com, John’s mother, Merry Chawteye, said the accident had cost her son’s two legs.</p>
      <p>According to her, she was called to come to Tema General Hospital and upon reaching there she received shocking news; she said ” my son’s leg was handed to me in a polythene bag with his name written on it.</p>
      <p>“So I carried my son’s left leg to Korle-Bu hoping it could be fixed back because we were told the situation was beyond them at Tema General.</p>
      <p>“The doctors are now saying he will need prosthetics which I have been able to purchase, but the driver is still nowhere to be found,” she narrated.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, she is appealing to all well-meaning Ghanaians to support her in financing her son’s bill since she had exhausted all funds she had and running into debts.</p>
