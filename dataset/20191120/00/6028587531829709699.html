      <p><i>Joker 2 </i><b>could be a case where the sequel “under performs” by merely performing about as well as we expected from its predecessor. Fortunately, </b><i>Joker </i><b>was cheap enough and earned so much that a sequel that afford to earn a lot less and still be a big hit. </b>For better or worse, it appears that Warner Bros. and Village Roadshow<i>’s Joker </i>may not end up being the second-biggest live-action flick to never get a sequel (or be a sequel). <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_2019-11-20%2006:05:00_ehayden&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews"><i>Hollywood Reporter </i>has revealed</a> that a <i>Joker </i>sequel is officially in development, while Todd Phillips used the afterglow of the film’s opening weekend to try to get the rights to other DC Films’ villain origin stories. Toby Emmerich said no, but Phillips (who apparently earned $100 million from back-end points when the $62.5 million movie ended up with over $1 billion worldwide) got proverbial permission to dabble with at least one more DC origin story. Whether that’s for a villain or a hero, I can only surmise, but we’re probably getting <i>Joker 2</i>. Will it perform like <i>Deadpool 2 </i>or <i>It Chapter Two</i>?</p>
      <p>It is fitting that <i>It Chapter Two </i>debuted on “priced to buy” VOD (or “electronic sell-through”) yesterday, because that film could paint a picture of how a <i>Joker </i>movie could perform. While the film was an unquestionable hit for Warner Bros. and New Line, earning $466 million worldwide (and $211 million domestic) from a $70 million budget, it was somewhat on the defensive because of its overperforming predecessor. Had <i>It </i>earned those numbers two years ago, we would have been every bit as impressed as we were with the film’s actual performance. But because <i>It </i>went bonkers, opening with $123 million and earning $327 million domestic and $700 million worldwide (on a $35 million budget), the sequel was unfairly put on the defensive for merely doing very, very well.</p>
      <p><i>It Chapter Two </i>was just the latest sequel to “underperform” merely by earning about what we expected (or dared not hope) from the first movie. Sometimes that means the movie isn’t much of a hit, as when <i>Neighbors 2 </i>earned $105 million on a $35 million budget, well below the $256 million predecessor (on a $17 million budget) two years prior. And while <i>Ted 2 </i>earned “just” $215 million on a $68 million budget, it was disappointing mostly in comparison to the first <i>Ted</i>, which was a surprise super-smash ($549 million on a $50 million budget) three years prior. What that usually means is that audiences were merely curious the first time, or that they showed up after an unexpectedly large opening weekend thanks to strong reviews and buzz.</p>
      <p>I’d wager that <i>Joker 2 </i>might fall into that category, as a sequel presumably won’t have the kind of “most controversial movie of the moment” press attention or a superb festival run that greeted its predecessor. But since <i>Joker </i>was so cheap and earned so much worldwide, it can afford to earn a lot less and still be a huge hit. Ditto next month’s <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, which doesn’t have to equal <i>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</i>’s surprise $404 million domestic/$962 million worldwide cume to be a hit. Sony would have been thrilled with <i>Night at the Museum </i>numbers ($250 million domestic/$543 million worldwide in 2006) and shouldn’t be too sad if <i>Jumanji 3 </i>does just that. Ditto next year’s Andy Serkis-directed <i>Venom 2</i>.</p>
      <p>It’s just as possible that <i>Joker 2</i> will perform closer to <i>Deadpool 2</i>, in terms of comparisons. That 2018 sequel did the (relatively) normal sequel thing, whereby it earned less in North America ($318 million versus $363 million worldwide) and about the same worldwide ($735 million versus $783 million). Okay, fine, when you include the PG-13 <i>Once Upon a Deadpool </i>that goes up to $324 million/$785 million, but we’ll see if <i>Joker 2 </i>can snag itself a Chinese release date this time out. <i>Joker 2 </i>would be just fine with $298 million domestic and $995 million worldwide even if they double the budget ($120 million). Of course, it would be fine with $709 million worldwide (if it drops like <i>It Chapter Two</i>) as well, give or take a surprise China play day/boost.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s entirely possible that <i>Joker 2 </i>could earn more than its predecessor, especially overseas, but that’s not the bar for success. For those who just came for updates, <i>Joker </i>has earned $323.3 million domestic and (presuming a 31.7/68.3 domestic/overseas split) $696.7 million overseas for a $1.02 billion global cume. It’ll cross $700 million overseas in a day or three and pass the overseas cume of <i>Captain Marvel </i>($701 million) soon after. The $741 million overseas cume of <i>Spider-Man: Far from Home </i>is a longshot, but <i>Joker </i>didn’t get the China boost that helped <i>Spider-Man 2 version 3, Captain Marvel</i>, <i>Aquaman </i>and <i>Iron Man 3 </i>($804 million overseas, but $121 million in China). <i>Joker </i>has been, from its first day of release, defying the odds one benchmark at a time.</p>
