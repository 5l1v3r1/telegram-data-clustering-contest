      <p><b>planned for the west coast of denmark, the new intervention will be positioned along the promenade of esbjerg and marks part of a greater urban development for the town. </b>as what will become the center of the larger project, lanternen is designed by <a href="http://werkarkitekter.dk/">WERK arkitekter</a> and <a href="https://snohetta.com/">snøhetta</a> to celebrate the region’s longstanding maritime tradition. the program includes multiple water-sport clubs, boat storage, training facilities, a large workshop and a variety of social spaces.</p>

      <p><b>the architecture is expressed as one rounded volume clad in timber, which makes reference to both the geometry and rich craftsmanship of boats. </b>due to its location next to the north sea, the building is designed to offer shelter from the elements yet become more open within. the heart of the structure is punctured by a raised terrace that opens out from the second floor level, creating a naturally-lit social hub that provides protection from the harsh climate.</p>

      <p><b>with its combination of both social and sports-related spaces, the lanternen center strives to become a new place for the local community to gather against the backdrop of esbjerg and its maritime tradition. </b>with its round, inviting shape, the architecture intends to convey a feeling of openness and inclusiveness. in short, a place of shelter.</p>
