      <p>Oil prices were steady on Wednesday, after falling the past two days, as a surge in U.S. stockpiles reinforced concerns about lacklustre global economic growth amid the trade war between the United States and China, the world's two biggest oil consumers.</p>
      <p>West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 11 cents, or 0.2%, to $55.32 a barrel by 0252 GMT, after falling 4.3% during the previous two sessions.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures were at $60.93 a barrel, up 2 cents, or 0.03%. Brent dropped 3.8% during the prior two sessions.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude inventories rose 6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 15 to 445.9 million, compared with analysts' expectations for a increase of 1.5 million barrels, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The increase in inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil user, added to concerns about a crude oversupply raised after Reuters reported that Russia, the world's second-biggest producer, was unlikely to back deepening output cuts when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meet on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna.</p>
      <p>Russia and other oil producers have agreed with OPEC to cut 1.2 million barrels per day of output through March to bolster prices, a producer group known as OPEC+.</p>
      <p>"Oil is also feeling heavy after the Russians signalled they are unlikely to agree on deepening oil production cuts at the December OPEC + meeting," said Edward Moya, an analyst at brokerage OANDA, in a note.</p>
      <p>"The API data also showed U.S. inventories posted a rather robust increase last week, which if confirmed by the EIA report, we could see oil prices continue to slide," he said.</p>
      <p>Official U.S. government inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is due at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>U.S. crude demand has slowed amid its protracted trade war with China. Hopes for an end to the dispute in the signing of a so-called Phase 1 agreement between the sides has dimmed amid disagreements over the removal of tariffs each side has enacted.</p>
      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that the United States would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end the war.</p>
      <p>Knock on effects from the trade war have been felt in other industrialized economies.</p>
      <p>Japanese exports tumbled at their quickest pace in three years in October, threatening to tip the trade-reliant economy into recession because of weakening demand from the United States and China.</p>
      <p>Crude imports to Japan, the world's fourth-largest oil buyer, fell 1.3% in October compared to the same month a year ago.</p>
