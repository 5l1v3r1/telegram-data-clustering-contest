      <h1>Yoenis Cespedes plans to play for Mets in 2020</h1>

      <p>It qualified as only a little less surprising than video footage of Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster or the Mets’ Bombshell Candidate:</p>
      <p>Yoenis Cespedes<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/we-werent-supposed-to-see-yoenis-cespedes-taking-batting-practice/"> taking batting practice</a>?!</p>
      <p>Out of nowhere Tuesday, beloved former Met Endy Chavez, now a coach in the team’s minor league system, released an Instagram post with him throwing BP to Cespedes, the $110 million outfielder who missed all of last season and most of 2018 <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/20/yoenis-cespedes-has-ankle-fractures-after-ranch-accident/">with myriad injuries</a>. If the Mets can’t necessarily count on a healthy Cespedes as they prepare for 2020, they must at least allow for the possibility that he’s going to try to play in his walk year.</p>
      <p>An industry source who has been in touch with Cespedes said the outfielder has been working regularly with trainers and intends to play next season, the last of the four-year contract he signed with the Mets in November 2016.</p>
      <p>Chavez’s video, exactly one minute long, shows a fit-looking Cespedes wearing a Mets sweatshirt and ski cap along with blue shorts and white sneakers — and taking healthy hacks at the lefty-throwing Chavez’s pitches, presumably in Florida where both men have been recently. To add a characteristically Mets-esque level of intrigue, Chavez subsequently deleted the video. A source familiar with the situation asserted the Mets didn’t order Chavez, who coached for Class-A Brooklyn last season, to take down the video, and SNY, the Mets’ regional sports network, actually kept the video on its Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>Cespedes missed the start of last season as he recovered from 2018 procedures to remove bone calcifications in both heels. Then, on May 18, Cespedes sustained multiple fractures in his right ankle as a result of an accident on his ranch in Port St. Lucie, and that sidelined him for the duration of 2019. The Mets collected “a little less” than 75 percent of the $29 million that Cespedes earned last season, as per the words used by COO Jeff Wilpon in a December 2018 news conference, as an insurance reimbursement. Since signing this contract, Cespedes has totaled 119 games.</p>

      <p>An active Cespedes, set to make $29.5 million in 2020, would hamstring the Mets’ payroll flexibility and add to their surplus of corner outfielders. Already, they have Michael Conforto, J.D. Davis, Jeff McNeil, Brandon Nimmo and Dominic Smith under team control and would like to add a natural center fielder who would represent an upgrade there over Nimmo. Of course, if he’s healthy, Cespedes, who has produced when on the field — he owns a .282/.343/.525 slash line in those 119 games — could give the Mets a major weapon as they try to reach the playoffs.</p>
      <p>At the Citi Field news conference to introduce new manager Carlos Beltran this month, Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen wouldn’t engage on the topic of Cespedes’ 2020 availability, saying, “Too early to tell.” Thanks to Chavez, we now can tell that Cespedes has made considerable</p>
