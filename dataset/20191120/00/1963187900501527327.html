      <p>CAIRO â€“ 20 November 2019: Egypt is moving ahead with the new comprehensive healthcare system at a rapid pace, Health and Population Minister Hala Zayed said on Tuesday. <br/><br/>As she made an inspection visit to the Sharm El Sheikh International Hospital to follow up preparations for applying the new healthcare system in South Sinai, Zayed clarified the new system will guarantee offering high-quality medical services to all citizens. <br/><br/>The new system gives beneficiaries the freedom to choose their health service providers and reduces personal spending on medical care, said a statement that was issued following a press conference held by Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouli to announce the launch of the new healthcare system in Port Said. <br/><br/>During the visit, the minister commended the quality services provided at the hospital, which had been renovated recently, according to a statement by ministry spokesperson Khaled Megahed. <br/><br/>Under the new system, citizens will head for the nearest health unit to their place of residence and conduct any type of medical tests they need. <br/><br/>These units will refer them to hospitals if necessary to make advanced tests. <br/><br/>The new system will cover all governorates by 2032.</p>
