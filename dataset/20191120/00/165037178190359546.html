      <p>Bayern currently have <b>Neuer and Ulreich</b>, but see Henderson as a good option for the future who canÂ give competition to both keepers, who are <b>33 and 31 respectively</b>.</p>
      <p>Troy Parrott is a 17-year-old Irish striker that still hasn't made his Tottenham first-team debut, but has been one of the sensations in<b> UEFA Youth League</b> scoring 5 goals in just 3 matches; 4 of them in the 9-2 rout against <b>Red Star Belgrade</b>.</p>
      <p>It is certain that Bayern's interest in Parrott isn't new and Tottenham have been working on a<b> contract extension</b> for some time to avoid one of their big promises moving to the Bundesliga, where Bayern are trying to capture future Premier League talent.</p>
