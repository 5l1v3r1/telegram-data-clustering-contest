      <h1>Official Monero website hacked to steal user funds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>The official website for the Monero cryptocurrency, <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/"><b>GetMonero.com</b></a>, was hacked to deliver malware that stole digital currency from users.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday a GitHub issue about mismatching hashes coming from this website was opened. A quick investigation found that the binaries of the CLI wallet had been compromised and a malicious version was being served,” GetMonero said in a <a href="https://web.getmonero.org/2019/11/19/warning-compromised-binaries.html"><b>statement</b></a>.</p>
      <p>GetMonero said that it immediately fixed the issue, meaning that these malicious files were only available on its website for a short period of time. It said that its binaries are now being served from a different, safe source.</p>
      <p>“It’s strongly recommended to anyone who downloaded the CLI wallet from this website between Monday 18th 2:30 AM UTC [4:30 AM SAST] and 4:30 PM UTC [6:30 PM SAST], to check the hashes of their binaries,” the team said.</p>
      <p>“If they don’t match the official ones, delete the files and download them again. Do not run the compromised binaries for any reason.”</p>
      <p>To check the hashes of their binaries, users can follow two guides provided by GetMonero – a <a href="https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-windows-beginner.html"><b>beginners’ guide</b></a> to verify binaries on Windows, and an <a href="https://getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/verification-allos-advanced.html"><b>advanced guide</b></a> for verifying binaries on Linux, Mac, or Windows command line.</p>
      <p>The team said that the situation was being investigated and an update would be provided soon.</p>
