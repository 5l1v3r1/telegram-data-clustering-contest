        <b>A 44-year-old man with a family history of glaucoma visited an ophthalmology clinic to reestablish care after relocating. American doctors found that the man suffered from a very rare Pigment Dispersion Syndrome (PDS) that turns a person's cornea into an incarnation of the Tolkien-created Middle Earth 'Eye of Sauron'.</b>

      <blockquote>According to ophthalmologists, PDS can develop when the cells that give the iris its color rub off the back of the iris. Pigment <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201704061052340333-canadian-doctor-glues-child-eye-shut/">may float around</a> to other parts of the eye and tiny bits <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/2005062340750252/">may clog the eye's</a> drainage angle giving rise to unwanted pressure, including glaucoma.</blockquote>
      <p>The unusual case <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1903842">was first published</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine. The medics say that such a rare condition is more common to people that are myopic. Nearly half of those with PDS, however, can further develop <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201810201069062576-doctors-remove-worms-baby-eyes/">elevated eye pressure</a> and glaucoma of the pigment decreases the outflow of fluid, the doctors say.</p>

      <blockquote>A cure for the rare disease involves selective laser trabeculoplasty and the use of a prescription for pressure-lowering eye drops to control inner eye pressure.</blockquote>
