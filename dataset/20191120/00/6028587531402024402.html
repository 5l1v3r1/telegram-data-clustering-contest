      <p><b>Topline</b>: A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-baltimore-mayor-catherine-pugh-facing-11-count-federal-indictment-wire-fraud-and">indicted</a> former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh on charges of wire fraud and tax evasion stemming from a years-long scheme to use fraudulent sales of her self-published children’s book series to enrich herself and fund her mayoral campaign.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prosecutors allege that from 2011 to 2019 Pugh fraudulently sold copies of her books—the “Healthy Holly” series—and used that money to fund her mayoral campaign and renovate a house in Baltimore.</li>
        <li>Pugh would “intentionally double-sold Healthy Holly books by selling books purchased by one buyer to a different buyer without either buyer’s knowledge or consent,” the indictment says, or she would simply never deliver books that were purchased.</li>
        <li>In once instance, a nonprofit bought copies of “Healthy Holly” in 2011 and gave them to the Baltimore City School District with the intention of providing free copies of the book for students to take home. While the donated books were being stored by the school district in a warehouse, Pugh would send her associates to remove copies and sell them to other buyers or give them out at political events, prosecutors say.</li>
        <li>All the white, Pugh evaded taxes on the more than $800,000 sales of “Health Holly” books, prosecutors say.</li>
        <li>One of the largest purchasers of books was the University of Maryland Medical System, where Pugh had a board seat, the<i> Baltimore Sun</i> first <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/bal-healthy-holly-coverage-20190319-storygallery.html">reported</a>, sparking concerns about self-dealing. </li>
        <li>Pugh’s former aide Gary Brown Jr. also plead guilty to similar charges for his role in the children’s book scheme, including cashing checks from Pugh’s Health Holly business account and then using that money to make fraudulent donations in the name of other people to Pugh’s mayoral campaign.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Pugh’s attorney declined to comment on the indictment.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: “Our elected officials must place the interests of the citizens above their own,” said U.S. Attorney Robert K. Hur. “Corrupt public employees rip off the taxpayers and undermine everyone’s faith in government. </p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: After the<i> Baltimore Sun</i> first reported on the scandal, Pugh resigned in May. At the time, she maintained that she paid all of her taxes and <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-pugh-on-books-20190320-story.html">said</a> a criminal inquiry was a “witch hunt.”</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for</b>: Prosecutors said Pugh will self-surrender to authorities before her arraignment  on November 21. If convicted, she faces a maximum 30 years in prison.</p>
