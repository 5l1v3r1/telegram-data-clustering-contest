      <h1>Oshiomhole Reveals How Lawmakers Who Dumped APC Were Punished</h1>

      <p>The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/adams-oshiomhole/"><u><b>Adams Oshiomhole</b></u></a>, has revealed how sixteen senators who dumped the party with former Senate President, <b>Bukola Saraki</b>, were punished.</p>
      <p>The former governor of Edo state stated this while speaking with State House correspondents after the closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole said: <i>“But of course, we also know that there was an election in Kogi but that is a matter for another day when we present the governor re-elected.”</i></p>
      <p>He claimed that the 16 senators who decamped from APC along with Senator Bukola Saraki had a hard time coming back to the senate as Nigerians in their respective constituencies insisted on punishing them for not been loyal and refusing to monetize their mandates.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole stated that the only Senator still struggling is <b>Dino Melaye</b> but is currently been led in the election which took place on Saturday by <b>Senator Smart Adeyemi</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I think the lesson for us to be learnt as a party is rather clear, that when politicians go to the polls to collect mandate on a particular political platform and then they dumped the party for another party, the electorate will always be waiting for them.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Over time, we are likely to see people out of fear for the electorate, not monetizing their mandate after they are elected.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But overall, we are grateful to Almighty God for making this election successful, we appreciate the people of Bayelsa State who have reposed confidence in our party and on our candidate.”</i>
