      <h1>Tories Slammed For Fact-Check Stunt - But Was That Part Of The Plan?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Alasdair Lane</a></address>
      <p>As Britain's electoral hopefuls duked it out before a live studio audience last night, the delicate divide between truth and spin narrowed. For little over an hour, the Conservative’s press office Twitter account was fashioned as ‘factcheckUK’, an apparently non-partisan body fastidiously debunking Labour’s ‘lies’. It has been condemned as a deeply cynical stunt - but in the war for digital dominance, it has perhaps achieved its main objective: attention. So glued to ITV’s ‘Johnson v Corbyn’ extravaganza, few might’ve noticed the stealthy switch. ‘CCHQ Press’ - the Conservative Campaign Headquarters’s media account - was suddenly ‘factcheckUK’. A new avatar accompanied the name change - a reliable looking tick symbol replaced the Tories’s ubiquitous blue tree - and out came a spree of myth-busting tweets, each authoritatively prefixed with “FACT”. </p>
      <p>For the average punter idly scrolling their news feed, the ruse might well have worked. Little cuts through Twitter’s interminable dross like the sheen of legitimacy and a coveted ‘blue tick’ - factcheckUK had both. But in reality, the stunt fell flat: most posts were retweeted just a few dozen times, with eagle-eyed users quick to call out the deception. </p>

      <p>But it’s the principle - trying to dupe the electorate - that has caused the greatest offence. Full Fact, a bona fide fact-checking agency, described the move as “misleading” and “inappropriate”. The Electoral Commission, though powerless to take any real action, made clear the public’s entitlement to “transparency and integrity”. Twitter also weighed in, threatening “corrective action” should there be another offence.</p>
      <p>The Tories don’t appear the least bit bothered. “We make no apology,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC, stressing their right to refute what they deem untrue. This is, of course, wholly fair - but the party’s apparent penchant for playing fast and loose with the truth is perplexing. Just last month, they doctored a now-deleted video of Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer to invoke a sense of cluelessness.  </p>
      <p>They claimed innocence back then, and are doing so again now. "No-one will have been fooled" by the fact-checker trick, argued Raab. Maybe he’s correct, but critics are right to worry about the precedent. In tone and volume, the noise around politics is intensifying. Now more than ever, voters must be given a fair chance to delineate quantifiable fact from politicised fiction.</p>

      <p>By blurring the line between the two, the Conservatives risk feeding the fake news frenzy. And perhaps, in a curious way, this was the real objective. Saturated in the sound and fury of political campaigning - deceptive or otherwise - people tend to shut off from all but the most singular of messages. While the debate on the ethics of factcheckUK rages, Raab and others have had the spotlight to hit their attack lines time and again: <i>get Brexit done, Labour can’t be trusted.</i></p>
      <p>It’s little wonder there’s been such a push to formally combat misinformation. Parliamentary reports have urged new regulation to police digital electioneering and advertising, but little progress has been made. In lieu of legislation, there was hope that social media companies - chastened by allegations of foreign electoral meddling - would self-regulate. Twitter says it’s taking the issue seriously, but when push came to shove last night, it could muster only a warning.</p>
      <p>A message has been sent however: recklessness with the truth will not go unchallenged. How the political players interpret this - a warning they’d better heed or a chance to be exploited - remains to be seen. </p>
