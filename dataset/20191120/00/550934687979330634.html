      <h4>Prosecutors have arrested three people in connection with a video that caused the collapse of the Austrian government earlier this year. Authorities made the arrests and searched properties on Tuesday.</h4>
      <p>Austrian prosecutors have arrested three people in connection with <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/austrias-sebastian-kurz-faces-no-confidence-vote-in-wake-of-ibiza-scandal/a-48813645">a video that brought down the Austrian government</a> earlier this year, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Thomas Vecsey told the Associated Press on Wednesday that authorities made the arrests and searched properties on Tuesday, but declined to provide further details.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors will decide whether to pursue action against the trio by Thursday, according to the Austrian newspaper <a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/politik/oesterreich/2039074-Ibiza-Video-Drei-Verdaechtige-in-Verwahrungshaft.html"><i>Wiener Zeitung</i>.</a></p>

      <p>The video, published in May 2019, appeared to show <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ex-leader-of-austrias-far-right-freedom-party-to-withdraw-from-politics/a-50654773">then-vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache</a> offering favors to a woman posing as a Russian investor, in return for positive media coverage of his party.</p>

      <p>Strache and Johann Gudenus, respectively leader and deputy leader of the far-right Freedom Party, also appeared to discuss corrupt political practices involving donors in the video. The Freedom Party was the junior party in a governing coalition at the time.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the "Ibiza Affair" because of the Spanish island where the footage was filmed, the video led to the collapse of Austria's coalition government. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/austrias-political-scandal-fails-to-stick-in-election-campaign/a-50604000">Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called a snap election</a>, which took place in September, and Strache has since resigned from politics.</p>
      <p>After winning the most seats but with no clear majority, Kurz and his right-wing Austrian People's Party remain in coalition talks with other parties.</p>
      <p>It is unclear who the suspects are nor what their exact charge is.</p>
