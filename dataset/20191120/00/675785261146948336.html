      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:32:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:32</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Michael Mutch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A man detained a convicted paedophile who was released from prison by mistake after spotting his wanted notice on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>Graham Lamb was sitting on a bus when he clocked a familiar figure boarding the vehicle.</p>
      <p>After checking the <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hull-dad-catches-paedophile-bus-3553532">Hull Live website</a> on his phone, the 45-year-old felt certain it was Valerijs Gordijis - a convicted paedophile wrongly released just the day before.</p>
      <p>“He got on and I thought 'it can’t be',” said Mr Lamb.</p>
      <p>“It can’t be that much of a coincidence but he was right in front of me.</p>
      <p>“I was checking Facebook and it popped up saying <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/valerijs-gordijis-paedophile-hull-prison-3552231">convicted paedophile was out of prison</a>, and he was right in front of me on the bus.</p>

      <p>“I kept looking at him and he kept looking at me. I brought up his picture on my phone and that was when I realised it was the same guy.”</p>
      <p>Gordijis had been serving a sentence at HMP Hull for sexual offences against children.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday morning police issued an appeal for the 46-year-old after he was released by accident.</p>
      <p>Realising he was in the pervert's presence, Mr Lamb decided he could not let him go free.</p>
      <p>Mr Lamb said: “I said to the bus driver it was him and that she needed to stop the bus so I could ring the police.</p>
      <p>“I showed her the picture and he looked at the phone and tried getting off the bus so I went after him. He tried to avoid me so I said ‘stay there’ and I rang the police.</p>

      <p>“I was ready to grab him and pin him down but I did not need to. He was only a small guy and would not have put up much of a fight.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I said 'stay there' he had a worried look on his face. He had the same scar above his left eye. I knew it was him.”</p>
      <p>As luck would have it there was a police car parked nearby.</p>
      <p>"As soon as the bus pulled away there was a police car right next to it so I flagged it down," the dad continued.</p>
      <p>“He deserves to be back in prison and I am glad that he is off the streets and is no longer a danger to anyone else or any other children.”</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Justice confirmed that  <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/valerijs-gordijis-paedophile-released-error-3553814">Gordijs was released by mistake</a> : "Valerijs Gordijs was released in error from HMP Hull yesterday but has since been recaptured.</p>
      <p>“Releases in error are very rare but we take them extremely seriously and working closely with police to bring offenders back into custody quickly.</p>
      <p>A  <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/all-about/humberside-police">Humberside Police</a>  spokesman added: "Following our media appeal, Valerijs Gordijis was located on Hessle Road this morning. He was arrested and will be returned to prison.</p>
      <p>"We want to thank everyone who shared our appeal."</p>
