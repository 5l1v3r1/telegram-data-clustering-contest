      <p>New Zealand captain Amy Satterthwaite, who has taken a break from cricket to have her first child, said she would miss being part of next year's ICC Women's T20 World Cup, but was hoping to make a comeback ahead of the 2021 50-over World Cup.</p>
      <p>Satterthwaite has represented the White Ferns in five editions of the T20 World Cup so far, including their successful campaigns in 2009 and 2010, when they made the final. The 33-year-old expects her child in January 2020, and will not participate in the next edition of the tournament, which begins in February. </p>
      <p>"I am going to miss it," she told Mel Jones in the <i>Road to the T20 World Cup</i> podcast. "But I know I have got some exciting things ahead. You kind of remind yourself about it. With the Big Bash starting and watching on TV, you sort of been itching to be out there. It's been different, but I'm sure it'll be good for me in the long run.</p>

      <p>"I haven't obviously been through this journey before, been a parent before. We are going to have to see how it goes. The ultimate goal would be to be back and to be playing the 2021 50-over World Cup in New Zealand. I still want to come back and have a little more to give."</p>
      <p>When asked about the player who would play a key role for New Zealand in the big tournament, Satterthwaite heaped praise on 21-year-old Rosemary Mair, who has so far featured in three ODIs and as many T20Is.</p>
      <p>Satterthwaite particularly praised the right-arm seamer for her debut performance against India in February. In her first over in international cricket, Mair was smashed for 18 runs by India opener Smriti Mandhana. Satterthwaite lauded the youngster for not getting "rocked" after that start, as she came back to return figures of 1/13 in her next two overs, playing an important role in New Zealand's 31-run victory.</p>

      <p>"She's a young player who's coming through," said the New Zealand skipper. "Mandhana certainly put her around her boundary in her first game, but she came back later in the match and it shows her character. She's got a good head on her and a skill set that's going to be a real asset in these conditions."</p>
      <p>Satterthwaite also reminisced on New Zealand's 50-over World Cup triumph in 2000, which she watched from the ground. The White Ferns skipper spoke about the excitement she felt as a 13-year-old watching her country topple Australia on the big stage, and added that she has drawn a lot from that experience in Lincoln. </p>
      <p>"We were coming back from a family trip, and it worked out really well to come in and watch the end of the game," she remembered. "The tense nature of the finish of the game, followed by the sheer joy and exhilaration from the result. Sense of achievement from an underdog team going into the game. It's something we've drawn from a lot."</p>
