      <p>     Have you ever wondered whether online ads, Instagram pages and websites touting lab-grown diamonds (LGDs) are telling the truth about their so-called “earth-friendly” or “environmentally sustainable” stones? Your wariness is well-placed. As it happens, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been researching potentially misleading LGD product claims in order to help prevent consumer fraud in the jewelry sector. Acting decisively, the FTC has issued warnings to the following LGD producers: <a href="https://www.adadiamonds.com/">ADA Diamonds</a> , <a href="https://www.diamondslabcreated.com/">Agape Diamonds</a>, <a href="https://diamondfoundry.com/">Diamond Foundry</a> , <a href="https://puregrowndiamonds.com/">Pure Grown Diamonds</a> , <a href="https://www.diamondnexus.com/">Diamond Nexus </a>, <a href="https://www.miadonna.com/">Mia Donna</a> &amp; Co., <a href="https://www.stauer.com/">Stauer</a>  and <a href="https://www.timepiecesusa.com/">Timepieces International</a>.</p>

      <p>    For the purposes of this article, let’s refer to these eight lab-grown diamond companies as the “LGD8.” In the spring of 2019, the FTC advised the LGD 8 that their online advertisements may mislead consumers, in violation of the FTC Act. In July 2018, the FTC issued updated <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2018/07/ftc-approves-final-revisions-jewelry-guides"><b>Guides for the Jewelry, Precious Metals and Pewter Industries</b> </a>which advise marketers on how to fairly represent jewelry, including natural, lab-created, and simulated diamonds. As the FTC press release warns, “Failure to follow the Guides could result in enforcement actions [including civic penalties] if the FTC determines that companies committed unfair or deceptive acts and practices.”</p>
      <p>    The FTC letters noted how some of the LGD companies’ advertising may “deceive consumers.” Examples of this include ads implying that a lab-created diamond is actually natural, as in mined from the earth, or that a simulated product such as a cubic zirconia is lab-created.  Likewise, the FTC stated that in some advertisements, product descriptions lacked the required disclosures regarding the diamond’s origins. “Manufacturers who make misleading advertisements are cheating consumers and hurting the jewelry industry by sowing confusion and mistrust,” says New York-based jewelry designer <a href="https://philanthropyisbeautiful.com/">Joan Hornig</a>, who uses natural diamonds as well as lab-grown stones in her various designs.</p>
      <p>As Los Angeles, CA.-based attorney Michael Ackerman explains, “Advertisers make false claims because legal representation and settlement costs will amount to less than the profits that they stand to make.” Ackerman, who has participated in dozens of anti-trust and consumer class actions, adds, “Misleading advertising of any type is illegal because it induces people to buy things under false pretenses.”</p>
      <p>According to a gemologist who briefly worked as a marketing freelancer for Diamond Foundry and requested anonymity due to concerns about retaliation from the company, “Scientific, gemological and accurate product information about Diamond Foundry lab-grown diamonds never seemed to be a priority with my supervisors,” he relates. “The most persuasive marketing language, rather than disclosing accurate product information, seemed to be the priority.” He also claimed he was instructed to describe the company’s LGDs “as only ‘created diamonds’ or ‘cultured diamonds’ as opposed to lab-grown. “This made me really uncomfortable,” he recalls, “because these stones are a manufactured product and they require tremendous amounts of electricity to create them in a matter of weeks. To say that these industrial products are cultured, like pearls, creates an inaccurate impression.”</p>

        <figcaption>London-based jewelry designer Nadine Aysoy notes that jewelry manufacturers and designers owe it to ... [+] consumers to disclose the nature of lab-grown diamond jewelry in all communications. "Transparency about materials is paramount," she says. "People deserve to know what a jewelry design is made of."<cite>Nadine Aysoy Jewellery</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Besides potentially duping customers into buying a product that has been intentionally misrepresented, “Some LGD marketing may be hurting the business of natural diamond jewelry designers by causing people to buy LGDs instead of natural diamonds,” says London-based designer <a href="https://nadineaysoy.com/">Nadine Aysoy</a>. Aysoy’s Czarina, Elle et Lui and Celeste collections incorporate natural diamonds and her highly luxurious collections retail in London at <a href="https://www.harveynichols.com/">Harvey Nichols</a> and in Los Angeles at <a href="https://justoneeye.com/">Just One Eye </a>While Aysoy’s grandfather and father were natural diamond dealers, she works with LGD for some of her more affordably priced collections. “There’s nothing wrong with using lab-grown stones as long as you’re disclosing their industrial origins, and never marketing them as somehow superior to natural diamonds,” Aysoy says. “As any jewelry industry expert will tell you, these are two distinctly different types of products.”</p>
      <p>        The FTC instructs that the only approved terms that can be used to describe or promote lab-grown diamonds are: laboratory grown, laboratory created and [manufacturer name] created. The website of lab-grown diamond company <a href="https://larkandberry.com/">Lark &amp; Berry</a> employs the word “cultured” to describe its products, despite FTC guidelines that terms such as this may mislead customers as to jewelry product origins.</p>
      <p>       Diamond Foundry uses the word “real” on its website despite the FTC’s prohibition of applying this term to lab-grown diamonds. The company also insists that it uses only renewable energy to produce its industrially produced stones without providing an evidence-based report on its energy sources. Mia Donna is another company that the FTC warned in writing. While its video entitled “Mia Donna: The Eco Diamond” lauds the environmentally sustainable merits of its lab-created goods, the FTC states that when companies make a claim about their environmental record, this must be substantiated with data and evidence. </p>

        <figcaption>Goldsmiths and designers Heleen Hoogenboom &amp; Sanne Bogers of Bilthoven, The Netherlands, only ever ...

      <p>In the final analysis, jewelry experts often stress that unlike natural diamonds, LGDs are considered practically worthless by high-end estate jewelers and the most discerning auction houses. According to Nan Summerfield, senior vice president and director of California operations for the New York-based heritage auction house <a href="http://doyle.com/">DOYLE</a> , “While natural diamonds hold their value across time and many can be resold for good prices, the secondary market for lab-grown diamonds has yet to come into existence.” Certainly, lab-grown diamonds are made of the same material as natural diamonds are, but because LGDs are manmade, they have zero resale value, unlike that of natural gems. Value-conscious lovers and others may therefore want to stick to purchasing only natural diamonds, since these maintain unassailably superior market value from one generation to the next.</p>
