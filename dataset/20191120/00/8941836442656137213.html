      <p>LIBERTY LAKE, Wash. (AP) - The Liberty Lake Sewer and Water District near Spokane is asking its customers to boil their water after a water sample from a fire hydrant tested positive for E. coli.</p>
      <p>The sewer and water district said Wednesday it is investigating the source of the contamination and disinfecting the entire system with chlorine. The district says it’s working with the state Department of Health and hopes to have the problem fixed within a week.</p>
      <p>The water system serves more than 10,000 people in Liberty Lake and the surrounding area approximately 12 miles (19 kilometers) from Spokane.</p>
      <p>No illnesses related to the water have been reported.</p>
