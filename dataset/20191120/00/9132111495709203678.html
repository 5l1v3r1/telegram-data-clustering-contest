      <p>Senyo Hosi, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Ghana Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors (CBOD) has publicly declared his opposition to a “yes” vote in the upcoming referendum on whether or not party politics should be introduced at the local government level.</p>
      <p>On his part, the unbridled partisanship has left Ghana in a situation where commonsense is defined by party colours. For this reason, he says, he shall vote “No”.</p>
      <p>“In a country where commonsense is defined by party colours, I’ll vote no to partisan district elections. #IvoteNo,” he declared on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The referendum, set for 17th December 2019, is to enable Ghanaians to decide whether or not to amend article 55(3) which bars political parties from participating in local government elections.</p>
      <p>The two major political parties, the National Democratic Congress ( NDC) and New Patriotic Party( NPP) are divided over the matter with the NPP canvassing for a yes vote while the NDC is campaigning for a No vote.</p>
      <p>The debate has been heated on social media with many prominent people equally divided on the matter with Prof Stephen Kwaku Asare popularly known as ‘Kwaku Azar kicking against the YES vote.</p>
      <p>Prof Azar wrote:</p>
      <p>In most constituencies, the general election is meaningless because a party will win if it sponsors a sansankroma. As a result, primary candidates need to raise, on average, GH?389,803 just to secure the party parliamentary nomination, which is largely determined by how well a candidate treats delegates. Some parties tax elected MPs who increasingly feel that the parties must shield them from competition because of such taxes. Parties also rely on a few profit-seeking financiers, further creating side obligations and making them less accountable to the people.</p>
      <p>Even someone like me who is an ardent supporter of party politics has become disillusioned by the way we practice it. Sadly, I have concluded that party politics, as practiced in our polity, undermines democracy and assures corruption. What we badly need then is to reform party politics at the national level not export it and all its glaring problems to local elections.”</p>
