      <h1>Gascoigne backs 'unbelievable' Mourinho to triumph at Tottenham</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho will have no trouble winning over Tottenham players and supporters, according to former favourite Paul Gascoigne.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Paul Gascoigne believes Tottenham's appointment of Jose Mourinho will energise the squad </b>and prove an excellent decision.</p>
      <p>Spurs named Mourinho their new manager less than 12 hours after dismissing Mauricio Pochettino, the man who led them to the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p><b>Results have soured this term and Pochettino left the role on Tuesday</b> without having added to the club's trophy cabinet.</p>
      <p>Tottenham great Gascoigne thinks Mourinho is the man to buck the trend of near-misses and, despite his adversarial managerial style, expects a reportedly fractured set of players to unite behind the new boss.</p>
      <p>"<b>The way Manchester City have put pressure on everybody, people are looking for the best</b>," Gascoigne, who won the FA Cup with Spurs in 1991, told Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"As far as I'm concerned, Jose Mourinho is an unbelievable manager. If I was a Tottenham player now and knowing Jose Mourinho was going to be manager I would be more than happy. <b>Have you had a look at what Jose Mourinho has won? </b>Jesus. Alex Ferguson was an unbelievable manager, the best ever in the world, and Jose Mourinho isn't far from him."</p>

      <p>Asked whether it might take time for Mourinho to win over the dressing room, Gascoigne replied: "I wouldn't have thought so. Definitely not, no way. <b>There will be sadness because obviously a lot of players were close to Pochettino </b>and I feel sorry for him. I suppose he will go on holiday and have a think about what he wants to do next. I'm sure a great club will come in for him. The players will warm to [Mourinho] and if they don't they'll be on the bench. He's definitely a manager I would play for, that's for sure. A manager is only as good as the players he's got and if he's not happy with the players he's got he will bring in players."</p>
      <p><b>The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said it was "shocked and saddened" by the decision to dismiss Pochettino</b>, who spent over five years in charge, but Gascoigne reckons fans can look forward with optimism.</p>
      <p>"All they have to look at is Jose Mourinho's trophy cabinet," he said. The players have got to understand they haven't won anything. Jose Mourinho has – what he has achieved as a manager is second to none. Tottenham's future looks bright and if I was a Tottenham supporter now I'd be more than excited."</p>
