      <p>NEW GLARUS, Wis. - Robert W. Holmes, age 81, of New Glarus passed away on Saturday, November 16, 2019 at his home.</p>

      <p>Bob quietly carried out his commitment to lifelong community service. He was a longtime member of Swiss United Church of Christ, and served the church in many roles.  His belief in education led him to serve locally on the New Glarus School Board and globally  as a mentor to several students in El Salvador after traveling on many mission trips, chauffeured "his ladies" from the New Glarus Home, volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, was a 4H leader, and a member of the Red Cross 5 gallon club.</p>

      <p>He was preceded in death by his parents, brother Donald, and in-laws Leland and Edith Crandall.<br/>A gathering of relatives and friends will be held from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Friday, November 29, 2019 at the Swiss United Church of Christ, 18 Fifth Ave., New Glarus. </p>
      <p>A memorial service will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 30, 2019 at the Swiss United Church of Christ in New Glarus.  Rev. Bill Wineke and Pastor Petra Streiff will officiate.<br/>The Zentner-Beal Funeral Home of New Glarus is assisting the family.</p>
      <p>A memorial fund has been established.</p>
      <p>It is with deep gratitude that the family thanks cardiologist Dr. Jaya Krishna, Dr. Glen Liu, and the research team of the G.U. unit at Carbone Cancer Center for their efforts to treat Bob's heart and prostate cancer.  The family also gives thanks to Agrace HospiceCare, Inc. and Helping Hands for the care given that allowed Bob to live out his life at home.</p>
