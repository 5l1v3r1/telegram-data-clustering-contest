        <b>The Renault Formula 1 squad has announced new signing Esteban Ocon will officially join the team on December 2, the day after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The French driver will then take part in the post-season 2020 Pirelli tyre test at Yas Marina, driving for Renault on both the Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ocon gained his first proper F1 race weekend experience with the Enstone team at Abu Dhabi in 2014, when he drove a Lotus-Renault E22 in FP1 and again in testing the following week (pictured below).</p>

      <p>His most recent F1 track mileage was completed at Paul Ricard in October, when he participated in 2020 Pirelli tyre testing with the current Mercedes W10.</p>
      <p>He has been released early by Mercedes GP, with whom he retains a management relationship. He will however still be on call as reserve driver until Saturday's qualifying session.</p>
      <p>With Ocon at Renault and Lewis Hamilton on Petronas promotional duties, Williams driver George Russell could be drafted in by Mercedes for the Pirelli test, which would potentially give more track time at Williams to Nicholas Latifi.</p>
      <p>The Canadian is expected to be confirmed as Williams's second driver for the 2020 season.</p>
