      <p>Dreich has beaten braw, glaikit and scunnered to be named as the “most iconic Scots word” by the Scottish Book Trust.</p>
      <p>It received 259 of the 1,895 votes cast in a poll as part of Book Week Scotland which was run with the hope of prompting discussion around well-loved and well-used words.</p>
      <p>Originally meaning “enduring” or “slow, tedious”, over time dreich has come to be defined as “dreary, hard to bear” and “dull, gloomy”.</p>
