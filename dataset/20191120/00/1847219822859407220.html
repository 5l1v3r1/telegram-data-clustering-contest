        <b>Latvian President Egils Levits, discussing the issue of doctor wages in the country, has said: «We have developed for a long time a mechanism of irresponsibility». The head of state gave an interview to Latvijas Televīzija’s programme Rīta Panorāma on Wednesday, November 20.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Latvian doctors continue their protests over the Latvian state budget, where the promises to raise the wages of the medical staff have been broken, medical trade unions have asked the President to send the state budget bill back to legislators, who passed it last week.</p>
      <p>«It is an unacceptable practice, because promises are made that are later not fulfilled,» said Levits about funding promises at the level of the government and the parliament.</p>
      <p>He did not give a clear answer on whether he would return the budget law to the Saeima.</p>
      <p>Doctors have also called for the dismissal of the parliament, but Levits commented that he saw no sense in dismissing the legislators. Even if the current campaign to collect signatures to sack the Saeima would end in a new election, the parties would remain the same, Levits predicted.</p>
