      <p>Closing the entrepreneurial gender gap could <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elanagross/2019/11/01/closing-the-entrepreneurial-gender-gap-could-increase-the-global-economy-by-5-trillion/#1fe65b43392a">increase the global economy by $2.5 trillion to $5 trillion</a>, yet female entrepreneurs still face sexism in every country. Research <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mastercard-Index-of-Women-Entrepreneurs-2019.pdf">published </a>Wednesday ranked the best countries for female entrepreneurs and found that the U.S. is first, followed by New Zealand, Canada and Israel.  The third Mastercard Index of Women Entrepreneurs looked at publicly available data from international organizations, including UNESCO and the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor to create a global index that tracks the progress and success of female business owners across 58 markets representing nearly 80% of the world’s female labor force. It evaluated each country based on three factors: women’s advancement outcomes like the rate of participation in the workforce, knowledge assets and financial access like financial inclusion and entrepreneurial support like cultural perceptions of female entrepreneurs. </p>
      <p>“The results reaffirmed that women are able to make further business inroads and have higher labor force participation rates in open and vibrant markets where the support for [small and medium-sized enterprises] and ease of doing business are high,” the report found. “They are also able to draw from enabling resources, including access to capital, financial services and academic programs.” </p>

      <p>Based on the three factors, each country was given a score out of 100, with higher numbers indicating a better environment for female entrepreneurs. The U.S. is in the lead for the first time with a score of 70.3 because of an increased rate of women business owners compared to 2018. New Zealand was marked by very supportive entrepreneurial conditions — around three of every 10 business owners are female. Canada is the best country for access to financial services and products and quality of governance. In contrast, the lowest ranked countries were Egypt (35.7), Bangladesh (35.9) and Algeria (39).</p>

      <p>The researchers also ranked each country on just the percentage of female entrepreneurs, excluding the qualitative factors. They found that the rate is not always correlated to the country’s wealth. In fact, it found that Uganda, Ghana and Botswana were the top three countries for women business ownership rates because, “women in these markets are deemed as ‘necessity-driven’ entrepreneurs, spurred by a need for survival despite their lack of financial capital and access to enabling services.” They found that women are achieving gender parity for entrepreneurial activity in Ecuador, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda. </p>
      <p>“With this study, we are shining a light on those under-represented because, even today, inequality and exclusion still hold women back,” said Ann Cairns, the executive vice chairman of Mastercard. “Now is the time for governments and organizations to power together to support women to advance their businesses by eradicating gender-bias and ensuring greater access to education and financial inclusion.”</p>
