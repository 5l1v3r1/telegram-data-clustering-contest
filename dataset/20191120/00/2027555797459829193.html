      <h1>KPL fixing: Notices issued to KSCA, all 7 teams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:05:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/umesh-r-yadav" target="_blank">Umesh R Yadav</a></address>
      <p>The Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Tuesday issued notices to the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) and the seven teams involved in the embattled Karnataka Premier League (KPL), seeking complete details of the tournament.</p>
      <p>This move comes after two KPL teams and their team owners were pulled up for spot-fixing and betting. Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (Crime), said a more thorough investigation is lined up since the involvement of a ‘few teams and coaches’ came to light after the initial inquiry.</p>
      <p>KSCA and KPL teams have been sent a notice with 18 points, but a time frame for the response was not revealed by the police.</p>
      <p>Last month, Belagavi Panthers owner Ali Asfak Thara was arrested for his involvement in fixing and an international betting scam. The police also issued a notice to the Ballari Tuskers’ owner Arvind Venkatesh Reddy after his role in the scam came to light.</p>
      <p>A Lookout Circular (LOC) was issued in his name after it was discovered that he was travelling abroad.</p>
      <p>In what has come as a jolt to the KSCA, the CCB police have thus far arrested seven people in association with the case, including former Karnataka skipper C M Gautam.</p>
      <p>Abrar Kazi, Nishant Singh Shekhawat, Vishwanathan, owner Ali Asfak, Bengaluru Blasters’ bowling coach Vinu Prasad and Bhuvanesh (a Ballari Tuskers drummer) were the six others arrested.</p>
      <p>K C Cariappa was the latest name to do the rounds after he was called up for interrogation last week.</p>
      <p>“We will arrest them only when we have credible evidence and findings against them,” Patil added.</p>
      <p>A senior police officer said, “In the notices, we asked KSCA and other seven KPL team managements to provide detailed information about the transactions between the team franchise, names of all the players in the teams with their residential addresses with phone numbers and financial details about how much they were auctioned for.</p>
      <p>“All the umpires, television crew, batting and bowling coaches of the team, score sheets of each match and scores and wickets taken by the players, video footage of all the matches have been sought.”</p>
      <p>Sources from the KSCA told DH that they have been cooperating with the investigation by providing the necessary details, and have suspended players and others who were arrested.</p>
