      <h1>Ratings: 'The Voice' Reclaims Monday's Demo With No New '9-1-1' as Competition</h1>
      <h2>CBS comedies “The Neighborhood” and “Bob Hearts Abishola” hit season highs in viewers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:42:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/jennifer-maas/" target="_blank">Jennifer Maas</a></address>
      <p>NBC’s “The Voice” is back on top as the king of Monday primetime thanks to Fox’s decision to air back-to-back reruns of “9-1-1” and “Prodigal Son” last night, instead of new episodes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, CBS’ freshman comedy “Bob Hearts Abishola” and sophomore sitcom “The Neighborhood” both hit season highs in total viewers, while the Max Greenfield-led series also scored its highest rating for Season 2 in the key adults 18-49 range.</p>
      <p>NBC was first in ratings with a 1.0/4 in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and second in total viewers with an average of 6.3 million, according to preliminary numbers. At 8 p.m., “The Voice” Top 13 performances episode scored a 1.2/5 and 7.7 million viewers. “Bluff City Law” at 10 settled for a 0.5/3 and 3.6 million viewers.</p>
