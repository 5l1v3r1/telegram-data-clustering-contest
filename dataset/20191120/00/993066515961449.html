      <p>A biography of the victims of Jack the Ripper has won a major literary award.</p>
      <p>Hallie Rubenhold’s The Five has been awarded the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction, organisers announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The British historian takes home £50,00 for winning the award, with chair of judges and editor of The Times Literary Supplement Stig Abell describing The Five as “brilliantly written and “brilliantly researched”.</p>
      <p>He added: “It’s a great story and it’s a great moral act, reclaiming the voice of these women.”</p>

      <p>Rubenhold’s book examines the lives of the five women – Mary Ann “Polly” Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly – considered the “canonical” victims of the serial killer.</p>
      <p>Rubenhold said she wanted to untangle the “web of assumptions, rumour and unfounded speculation” surrounding the women, who were all murdered by in London in 1888.</p>
      <p>She found there was no evidence that three of the women were sex workers, despite the widely held belief the ripper targeted prostitutes.</p>
      <p>“These were ordinary people, like you and I, who happened to fall upon hard times,” the winning author said.</p>

      <p>“There’s so much in their stories that we can take away that tells us about how we live today: everything from homelessness to addiction to domestic violence. And people become victims because society doesn’t care about them.”</p>
      <p>Rubenhold is the seventh woman to win the Baillie Gifford Prize, formerly the Samuel Johnson Prize, since it began in 1999.</p>
      <p>The other shortlisted books were Casey Cep’s Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud, And The Last Trial Of Harper Lee, Laura Cumming’s On Chapel Sands, William Feaver’s  The Lives Of Lucian Freud: Youth, Julia Lovell’s Maoism: A Global History and Azadeh Moaveni’s Guest House For Young Widows.</p>
