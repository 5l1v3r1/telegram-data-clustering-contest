      <p>OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) - Ottawa Senators forward Bobby Ryan will be away from the team indefinitely while taking part in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>/National Hockey League Players’ Association assistance program.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> and NHLPA made the announcement Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Senators issued a statement from general manager Pierre Dorion saying, “Bobby is an important member of the Ottawa Senators family and he has our full support as he tends to this matter.”</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Ryan did not play for Ottawa in a victory in Detroit on Tuesday, one day after leaving practice early because he was not feeling well, according to coach D.J. Smith.</p>
      <p>The No. 2 overall pick by Anaheim in the 2005 draft, Ryan has one goal and three assists in 16 games this season.</p>

      <p>The Senators acquired Ryan in a trade with Anaheim in July 2013, on the same day they lost franchise player Daniel Alfredsson to the Detroit Red Wings in free agency.</p>
