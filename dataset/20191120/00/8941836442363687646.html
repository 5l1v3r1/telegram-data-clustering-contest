      <p>CRATER LAKE, Ore. (AP) - Officials say the Army Corps of Engineers Road System at Crater Lake National Park is among Oregon’s latest entries in the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
      <p>Park officials said Tuesday that the National Park Service accepted the nomination Aug. 12.</p>
      <p>The nomination centered on a previously little-known effort by the Army Corps of Engineers in highway engineering and construction that happened from 1910 to 1919 in the park.</p>
      <p>The Army Corps of Engineers Road System, a precursor to the historic Rim Drive, is significant for its association with the earliest period of highway engineering in Oregon.</p>
      <p>The road system was the first federally funded and supervised highway project in Oregon and is the only road project in Oregon attributed to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
