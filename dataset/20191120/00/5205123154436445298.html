      <p>The victim was reportedly walking taking her own dogs for a walk at the time.</p>
      <p>It's also been claimed that the woman had phoned her partner, saying he was worried about a number of "threatening dogs" that she'd spotted on her walk.</p>
      <p>It was her partner who tragically made the grizzly discovery having gone in search of her following the phone call.</p>
      <p>The police have launched an investigation into manslaughter by dog attack.</p>
      <p>A total of 93 dogs have been taken in for tests, including some hounds from the hunt and five dogs belonging to the woman herself, to try to establish which ones attacked her.</p>
      <p>President of the an animal welfare foundation, Brigitte Bardot said she was deeply shocked to hear about the case, and urgently pushed for a suspension of "all hunt authorisation for this season."</p>
      <p>However, the French hunting association, which has around30,000 hunt hounds in total, released a statement saying that "nothing shows the involvement of hunting hounds in the death of this woman.</p>
      <p>They also said that "these dogs are trained to hunt a particular animal and obey man in all circumstances."</p>
