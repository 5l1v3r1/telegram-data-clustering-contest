      <h2>The bank is accused of violating the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act 23 million times</h2>

      <p>Australian banking giant Westpac faces a massive fine after being accused by regulators Wednesday of “serious and systemic” breaches of money-laundering laws involving more than US$7 billion.</p>
      <p>Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, said it had taken legal action against Westpac for its failure to report more than 19.5 million international fund transfers, including “high-risk transactions” to Southeast Asian nations potentially linked to child exploitation.</p>
      <p>Overall, AUSTRAC chief Nicole Rose said, Westpac violated the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing act 23 million times.</p>
      <p>She did not comment on the amount of a potential penalty, saying it was a matter for the courts.</p>
      <p>But in its submission to the Federal Court, AUSTRAC noted that each of the 23 million breaches attracts a civil penalty of “between A$17 million and $21 million” – theoretically putting the bank on the hook for up to $483 trillion (US$330 trillion) in fines.</p>
      <p>The global economy was worth almost US$86 trillion in 2018, according to the World Bank.</p>
      <p>Australia’s largest lender, the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), last year faced a theoretical maximum fine of A$1 trillion after AUSTRAC found it had failed to report on 53,500 transactions, a small portion of the alleged breaches by Westpac. The CBA ended up negotiating an A$700 million settlement.</p>
      <p>The AUSTRAC action knocked nearly 3% off Westpac shares.</p>
      <p>In a statement Tuesday, Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer acknowledged the “serious” nature of the issues raised by AUSTRAC and said the bank was working with the regulator to correct its procedures.</p>
      <p>“These issues should never have occurred and should have been identified and rectified sooner,” he said in a statement. “It is disappointing that we have not met our own standards as well as regulatory expectations and requirements.”</p>
      <p>But Hartzer also said many of the transfers cited by AUSTRAC as unreported were “recurring, low-value payments” from foreign government pension funds to people living in Australia.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who leads a conservative, pro-business government, said he was “appalled” by the allegations against Westpac and said Australia’s banks need to “lift their game.”</p>
      <p>Rose told a news conference that Westpac’s failures “resulted in serious and systemic non-compliance” with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.</p>
      <p>She said the unreported transactions amounted to more than A$11 billion (US$7 billion) from 2013 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Westpac “failed to appropriately assess and monitor the ongoing money-laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with the movement of money into and out of Australia through correspondent banking relationships,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This resulted in a significant loss of intelligence to AUSTRAC and our national security and law enforcement partners,” she added.</p>
      <p>Rose said the breaches involved more than 19.5 million transactions, including “high-risk transactions to the Philippines and Southeast Asia concerning known financial indicators relating to potential child exploitation risks.”</p>
      <p>The AUSTRAC action added to a host of problems challenging Australia’s banking industry, one of the world’s most profitable.</p>
      <p>The country’s four biggest banks – CBA, Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ – were the target of a royal commission of inquiry that early this year exposed rampant malpractice across the sector.</p>
      <p>It found banks had charged fees to dead people and for no services at all, used aggressive selling tactics and provided poor advice that led to significant financial upheaval for clients.</p>
      <p>All the banks have reported significant hits to profits as they reimburse hundreds of millions of dollars to wronged customers.</p>
