      <p>Former President of Ghana, John Mahama, has appealed to the administration of President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/15/border-closure-nigeria-benin-niger-set-up-joint-border-patrol/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a> to reopen Nigeria borders.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> recalls that Buhari, in August, had ordered the closure of land borders partially, saying the action will check smuggling activities.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the 7th-anniversary lecture, investiture into The Realnews Hall of Fame and the unveiling of a book: ‘Pathways to Political and Economic Development of Africa in Lagos’, Mahama said reopening the borders will allow economic activities can resume in West Africa.</p>
      <p>He said the closure of borders affecting many small and medium businesses especially in Togo, Ghana and Cote D’Ivoire that relied on inter-country trade.</p>
      <p>“<i>I am sure that businesses in Nigeria that rely on supplies from these countries are also suffering,”</i> he said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“With the signing of the joint border task force agreement between Nigeria and her neighbours, I will like to take this opportunity to appeal to Nigeria to open up her border so that economic activities can resume.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>According to NAN, Mahama noted that it was not by accident that Nigeria is home to the headquarters of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/border-closure-ecowas-countries-ban-sale-of-nigerian-goods/"><u><b>Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS)</b></u></a> and the largest economy in West Africa.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Integrated economic activities as envisaged in the area revolve around but are not limited to industry, transport, telecommunications, energy, agriculture, natural resources, commerce, monetary and financial issues, social as well as cultural matters.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Back home in Ghana, I also look forward to our government’s intervention that brings an immediate cessation to the forceful and illegal closure of shops of foreigners, especially Nigerians, by members of the local trade associations,”</i> he added.</p>
