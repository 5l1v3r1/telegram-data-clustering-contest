      <p>For a child to evolve into a financially savvy adult, it is important for parents to talk to him about money. While most parents are adept at introducing kids to the basics of saving and spending, they are often caught on the wrong foot when it comes to talking about financial problems. <br/><br/><b><u>Here’s how to deal with the situation: <br/></u></b><br/><b>Consider child’s age &amp; maturity</b> <br/>You are the best judge of your child’s ability to tackle the problem—is she old enough to understand it and mature enough to process it correctly? Sometimes, kids interpret the issue wrongly, exaggerating it or blaming themselves for it. This could lead to unnecessary anxiety and stress, which the child may not be able to express or share with anyone. Worse, she could carry the anxiety into adulthood. For instance, if you have defaulted on a loan repayment and have been hounded by the bank, the child may become averse to taking loans as an adult. <br/><br/><b>Be optimistic</b> <br/>Whatever the nature of financial problem, a positive approach will help ward off anxiety in children. In fact, a crisis is often a good time to teach the children about budgeting, frugality and financial discipline. For instance, if you have suffered huge losses in your business or one of the spouses needs to quit working, resulting in a tighter cash flow, calmly explain the situation to the kids. Then invite suggestions on how they can contribute to the ongoing crisis or help curb the spending. If you simply vent your frustration about a situation to which a child can offer no solution, you are only passing on your stress to the kid. <br/><br/><br/><b>Don’t lie to kids</b> <br/>It is never a good idea to hide financial problems from children. By the age of 12, most kids are aware of the family’s financial standing and are often smart enough to sniff out any money-related stress. So if you are facing a crisis that is likely to be temporary, say, a job loss, inform the kids without alarming them and ensuring that it will be resolved as soon as you find new employment. This will not only put the children at ease, but also help you impose budgetary restrictions without having to hide the reason, and teach them how to deal with financial emergencies later on in life. <br/><br/><b>Don’t fight or blame the spouse</b> <br/>If you are facing a financial dilemma, make sure the kids don’t find out about it during a fight with the spouse. Similarly, ensure that you don’t blame the partner for any financial crisis that you are going through. This will not only send out negative signals about how to deal with the specific financial situation, but also impact their relationships later on in life. The best option is to talk to them as a couple and explain how you are trying to resolve it together.</p>
