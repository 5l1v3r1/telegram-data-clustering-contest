      <h1>Doctors Have Placed Humans in Suspended Animation For The First Time, Report Claims</h1>

      <p>A team of doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have placed humans in "suspended animation" for the first time as part of a trial that could enable health professionals to fix traumatic injuries such as a gunshot or stab wound that would otherwise end in death, according to a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224004-exclusive-humans-placed-in-suspended-animation-for-the-first-time/"><i>New Scientist</i> exclusive</a>.</p>
      <p>Suspended animation - or "emergency preservation resuscitation," in medical parlance - involves rapidly cooling a patient's body down to ten to 15 degrees Celsius (50 to 59 Fahrenheit) by replacing their blood with an ice-cold salt solution.</p>
      <p>This slows down brain activity enough to buy the surgeons time - a couple of hours - to conduct life-saving surgeries.</p>
      <p>That's because oxygen is no longer being carried to the brain, thereby stopping energy production. Without cooling, even five minutes without brain functions can cause irreversible damage.</p>
      <p>After the operation, the patient's body is warmed up again and the heart is restarted.</p>
      <p>The team got permission by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to carry out the trial even without the patient's consent, as there is no alternative treatment available.</p>
      <p>A cautionary note: the team has yet to announce the results of the trial - or if any of the patients even survived the ordeal.</p>
      <p>Lead researcher Samuel Tisherman told <i>New Scientist </i>that he's hoping to announce the results by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>"Once we can prove it works here, we can expand the utility of this technique to help patients survive that otherwise would not," Tisherman said.</p>
