      <h3>RACE 1 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) AUGUST LEAVES</b> showed good improvement last time out and is clearly suited to this distance. A big winning chance.</p>
      <p><b>(4) CONGO COMPAQ</b> has been close-up in his last two starts and can go close again.</p>
      <p><b>(1) KURSK</b> has been disappointing in his last two starts but could improve with Anton Marcus in the irons.</p>
      <p><b>(2) JJ THE WOLF</b> returns from a break and needs to find a few lengths but should be in it.</p>
      <h3>RACE 2 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) HOW I WONDER</b> returns from a break and has been gelded. He can improve.</p>
      <p><b>(3) SMART WILLIAM</b> showed promise on his debut and could improve over this longer distance.</p>
      <p><b>(4) HAPPY WANDERER</b> returns after being gelded and could improve.</p>
      <p><b>(5) ALPHA PAPPA</b> was narrowly beaten in his latest start and can go close again.</p>
      <p><b>(7) ZENO</b> has a chance.</p>
      <h3>RACE 3 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) SAVEA</b> won well last time out and must be given respect over a course and distance that clearly suits.</p>
      <p><b>(3) BRAVE TIGER</b> is holding form and can contest the finish.</p>
      <p><b>(4) REGIMENTAL</b> is better than his last run and won nicely on debut.</p>
      <p><b>(5) AQUA BOLT</b> has improved with blinkers and should fight out the finish.</p>
      <h3>RACE 4 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) MISS HONEY</b> and <b>(4) VANDAH'S SPIRIT</b> probably needed their last runs and can improve.</p>
      <p><b>(5) ALSFLAMINGBEAUTY</b> has been consistent lately and could finish in the money again.</p>
      <p><b>(7) IKEBANA</b> is holding form and can earn.</p>
      <p>Respect <b>(8) MISSISIPPI BURNING</b>.</p>
      <h3>RACE 5 (1,400M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) PADRE PIO</b> needed his local debut and could do a lot better with Marcus aboard.</p>
      <p><b>(2) SOVEREIGN SPIRIT</b> is on the rise and is looking for a hat-trick of wins but is returning from a break.</p>
      <p><b>(3) WATING FOR RAIN</b> won nicely last time out but appears to be tackling stronger opposition.</p>
      <p><b>(5) SPECTRA FORCE</b> is holding form and is not out of it.</p>
      <p><b>(6) CLOUDED HILL</b> can go close.</p>
      <h3>RACE 6 (1,600M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) LATE AT NIGHT </b>may have just needed his last run and could be fitter this time.</p>
      <p><b>(2) SIX DEGREES</b> needs to do more to win but could finish in the money.</p>
      <p><b>(3) GOLDEN DUCAT</b> is a good horse that is improving and should have a big chance of following up on his maiden victory.</p>
      <p><b>(5) PINKERTON</b> was full of running when breaking his maiden tag and can go close.</p>
