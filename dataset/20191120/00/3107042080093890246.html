      <p>''I'm pretty sure we can't have a super over in a test match,'' Trent Boult quipped yesterday when asked if it was New Zealand's time to shine.</p>
      <p>England edged the Black Caps in the World Cup final on a boundary countback after a dramatic tied match followed by a tense tied super over.</p>

      <p>Then earlier this month England clinched the twenty20 series 3-2 with a super over win in the decider. It is still a sensitive topic for the Black Caps, who will be hoping victory will not be snatched away late again anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Boult can be sure there will not be a super over but he cannot be sure who will partner him with the new ball when the first test against England at Bay Oval gets under way in Mount Maunganui tomorrow.</p>
      <p>How the pitch plays is another unknown. The venue is making its test debut.</p>
      <p>''It is a little bit of the unknown, really,'' Boult said.</p>
      <p>''It is a pitch that hasn't gone five days before.</p>
      <p>''They've played a handful of first-class matches here before. I was a part of one [recently].</p>

      <p>''Hey, it is a good wicket. Most wickets these days are very good and I know the ground staff are looking for a good wicket that is going to be a good battle between bat and ball and a wicket that goes the full five days.''</p>
      <p>Boult, Tim Southee and Neil Wagner have teamed up for the past seven home tests and the trio has enjoyed tremendous success.</p>
      <p>They have captured more than 100 wickets among them and guided New Zealand to five wins and two draws during that time.</p>
      <p>But the form of Lockie Ferguson at the World Cup means it is becoming increasing difficult to leave him out of the test XI.</p>
      <p>Boult, however, appeared to urged caution about breaking up the band.</p>
      <p>''We've got a very good record at home. I think we've lost one test match in the last 15 and that is probably testament to the way the bowlers have stuck at it.</p>
      <p>''For New Zealand cricket to have the stocks that we have is exciting. We've got guys that can cover everything from 150kmh to guys that can swing the ball around in the air.''</p>
      <p>Getting that ball to hoop has been a big challenge in the past few years. He said the Kookaburra ball ''doesn't do too much'' but ''I think we've got an attack that is well-balanced and very experienced and very clear on how they can generate 20 wickets no matter whether the ball is swinging or is not swinging''.</p>
      <p>''We need to get these guys out to generate a result and we are looking forward to that challenge.''</p>
