      <h1>Ex-Poly Prep student claims he was sexually abused by Latin teacher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:30:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Denney and Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>A former student at Brooklyn’s tony Poly Prep Country Day School filed a lawsuit against the school claiming he was sexually abused by a teacher and witnessed other abuse that was covered up.</p>
      <p>The former student, who was identified as John Doe in the court documents, claims in the suit that longtime Latin teacher John Miller sexually abused him on a number of occasions from 1974 to 1976.</p>
      <p>During his junior year of high school, Miller — who was also an Episcopal priest — asked the boy to stay after class, shoved him against a wall and pressed up against his private parts, the suit in Brooklyn supreme court alleges.</p>
      <p>Terrified, the boy began to cry — and Miller responded by forcibly kissing him and licking his tears off his face, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>On another occasion, Miller, who is no longer alive, invited the boy to the Yale Club in Manhattan to discuss a college recommendation letter, the suit states.</p>
      <p>He then brought the boy to his Park Avenue apartment and tried to coerce him into sex, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>“Miller made aggressive advances and tried to have oral sex with Doe,” the suit states.</p>
      <p>The defendant also claims he witnessed abuse by football coach Phillip Foglietta, <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/02/22/brooklyns-poly-prep-apologizes-for-decades-of-sexual-abuse/">who was at the center of a previous sexual abuse lawsuit</a> brought against the school.</p>
      <p>The man claims that while he was on the football team, Foglietta groped and abused children in plain sight to brag that he could get away with it.</p>
      <p>In one instance, Foglietta groped a boy in front of the defendant while giving him “defiant” stares, which he “understood to mean, ‘What the fuck are you going to do about it’?” the suit says.</p>
      <p>Poly Prep did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
