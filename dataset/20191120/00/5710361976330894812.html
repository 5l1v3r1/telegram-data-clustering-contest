      <h1>Dollar rises as U.S.-China relations worsen over Hong Kong and tariffs</h1>

      <p>By Elizabeth Howcroft</p>
      <p>(Reuters) - The dollar rose on Wednesday and trade-exposed currencies fell after the U.S. president threatened a trade war escalation and China condemned a U.S. senate measure backing pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>China's yuan slipped to a new two-week low in overnight trading after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to raise new tariffs on Chinese imports if ongoing trade negotiations fail.</p>
      <p>China condemned the U.S. legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong, saying that the U.S. should stop interfering.</p>
      <p>After four days of falling, the dollar was up 0.1% against both the euro (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">EUR=EBS</a>) and a basket of currencies. (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar">DXY</a>)</p>
      <p>"Today the main focus is the trade talks between China and the U.S. and we are seeing risk aversion," said Piotr Matys, currency strategist at Rabobank.</p>
      <p>Matys said that the U.S. senate's bill in support of Hong Kong could complicate progress towards a preliminary trade deal.</p>
      <p>Markets had hoped that a partial trade deal to end the 16-month U.S.-China trade war could be signed at a summit in Chile, which was scheduled for mid-November. The summit was cancelled, leaving the outlook for a deal unclear.</p>
      <p>Adam Cole, chief currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets said that a preliminary "phase one" trade deal could be reached by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>"The prospect of a broader more all-encompassing deal will drag on well into next year," he added.</p>
      <p>"The market is worrying (about) this sort of exogenous shock to the process by the build-up of tension in Hong Kong - I ultimately doubt that either side will allow that to delay the process," Cole said.</p>
      <p>The Canadian dollar fell against the U.S. dollar to its lowest since Oct. 11 after a speech by the Bank of Canada's senior deputy governor boosted the perceived likelihood of a rate cut.</p>
      <p>Trade-exposed currencies took a hit from the worsening U.S.-China relations. The Australian and New Zealand dollars were both down 0.4% versus the U.S. dollar , .</p>
      <p>The Norwegian crown was down 0.9% versus the dollar and 0.7% versus the euro (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-nok">EURNOK=D3</a>).</p>
      <p>The Swedish crown tracked these losses, but to a lesser extent, down 0.4% versus the dollar and 0.7% versus the euro (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-sek">EURSEK=D3</a>).</p>
      <p>Demand for safe-have currencies was relatively unchanged, with the Japanese yen up around 0.1% against the dollar and the Swiss franc flat around 0.9905 .</p>
      <p>Minutes from the U.S. federal reserve's FOMC meeting in October are due at 19.00 GMT. Analysts expect little impact.</p>
