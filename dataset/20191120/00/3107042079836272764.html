      <p>The popular Templeton Community Centre is due for a spruce up over summer.</p>
      <p>But the city council is yet to confirm when the work will start.</p>
      <p>City council head of facilities, property and planning Bruce Rendall said the start date for the $110,000 project has not been finalised but the work is likely to take place early next year.</p>
      <p>“Council has an ongoing programme of repairs and renewals across its community facilities portfolio and one of the priority sites for 2019/2020 is this facility,” he said.</p>
      <p>The upgrade to the 16-year-old centre has been welcomed by the community.</p>
      <p>Templeton Residents’ Association secretary Jolene Eagar said it needs a tidy up as there are people practically using it daily.</p>
      <p>“There are so many community events happening in there, we have got marching girls, line-dancing, karate and martial arts. On Sunday, there is a church group that uses it. I know when the TRA needs it we have to book in advance,” she said.</p>
      <p>Proactive Martial Arts head instructor Allister Sutherland, who has been hiring the hall for the past 14 years, saidthe maintenance needs to be done and he hopes it can be completed as quickly as possible.</p>
