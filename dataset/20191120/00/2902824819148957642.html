      <h1>Ja Rule escapes punishment from $100m Fyre Festival class action lawsuit</h1>
      <h2>The Fyre Festival co-founder’s social media posts were not linked directly to ticket purchases, judge rules</h2>

      <p><a href="https://mixmag.net/read/ja-rule-new-music-festival-news">Ja Rule</a> has escaped punishment from a $100m <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/private-island-fyre-festival-for-sale-news">Fyre Festival</a> class action lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The case against Ja Rule, who co-founded the failed festival with Billy McFarland, was dropped on Monday by <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/new-york-rising-how-brooklyn-became-one-of-the-worlds-best-clubbing-destinations">New York City</a> southern district judge P Kevin Castel.</p>
      <p>The verdict comes after an appeal by Fyre attendees, who were disputing the claim that Ja Rule was unaware of the organisational mishaps plaguing the festival.</p>

      </p>
      <p>During the appeal, plaintiffs were unable to prove that repeated social media promotion across all of his pages led to them purchasing tickets.</p>
      <p>Ja Rule’s lawyer, speaking to <i><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/ja-rule-legally-cleared-in-fyre-festival-lawsuit">Complex</a></i>, described the verdict as “total vindication” for the rapper, whose real name is Jeffrey Atkins.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Billy McFarland has already been found guilty of wire fraud in 2018, subsequently being sentenced to six years in jail and a $25m fine.</p>
      <p>McFarland still remains a defendant in the $100m lawsuit.</p>
