      <p>"The system consists of <b>14 cameras on the playing field</b>. A high-resolution camera will be on the goal line. This system is connected to the referees and in less than a second the referees hear the word goal three times and the clock vibrates to indicate it. This is historic," he declared.</p>
      <p><b>Velasco Carballo also defended VAR.</b> "VAR, in technology, has failed zero times. Not once. The system has never stopped being available. <b>In 305 games there are more than 3,000 incidents</b> and all of them have been checked and there has been no problem. Yes, there were technological incidents, but then the support systems worked. All the passages of play could be checked," he said.</p>
