      <p>Eight-time Grammy winner Ziggy Marley and British folk darling Laura Marling have joined the 2020 Womadelaide line-up, along with 48 other additional acts.</p>
      <p>Marley is famously the son of reggae legend Bob Marley, but he’s had a well-documented career of his own, releasing eight albums with his band The Melody Makers and seven solo records.</p>
      <p>Marling, who led the mid-2000s nu-folk wave in the UK (alongside Noah and the Whale and Mumford &amp; Sons) will make her Womad debut with a stripped-back solo set.</p>
      <p>Other acts announced today are Brazil’s “king of samba rock” Jorge Ben Jor; Aussie vocalist Kate Miller-Heidke; Yorta Yorta rapper and multi-talent Briggs; Aussie rock trio Dyson Stringer Cloher; dance floor filler Late Night Tuff Guy; and Papua New Guinea-born powerhouse Ngaiire, whose striking live shows fuse fashion, art and music. Rounding out the local contingent are beatmaker Oisima and one of Adelaide’s busiest live acts, Dr Piffle &amp; the Burlap Band.</p>
      <p>This second line-up joins the <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/adelaide/entertainment/article/womadelaide-anounces-first-20-acts-2020">already announced</a> Aldous Harding, Mavis Staples, Bill Callahan, Hiatus Kaiyote and more.</p>
      <p><i>Womadelaide is on from March 6 to 9 at Botanic Park. <a href="https://www.womadelaide.com.au/lineup">Full line-up here</a></i>.</p>
