      <h1>Amazon Tackles Logitech Universal Remote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has thrown its name into the universal remote control ring taking on the likes of Logitech’s Harmony remote with its recently launched Fire TV Blaster.</p>
      <p>Due to be released in the US, Canada, UK and Germany on 11 December, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B075F9PYGR"><u>Amazon Fire TV Blaster</u></a> is available for preorder for $34.99 and requires a Fire TV device to operate.</p>
      <p>At this time, there is no information regarding Australian availability or pricing, though, considering the lack of Fire Stick TV devices sold in Australia, it does seem unlikely.</p>
      <p>The companion device is a tiny device at just over 2-inches tall that allows users to connect their compatible Audio Visual sources to the Amazon Fire TV Blaster to enable voice-controlled input switching for your TV and Fire Stick streaming device.</p>
      <p>Using your voice, you can operate compatible TVs, soundbars, satellite and cable boxes, and receivers from a range of different brands including Sony and LG.</p>
      <p>Though unlike the Logitech Harmony devices, Amazon cannot interact with non-compatible devices, with the Fire TV Blaster only able to communicate with and operate Alexa enabled devices.</p>

      <p>It should be noted, however, that the Amazon Fire TV Blaster does not have a built-in microphone or speaker, meaning users will need to ensure they have a compatible Alexa smart speaker for voice control to work.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the TV Blaster is not compatible with Fire TV Edition televisions or soundbars.</p>
      <p>Clearly out to compete with the likes of Logitech’s Harmony Remote, or even the <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/us600-highly-refined-smart-home-remote-unveiled/">Control4 Smart home controller</a>, the Amazon Fire TV Blaster represents a push by tech companies into universal remotes.</p>
      <p>Connected home products are experiencing tremendous growth, and by positioning your device in the centre of it all presents a substantial business opportunity for Amazon to control all the things in your smart home.</p>
      <p>While Logitech’s offerings are considerably more expensive with its flagship <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/harmony-elite?crid=60">Harmony Elite</a> remote costing upwards of AU$479.95, Amazon’s entrant into the market may bring down prices across the board.</p>
      <p>Though considering the Logitech devices work across Amazon, Google and even Siri with the Harmony iPad Base Charging Stand, you definitely get what you pay for.</p>
