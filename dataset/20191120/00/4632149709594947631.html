      <h1>BBMP says new plant will take care of city’s debris problem</h1>

      <p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is in the process of identifying a quarry in the south of the city to set up a processing plant for Construction and Demolition (C and D) waste. The agency says three processing plants for C and D waste will suffice for the city for at least a decade. <br/><br/>With less awareness about the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules 2016 and no proper mechanism to tackle the waste, it is usually dumped on the streets, lake beds, footpaths or parks. <br/><br/>According to sources, one of the regular spots for the dumping of the waste has been Kogilu Cross, Yelahanka. The spot was recently cleared by marshals so the contractors travel further to dispose of the waste. But nobody knows where this site is. The bulk generators, including the BBMP, do not know where contractors are dumping the waste. The responsibility to dispose of the waste generated by any project lies with the contractor. <br/><br/>However, according to sources, the waste generated even by the BBMP does not go to the processing unit. Currently, there is only one processing unit as identified by the BBMP -- Rock Crystal in Chikkajala with a capacity of 1,000 tonnes. Mayor Gautam Kumar Jain admits the waste does not go to the processing plant. “We are working on taking measures to sort the issue out soon,” he says. <br/><br/><br/>Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, solid waste management, says once another processing plant of 1,000-tonne capacity by the Rock Crystals comes up in Kannur, the total C&amp;D waste can be taken care of. “We are also planning to build another plant in the south. We are identifying a quarry to set up a processing plant. This should be sufficient to manage the C&amp;D waste of the city.” <br/><br/><b><u>BIDDING ON<br/></u></b><br/><i>* The BBMP had invited bidders for the collection and transportation of C and D Waste generated for a period of five years<br/>* The vendor is expected to provide online and phone-based service for booking a pickup of C and D waste and ensure prompt collection and transportation in covered dedicated trucks/tractors</i></p>
