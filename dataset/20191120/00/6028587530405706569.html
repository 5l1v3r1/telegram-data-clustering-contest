      <p><i>“Just start doing it. Build it, be scrappy, be humble, and see how it grows.”</i>Hannah Sieber is the co-founder and COO of Ecoflow, a company that designs, develops, and manufactures eco-friendly portable power stations. The company was featured on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in the energy sector. I sat down with Hannah to discuss her career path, the start of Ecoflow, and the advice she’d give to young entrepreneurs.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: You’re an entrepreneur many times over. How do you keep going when there’s no guarantee of success? What keeps you going?</p>
      <p><b>Hannah</b>: To be an entrepreneur you have to be incredibly optimistic and even, perhaps, slightly delusional. I believe that as a society and at EcoFlow, we can achieve a better future, so every day I wake up excited to help make that happen. I have a steadfast belief that at EcoFlow, we’re going to achieve our goal —  to make power more portable, eco friendly, and accessible to everyone around the world. </p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: After Duke, you started at The Parthenon Group [a consulting firm in Boston]. How did you get from there to here?</p>
      <p><b>Hannah:</b> At Duke I focused on academics and planned  to pursue a Ph.D. I was interested in understanding the rise of modern China, and I studied it through multiple disciplines—historical, political, and economic. I wrote my thesis on the role that human capital migration between China and the U.S. has on innovation and invention in China. If I had thought about it at the time, I would have realized I was interested in innovation and entrepreneurship. </p>
      <p>After Duke, I worked for The Parthenon Group and I was fortunate to work in both the Boston and Shanghai offices. Through this experience, I learned I wanted to be at the forefront of what was happening in China. There were so many exciting new inventions coming out of China—particularly in Shenzhen and Southern China. Ninety percent of the world’s electronics come from Shenzhen — the large majority of all phones, laptops, speakers, headphones, watches, drones. I started looking for opportunities to relocate to China full-time and was recruited by the San Francisco Center for Economic Development  (SFCED). They were interested in building an office in Shenzhen. (They already had offices in Beijing and Shanghai.) I moved to Shenzhen, built an office, hired a team and was working on cross-border investing and financing. </p>
      <p>I met my three co-founders in Shenzhen, all of whom at the time were working at DJI, the drone company.  One of the biggest challenges confronting the drone industry is battery life. For a consumer its less of an issue, however for enterprise applications like search and rescue or mapping, battery life is often the limiting constraint. We started thinking about solutions for drone pilots, who currently go into the field with a half-dozen batteries (expensive), use their car to recharge the drones (environmentally inefficient), or bring a fuel generator  (environmentally inefficient). In our research, we discovered there was a huge white space in the market for battery-powered solutions: there were large, fixed home solutions and small pocket-sized power solutions, but nothing in between. We founded Ecoflow to dethrone the fuel generator and revolutionize the market for affordable, portable, and eco friendly power. </p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: I love that you had a sense of what your interests were, but within those interests there were so many pivots in your journey. Can you share how important it is to be able to allow for that flexibility in your career flow? I see so many undergrads today think that they have to do this <i>one thing</i> or achieve <i>one thing</i>, and if they don’t, then they’re failures. But that’s not the reality. Can you speak to that?</p>
      <p><b>Hannah</b>: Some career paths will probably be a bit more linear—for example if you know you want to be a managing director at a large bank. But if you’re still discovering what you want to do, the best thing you can do is to make those pivots. They allow you to discover yourself.  I don’t think I’d be a successful entrepreneur today without the work I’ve had in management consulting and the nonprofit sector. Likewise, the experience of starting my own team and living abroad both set me up for success at Ecoflow.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: We’ve talked before about the power of mentors and the power of being a mentor. How does mentoring and being mentored factor into clarity on your career path and being successful throughout your career?</p>
      <p><b>Hannah</b>: Mentorship is fundamental to growth.  I have different relationships with many of my  mentors: I have mentors that challenge me, encourage me, and push me to consider different perspectives. I have a lot of female mentors, which has been helpful. I value having other women in this space that have been through common experiences—it brings a feeling of unity. </p>
      <p>I also love being a mentor and get a tremendous amount out of mentoring others. I’m still in contact with my Business Oriented Women’s club from Duke, and regularly have women from the club reach out to me for advice. I’m constantly learning about myself when I talk to them and help them think through their questions.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: When you took on Ecoflow, you guys [Hannah, along with her co-founders, Eli Harris, Fan Zheng, and Lei Wang] did something extraordinary. When you first started, you decided to do your initial funding efforts through crowdfunding instead of going through traditional investors. You had never done that before, but on your first go, you guys hit $1.25 million in funds.</p>
      <p><b>Hannah</b>: I’ll take you back to the beginning of Ecoflow. It was summer 2016 — we were building out our first product for EcoFlow on the nights and weekends while we worked other jobs during the day. Our goal was to be ready in time for CES, the largest consumer electronics show, which takes place in early January. In December we quit our jobs to work full-time on Ecoflow — and started working around-the-clock. I remember working until midnight on Christmas Day in order to get all our marketing materials ready. We received great initial feedback at CES, so we came back to Shenzhen and  spent the next few months preparing to launch our pre-order campaign. This involved shooting our product intro video and photo content, building our website, marketing and social media, finalizing the pricing of different SKUs, formalizing our warehouse and logistics processes, setting up an international corporate governance structure etc. Every day felt like a million new things that we’re all marked urgent. </p>
      <p>We launched our pre-order campaign four months after CES in mid-April of 2017. I had found a handful of other entrepreneurs in Shenzhen who had launched successful crowdfunding campaigns, and I had treated several of them to coffee and picked their brains about the best way to launch a pre-order campaign. Once we launched, it was unbelievable to see how many people were excited about our product. We had an amazing group of early evangelists and supporters — and we learned a lot about our customers from the campaign. Crowdfunding allowed us to cultivate early adopters, get customer feedback, and raise money. It also gave us the confidence and momentum to launch into retail.</p>

      <p><b>Sanyin</b>: I think, for a lot of us, when we enter into something—a new endeavor or launch—we feel that we need to have all the answers before we even start. And as much preparation as you did for four months, there was a part of you that was still learning. You were reaching out to people who had done it before. There’s an element of vulnerability in that, but you ultimately exceeded your crowdfunding goals. </p>
      <p>What advice would you give other young entrepreneurs who have recently graduated from college and wants to start on the entrepreneurship path? </p>
      <p><b>Hannah</b>: Start small. Right now, there’s a sense that entrepreneurship is about raising millions of dollars from venture capitalists and growing a company to become a billion-dollar unicorn. And, of course, that’s something none of us would turn down. But there’s a lot to be said for starting small and just <i>doing</i> it, doing the work of putting together the product or the prototype, getting some proof of concept for your idea. I sit on the board of an incredible non-profit called Bootstrap Business School, that runs courses on how to bootstrap a business — so people can launch quickly and cheaply without any equity or debt. I’m a huge fan of this model. I always encourage people to just start doing it. Build it, be scrappy, be humble, and see how it grows. </p>
