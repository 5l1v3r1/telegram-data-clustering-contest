      <p>The Ghana international comes fourth in the most tackles won in the Spanish league after an impressive start to the season.</p>
      <p>The 29-year old has won 21 tackles this season placing him the fourth in the list of hard working midfielders in Spain.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid defensive midfielder Casimero leads the pack with 28 duels won, followed closely by Celta Vigo's Hugo Malo.</p>
      <p>Wakaso comes fourth just one behind Vincente Iborra of Villareal.</p>
