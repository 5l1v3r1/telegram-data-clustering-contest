      <p>A number of Jamaicans surveyed in the capital city yesterday have given conditional agreement to the call by some Members of Parliament (MPs) that they deserve more pay.</p>
      <p>The <b>Jamaica Observer</b> sought the opinion of the public following this week's <b>Sunday Observer </b>lead story in which several MPs lamented that their monthly salary of approximately $300,000 cannot suffice, as they have to use the money to support their families and help their constituents.</p>
