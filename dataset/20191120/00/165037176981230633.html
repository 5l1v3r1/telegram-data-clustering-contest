        <b>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked as Tottenham manager on Tuesday, with captain Harry Kane writing a heartfelt tribute to the coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Tottenham captain Harry Kane thanked Mauricio Pochettino for helping him realise his dreams </b>following the Argentinian's sacking.</p>
      <p><b>Spurs sprung a surprise on Tuesday </b>when they announced Pochettino's five-and-a-half-year spell as manager had been ended.</p>
      <p>Pochettino had enjoyed a<b> fine spell at the club, transforming them into top-four regulars and taking Spurs to their first Champions League final</b> last season, ultimately losing 2-0 to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>But after a difficult start to the new campaign, claiming just <b>14 points from their first 12 matches</b>, chairman Daniel Levy made a drastic decision, with Spurs confirming Jose Mourinho as their new manager on Wednesday.</p>

      <p><b>There remains plenty of respect for Pochettino in the Spurs dressing room</b>, however, with skipper Kane the latest to pay tribute to ex-Southampton boss. </p>
      <p>"Gaffer. I'll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams," Kane wrote on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>"We've had some amazing moments in the last five and a half years that I will never forget.</p>
      <p>"You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship. Good luck with your next chapter!"</p>
