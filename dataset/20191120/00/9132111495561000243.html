      <p>Shaanxi Mining Company has refuted claims that over 60 people have died as a result of its operations in the Upper East region.</p>
      <p>According to the company, only 8 of its workers have lost their lives in the line of duty.</p>
      <p>There was a volcanic outpouring of rage Monday in Talensi, a district in the Region, over a fresh disaster that has claimed the lives of two Ghanaian employees of the mining company.</p>
      <p>Clarifying the issue on the Morning Starr Maxwell Wooma, PRO for the company said “safety is key when it comes to our mines. We expect that workers do not even lose their fingernails when they come to work. We are creating jobs and not setting a death trap for people. We do not plan accidents for our staff.”</p>
      <p>He stressed “we have a workforce we account for. Within the mines, we have about 8 workers who have lost their lives.”</p>
      <p>He entreated “we need to be careful in determining which death is ours and which aren’t ours because some people who have lost their lives around our mines are illegal miners and we do not account for them.”</p>
      <p>He however assured that whatever recommendations will be brought up to ensure safety will be taken very seriously.</p>
      <p>“Because our members died strictly in their line of duty, the work-man compensation law will be used to compensate the family. We will do the needful,” he added.</p>
