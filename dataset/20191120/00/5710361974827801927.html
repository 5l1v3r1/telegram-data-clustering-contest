      <h1>Opening Bell: Stocks Fall, Yields Tumble As U.S.-China Tensions Flare Up</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>U.S. futures, European stocks markedly in the red as China rebukes U.S. interference in Hong Kong turmoil</li>
        <li>Gold, yen and dollar all climb on risk off; yields tumble</li>
        <li>Australian shares take a hit from allegations of severe legal breaches against Westpac</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Key Events</h3>
      <p>Futures on the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures">S&amp;P 500</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30-futures">Dow</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nq-100-futures">NASDAQ 100</a> joined global stocks in a decline this morning after China <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/hong-kong-protests-beijing-condemns-bills-accuses-us-of-interference.html">rebuked</a> a unanimous U.S. Senate legislation supporting Hong Kong protestors, which further distanced an already elusive trade deal. Safe-haven assets all gained ground on renewed risk off, with Treasurys advancing alongside the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/us-dollar-index">dollar</a>, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-jpy">yen</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold">gold</a>.</p>
      <p>A standoff on the question of tariffs timing—with the U.S. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-threatens-to-raise-china-tariffs-if-no-trade-deal-2019-11-1028701809">tying any tariff rollback to a phase-one agreement</a>, and China wanting tariffs to be removed from the outset—became a lot more complicated after U.S. lawmakers intervened in what the Chinese government consider internal problems. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday it would be tough for the U.S. to seal a deal if the demonstrations in Hong Kong are met with violence.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a data miss on U.S. <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-retail-sales-63">core retail sales</a> indicated that a continuing economic expansion is far from being a foregone conclusion. Japanese figures this morning showing a tumble in <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/exports-995">exports</a> also underlined the global hit from the trade dispute.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the release later today of <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/fomc-meeting-minutes-108">minutes</a> from the last FOMC meeting may provide fresh insight into what the Federal Reserve makes of the current macro signals.</p>
      <p>Europe's <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/stoxx-600">STOXX 600</a> slid with oil producers and banks shares.</p>
      <p>In the earlier Asian session, Australia’s <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/aus-200">S&amp;P/ASX 200</a> (-1.35%) tumbled after Westpac (ASX:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/westpac-banking-corporation">WBC</a>) was accused of severely breaching anti money-laundering and terrorism financing laws. Given the country's heightened sensitivity to the U.S.-China trade spat—China being Australia's largest two-way trade partner—new threats from U.S. President Donald Tump to further hike levies on Chinese goods further soured the mood in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/hang-sen-40">Hang Seng</a> (-0.75%) also slid lower as the city's political turmoil kept monopolizing news headlines.</p>

        <b>NASDAQ Composite Daily Chart</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> and the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">Dow</a> closed lower after disappointing retail numbers, giving up fresh intraday records. Only the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">NASDAQ Composite</a> managed to hold onto gains to post a new record close.</p>

      <p>The yield on <a href="https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield">10-year</a> Treasurys fell for the third straight day to a three-week low today, slipping below the rising channel since the Oct. 6 low. Rates are now flirting with the 50 and 100 DMAs, heading back to the uptrend line since the Sept. 3 bottom. Both the MACD and the RSI are favoring that view.</p>

      <p>In safe-haven markets, risk-off concerns offset asset-price considerations: the dollar strengthened despite a rise in the Japanese yen, and gold advanced even against a more expensive dollar.</p>
