      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/3f3186c1a76d4e9e9c602eb93f2bd207">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Coach (Frank) Vogel came in here and said, ‘Congratulations,’ and I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers,” James said. “I really don’t know what to think about it. I just think it’s a pretty cool stat to know, and I’m glad it happened in a win.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>James has five triple-doubles in the Lakers’ last 10 games, getting four in victories.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Amazing,” Davis said. “To be able to do that against every team is something special. I mean, (it’s) trippy that he’s been playing for a long time, so it was a matter of time before it happened, but just a tribute to all his hard work.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>James is fifth in NBA history with 86 triple-doubles, but the four players in front of him — Oscar Robertson, Russell Westbrook, Lakers great Magic Johnson and Lakers assistant coach Jason Kidd — hadn’t done it against 30 teams. Kidd, who did it against 28 teams, has served as a role model for James’ efforts as a tall point guard.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“He’s just playing terrific basketball,” Vogel said. “For him to be doing what he’s doing in his 17th year is just nothing short of remarkable. There’s no reason to believe he can’t sustain that for the rest of the season and help us make a real strong playoff push.”</i>
