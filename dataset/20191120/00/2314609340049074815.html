      <h1>Call for better drug to be approved for sufferers of rare blood cancer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:45:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:45</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Layt</a></address>
      <p>Lara Chapman suffers from a rare type of cancer that causes her body to produce too much blood, and she’s joining calls for a drug that can effectively cure her disease to be approved in Australia.</p>
      <p>Polycythaemia vera (PV) causes an accumulation of red blood cells, white blood cells and plasma in a patient’s blood.</p>
      <p>Ms Chapman, 49, was first diagnosed with a milder form of the cancer back in 2008 when she was 38, and said it then progressed rapidly.</p>

      <p>“At one point I spent about three months straight incapacitated on the couch with severe headaches and a huge amount of fatigue,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I could barely think, because all the small blood vessels in my head were getting this thick blood pumping through.”</p>
      <p>In addition to bad headaches and crippling fatigue, PV sufferers are also prone to blood clots, which can pose a separate health risk.</p>
      <p>According to the Leukaemia Foundation, PV is diagnosed in an estimated 250 Australians each year, and is one of three types of blood cancers called MPNs.</p>

        <figcaption>Associate Professor Steven Lane says the longer-lasting the version of interferon, the greater the effect it appears to have on PV.</figcaption>

      <p>Standard treatment for the condition is old-fashioned bloodletting to help thin the blood, combined with drugs that target the bone marrow, where the cancer’s “stem cells” are located.</p>
      <p>Associate Professor Steven Lane, who is the head of QIMR Berghofer’s Cancer Program and a Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital clinical haematologist, said the current most effective drug on the market in Australia was a form of interferon, a protein-based anti-cancer drug.</p>
      <p>However, the form used most widely had to be taken up to three times a week, which, given the drug will often have to be used for the rest of the patient’s life, was not ideal.</p>
      <p>“A long-acting version of the drug has now been approved for use in Australia that only needs to be given once a week – we call it the long-acting version of the drug,” Dr Lane said.</p>
      <p>“There’s actually an even longer-acting version of the drug, an ultra-long-acting version, which has been approved in Europe but not Australia, and we’d like to see that approved here.”</p>
      <p>That’s because Dr Lane’s recent research into PV’s response to drug therapy found that, in mice, the longer-acting the version of interferon, the better the effect on reducing the cancer symptoms.</p>
      <p>“People need to remain on this drug for a long time, and it actually doesn’t usually start having an effect for six months,” he said.</p>

      <p>“And as you increase the duration of action of the drug, not only is it more convenient for the people who need to inject themselves with it, it appears to be more effective as well.”</p>
      <p>Ms Chapman switched to the long-acting version of interferon around a year ago, and said she finally felt a sudden improvement in her condition just three months ago, just ahead of her 50th birthday in December, and her daughter’s 21st.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve been living with this for 12 or 13 years, you sometimes forget what it’s like to feel normal,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I would love to get access to the ultra-long-acting version … it would be wonderful to have even fewer injections, and better control over the disease as well.”</p>
      <p>The QIMR research has been published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-019-0638-y"><i>Leukemia</i></a>.</p>
