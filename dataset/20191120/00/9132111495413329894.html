      <p>State Prosecutors have told an Accra Circuit court that investigations into the Menzgold scandal are at an advanced stage but will need time to commence trial.</p>
      <p>Menzgold CEO, Nana Appiah Mensah, popularly known as NAM1 and two of his relatives said to be at large are facing 61 charges including money laundering, unlawful deposit-taking and sale of minerals without a license.</p>
      <p>Nana Appiah Mensah is currently on bail.</p>
      <p>He had been in detention in Dubai since December 7, 2018, when he was arrested in that country on charges of defrauding a business partner.</p>
      <p>After months of legal tussle, he was released as prosecutors could not prove their case of fraud against him.</p>
      <p>ASP Sylvestre Asare informed the court Wednesday that the state would want a long adjournment preferably to January by which time it will be ideal for the trial to commence.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Harriet Akweley, however, had concerns as to why investigations were not thoroughly conducted before the accused was charged.</p>
      <p>ASP Asare said the state intended to once again amend the charge sheet but opted against it due to a fresh development. He assured the court investigations was at an advanced stage.</p>
      <p>The court said it could not grant an adjournment to January as it fixed December 23, as the next court date.</p>
