      <p>Pakistan captain Azhar Ali has high hopes for Naseem Shah as the 16-year-old prepares to make his Test debut against Australia.</p>
      <p>Azhar praised the seamer's technical abilities and mental strength after the teenager suffered a personal tragedy following the recent death of his mother.</p>
      <p>Although Pakistan's line-up for the clash at the Gabba is yet to be revealed, Azhar confirmed Naseem would be involved and he has high hopes for the youngster.</p>
      <p>"Not many players can be at that standard so early but there are exceptions and he is one of them," said the skipper ahead of the two-match series. </p>
      <p>"And hopefully – we are all looking forward to it – he can have a very successful career.</p>
      <p>"When I saw him first, I was so surprised. The control he had, the pace he had – and the temperament and the composure when he bowls is so exciting to see."</p>
      <p>Naseem, who is will become the youngest male Test debutant on Australian soil, played in a warm-up match in the aftermath of his mother's passing and Azhar paid credit to his courage.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, it was a hard time for him but he coped with it very nicely and he came out and bowled the very next day, which is very heartening," he said.</p>
      <p>"He is opening up a little bit. Obviously, when he came in to first-class cricket, he was a bit shy but now he is starting to enjoy it."</p>
      <p>Pakistan have not won a Test match in Australia since 1995 and have never triumphed in a series there in the longest format. </p>
