      <h1>Israel confirms strikes against military sites in Syria</h1>

      <p>Strikes were in response to the rockets fired at Israel<br/>State media earlier said Syrian anti-aircraft defenses intercepted a ‘heavy attack’ over the capital Damascus</p>
      <p>The Israeli army confirmed it carried out strikes on Syrian and Iranian “terror targets” near Damascus on Wednesday, in response to fire from Syria the day before.</p>
      <p>The Israel Defense Forces, who blamed Tuesday’s rockets on “an Iranian force,” said it holds Damascus responsible for attacks launched from Syria into its territory.</p>
      <p>Syria’s state media earlier said Syrian anti-aircraft defenses intercepted a “heavy attack” by Israeli warplanes over the capital in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Israel has carried out frequent air and missile strikes against Iranian targets inside Syria since the country descended into civil war in 2011, but rarely comments on them.</p>
      <p>“We just carried out wide-scale strikes of Iranian Quds Force &amp; Syrian Armed Forces targets in Syria in response to the rockets fired at Israel by an Iranian force in Syria last night,” the Israel Defense Forces tweeted.</p>
      <p>During the attack the Syrian government’s defense missile was fired “despite clear warnings to refrain from such fire,” it added. As a result, a number of Syrian aerial defense batteries were destroyed.</p>
      <p>“We hold the Syrian regime responsible for the actions that take place in Syrian territory and warn them against allowing further attacks against Israel,” the army said.</p>
      <p>“We will continue operating firmly and for as long as necessary against the Iranian entrenchment in Syria.”</p>
      <p>An AFP correspondent in Damascus heard several large explosions in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>“Our air defense confronted the heavy attack and intercepted the hostile missiles, and was able to destroy most of them before reaching their targets,” Syria’s SANA news agency quoted a military source as saying.</p>
      <p>SANA added that the aggression was carried out from “Lebanese and Palestinian territories.” Israel sometimes launches its attacks on Syria from planes flying over neighboring Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Triggered by the repression of demonstrations by President Bashar Assad, the Syrian conflict has been complicated by the involvement of foreign powers.</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s air raid comes a day after Israel’s defenses intercepted four rockets fired from Syria.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday’s rockets were fired from positions around the capital held by groups loyal to the Damascus government.</p>
      <p>The flare-up follows a major escalation in and around Gaza last week when Israel carried out the targeted killing of a top commander of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Damascus.</p>
      <p>The killing was accompanied by a second strike, unconfirmed by Israel, on an Islamic Jihad leader in Damascus that killed his son and another person.</p>
      <p>The hundreds of strikes carried out by Israel in Syria have mostly been against Iranian targets or positions of Iran’s Lebanese ally, Shiite militant group Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>Both are sworn enemies of the Jewish state and both have backed the Syrian president’s forces with advisers or fighters.</p>
      <p>The war in Syria has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions.</p>
