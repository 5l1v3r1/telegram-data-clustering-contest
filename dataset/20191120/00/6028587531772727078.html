      <p>Announcing Home Depot’s third-quarter 2019 results on November 19, CEO Craig Menear admitted the home improvement/DIY retailer <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2019/11/19/home-depots-numbers-dont-mean-what-you-think-they-mean/#7854855e3afb">hadn’t seen as much of a lift in sales as it had hoped for</a> because of issues with legacy technology.The company reported net income of $2.8 billion on revenue of $27.2 billion for the third quarter, up 3.5% from the prior year. It also projected overall sales growth of 1.8% for 2019 compared with a previous projection of 2.3%. In an analyst conference call, Menear said Home Depot’s digital plans were on track and delivering hoped-for benefits, but that returns from the investment would “take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.”</p>
      <p>It’s a setback for one of the most high-profile digital transformation initiatives in an industry whose economics have been turned upside down by the rise of online commerce.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2017, Home Depot unveiled a bold strategy to invest $11.1 billion over the following three years to transform itself into a more digital-centric retailer, with a goal of lifting revenues to $115 billion-$120 billion in 2020, up from $101 billion in 2017. Since then, it’s pushed forward on multiple fronts with its “One Home Depot” digital transformation strategy.</p>
      <p>The goal is to create a seamless experience for customers across its digital offerings and its 2,000-plus physical stores; break down internal data silos to get a clearer picture of customer activity; and create an even more efficient supply chain for the business. To speed up its digital shift, the company <a href="https://fortune.com/2018/04/18/home-depot-it-workers/">has committed to hiring 1,000 additional IT staff</a>, including software engineers, user-experience designers and product managers.</p>
      <p>Almost two years in, Home Depot has made substantial progress, but older tech infrastructure is clearly proving a drag on its efforts. The company didn’t return a request for comment, but in the analyst conference call Menear said that unwinding legacy technology “has proven more complex than originally anticipated.”</p>
      <p>Home Depot’s revamped B2B website, which targets professionals rather than part-time DIYers, is a notable area that’s been affected. The site’s ability to create more personalized experiences for users has helped boost Home Depot’s B2B sales, but further efforts to tailor the site’s offerings for the largest building contractors have been delayed because of unspecified problems with legacy systems.</p>
      <p>Allen Bonde, who heads digital transformation research at Forrester, says it’s not uncommon for large transformation projects that span several years to hit “bumps in the road” caused by legacy systems. Bonde adds that Home Depot deserves credit for taking a careful, multistage approach to turning itself into a more digital-centric retailer, starting with smaller projects like building a highly regarded mobile app for customers and then gradually scaling up to its latest mega-plan.</p>
      <p>Menear’s message that benefits from this strategy are coming, if somewhat later than expected, nevertheless failed to reassure investors, who sent Home Depot’s shares down 5.4% after its results were announced.</p>
