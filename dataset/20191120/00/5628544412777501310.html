      <h1>Globes Rules Two Popes Drama, will Netflix Power Through with Three in the Category?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.awardsdaily.com/author/admin/" target="_blank">Sasha Stone</a></address>
      <p>I didn’t realize it when I wrote the Ace Editors column but The Two Popes is going into drama, not comedy, at the Globes and at the Ace awards. That means, three of the four Netflix movies heading into the race will have to compete for the five slots at the Globes:</p>
      <p>The Irishman<br/>Marriage Story<br/>The Two Popes</p>
      <p>The comedy category will be free and clear for Dolemite is My Name to compete against Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Jojo Rabbit, which will end up there. That is going to be a blood bath. There is no other way to put it. But so is drama. Other potential comedy/musical titles – Rocketman, The Farewell, Booksmart, and Late Night.</p>
      <p>I think this is nonsense, by the way. The Two Popes should be in comedy.</p>
      <p>Other films that will head for the drama category, competing against Netflix would be:</p>
      <p>Joker<br/>Little Women<br/>1917<br/>Ford v Ferrari<br/>Just Mercy<br/>Hustlers<br/>Uncut Gems<br/>Queen &amp; Slim<br/>Waves<br/>Judy<br/>Bombshell<br/>Us<br/>Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood<br/>Motherless Brooklyn<br/>Dark Waters<br/>The Lighthouse<br/>Honey Boy<br/>The Peanut Butter Falcon</p>
      <p>This year is tough all the way around. Predicting is anyone’s game. We say that every year but this year it’s actually true.</p>
