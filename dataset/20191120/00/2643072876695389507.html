      <p>Obasanjo noted the need for youths across the African region to get mentorship from past leaders.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m not afraid of death at my age, God has favoured me and I appreciate God’s blessings on me over these years.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>”My concern over the years is to build leaders of Africa. My greatest concern is tomorrow and that tomorrow begins today.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The world today is in crisis; I believed that youths need interaction from leaders and learning from them. I want to be inspired at the end of this programme.</i>
