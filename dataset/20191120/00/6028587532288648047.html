      <h1>A New Designer Collaboration You Won’t Want to Miss</h1>

      <p>How can two distinctive brands, each with cult followings collaborate on a collection in which both of their styles not only mesh but bring out a sensibility that seems to effortless mix the two aesthetics? This is the case with the new 333 Collection by HOORSENBUHS x Spinelli Kilcollin exclusive collaboration.Robert Keith of Hoorsenbuhs initially thought of the idea. We noticed numerous clients wearing both collections,” partner Kether Parker explains. “We have always thought pieces from both lines looked great together. He realized that he hadn’t seen any high jewelry brands collaborating and this was something very interesting to him.” Keith initiated a conversation with the talent’s behind Spinelli Kilcollin. I interviewed creative director Dwyer Kilcollin to get the inside scoop on how it all came together in such a seamless melding of the two brands. </p>

        <b> Can you talk about how the idea was born?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“When Yves [Spinelli] and I meet clients, we also frequently notice they are wearing ours and Hoorsenbuhs together. We’ve been fans of the brand for ages. But it was actually Robert who thought of the collaboration. We were honored when the approached us. They had us over and we met the team and saw their Venice, California store and studio, had an epic creative meeting, and all sat together for an awesome vegan Thai lunch.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you come up with a collaboration that stayed true to both of your strong design identities?</b>
      </p>
      <p>“When we went in to meet at Hoorsenbuhs, Robert Keith and his creative team had already laid out a ton of possibilities for us to consider. We sifted through what they had and pretty quickly came up with the 3 silhouettes we wanted to make, One based on our Aquarius ring –the five band ring which launched our collection, and two based on their unisex and instantly recognizable link motif rings. Each silhouette used signature components from each brand, so the whole collection came together very naturally”</p>
      <p> <b>Are there variations in the three different silhouettes?</b></p>
      <p>When we finished the design process, we arrived at the three main silhouettes, each with three variations. Just then, Robert rolled up his sleeve to reveal a tattoo, “333” on his forearm! From there the collection name was born: the “333 collection” we all love that number.” </p>

        <b>Can you talk a bit about the design process?</b>
      </p>
      <p>”It was crazy how quickly the designs came together in that first meeting! After that, we brought sketches and photoshopped images to our design and fabrication teams and began ironing out the details. The next time we met in person was for pre-sales meetings In Tokyo, in New York, and Paris!”</p>
