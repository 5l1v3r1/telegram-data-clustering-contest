      <p>The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) Chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, has indicted some universities, teaching hospitals, Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) for allegedly padding their budgets with N18.9 billion.</p>
      <p>Some of those indicted are: the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (N1.1 billion); Federal Medical Centre, Bayelsa (N915 million); Nnamdi Azikwe University (N907 million); University of Jos (N896 million); University College Hospital Ibadan (N701 million); Usmanu Dan Fodiyo University (N636 million) and University of Ibadan (N558 million).</p>
      <p>Owasanoye said ICPC saved N2 billion by tracking 255 of 424 constituency projects.</p>

      <p>The agency chief recalled that in the past 10 months, the commission has recovered over 250 physical assets valued at N32 billion in seizures, interim forfeiture orders and final orders.</p>
      <p>He added that cash recoveries in interim and final orders in Naira and USD amounted to over N3 billion.</p>
      <p>The ICPC chairman urged President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend all indicted public officers under investigation.</p>
      <p>Owasanoye spoke on Tuesday at a National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in the Public Service and presentation of Public Service Integrity Award at the State House, Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said: “Part of our preliminary findings, the summary of which are included in a visual narrative in your folders, revealed gross abuse of personnel budget and inflation or padding of the nominal role. As at the time we went to press, we had covered about 300 MDAs and the amount inflated was about N12 billion.”</p>
