        <b>Ghana U-23 coach Ibrahim Tanko says the team has one more chance to reach the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year with a third place play off game clash against South Africa. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Ibrahim Tanko is confident the Black Meteors will grab the final ticket to Tokyo 2020 with victory against South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors failed to pick one of the two tickets available at the semifinal stage after suffering a penalty shoot out defeat to Ivory on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I want to congratulate Cote d’Ivoire who qualified to the final and got their qualification to the Olympics. Tonight we missed on penalties, but both teams have given a beautiful image of African football and we still have a chance of Olympic qualification with the ranking match," he said after the game.</p>
      <p>Youssouf Dao's double for Ivory Coast was canceled by Yaw Yeboah and Evans Mensah to force the game into extra time before the Ivorians won on penalties.</p>
      <p>Ghana will have to beat South Africa on Friday to secure the final ticket to next years Olympic games.</p>
      <p>Ghana has not qualified for the Olympics since Athens 2004.</p>
