      <p>Amazon's pre-Black Friday sales are still going, in anticipation of the proper deals kicking off this Friday. Today is a new day, and that means there are new deals to enjoy, so let's take a look at some of the savings you can grab today.</p>
      <p>Honestly there's not a lot right now, certainly not compared to the other tech brands who have kicked off their Black Friday deals with a bit more enthusiasm than Amazon, but there are still a few bits you can enjoy. We'll also update this post later today with any more interesting deals that pop up during the day, so make sure to check in this afternoon.</p>
