      <h1>Facebook’s Latest Changes: What Fundraisers Need To Know</h1>

      <p>With a doubt, Facebook fundraising had a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhessekiel/2019/09/19/at-2-billion-raised-facebook-fundraising-cant-be-ignored-by-nonprofits/#5411ac65af97">huge impact on peer-to-peer fundraising</a> in 2019.  And it doesn’t appear that trend will change in 2020. The social media giant <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/kicking-off-giving-season/">earlier this month announced new fundraising features</a> intended to generate more revenue for nonprofits and continue to strengthen Facebook’s grip on peer-to-peer fundraising. </p>
      <p>Among the array of tools added to the arsenal that have helped users raise more than $2 billion to date, Facebook is rolling out a livestream fundraising feature that will allow gaming creators to select causes for viewers to support – and give their viewers an opportunity to donate directly through the platform.</p>
      <p>This gives Facebook an entry into yet <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhessekiel/2018/11/05/livestream-fundraising-comes-of-age/#7888d0f95cbf">another fast-growing fundraising channel</a> – and sends a clear message to nonprofits, P2P fundraisers say.</p>
      <p>“Facebook fundraising is not going anywhere,” said <b>Nicole Dolan</b>, senior director of the Out of Darkness Walks, a peer-to-peer campaign for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. “It’s never too late to start. It’s a great means of raising funds, but also raising awareness because these fundraisers are showing up all across everyone’s feeds.”</p>
      <p>Dolan’s organization is one of a growing number of nonprofits that have been betting heavily on – and reaping the benefits of – fundraising on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The most engaged fundraisers for Out of Darkness Walks have traditionally been women in their 30s-50s – a demographic that also tends to be especially active on Facebook. Because of this, Dolan’s organization has been aggressively investing in Facebook advertising and strategic community engagement on the platform for several years.</p>
      <p>“This put us in a good position when Facebook fundraising rolled out in the summer of 2017,” Dolan says. “We consider ourselves to be early adopters of almost anything that will make it easier for folks to register, fundraise, or donate with us. So we immediately took the steps to accept donations via Facebook.”</p>
      <p>During its first month of Facebook fundraising in 2017, the organization brought in more than $100,000. By the end of its first year, it had raised $8 million.</p>
      <p>The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has since made additional investments – including partnering with Good United to help turn Facebook fundraisers into advocates and taking advantage of DonorDrive’s Facebook integration.</p>
      <p>These moves helped the organization raise more than $2.4 million in September – its highest Facebook fundraising month on record.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has the opportunity to set this integration up through their P2P platform, I’d highly recommend it,” Dolan said.</p>
      <p>The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention isn’t the only nonprofit that has been reporting explosive growth on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The Pan-Mass Challenge went all-in on Facebook for the first time in 2019 with breathtaking results. More than 42,000 donors raised nearly $2.8 million on Facebook. Of that total, more than 31,600 donors were new to the organization, said <b>David Hellman</b>, PMC’s senior vice president of operations.</p>
      <p>“There are many ways for your participants to leverage the Facebook platform,” Hellman says. “Support the deepest integration available to you.”</p>
      <p>Given these results – and the fact that Facebook’s presence will likely grow for at least the short term – we’re taking a deep dive into Facebook fundraising at the <a href="https://www.peertopeerforum.com/events-online-learning/conference/">2020 P2P Professional Forum Conference in Austin</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Jessica Bomberg</b>, associate director of peer-to-peer fundraising at No Kid Hungry, will join Dolan and Hellman to share their success stories and provide advice on how your peer-to-peer program can improve its Facebook fundraising results.</p>
      <p>No Kid Hungry – which has been able to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhessekiel/2019/09/19/at-2-billion-raised-facebook-fundraising-cant-be-ignored-by-nonprofits/#9972910af976">provide 100 million additional meals</a> to those in need via its own Facebook fundraising efforts – offers yet another example of how nonprofits are benefiting.</p>
      <p>It remains too early to say whether Facebook will produce a short-term bump – or whether its tools are here to stay.</p>
      <p>But, for now, nonprofits that raise money through P2P cannot ignore its importance.</p>
