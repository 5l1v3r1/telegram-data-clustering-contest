        <b>Joey Antipas said on Wednesday he was quitting as caretaker coach of Zimbabwe, one day after achieving the best result of his four months in charge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zimbabwe scored a <b>rare victory in neighbouring Zambia</b> on Tuesday with the 2-1 win placing them <b>second behind defending champions Algeria</b> in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group.</p>
      <p>In other matches under Antipas, <b>Zimbabwe drew with Botswana</b> in the Cup of Nations and recovered from a <b>shock loss in Somalia</b> to beat them on aggregate in a 2022 World Cup eliminator.</p>
      <p>He replaced fellow former international defender Sunday Chidzambwa, who quit after a <b>winless first round exit from the 2019 Cup of Nations in Egypt</b>.</p>
      <p>Antipas offered no reason for leaving, saying only that he was "<b>bowing out</b>", but Zimbabwe have time to weigh options with the next competitive match a 2022 World Cup qualifier in March.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe are ranked 29th in Africa and 117th in the world and have <b>generally underperformed</b> since the country gained independence 39 years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Burundi officials have defended coach Olivier Niyungeko after losses to the Central African Republic and Morocco in the Cup of Nations.</p>

      <p>"The problem is not coach <b>Olivier Niyungeko</b>, the <b>problem with the national team is complex</b>," an official said without giving further details.</p>
      <p>Niyungeko became a <b>national hero </b>last year when he guided the tiny central African country to the biennial <b>continental tournament for the first time</b>.</p>
      <p>But the '<b>Swallows' flopped last week</b>, losing 2-0 away to the Central African Republic and 3-0 at home to Morocco, who punished a series of defensive blunders.</p>
      <p>Already four points adrift of joint leaders Morocco and Mauritania, the odds are stacked against Burundi reaching successive Cup of Nations tournaments.</p>
      <p>Another coach under pressure is Ibrahim Kamara, whose star-stacked Ivory Coast side struggled to overcome Niger, then fell to Ethiopia, a country <b>ranked 95 places lower in the world</b>.</p>
      <p>Despite boasting a squad including Premier League trio Serge Aurier, Nicolas Pepe and Wilfried Zaha, the Ivorians missed a penalty before converting a second spot-kick to edge the Nigeriens.</p>
      <p>After Aurier scored early in Ethiopia, they conceded twice in 10 minutes to lose and leave <b>Kamara feeling uncomfortable while officials privately ponder hiring a foreign coach</b>.</p>
      <p>Before local Kamara was appointed, Ivory Coast hired numerous Europeans, including Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson, Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic and Frenchman Herve Renard.Â </p>
