      <p>Police have arrested eleven members of a group that purported to declare independence for the Volta Region and other parts of the country.</p>
      <p>A manhunt is still on for leader of the group, octogenarian, Charles Kormi Kudzodzi, Volta Regional Police PRO, Corporal Prince Dogbatse said.</p>
      <p>He, however, told AdomNews the spouse and daughter of Kudzodzi have been arrested among the eleven.</p>
      <p>The police called for calm among residents of the region and maintained that Volta Region and the other areas being purported to have been seceded remain a part of Ghana.</p>

        <b>Homeland Study Group Foundation</b>
      </p>
      <p>The group, Homeland Study Group Foundation has been advocating the independence of former Western Togoland made up of Volta Region, Oti Region and parts of the North East Region, Northern Region and Upper East Region.</p>
      <p>The region was a German colony but at the end of World War I, it was split in two and the Eastern side ceded to France and is present-day Togo.</p>
      <p>The Western side was a British protectorate and voted in a plebiscite in 1956 to join Ghana which was about to be granted independence by Britain.</p>
      <p>The Homeland Study Group Foundation argues that the agreement to join Ghana included forming a union in 50 years.</p>
      <p>They claim the said union was never formed so since 2007, the group has been championing separation from Ghana.</p>
      <p>Leaders of the group have been arrested in the past and released.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Reaction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Information Minister, Kojo Oppong Nkrumah has stressed the members of the group who took part in the illegal act [declaration of independence] would be dealt with per the laws of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the issue, outspoken MP for North Tongu in the Volta Region, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, described the separatist’s actions as a “comic relief” which “is no longer funny.”</p>
      <p>“Besides, it is totally unacceptable for a few secessionist elements without any mandate whatsoever, to purport to be speaking for an entire region and declaring independence on our behalf. Enough,” he wrote on Facebook.</p>
