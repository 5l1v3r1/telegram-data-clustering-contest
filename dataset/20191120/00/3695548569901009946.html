        <b>Maverick Vinales topped the final day of Valencia 2020 pre-season MotoGP testing by 0.164 seconds from fellow Yamaha rider Fabio Quartararo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a first hour without action, Honda's Stefan Bradl took to the circuit as well as KTM trio Pol Espargaro, Iker Lecuona (Tech3) and Brad Binder.</p>
      <p>Bradl was forced to park up after just a few corners after his 2020 Honda encountered a mechanical issue, with Marc Marquez also experiencing an issue with that bike later in the morning.</p>
      <p>Espargaro set the early pace at 1m32.080s on the '20 KTM, with Marquez taking over with a 1m30.950s on his first run on the '19 RC213V.</p>
      <p>As the second hour drew to a close, Petronas SRT's Franco Morbidelli went fastest with a 1m30.803s - though would be deposed around 30 minutes later by Marquez on the 2020 Honda he wrecked in a crash on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Moments later, the session was brought to a brief halt when Andrea Iannone's Aprilia caught fire on the way into Turn 1 and left fluid on the circuit.</p>
      <p>Marquez's 1m30.664s benchmark stood for almost an hour, before Tuesday pacesetter Fabio Quartararo assumed control of the timesheets with a 1m30.591s.</p>
      <p>Quartararo further improved to a 1m30.013s an hour later, which would not be toppled until the final 70 minutes, when Vinales dipped into the 1m29s for the first time this week with a 1m29.849s as he continued to test Yamaha's new engine and chassis.</p>
      <p>As Quartararo packed up with an hour still to go, Vinales would come under no threat before the chequered flag.</p>
      <p>Morbidelli was third to complete another Yamaha 1-2-3, while LCR Honda's Cal Crutchlow brushed off a late fall to end the day fourth, having spent Wednesday comparing the current and prototype versions of the RC213V - including a new aerodynamic fairing.</p>

      <p>Joan Mir led Suzuki team-mate Alex Rins in fifth, both putting more miles on the GSX-RR's new engine, with Marquez seventh in the end with a 1m30.556s set on the 2020-spec Honda - on which he also tested a new aero package.</p>
      <p>Pol Espargaro - who crashed at Turn 10 in the morning - the sister works Yamaha of Valentino Rossi and Pramac's Jack Miller, who trialled a new seat unit amongst other small items on his Ducati, rounded out the top 10.</p>
      <p>Andrea Dovizioso was Ducati's top works rider in 11th, while team-mate Danilo Petrucci opted to sit out Wednesday's running in order to recover from a shoulder issue that limited him to just 10 laps on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Honda's new signing Alex Marquez enjoyed a less complicated second day on the LCR-run 2019-spec RC213V, improving his lap time from Tuesday by six tenths to a 1m32.235s to end the test 20th after logging 76 laps.</p>
      <p>Fellow rookie Binder was last of the 22 riders present, some 2.5s off the pace, while Tech3 counterpart Lecuona once again led the debutants in 15th.</p>
