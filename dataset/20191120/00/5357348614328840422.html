      <p>MegaMart Wholesale Club on Monday celebrated its 20th anniversary with an impressive awards banquet at AC Kingston Hotel in New Kingston during which 68 members of staff were honoured for long service.</p>
      <p>Owner and conceptualiser of the chain Gassan Azan Jr, who was also recognised by his staff, thanked the 1,200 team members for their service and reminded them that MegaMart's 20 years of existence is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit of the team, which goes beyond policy.</p>
      <p>“It represents a determination to make something work against all odds,” Azan Jr said as he recalled that he and his partners had to absorb the full risk of the investment with the opening of the first MegaMart store in Portmore in 1999 at the height of the financial sector meltdown that ruined many businesses and individuals in Jamaica.</p>
      <p>“The outcome which we celebrate tonight confirmed our firm belief and approach that a recession can be used to the advantage of those willing to take risks and expand when others are pulling back,” Azan Jr said.</p>
      <p>He noted that after the concept of the wholesale membership shopping club was proven in Portmore, the chain added its Kingston store on Waterloo Road in 2004, after which it opened in Montego Bay in 2008, and in 2012 expanded to Mandeville.</p>
      <p>“MegaMart, like all other successful businesses, is built on the support of our customers, and so I would like to say a special thank you to all our loyal customers who have supported us over the years, across the length and breadth of Jamaica, beginning with the people of Portmore, whose initial support validated our idea,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The most critical component of our success, however, is our team. I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped to make this 20-year journey of MegaMart possible, including our past and present staff,” Azan Jr said.</p>
      <p>The keynote address was given by Prime Minister Andrew Holness, while GraceKennedy Group CEO Don Wehby made a special presentation from the group to Azan Jr.</p>
