        <b>Students at Best Care Special Education School in St Andrew are now the beneficiaries of an improved learning environment, following the completion of renovation work done with funding from Sagicor Foundation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The school, which serves children with developmental and learning disabilities, is operated by Best Care Foundation, a past beneficiary of Sagicor Sigma Corporate Run.</p>
      <p>The foundation received a total contribution of $4 million, the final instalment of which was used this year to complete upgrades at the school in time for the new academic year in September.</p>
      <p>In addition to a fresh paint job, general renovation of the building was carried out, including repairs to the ceilings and floors, bathroom upgrades and the partitioning of spaces to host an additional three classrooms, accommodating an increase in the school population from 50 to 112 students.</p>
      <p>Orville Johnson, chairman of Best Care Foundation, expressed gratitude to Sagicor Foundation for the contribution to the transformation of the institution.</p>
      <p>“We are very pleased that Sagicor was able to help us to fund the renovation of the property. It is an old property, so getting it to the state we wanted was always a work in progress. Now that our focus is on education, it was important that there were better facilities with respect to classroom spaces,” he said.</p>
      <p>Best Care Foundation, established in 1984, operated a children's home before transitioning to a school nine years ago.</p>
      <p>“The support we received allowed us to get a lot of work done and we are very grateful to Sagicor for it because we can feel and see the difference it has made for the students and teachers, and we are happy for that,” Johnson said.</p>
      <p>Alysia White, executive director, Sagicor Foundation, congratulated the institution on the completion of the renovation and the work it continues to do to support children with disabilities.</p>
      <p>“Supporting positive development of children and education are key drivers behind the work we do at the Sagicor Foundation, and we are very pleased when we see the impact and reach of the initiatives we carry out,” she said.</p>
