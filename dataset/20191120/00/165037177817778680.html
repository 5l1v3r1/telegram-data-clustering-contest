        <b>The legendary ex-player is begging players and managers to use the power they have to influence and support the disadvantaged in social causes.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Eric Cantona</b> spoke to 'The Guardian' and made the most of it to address players. He is calling for more initiatives such as '<b>Common Goal</b>' from Juan Mata so that the world and disadvantaged make the most of everything that football generates.</p>
      <p>"We ask the players to play well, but<b> it's also important that they keep an eye on the companies and observe everything that's going on </b>around them", the player started by saying.</p>

      <p>Always focussed on causes of solidarity, Cantona laments that players forget their roots when they reach fame. "There is a form of ignorance in this life and it is reflected in <b>some players leaving poor neighborhoods or cities</b>. <b>Some players come from these environments </b>and forget, we have to make them understand", he continued.</p>
      <p>Finally, Cantona asks that players use their power: "<b>We all love football and can use it to do a lot of good things</b>".</p>
