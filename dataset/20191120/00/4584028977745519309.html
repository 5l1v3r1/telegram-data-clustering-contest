      <h1>Kane thanks Pochettino for making his &amp;#039;dreams&amp;#039; come true</h1>

      <p>Tottenham captain Harry Kane thanked Mauricio Pochettino for helping him realise his dreams following the Argentinian's sacking.</p>
      <p>Spurs sprung a surprise on Tuesday when they announced Pochettino's five-and-a-half-year spell as manager had been ended.</p>
      <p>Pochettino had enjoyed a fine spell at the club, transforming them into top-four regulars and taking Spurs to their first Champions League final last season, ultimately losing 2-0 to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>But after a difficult start to the new campaign, claiming just 14 points from their first 12 matches, chairman Daniel Levy made a drastic decision, with Spurs confirming Jose Mourinho as their new manager on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There remains plenty of respect for Pochettino in the Spurs dressing room, however, with skipper Kane the latest to pay tribute to ex-Southampton boss. </p>
      <p>"Gaffer. I'll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams," Kane wrote on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>"We've had some amazing moments in the last five and a half years that I will never forget.</p>
      <p>"You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship. Good luck with your next chapter!"</p>
