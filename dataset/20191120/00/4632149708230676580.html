      <h1>Curious case of Mercs with identical no. plates</h1>

      <p><i>Cops found one of the cars had a fake number plate</i> <br/><br/>Two traffic inspectors from the Regional Transport Office (RTO) from Yeshwanthpur zeroed in on two Mercedes Benz E220 cars, flaunting id entical number plates. The RTO officers have been keeping an eye on vehicles with same number plates over the last three days and on Monday they seized the cars after rounds of verification. <br/><br/>The officials said there are many vehicles, including buses, that ply on Tumkur Road and even private buses with duplicate number plates in the Nelamangala RTO jurisdiction. Gnanendra Kumar, additional commissioner of Bengaluru RTO department, said, “A few days ago, a bus was checked in Nelamangala RTO and we saw another bus with the same number on the road. Our officers have kept track of it and nailed it. Tracking yellow boards is not difficult, but the white boards are tougher to track down.” <br/><br/>On the tracking down of the Mercs, he said, “We had some information with us, which we used to find them.” He said, inspectors Rajanna and Sudhakar were constantly on the lookout for duplicate number plates. “One day a car had come to Yeshwanthpur RTO and the inspector noticed the car and the number plate,” he said. <br/><br/>A few days later, the same inspector saw another car with the same number plate while on duty in Yeshwanthpur limits. Kumar said, “This made the inspector a little curious. He wasn’t sure about the car he had seen parked on Tumkur Road, and so he sent the picture of the car to the person, who had come to the RTO. The man responded saying this was not his car and so we confirmed that something was wrong.”</p>
      <p>He accepted that it was a fake number plate and that his car only had a temporary number plate</p>
      <p>–Gnanendra Kumar, RTO<br/><br/>The officials tracked down the fake number plate with the help of the traffic police. Using cameras, they zeroed in on a place in Mylasandra in Kengeri. “The traffic police accompanied us to Kengeri to the house where this car was parked and we caught the person at 5 am. As soon as he was caught, he accepted that it was a fake number plate and that it was not registered for more than three years. He had only a temporary number plate. By 6.30 am he was brought to Yeshwanthpur RTO,” added Kumar. <br/><br/><br/><b>The taxing bit</b> <br/>The interesting part in this case was that after reaching the RTO office with the culprit, the officials started checking the chassis number. <br/><br/>“As we were checking the number and writing it down in our case sheet, the person fled from the place and managed to escape. When we calculated the tax dues of this car, it came up to Rs. 22 lakh. We found that this car was from 2013, and we had to impose penalties for the past seven years on the culprit.” <br/><br/>However, what baffled the transport department about the car number was that this series was released only recently and it is an ongoing series.</p>
