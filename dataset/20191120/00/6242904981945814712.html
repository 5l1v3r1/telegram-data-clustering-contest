        <b>ArthurLegacy Sports has signed an agency agreement with with Accra-based colts club Mighty Cosmos.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deal will see the sports agency have the first option and authorization to sell their players to foreign clubs.</p>
      <p>Mighty Cosmos recently had 19-year-old attacking midfielder Edmund Addo transferred to Slovakian side FK Senica through ArthurLegacy's involvement.</p>
      <p>"I'm extremely happy to have signed this agreement with Mighty Cosmos. Edmond is a hugely talented young footballer who I believe will go far, and his performance is beginning to tell at FK Senica,'' ArthurLegacy CEO Oliver Arthur said.</p>
      <p>''I believe this agency agreement will become a major boost for Cosmos to continue to nurture talents at the juvenile stage and we pledge to support them.''</p>
      <p>Mighty Cosmos General Secretary Robert Dodoo hopes this relationship can give the clubÂ  a major lift.</p>
      <p>"This is our first time having a football agent signing a player agreement with us so we hope for the best because a lot of agents have failed us in the past," Dodoo said.</p>
