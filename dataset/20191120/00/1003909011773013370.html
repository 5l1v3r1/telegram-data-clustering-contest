      <p>Calgary’s governing body for minor hockey is applauding the move to drop the term “midget” and other traditional age group names across the country.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Hockey Canada said the age categories, which also include novice, peewee, atom and bantam, would be replaced by age descriptors ranging from U7 (under-7) to U21.</p>
      <p>The change will be implemented in all minor hockey programs across the country by Hockey Canada and its 13 provincial and territorial members for the 2020-21 season.</p>
      <p>Hockey Calgary executive director Kevin Kobelka said the change will be good for the game.</p>
      <p>“We support the decision. We think it’s the right decision moving forward and we believe it’s right for the game of hockey,” said Kobelka, adding it would align Canada with other sporting bodies internationally.</p>
      <p>The numerical categories will offer clarity for those not involved in hockey or new to the game, keeping the system simple to understand, he said. But it will also make hockey “more inclusive,” according to Kobelka.</p>
      <p>“I just think that for those who had concerns or questions regarding the term ‘midget’ and some of the other terms that are out there, if they felt that it was not appropriate, that now they’ll be more eager to join the game of hockey,” he said.</p>
      <p>The term has long been used in a variety of sports, despite being considered by many to be a derogatory slur. Allan Redford, president of the Little People of Canada, said it originates from the oppression and exploitation of people with dwarfism in “freak shows” in the mid-1800s.</p>
      <p>Redford, who also serves as a director with the Dwarf Athletic Association of Canada, said “it’s not about sensitivity.”</p>
      <p>“It’s about awareness, acceptance and dignity. It’s often sometimes difficult to imagine the challenges that people with short stature face,” he said.</p>

      <p>The issue generated some buzz a year ago when Regina Scott of Guelph, Ont., who has a young son with dwarfism, helped make a change at her local youth basketball association after noticing the term on a banner at a mall.</p>
      <p>The Ontario Basketball Association later announced it planned to drop the term, a move supported by Canada Basketball, which already used age descriptors. Many provincial and national associations followed suit.</p>
      <p>The International Ice Hockey Federation and USA Hockey already use age designators. Hockey Canada initiated its change in conjunction with its provincial and territorial members and following the recommendations of a task team.</p>
      <p>The federation classifies the midget category as players who are under 18 as of Dec. 31 of the current season.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://poll.fm/10462649">Are you in favour of Hockey Canada's decision to drop the terms midget, peewee, atom and bantam?</a>
      </p>
      <p>The term is still used in some tournament titles, including the prominent Mac’s Midget AAA World Invitational Tournament in Calgary, an international competition first held in 1978 as the CP Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>The tournament, which falls under Hockey Calgary’s umbrella, could see a name change coming next year. Kobelka said the organization and its title sponsor would look into addressing the tournament naming following this year’s event, which runs from Dec. 26 to Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>In a sport with a long-standing tradition such as hockey, Kobelka said he isn’t concerned about potential backlash from those opposed to the decision.</p>
      <p>“There’s traditionalists and there’s those who don’t like change, but I think change is something that’s necessary,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Change is inevitable and you need to do it to keep up and to keep people involved in this day and age.”</p>
