      <h1>Taking Stock: Historic day on D-St! Here's what is driving the rally</h1>
      <h2>In the broader market space – the S&amp;P BSE Mid-cap index rose 0.25 percent while the S&amp;P BSE Small-cap index closed with gains of 0.07 percent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kshitij Anand</a></address>
      <p>Bulls pushed the S&amp;P BSE Sensex to a fresh record high of 40,816 on November 20 while the Nifty50 had a touch-and-go moment with 12,000 levels.</p>
      <p>Selling pressure was seen at higher levels as investors preferred to book profits near 12,000 on the Nifty50.</p>
      <p>The final tally on D-Street – the S&amp;P BSE Sensex rose 181 points to 40,651 while the Nifty50 closed 59 points higher at 11,999 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sectorally, the action was seen in energy, healthcare, oil &amp; gas, and capital goods index while profit-taking was seen in realty, consumer durables, telecom and power stocks.</p>
      <p>In the broader market space – the S&amp;P BSE Midcap index rose 0.25 percent while the S&amp;P BSE Smallcap index closed with gains of 0.07 percent.</p>
      <p>No major negative surprises from Q2 results, divestment buzz and fierce rally in RIL which is now closer to hitting Rs 10 lakh crore mark in terms of market capitalisation, highest among the BSE-listed companies drove much of the gains.</p>
      <p>"Market traded higher ahead of the cabinet meeting due today to discuss on divestment and continued strong buying in index heavyweights lead by pharma and banking stocks,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd.</p>
      <p>“Fresh worries surfaced over US-China trade tensions but domestic market maintained positive momentum. Government’s plan to divest PSU stake to help maintain the fiscal deficit target in check," he said.</p>
      <p>Market breadth was a tad in the negative but nothing alarming. The overall structure remains positive and the rally is getting broad-based, and it is just a matter of time when the Nifty50 also starts trading in the unchartered territory.</p>
      <p>“We continue to remain overall positive on the index and believe the index is poised to hit fresh all-time highs above 12,100 zone,” Amit Shah, Technical Research Analyst with Indiabulls Ventures Ltd told Moneycontrol.</p>

      <p>Max Call OI: 12000, 12200</p>
