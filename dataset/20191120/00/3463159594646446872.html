      <p>FIFA and the Local Organising Committee today announced the Paraguayan beer brand Pilsen as a National Supporter of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup 2019™.</p>
      <p>First brewed in 1912, Pilsen has been a household name in Paraguay for more than 100 years and is committed to promoting cultural and sporting activities. Pilsen will be served at the new, purpose-built beach soccer stadium in Asunción, which will see teams from 16 countries take to the sand starting tomorrow. </p>
      <p>“At Pilsen, we are proud and happy to be part of an event of such importance throughout the world. We are convinced that Paraguay has much to offer visitors, from the warmth of its people to its products,” said Bruno Yuli, Pilsen’s Marketing Manager for Core Brands. “The FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup™ is a great opportunity for our country to demonstrate what it can produce as it welcomes sports fans in the coming weeks.” </p>
      <p>“It’s exciting to see a well-established local brand join the event. Pilsen is committed to creating unique experiences for its customers and the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup is a perfect platform to do that,” said Jean-François Pathy, FIFA’s Director of Marketing Services. </p>
      <p>The tenth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup will be held from 21 November to 1 December in Asunción. This is the first time that Paraguay will stage a FIFA event and the first time that the beach soccer tournament will take place in a landlocked country.
