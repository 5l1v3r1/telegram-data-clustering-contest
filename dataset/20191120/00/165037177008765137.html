        <b>Bayern Munich have been linked to Mauricio Pochettino, a coach admired by Joshua Kimmich.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Joshua Kimmich</b> gave a <b>strong endorsement</b> of Mauricio Pochettino's coaching ability after the rumoured <b>Bayern Munich</b> target departed <b>Tottenham</b>.</p>
      <p>Spurs brought Pochettino's <b>well-regarded stint in charge</b> to an <b>abrupt end</b> on Tuesday, dismissing the man who led them to the Champions League final following a <b>poor start to the new season</b>.</p>
      <p>The development could have ramifications in Bavaria, where the Argentinian is said to be <b>held in high regard.</b></p>
      <p>Bayern were reportedly interested in Pochettino even before they parted company with head coach <b>Niko Kovac</b> at the beginning of November and could now pursue him as a free agent.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions have entrusted <b>Hansi Flick </b>with overseeing the team until the end of 2019 but have not committed to a long-term appointment.</p>
      <p>"I do not know if he is a candidate for us," Kimmich told reporters when asked about Pochettino after Germany's win over Northern Ireland in Euro 2020 qualifying.</p>

      <p>"What you can say is that Tottenham were fighting at the top for years. They have had huge consistency. He's a top coach, but <b>I do not know if he's an option for us</b>."</p>

      <p>Flick has won each of his two matches since taking charge on an interim basis, the second a 4-0 thrashing of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Bayern CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge last week said: "We decided that he will be coach at least until Christmas and possibly beyond. <b>We trust Hansi Flick.</b>"</p>
      <p>Bayern have reportedly identified Ajax boss <b>Erik ten Hag </b>and Paris Saint-Germain's <b>Thomas Tuchel</b> as their preferred candidates but would likely struggle to prise either coach away from their clubs before the end of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho</b> had also been linked with the Bavarian club, but he was appointed Pochettino's successor at Spurs on Wednesday.</p>
