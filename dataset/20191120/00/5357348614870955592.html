        <b>THE Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA) is inviting entries for its child protection mascot design and name competition.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The competition, titled 'ProtekWiPickneyDem', is being rolled out at primary-level institutions islandwide and is targeted at children between ages seven and 12.</p>
      <p>Public relations and communications manager at the CPFSA, Rochelle Dixon told JIS News that the aim of the competition is to galvanise children to design a child-friendly character that they can relate to, while learning about child abuse and protection.</p>
      <p>The mascot will make special appearances at schools on a quarterly basis and will be used, along with a jingle created in 2018, as part of the child-protection programme.</p>
      <p>Dixon said participants will have a chance to win attractive prizes, including a tablet, book vouchers and gift baskets, along with accolades of having designed the CPFSA's mascot.</p>
      <p>The school that the winner attends will receive a smart television.</p>
      <p>Children wishing to participate can download the competition rules and guidelines from the CPFSA's website at http://childprotection.gov.jm/ mascotdesign.</p>
      <p>Entries should be e-mailed to prunit@ childprotection.gov.jm or dropped off at any of the CPFSA parish offices no later than Friday, November 29.</p>
