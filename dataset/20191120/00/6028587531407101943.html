      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/estee-lauder/"><b>Estee Lauder’s</b></a> (NYSE: EL) total revenue has grown from $11.82 billion in 2017 to $14.86 billion in 2019, and we expect this growth to continue, driving total revenue to $17.14 billion in 2021. The growth in total revenue has largely been due to strong growth in emerging markets and an increase in selling prices. Skin Care Revenue has seen the highest absolute growth, from $4.55 billion in 2017 to $6.58 billion in 2019, and we expect this segment to bring in $8.11 billion by 2021. We expect Estee Lauder’s total revenue to rise to around $17.14 billion by 2021, as the company plans on further expanding in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
