      <p>The commercial bus driver and his conductor who assaulted a police officer on the Weija road have been slapped with a GH¢1,800 fine each by the Weija High Court.</p>
      <p>The two – Francis Buabeng, 26 and Albert Ansah, 33 – attacked Constable Julius Mawule Ekpe in the line of duty at the Mallam Junction earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The court presided by Justice Benard Bentsil fined the two 150 penalty units each (GH¢1,800) or face one year in jail.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Joy News’ Piesie Nana Yaw Safo, lead counsel for the defendants, Cynthia Nimo Ampadu voiced her dissatisfaction at the verdict.</p>
      <p>“We are not satisfied with the outcome of the ruling and so we will apply a copy of the judgment, study it and advise ourselves on the way forward,” she said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Background</b>
      </p>
      <p>Francis and Albert while driving their bus and looking for passengers at the Weija junction, reportedly stopped in the middle of the road to wait for some commuters.</p>
      <p>The driver’s action was said to have caused heavy traffic on the road, causing a motorbike to run into the rear of a private vehicle.</p>
      <p>Constable Ekpe, who was around the area, upon noticing the development, went there to help.</p>
      <p>But the driver was said to have almost knocked the officer with his vehicle when he ignored the officer’s command to stop and sped off.</p>
      <p>The police officer then hopped unto a motorbike, chased and crossed the driver causing him to stop. He then requested that the driver and his mate accompany him to the station.</p>
      <p>But the driver and his mate will have none of that. Together, they launched an attack, beating the officer to the surprise of other motorists and passengers.</p>
      <p>After the confrontation, the police officer sat in the vehicle and radioed control for assistance.</p>
      <p>The driver and his mate abandoned the vehicle and left. The police managed to tow the vehicle to the Odorkor police station.</p>
      <p>Other reports from witnesses also suggested that the officer was the first to attack the driver and his mate and that they only retaliated.</p>
