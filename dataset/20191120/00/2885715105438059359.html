      <p>In its budget presented Tuesday, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) said the multi-storey car parking at Krishna Nagar will soon be handed over to a successful bidder for three years.</p>
      <p>Also, 81 parking sites have been identified for expansion of parking facilities and tenders have been issued for the same.</p>
      <p>Among other new projects proposed is a three-storey operation theatre at Swami Dayanand Hospital, which is estimated to cost around Rs 400 lakh.</p>
      <p>The EDMC budget document also stated that in the year 2019-20, work of installing vertical gardens will begin at Mayur Vihar, SDN Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Laxmi Nagar, Karkardooma flyover and Mayur Vihar Phase-1 Extension.</p>
      <p>The East Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is facing a deficit of crores, also proposed several new taxes including a professional tax to be imposed on those earning more than Rs 5 lakh a year at the rate of Rs 100 per month and Rs 200 per month for those earning more than 10 lakh per year.</p>
      <p>An education cess at 5% of property tax has also been proposed.</p>
      <p>It is expected that the East civic body will earn a minimum of Rs 5 crore from professional tax, Rs10 crore from educational cess and Rs15 crore from imposing betterment tax.</p>
      <p>However, such proposals have been made for the past several years and were outrightly rejected by the political wing. “With elections just two months away, there is hardly any chance of such proposals being accepted,” said a senior leader.</p>
