      <p>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Pennsylvania’s highest court has ruled that a man charged with distributing child pornography does not have to tell police his computer password.</p>
      <p>The court’s 4-3 decision Wednesday reaffirms the right to remain silent and acknowledges the difficulty of building cases when police confront sophisticated encryption services and other technology.</p>
      <p>Defendant Joseph Davis was arrested in 2015 on the charges. He has been in the Luzerne County Jail for four years while lawyers litigate the issue before trial.</p>
      <p>Justice Debra Todd writes that authorities cannot force people to “unlock the safe” in their minds to potentially incriminating evidence.</p>

        <p>The state Attorney General’s Office could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to consider the issue. A message seeking comment was left with the office Wednesday.</p>
