      <p>Kristen Bell was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame alongside her <i>Frozen 2</i> co-star Idina Menzel on Thursday, and delivered an acceptance speech which was pretty much what you'd expect of the <i>Good Place </i>actor.</p>
      <p>"I am so grateful to be accepting this honor today on these hallowed streets where Pretty Woman sold her body for money — it's really a dream!" Bell joked.</p>
      <p>In her humorous but sentimental speech, the actor reflected on her career and the people who helped her along the way. Bell said she considered the support of her parents and husband — as well as the advice of Cher — more permanent and significant than her sparkling new star. Though don't get her wrong, she was still thrilled to receive it.</p>
      <p>"This star will really only know its true value when, inevitably, someone is mugged in that very spot, and as they clutch their purse the assailant screams, 'Let it go!' And the victim will look up and say, 'That's not even her song you son of a bitch,'" said Bell. "Only then will I know that I've truly made it."</p>
