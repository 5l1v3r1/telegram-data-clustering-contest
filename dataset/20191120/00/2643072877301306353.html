      <h3>Dickson Chides APC After Bayelsa State Election</h3>
      <p>The Governor of Bayelsa State, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/seriake-dickson/"><u><b>Seriake Dickson</b></u></a> has accused the <b>All Progressives Congress</b> (APC) of attempting to legitimize electoral fraud by using the image of ex-president <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/goodluck-jonathan/"><u>Goodluck Jonathan</u></a>.</b></p>
      <p>Governor Dickson is alleging the APC perpetuated electoral fraud to emerge winners of the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State.</p>
      <p>The Governor made the submission during a press conference in Yenagoa on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It will be recalled as previously reported by <b>Naija News</b> that <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/bayelsa-apc-governors-visit-ex-president-goodluck-jonathan-photos/"><u>some APC leaders</u></a></b>, including the governor-elect, David Lyon; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; Governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu; and the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipreye Sylva, had visited Jonathan after the APC defeated the PDP in the Bayelsa governorship election.</p>
      <p>The <b>Independent National Electoral Commission</b> (INEC) had <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>declared David</b> <b>Lyon</b></u></a> of the APC winner of the governorship election with a total of 352,552 votes, defeating his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <b>Senator Duoye Diri</b>, who polled 143,172 votes and all other candidates.</p>
      <p>Dickson, however, said Jonathan did not contribute to the electoral manipulation but the APC are attempting to use his image to legitimize Lyon’s victory.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“That’s why they had to be taking David Lyon to him (Jonathan). They had to be talking about him; they had to visit him and appear to be celebrating a victory never earned.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Like Pontius Pilate, they are preparing the window by which they will wash their hands strategically, and put it at his (Jonathan) doorstep; that he endorsed, sanctioned (and) legitimised it. That’s the game they are playing,”</i> Dickson stated.</p>
      <p>Dickson added that the PDP will take the matter before the election tribunal, with the Governor declaring he had “implicit confidence” in the judiciary to deliver justice.</p>
      <p>Also at the event, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/19/bayelsa-dickson-reveals-next-move-says-jonathan-remains-his-oga/"><u><b>Naija News</b></u></a> earlier published Dickson said: <i>“Jonathan remains my oga (boss) and I respect him, but there are lots of efforts by certain interest to create a rift between us, there is no politician that has been there for the former president than me.”</i></p>
      <p>He further stated that he will soon write memoirs on the events before, during and after the November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State so people will have a fair view of what happened.</p>
