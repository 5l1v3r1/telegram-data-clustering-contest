      <p>OPELIKA, Ala. (AP) - An Alabama judge is ordering DNA testing for a man charged with kidnapping in the disappearance of the missing stepdaughter of a UFC heavyweight fighter.</p>
      <p>Lee County District Judge <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russell-bush/">Russell Bush</a> ordered 29-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Ibraheem Yazeed</a> to submit a DNA sample to authorities investigating what happened to 19-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Aniah Blanchard</a>.</p>
      <p>The college student is the stepdaughter of UFC participant Walt Harris of metro Birmingham. She was last seen on Oct. 23 in Auburn and remains missing.</p>
      <p>The judge ordered testing during a hearing Wednesday as prosecutors revealed DNA evidence from a male was found in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a>’s car.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/russell-bush/">Bush</a> also refused bail for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Yazeed</a>, who hasn’t entered a plea in the case.</p>
