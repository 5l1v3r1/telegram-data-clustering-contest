      <p>Past quarter, highly-visible honchos waxed somewhat less frantic in portfolio turnover, but I didn’t see many four-baggers landing in the center-field bleachers.With the wind at our backs, you’d expect overachievers to soar far above the market’s year-to-date return of 25%. But, I sense the majority of hedge funds are still underperforming. While turnover ratios wax lower, many funds like Iridian Asset Management, Glenview Capital Management, Bridgewater Associates, Coatue Management, Farallon Capital Management, Citadel, Tudor Investment and Lone Pine Capital show static ratios in the teens or lower.</p>
      <p>In a bull market, you’d expect money managers to sit back, relax and enjoy the fruits of their picks. You’re supposed reduce portfolio churning. The gold palm here forever goes to Berkshire Hathaway with a static ratio of 87.5%. Nobody else comes close to such do-nothingness. Who else holds American Express and Coca-Cola for half a century?</p>
      <p>Long-term players like Carl Icahn run at a 50% static ratio, still heavy in energy. After yelling and screaming at Occidental Petroleum management for overleveraging to buy Anadarko Petroleum, he pared his position. Xerox is a big winner, now down to under 3% of assets. Hey, Carl. Throw your Occidental out the window unless you see a bull market around the corner in oil futures.</p>
      <p>I see only three other portfolios with static positions over 50%. Namely Greenlight Capital, Tiger Global Management and Paulson’s outfit. Greenlight’s is a bricks and mortar portfolio, literally. Green Brick Partners, a homebuilder, is an outsized 48% holding, successful, followed by General Motors at 16.5%.</p>
      <p>I sold out my General Motors in the high thirties, fearing offshore auto sales stay weak, a pawn in trade-war dynamics. But, GM sells at maybe 6.5 times earnings power with hefty balance sheet liquidity. Nobody loves it to death.</p>
      <p>Paulson’s 52% static ratio reeks of bearishness. Some 17% of assets rest in gold. No technology or internet plays here. Other dominant concentration is healthcare, over 40% of assets. Give ‘em an A for implementation, but you gotta be right-on trend and direction in the market, too. I find Allergan and Celgene pricey pieces of paper, but I could be wrong.</p>
      <p>When I got to Tiger Management, my face lit up because this is the way I manage my own capital. With a static ratio of 65%, Tiger’s two dominant positions, Microsoft and Facebook, account for 22% of assets. Alibaba and Amazon another 13%. You could say Tiger’s portfolio is a proxy for the Nasdaq 100 Index, but there’s no Apple here or hardly anywhere else.</p>
      <p>With the exception of Berkshire Hathaway’s outsized position in Apple most operators have eschewed not only the trillion-dollar biggies, but most of the $500 billion pieces as well. You find Amazon underrepresented along with Facebook and Alibaba. Why?</p>
      <p>Apple is over a 25% position for Berkshire. Hey, guys! Show more courage in your convictions. In a swoop, Warren Buffett overweighted the entire technology sector with Apple’s purchase. But, he coulda done even better. Microsoft vies with Apple for numero uno in the S&amp;P 500 Index. Amazon is not far behind, up 40% latest 12 months.</p>
      <p>Alphabet. Why Netflix, only 3%, but I find it unanalyzable relative to Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Maybe, these 25 portfolios are more revealing on what they haven’t committed to. I see sizable gaps in perception, largely to do with sector omissions. It’s not just the absence of Microsoft, Apple, et al but the under-commitment to financials, now 13% of S&amp;P 500 Index weighting.</p>
      <p>I can’t find any Citigroup, Bank of America, even JPMorgan Chase in these portfolios. The one exception is Pershing Square Capital Management’s 13% in Berkshire Hathaway which holds 40% of its assets in financials, triple sector weighting.</p>
      <p>Come on fellas! You can’t be bullish on the market and the economy, yet be naked in bank stocks. We could be seeing the end to declining net interest margins for banks. Inherent leverage for rising NIMs is at least 10% to earnings power, maybe 15% next couple of years.</p>
      <p>The unspoken message in bank stock valuation is the group could close the disparity relative to the S&amp;P 500. Why should Citigroup sell at 11 times earnings with the market P/E at 18? I see banks selling at 13 times forward 12-month earnings power. Management seems more focused on share buybacks than deals and backing crazy loan paper.</p>
      <p>Individual investors need to examine how their money is managed. You can’t be just a player looking for hot stocks to own and then flip. The investment universe is highly complex. Most high net worth individuals and estates remain inherently conservative, managed by banks and brokerage houses that have adopted a pie chart investment schema.</p>
      <p>This embraces the U.S. equity and fixed income universe. Then, weighs in on foreign markets, commodities, gold, oil futures, third world debt - whatever. A goodly percentage of assets are delegated to outside managers so clients are paying double fees. Clients pay out around 1% of assets in annual fees. The unstated message to clients is we are the masters of the investment universe.</p>
      <p>Past few years, pie chart investing underperformed the domestic benchmark of 60% in the S&amp;P 500 and 40% in a mix of bonds, normally investment grade with duration of 5 to 10 years. Such portfolio management does more for the money manager than for the client who isn’t conversant with third world debt or emerging markets equities. It makes the manager look busy, perceptive and difficult to criticize.</p>
      <p>Start with JPMorgan Chase and work your way down the list. Too much groupthink. Morgan has underperformed in these accounts past couple of years. I noted they just made several changes at the top of their money management division.</p>
      <p>There’s another kind of a money manager who wouldn’t know a stock from a slab of salami. He’s a mathematician who processes, daily, thousands of commodity transactions minute by minute looking for anomalies relative to past transactional behavior. This is practiced by Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies whose computerized trading operation shows a 39.1% annualized net rate of return over 30 years in his Medallion Fund.</p>
      <p>The hidden patterns in financial markets is a discipline pursued by hundreds of mathematicians, one even sleeping in a Murphy bed in his office to stay abreast. The Street’s going to need tens of billions to play in this game. Eventually, rival groups will cancel out the present margin of profitability.</p>
      <p>All this proves there’s no monopoly on brains. Quarterly 13F reports will look like quaint documents on how an older generation of money managers fought the battle of investment survival and got humbled therein. I never would have dreamed that I’d be replaced by an army of nerdy quants who never learned to tango across the dance floor, intertwined with a beautiful partner.</p>
