      <h1>Watch The Exact Moment Tones And I Brought Her Monkey Business To US Television</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:02:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">By David Adams</a></address>
      <p>Superlatives fail for <b>Tones and I</b>, the Australian muso whose tune <i>Dance Monkey</i> has spent a record-breaking 16 weeks atop the <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/music/dance-monkey-aria-record/">ARIA singles chart</a> and has reached #1 across huge swathes of Europe. Punters simply cannot get enough of the moment those piano plinks morph into a bass warble, allowing the singer to unleash one of the catchiest choruses penned this decade.</p>
      <p>But <i>Dance Monkey</i> is yet to hit those dizzying heights in the US market, despite the track’s debut in the Billboard Hot 100 last month. That may change thanks to her appearance on the latest edition of <i>The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, which sparked a standing ovation and some big words from the host himself.</p>
      <p>“Yes, come on! US debut, that’s the way to do it,” old mate said.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to hear what the hit tune sounds like coming out of a New York City soundstage, you can find out below:</p>
