      <p>A local governance expert, Issaka Amon Kotei, believes there is no defect in the current local government system being practised in the country urging parliament to withdraw from tampering with Article 243 of the 1992 constitution.</p>
      <p>“What we need is some slight changes just to put us on the right track. we don’t need a major paradigm shift” he told host Kweku Owusu Adjei on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The amendment of Article 55(3) seeks to repeal the provision of the constitution which bars political parties from local assembly and district level elections.</p>
      <p>If approved in the referendum, it would pave way for MMDCEs to be elected on partisan basis if Parliament completes its amendment of Article 243/1 to make the position elected instead of appointed.</p>
      <p>But Dr. Amon Kotei is rather calling for the system to be tweaked to allow agencies like the Public Services Commission among others to vet appointees after their nomination by the President.</p>
      <p>He’s therefore writing to parliament reconsider the amendment of the Local Government Law arguing that the President should still appoint MMDCES.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, the Technical Advisor at the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD), Dr Eric Oduro Osae, believes the time is ripe for the nation to democratize local government system, just as had been done at the national level.</p>
      <p>“Why is it that we have a constitutional democracy yet we have to still inherit the PNDC law? The progress and reform of our local government system is necessary now.” he said.</p>
      <p>The Constitution requires that at the referendum, 40 per cent of qualified voters would vote.</p>
      <p>Out of the 40 per cent that would vote in the referendum, 75 per cent must vote ‘yes’ in favour of the referendum.</p>
      <p>Following the successful completion of the referendum, Parliament would have to amend Article 55(3) to pave the way for the election of MMDCEs.</p>
