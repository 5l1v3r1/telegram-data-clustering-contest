      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A cat who has been missing for five years in Portland, Oregon, has been found in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
      <p>The Santa Fe Animal Shelter announced this week that Sasha the black cat was recently found wandering the streets of New Mexico’s capital. Officials said a scan of the cat’s microchip revealed that the kitty had traveled more than 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) from Oregon.</p>
      <p>American Airlines offered to fly the cat to Portland, along with a member of the Santa Fe Animal Shelter. Officials will present the animal to Viktor Usov, the cat’s original owner.</p>
      <p>Usov says the family thought they’d never see the cat again.</p>
