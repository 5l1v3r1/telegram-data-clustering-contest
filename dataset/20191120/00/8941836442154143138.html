      <p>DALLAS (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Jamie Benn</a> knows why the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a> have emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a>’s hottest teams following a dismal start.</p>
      <p>“Guys are coming out of their shells,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> scored the first two goals Tuesday night, and some unsung <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> added four more to beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Vancouver Canucks</a> 6-1 for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>’ fifth straight win.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> have a nine-game point streak (8-0-1) and have gone 11-1-1 in the last 13.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is contributing,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> said. “That’s why we’re successful as of late, and we’re going to continue doing that.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a>, the team captain, has been joined in on the surge. After scoring one goal in his first 20 games, he has scored three in the last two games.</p>
      <p>Another spark has been Justin Dowling, who after going without a goal in his first 34 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nhl/">NHL</a> games has scored three in the last four on a line with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> and Tyler Seguin.</p>
      <p>“They’re super easy to play with,” Dowling said. “They’re elite players. I think you could plug anyone in right now to play with them. I’m fortunate enough to be the guy right now.”</p>
      <p>Corey Perry and defensemen Taylor Fedun and Miro Heiskanen also scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>.</p>

        <p>“It’s important that you have players like Taylor Fedun and Dowling that are able to produce,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> coach Jim Montgomery said. “Wave after wave is the way we like to play. Right now, we’re playing that way. We just have to maintain this because we know that the other side is not so much fun.”</p>
        <p>Bo Horvat scored the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a>’ goal in the second period against Ben Bishop, who made 32 saves. Vancouver goalie Jacob Markstrom stopped 25 shots. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> are 1-5-1 in the last seven games.</p>
        <p>“We weren’t very good all night,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> coach Travis Green said. “The other team came out with a purpose.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> killed all five penalties against them, including a 5-on-3 in the second period.</p>
        <p>Dowling had a goal disallowed 1:26 into the game. Tyler Seguin sent a pass from the top of the right faceoff circle to the left of the goal for Dowling, who tipped the puck in off Markstrom. Vancouver’s video challenge showed the play had been offside.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> scored for real at 7:53 of the first period, skating into the slot and sliding a backhand between Markstrom’s legs</p>
        <p>“You just kind of take advantage of what they give you,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> said. “It’s kind of a lucky goal.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a>’s second goal came on the power play at 9:59 of the second period. Perry’s shot went off Markstrom’s left pad to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jamie-benn/">Benn</a> at the right of the goal for a wrist shot over the goalie’s left shoulder.</p>
        <p>Horvat pulled the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/vancouver-canucks/">Canucks</a> within 2-1 on a breakaway with a wrist shot into the left side of the net at 11:24.</p>
        <p>Fedun started the play for the third <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> goal, his first this season, by gaining the puck in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>’ end. He finished it by putting in his own rebound from the right of the net.</p>
        <p>Heiskanen, Dowling and Perry scored in the first 8:29 of the third period to put the game away.</p>
