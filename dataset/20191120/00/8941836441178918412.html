      <h1>Nicklas Backstrom out vs. Rangers; Capitals do salary-cap gymnastics w</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>Nicklas Backstrom is day-to-day with an upper-body injury and will miss the Washington Capitals’ game Wednesday night at the New York Rangers.</p>
      <p>Forwards <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carl-hagelin/">Carl Hagelin</a> and Nic Dowd also will miss Wednesday’s game, and with a suspension likely looming for fellow forward Garnet Hathaway, the Capitals were forced to make a slew of roster moves to stay under the salary cap.</p>
      <p>They called up four players from AHL Hershey: forwards Beck Malenstyn and Mike Sgarbossa, defenseman Tyler Lewington and goalie Ilya Samsonov. They returned goalie Vitek Vanecek to Hershey.</p>
      <p>Washington also retroactively placed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carl-hagelin/">Hagelin</a> on long-term injured reserve, meaning he must sit out a total of 10 games. The Capitals said he is eligible to be activated in time for their Dec. 3 game at the San Jose Sharks.</p>
      <p>Dowd was placed on standard IR. He’s also considered day-to-day, so it likely signals that the Capitals feel he’ll be ready to play in their next game Saturday against Vancouver. Dowd has been sidelined by a cut on his hand.</p>

      <p>Hathaway has a hearing Wednesday morning for spitting in an opponent’s face during a brawl in Monday’s game against the Ducks. His salary will still count against Washington’s cap if he is suspended, so the front office responded by making these moves, which will only affect the roster for a few games.</p>

        <p>Malenstyn has yet to play in an NHL game, while Sgarbossa last appeared at the NHL level for the Florida Panthers in the 2016-17 season.</p>
