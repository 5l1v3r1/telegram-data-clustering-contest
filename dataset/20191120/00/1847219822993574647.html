        <b>Riga Mayor Oļegs Burovs (Honour to Serve Riga) is looking for a new majority after cooperation with his party has been stopped by Harmony party. If no new majority is established, Burovs would resign, he said in an interview with <i>Latvijas Radio</i>.</b>

      <p>In the interview on Wednesday, November 20, Burovs, who is the head of the Riga City Council since August 2019, said he plans to find coalition partners to form a majority in up to two weeks. If the plan fails, the politician would be ready to resign and call a snap municipal election.</p>
      <p>Burovs said he seeks to find a stable majority, which would be more than 32 councilmembers in the 60-seat Riga City Council.</p>
