      <h1>Social care must be solved by next government, coalition of charities and councils tell Telegraph </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:01:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/gabriella-swerling/" target="_blank">Gabriella Swerling</a></address>
      <p>The social care crisis must be solved by the next government, a coalition of charities and councils have warned, as they urge politicians to finally 'grasp the nettle'.</p>
      <p>Since 2010, almost £8billion has been cut from council adult social care budgets during a time of growing demand.</p>
      <p>Writing in The Telegraph today care experts have issued a warning to politicians that “social care must be at the top of the domestic policy agenda”. </p>
      <p>“For two decades, political parties of all colours have failed to deliver changes to how care is funded and what individuals are expected to pay. Changes to the system would ensure older and disabled people and unpaid carers have timely access to the support they need, in the way they want it, to help them live their lives. </p>
      <p>“This General Election is a chance for the incoming government to finally grasp the nettle and find a lasting solution.</p>
      <p>“The next government has a unique opportunity to show its ambition for and commitment to the future of adult social care. </p>
      <p>“As organisations dedicated to bringing about the changes needed for social care, we want to see a new government put funding reform into action to deliver sustainable investment which supports people’s wellbeing…</p>
      <p>“Working together, we can make the most of that opportunity for the benefit of the entire population. This is in the national interest, it must not be wasted again.”</p>
      <p>Among the signatories are: Local Government Association, Age UK, Alzheimer’s Society, Association of Directors of Public Health, Association for Real Change, Associated Retirement Community Operators, Care England, Care Provider Alliance and Carers UK. </p>
      <p>Other charities and organisations which have signed the letter include: Independent Age, NHS Confederation, Shared Lives Plus, Solace, United Kingdom Homecare Association (UKHCA) and Voluntary Organisations Disability Group.</p>
      <p>Their letter comes after this summer, when Age UK warned that a record number of over 65s are not getting the care they need with increasing numbers are “at far greater risk of not eating enough and of falling and hurting themselves”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/30/record-number-65s-not-getting-care-need-system-risks-total-collapse/"> The charity warned that the care system was on the brink of “collapse”. </a>According to the latest available figures, in 2018 a record 1.4million people aged 65 and over had unmet needs and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/16/elderly-taken-ride-care-homes-charging-thousands-hidden-fees/">were struggling to carry out basic daily living activities such as eating, bathing, getting dressed, using the toilet and getting in and out of bed</a>. </p>
      <p>In 2017 the figure was 1.2 million, which rose from 1.04 million in 2015. The data reveals that the record 2018 figure has more than doubled in four years, after just 900,000 over 65s were recorded as having unmet needs in 2014. </p>
      <p>“Everyone deserves the right to live the life they want to lead, whether that is maintaining social and family relationships, pursuing activities, studying, working, or living in a place that feels like home,” the letter added. </p>
      <p>“Social care provides vital support that helps make this happen. It also helps sustain our NHS and supports our country’s economy.</p>
