      <h1>Arthritis drugs could prevent fatal spread of breast cancer   </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:01:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/laura-donnelly/" target="_blank">Laura Donnelly</a></address>
      <p>Arthritis drugs used on the NHS could prevent the fatal spread of breast cancer, research suggests. </p>
      <p>Scientists believe the common medications could be re-purposed to help block cancer reaching bones.</p>
      <p>Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in the UK, with 55,000 diagnoses a year, and 11,500 deaths – almost all from tumours that have spread to other parts of the body.</p>
      <p>Research teams from the University of Manchester and the University of Sheffield discovered that a protein released by bone marrow, called interleukin 1-beta encouraged <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/breast-cancer/">breast cancer</a> cells to form secondary tumours once they reach the bone.</p>
      <p>Tests found that this molecule can be blocked by the drug anakinra, already used to treat <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arthritis/">arthritis</a>.</p>
      <p>The study, largely funded by charity Breast Cancer Now and published in the Nature Communications journal, revealed that anakinra was able to prevent <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/10/quarter-women-incurable-breast-cancer-sees-gp-least-three-times/">breast cancer forming secondary tumours</a> in the bone.</p>
      <p>Follow treatment with anakinra, only 14 per cent of mice in the study developed secondary tumours in the bone, compared to 42 per cent of control animals.</p>
      <p>Breast cancer most commonly spreads <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/12194456/Astounding-study-claims-major-breakthrough-in-cure-for-terminal-breast-cancer.html">to the bones, brain, lungs or liver</a>.</p>
      <p>Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breast Cancer Now, said: "These major findings offer another promising step forward in re-purposing existing drugs to prevent the spread of breast cancer.</p>
      <p>"While more research is needed, it's really exciting that these well-tolerated and widely-available arthritis drugs may help prevent secondary breast cancer in the bone."</p>
      <p> Lead author Dr Rachel Eyre, from The University of Manchester, said: “We are very excited by our results in the lab showing that breast cancer in bone can be prevented using drugs that are already approved for other diseases.</p>
      <p>“We hope it can soon be established whether these drugs can be used for breast cancer patients following successful testing in clinical trials.”</p>
