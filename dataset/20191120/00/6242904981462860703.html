        <b>Ghanaian midfielder Yusif Raman Chibsah has urged his Gazientep teammate to bounce back from the defeat to Galatasaray and secure a win against Antalyspor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gazientep travel to Antalyspor after the international break and will be hoping to return to winning ways after the setback against Galatasaray.</p>
      <p>Chibsah has been in top form for the Turkish super Lig side, and are currently fifth on the table after some run of good results.</p>
      <p>“We are going very well as a team. The last match we played Galatasaray could not be very effective. I hope we make up for this away match Antalyaspor," says Chibsah.</p>
      <p>The 26-year old has played 11 super Lig games this season after joining from Italian side Frosinone in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>He has also played two games in the Turkish Cup, netting two goals in all competition for the club.</p>
