      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - K-pop supergroup SuperM and singer BoA will perform at a Global Citizen event in Asia as part of a massive multi-continent concert next year.</p>
      <p>The advocacy organization says the performers will join the lineup of Global Goal Live: The Possible Dream in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 26, 2020. The event is a part of a yearlong initiative to achieve the United Nations’ Global Goals to end poverty and tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>The goal is to secure $350 billion for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>The 10-hour concert will span five locations. It will be broadcast live from Seoul, New York City, Lagos, Nigeria, and other cities in Latin America and Europe.</p>
      <p>Performers in other locations include Alicia Keys, H.E.R., Miley Cyrus, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Metallica.</p>
