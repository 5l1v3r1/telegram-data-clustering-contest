      <h1>Jose Mourinho's in-tray: Five key issues at Spurs</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho is back in the Premier League, replacing Mauricio Pochettino as manager of Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese former <b>Chelsea and Manchester United boss</b> inherits a side packed with <b>quality players</b> but currently 14th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>AFP looks at five of the <b>most pressing issues in his in-tray.</b></p>
      <h3>Win a trophy</h3>
      <p>Jose Mourinho's first task will be to stop <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham's </a>slide. Last season they rubbed shoulders with Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the league before falling away.</p>
      <p>Spurs, and Mourinho, will be desperate to end the club's trophy drought, which has<b> lasted for more than a decade</b>.</p>
      <p>They have not won the English top flight since <b>1961.</b></p>
      <p>As well as his high profile, Mourinho's knack of picking up silverware will have been a <b>huge plus for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</b></p>
      <p>For all of Pochettino's success, he was <b>unable to win a trophy</b> for the club in his spell of <b>more than five years in charge</b>.</p>
      <h3>Defensive issues</h3>
      <p>Tottenham have <b>struggled defensively</b> this season.</p>
      <p>They have kept just one clean sheet in the league and conceded seven in a Champions League game against <b>Bayern Munich</b>.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is renowned for his ability to build a side that is defensively rigid and he will have to get to work quickly on drilling his new back line.</p>

      <h3>Sort out contracts</h3>
      <p>Pochettino faced a major problem after a summer rebuild failed to materialise and he was left with a clutch of players who had <b>appeared to be on their way out of the club.</b></p>
      <p><b>Christian Eriksen</b> spoke publicly of his desire to quit Spurs at the end of last season and the Dane, along with <b>Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld</b>, is in the final year of his contract.</p>
      <p>Eriksen, Danny Rose -- also linked with a move away -- and Vertonghen, have <b>performed well below par this season.</b></p>
      <p>Mourinho must find a way to unite the squad quickly and get the best out of his players, some of whom could leave the club as early as January.</p>
      <h3>Tackle away form</h3>
      <p>Part of Pochettino's demise was due to poor away form. Spurs have <b>won just three times on the road since January</b> -- all in the Champions League.Â </p>
      <p>That is not good enough for a side of Tottenham's quality.</p>
      <h3>Convince Harry Kane to stay</h3>
      <p>While the fate of players such as <b>Eriksen, Vertonghen and Alderweireld</b> may be out of his hands, Mourinho needs to convince <b>Harry Kane </b>that his future remains at Spurs.</p>
      <p>The England captain is under contract for plenty of time yet, but he is a superstar of European football and has always said he wants to win things.</p>
      <p>Ideally that would be at Spurs, and his chances of that might just have improved, but it would be a <b>surprise if he were not linked with the super clubs this summer</b>, especially if he has a <b>good Euro 2020.</b></p>
      <p>Mourinho needs to do everything he can to make sure Kane, who had a <b>close relationship with Pochettino</b>, still feels content at the club -- and hopefully winning matches will help to convince him.</p>
