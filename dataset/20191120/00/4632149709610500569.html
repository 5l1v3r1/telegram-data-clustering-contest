      <h1>Easynomics: What does the government have to do with India’s unemployment problem?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bangalore Mirror Bureau</a></address>
      <p>According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the unemployment rate in October 2019 stood at 8.45%. This figure in itself does not explain the gravity of the situation. <br/><br/>While the rate of unemployment in the 15-19 age group stood at 54.7%, it was 37.48% in the 20-24 years age group. And it stood at 12.81% in the 25-29 years age-group. Despite such high rates of unemployment, companies constantly complain about the fact that when they advertise for jobs, they are unable to hire employees with the right skillset and willing to work at the salary on offer. <br/><br/>It seems this is a problem that isn’t just peculiar to India and is prevalent in other parts of the world, including South Africa (where the rate of unemployment among 15-24 age group is greater than 50%), Egypt and countries in the Middle East. <br/><br/>A part of the problem, like most disappointments in life, is a mismatch of expectations that the unemployed youth have, and the situation as it prevails. As Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo write in Good Economics for Hard Times: “They [i.e. the youth] were told that if they studied hard they would get a good job, meaning mostly a desk job or a teaching job. This was closer to the truth in their parents’ generation than it is today… The growth in government jobs slowed and eventually stopped in the face of budgetary pressures.” <br/><br/>In the Indian scenario, the government doesn’t create new jobs on the whole. But the fascination for a government job still remains strong and there is an economic incentive for it as well. As Banerjee and Duflo write: “There are small fraction of jobs that are much more attractive than the rest, for the reasons having nothing to do with productivity. The best example are government jobs… In the poorest countries, public-sector workers earn more than double the average wage in the private sector. And this is not counting generous health and pension benefits.” Also, unlike a private job, the chances of getting fired from a government job are close to zero. <br/><br/>What this ensures is that many individuals spend the best part of their youth preparing and writing exams to get into a government job. As Banerjee and Duflo write: “These young people are mostly waiting for jobs they will not get… If the government jobs stopped being quite so desirable, the economy would gain many years of productive labour… Of course, government jobs are attractive in other countries as well, particularly because they often come with job security. But the wage gap is not quite as large and the queue not nearly as long.” <br/><br/>The cut off age for many government jobs in India runs well into the thirties. Also, the government is quite lenient when it comes to the number of attempts it allows to write exams to get a job. <br/><br/>But given that there are very few government jobs going around at the end of the day, the futility of it all, ultimately hits individuals who cannot see a world beyond a government job. As mentioned earlier, the rate of unemployment in the 25-29 age-group falls to 12.81%. It falls further as people enter their thirties. In the 30-34 age-group, the unemployment rate is at 2.49%. In the 35-39 age-group it falls further to 1.62%. It keeps falling until the age of 60, when it goes up a little. <br/><br/><br/>What this basically means is that as people age, they eventually do start working, once their overall expectations fall in line with what is on offer. <br/>Of course, this is not the only reason why companies are not able to find the kind of employees they are looking for. Even people who have the right degrees and skillset remain a major problem. Every year, a new report tells us that a bulk of India’s engineering graduates are unemployable. Over and above this, many youngsters looking for jobs lack even the most basic educational outcomes, like the ability to read, write and do basic maths. <br/>Clearly, India’s unemployment problem is a lot more than just the love for a government job. <br/><br/><br/><b>(Vivek Kaul is the author of the Easy Money trilogy).</b></p>
