      <p>While chatbots continue to increase user efficiencies, drive conversions and engage consumers, businesses are also reporting significant savings thanks to the technology according to findings from a recent Intercom <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-state-of-chatbots/">study</a>. Business leaders saved an average of $300,000 in 2019 from their chatbots, according to the report. Rising consumer expectations of chatbots show there is plenty of room for improvement.</p>
      <p>The study also surveyed consumers and found that 74% of consumer respondents indicated that they expect to encounter a chatbot on a website, and 87% still prefer chatting with a human instead of a bot.</p>
