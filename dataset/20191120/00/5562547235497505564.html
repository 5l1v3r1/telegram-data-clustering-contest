      <h1>Ricky Rubio Limited As Back Spasms Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>The Phoenix Suns found out five minutes before their Monday night game that starting point guard Ricky Rubio was unable to play as a result of back spasms. Those issues returned against last night, forcing the veteran back to the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Despite missing the first game of Phoenix’s back-to-back against the Boston Celtics, Rubio set out to play Tuesday night against the Sacramento Kings and even started the first half of the ball game.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Suns fans, Rubio struggled to an 0-7 first half and was eventually shut down after just 16 minutes of action. <a href="https://twitter.com/DuaneRankin/status/1197024270926282752?s=20">Duane Rankin of the Arizona Republic</a> reports that it was in fact that back spasms that limited Rubio.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear how the team will handle the injury heading forward given that the spasms returned so quickly after the first bout. Their next game is scheduled for tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>In his first year with the Suns, Rubio has been a major part of the team’s drastic improvement and his absence was felt when he was forced to the sidelines. Despite the consecutive losses without Rubio, Phoenix is still 7-6 on the season.</p>
      <p>In 11 games for the Suns this season, Rubio has averaged 12.5 points and 8.1 assists.</p>
