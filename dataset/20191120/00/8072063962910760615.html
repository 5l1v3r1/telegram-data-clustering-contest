      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE) –</b> Sandals Grande Saint Lucian Spa and Beach Resort recently hosted a health fair for all team members, an ongoing initiative to help the staff maintain a proper level of health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Managing Director Mr. Winston Anderson said Sandals was cognizant of the fact that it was sometimes difficult for team members to find time to do such check-ups, “This is why we brought it to them and I believe the health fair achieved its objective. Team Members were able to receive free health care at their work place from some top local providers, and we must thank our partners for making this possible.”</p>
      <p>Some of the partners included the Bureau of Health Education, various divisions from the Ministry of Health such as Infectious Diseases, the Renal, Substance Abuse and Dental Units, the Saint Lucia Diabetes and Hypertensive Association, the Saint Lucia Planned Parenthood Association, Courts Optical, Kako Products, The Fountain of Life and Frances Rub.</p>

      <p>From head to toe, team members were able to source information about improving their health. By far the most popular area of focus came from the Community Nursing Service, giving Blood Sugar and Blood Pressure testing and Counseling. A total of 185 team members took advantage of this, of which 66 were male and 119 female.</p>
      <p>While 36 team members took the opportunity to visit the Courts Optical booth for Eye Examinations and to browse through the display of frames, 112 team members took tests from the Renal Unit, and benefitted from valuable information and referrals as necessary.</p>
      <p>Other popular booths included the Bureau of Health Education, which provided valuable information on Cholesterol and Diabetes. Additionally, the Infectious Disease booth, where team members went for HIV/Syphilis Rapid Testing was well patronized. Over 63 team members went to get information.</p>
      <p>The KAKO team presented samples of their products to over 60 team members. Another 110 team members sampled from the Fountain of Life Products that were on display.</p>
      <p>Over 234 team members visited the other booths.</p>

      <p>Managers and team members alike were very pleased that this event was organized at the work place which not only gave them free and convenient access to health care, but meant that they did not have to take a day off to do such check-ups, time they can now spend with their families or doing personal business.</p>
      <p>Spa Manager Portia Thompson said, “I always look forward to this event that Sandals Grande hosts for us. It allows me to stay on top of my job and I get really good advice and assistance from medical professionals. I only wish I had made time for my teeth. That one will have to wait.”</p>
      <p>For the first time, the event was held in the staff lobby and restaurant area to allow for easy access, which Event Coordinator Nadiege Smith-Lambert, Acting Health Educator from the Bureau of Health Education, Ministry of Health &amp; Wellness, said, worked very well. “The new location met its objective which was to provide comprehensive health services to staff at a location convenient to them in order to facilitate their attendance. This site was ideal for the services offered and staff took full advantage of the services. We were very pleased at the number of participants visiting or accessing services and or information from each unit.”</p>
