      <p>the Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has advised members of the Institute of Public Analysts of Nigeria on the need to maintain a good laboratory practice.</p>
      <p>Ehanire, who was represented by the Director-General of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Dr Babaunde Salako, at the 28th Mandatory Continuous Professional Development Workshop of the Institute of Public Analysts in Lagos on Tuesday, said that a good laboratory practice would affect a whole country, not just individuals.</p>
      <p>“If your laboratory is well equipped and if you follow the standard operating procedure, what comes out of it will be comparable to international standards. The implication of the results that come out of your laboratory goes wider than the laboratory itself.</p>
      <p>“Some people will take decisions, based on the results that you have provided. Those decisions may affect a whole country and not just a person. For instance, when a medical device is introduced to a country for diagnosis, if you produce a wrong result, you will get the wrong diagnosis. Your patients will also get the  wrong treatment and people will continue to die. It goes beyond what you are doing in the laboratory,” Ehanire said.</p>
      <p>He added that laboratory practice goes beyond what members of the IPAN do in their laboratory and it has a multiplying effect on the people.</p>
      <p>“It is the same thing as food items, people will eat those food and if there is a wrong result, it will have a multiplier effect within the community.</p>
      <p>“ Each time you are analysing a particular agent or device in your laboratory, please remember the community that will use your result and ensure that whatever comes out of your laboratory is authentic and reliable,” the minister said.</p>
      <p> The Registrar of the Institute, Mr Aliyu Angara, said its members provide service that borders on quality certification of consumer and health-related products.</p>
      <p>“The diversity of public analysts across sectors and strata of consumer and health-related products analysis accord the Institute the vantage point of addressing most of these herculean tasks,” Angara said.</p>
