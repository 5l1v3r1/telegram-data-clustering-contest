      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:06:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/chris-rierson/" target="_blank">Chris Rierson</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Be a kitchen wizard and save up to 35% on KitchenAid <a href="https://zdcs.link/xNpKx">blenders</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVwrp">food processors</a> at Amazon before Black Friday even begins.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Take a look around that kitchen. What do you see? Like most folks, the basics probably adorn your counter top: microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. Which is fine, if you want to be basic. </p>
      <p>But now that you've binged <i>The Great British Baking Show </i>and exhausted the entirety of <i>America's Test Kitchen, </i>basic simply won't do. You need the right appliances at the right price to give your kitchen the glow-up it deserves and get cooking.</p>
      <p>Amazon is a great place to find pre-Black Friday deals of up to 35% off KitchenAid blenders and food processors to get you prepping those fancy meals like a pro. And with free shipping included, you'll save even more to make your budget sing. </p>
      <p>For starters, try a versatile <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVwrp">KitchenAid 7-cup food processor</a> for only $64.99 — on sale from $99.95. You'll chop, slice, puree, and shred everything in site with this handy, easy-to-clean, all-purpose kitchen tool. That means sauces, salsas, and spice mixes are a breeze to create. Plus, it is compact and easy to store to keep that counter clutter to a minimum.  </p>

      <p>Or, add a little extra oomph to the proceedings with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/xNpKx">KitchenAid 56-ounce countertop blender</a> for $179.99 —  a cool $70 off the normal price of $249.99. That means you get more horsepower to crush ice for those killer after-dinner cocktails, or roll out a quick morning smoothie packed full of fruits and veggies to get over last night's killer cocktails. Or maybe make some soup, because who doesn't like soup?</p>

      <p>If you really want to kick things up a notch, there are other early Black Friday alternatives from Amazon, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PXBR">Hamilton Beach professional-grade 14-cup dicing food processor</a>, discounted to $156. Normally $199.99, that's a great kitchen upgrade that also makes a worthy gift for the closet-chef in your life. It comes with five attachments for kneading, chopping, and all that other fun stuff, plus a storage case and bowl. It's like having your own robot sous chef at your beck and call.  </p>
      <p>The point is, you have plenty of options right now to help you cut down on all that food prep time so you can actually get to the eating part.</p>
