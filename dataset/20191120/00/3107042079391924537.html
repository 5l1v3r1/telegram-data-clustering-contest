      <p>Australian academic Tim Weeks has been released by the Taliban, along with his American colleague Kevin King, three years after they were abducted in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Mr Weeks (50) and Mr King (63), who were grabbed outside the American University in Kabul in 2016, were freed in exchange for three members of the Taliban's Haqqani Network.</p>
      <p>The two men were handed over to US forces in Afghanistan's southern Zabul province and flown out in a US helicopter, The Associated Press reports.</p>
      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham indicated Mr Weeks, from Wagga Wagga in NSW, was in the care of US officials and receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>Mr Weeks' father Mervyn was notified of his release in a phone call from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>
      <p>Mervyn Weeks told the ABC he was very relieved but that he had yet to speak to his son and was unsure of his whereabouts and plans.</p>
      <p>A Weeks' family statement on Tuesday night asking for privacy.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful for the efforts of the Australian government in securing Tim's release," it read.</p>
      <p>"We would like to thank the United States government for the significant role it played in securing Tim's freedom and acknowledge the important contribution of the government of Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>"We thank our friends and extended family for their love and support over the past three years during this very difficult time.</p>
      <p>"While we understand the intense public interest in Tim's release, we do not want to comment further."</p>
      <p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison late on Tuesday night tweeted his relief at Mr Weeks' release and said he was "profoundly pleased".</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison issued a joint statement with Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne which thanked US President Donald Trump and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.</p>
      <p>"We regard this release as one of a series of confidence-building measures that are taking place in Afghanistan. We hope that such measures will set the stage for a ceasefire and intra-Afghan dialogue," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Mr King's family released a statement saying he was also safe with US officials and getting the medical care he needs before his return home to be reunited with his family.</p>
