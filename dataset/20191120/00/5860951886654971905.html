      <p>A previous outbreak of surgical site infections with VIM-producing carbapenem-resistant <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (VIM-CRPA) primarily associated with bariatric surgery at Grand View Hospital was deemed over and CDC removed its travel advisory.</p>
      <p>However, CDC and multiple state and local health departments continue to receive reports of VIM-CRPA infections in patients following surgeries and invasive procedures at several different hospitals in Tijuana. Five cases of VIM-CRPA infections have been identified in patients with healthcare exposures in Tijuana-area hospitals and subsequently hospitalized in San Diego. The most recent case had a surgery in a Tijuana-area hospital in August 2019.</p>
