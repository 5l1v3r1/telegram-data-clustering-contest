      </p>
      <p>A Tanzanian court on Wednesday postponed the hearing for the eighth time of a prominent Tanzanian journalist arrested in July.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Dar es Salaam-based journalist Erick Kabendera in July and he was charged in August with leading organized crime, failing to pay taxes and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Mr Kabendera’s lawyers reject the charges. His lawyers and rights groups say the case is politically motivated.</p>
      <p>Mr Kabendera’s trial has not begun. At each of the eight hearings since August, prosecutors have told the court that investigations were not complete.</p>
      <p>Last month, Kabendera’s lawyer Jebra Kambole told the court that he is pursuing a plea bargain. On Wednesday, Mr Kambole told the court that the process had not reached a conclusion.</p>
