      <h1>Open Source Kitchen Helps You Watch What You Eat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/dammitcoetzee/" target="_blank">Gerrit Coetzee</a></address>
      <p>Every appliance business wants to be the one that invents the patented, license-able, and profitable standard that all the other companies have to use. <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/165563-sk-squirrel">Open Source Kitchen wants to beat them to it. </a></p>
      <p>Every beginning standard needs a test case, and OSK’s is a simple one. A bowl that tracks what you eat. While a simple concept, the way in which the data is shared, tracked, logged, and communicated is the real goal.</p>
      <p>The current demo uses a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/08/26/step-up-your-jetson-nano-game-with-these-printable-accessories/">Nvidia Jetson Nano</a> as its processing center. This $100 US board packs a bit of a punch in its weight class. It processes the video from a camera held above the bowl of fruit, suspended by a scale in a squirrel shaped hangar, determining the calories in and calories out.</p>
      <p>It’s an interesting idea. One wonders how the IoT boom might have played out if there had been a widespread standard ready to go before people started walling their gardens.</p>
