      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE) –</b> Following a dynamic year of award-winning marketing campaigns, new events, and hotel openings, The Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority is excited to be celebrating an even greater milestone.</p>
      <p>By December 2019, Antigua and Barbuda Tourism stayover arrivals would have reached over 300,000. And, with the launch of a new ‘Come home’ sweepstakes, the Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority is inviting the Antiguan and Barbudan diaspora to join in on the celebrations.</p>
      <p>“The destination has received tremendous growth since 2018, and we are proud to know that by December 2019, we would have met and surpassed our target of 300,000 stay-over visitor arrivals,” said Antigua and Barbuda Minister of Tourism, The Honourable Charles Fernandez. “We have to recognise each and every one employed in the tourism industry, who have welcomed visitors to our shores and whose deliverance of quality customer care ensures our visitors have an amazing experience while they are here.”</p>
      <p>“Reaching 300,000 stay-over tourism arrivals is a significant milestone,” said CEO of the Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority Colin C. James. “We have incredible partnerships with stakeholders throughout the industry, who have been instrumental in bringing us to this milestone, and who are as committed as we are to driving tourism growth.”</p>
      <p>As Antigua and Barbuda Tourism officials push to reach the 300,000 mark, the Antigua and Barbuda Tourism Authority has launched a sweepstake specifically targeted to the global diaspora.</p>
      <p>“The Antigua and Barbuda diaspora are travelers too. And we are inviting them to ‘Come home in December’ to reconnect with family and friends, and ring in the new decade in Antigua and Barbuda,” said James.</p>
      <p>The ‘Come Home in December’ promotion entices Antiguans and Barbudans living abroad to come home during the month of December for a chance to win a free 3-night, 4-day trip back to Antigua during summer of 2020. The promotion officially kicks-off today, November 20, 2019.</p>
      <p>The sweepstake is open to citizens of Antigua and Barbuda living abroad and persons of Antiguan and Barbudan heritage. Persons must enter on the www.visitantiguabarbuda.com website and be able to prove booking and travel between December 1 and December 31, 2019.

Winners will be selected by random drawing and will be expected to show proof of citizenship and heritage or lineage.
