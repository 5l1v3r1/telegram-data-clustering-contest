      <p><b>BorgWarner (NYSE: BWA)</b>, an automotive components company that is best known for its power train components, has seen its stock rally by close to 40% over the last three months. Part of the increase was driven by the company’s stronger-than-expected Q3 2019 results, with EPS coming in at $0.96 per share, well ahead of consensus of $0.85. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year guidance. While the auto market has been facing some headwinds with growth cooling, BorgWarner sales have been outperforming the industry-driven partly by its higher exposure to hybrid and electric. The company’s exposure to the trade war between the U.S and China is also relatively limited. We ‘step back’ from these recent swings to review BorgWarner’s<b><i> </i></b>performance over the last few years, as a context for what might come next.
