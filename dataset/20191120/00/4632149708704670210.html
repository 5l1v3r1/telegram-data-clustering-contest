      <p><i>Symptoms can appear weeks before a heart attack occurs — and knowing them could save a life<br/></i><br/>A heart attack is a serious medical emergency, which requires immediate attention. If you’ve experienced one yourself or have a loved one who has suffered a heart attack, you know it can be a frightening and devastating experience. A heart attack, medically known as a myocardial infarction, is when the supply of blood to the heart becomes blocked. It can seriously damage the heart muscle and prove to be fatal. <br/><br/>Based on a UK report, here are warning signs which people may experience a month before having a heart attack, or even earlier: <br/><br/><b>Fatigue</b> <br/>One of the main symptoms, which can indicate an impending heart attack, is experiencing unusual levels of fatigue. Performing simple tasks like making a bed or taking a shower can become noticeably more difficult and levels of fatigue increase by the end of the day. Women are more likely to report this symptom than men. <br/><br/><b>Abdominal pain</b> <br/>Another common symptom is abdominal pains — also stomach nausea, feeling bloated or an upset stomach. Before a heart attack, the pains will usually come in waves, easing and returning for short periods of time. <br/><br/><b>Chest pains</b> <br/>In men, chest pain is one of the most important early signs, which should not be ignored. But it only affects 30 per cent of women. Feelings can be permanent or temporary and include uncomfortable sensations in one or both arms (more often the left), the jaw, neck, shoulders and stomach. <br/><br/><b>Insomnia</b> <br/>Symptoms include difficulty going to sleep, staying asleep and early-morning wake-ups. These are associated with an increased risk of heart attack <br/>or stroke. It can include feeling high levels of anxiety and absentmindedness, and is more common among women. <br/><br/><b>Shortness of breath</b> <br/>Dyspnea, or breathlessness, gives the feeling of not being able to draw enough breath, and can also leave you feeling dizzy. <br/><br/>It often occurs in both men and women up to six months before a heart attack, giving a warning sign of a medical condition. <br/><br/><b>Hair loss</b> <br/>Losing hair can be another indicator and most commonly affects men over 50. <br/><br/>Women can also be at risk and close attention should be paid to losing hair from the crown of your head. <br/><br/><b>Irregular heartbeat</b> <br/>Skipped beats or an irregular heartbeat often come with panic attacks and anxiety, especially among women. <br/><br/><b>The irregular beats last for <br/></b><br/>1-2 minutes and can cause dizziness and extreme fatigue. In this case, experts recommends calling a doctor right away. <br/><br/><b>Excessive sweating</b> <br/>Unusual or excessive perspiration can be an early warning sign of a heart attack and can occur at any time, day or night. It affects women more often and can be confused with hot flashes or night sweats, typical of menopause. <br/><br/><br/>One may also experience flu-like symptoms, which include clammy skin and sweatiness regardless or temperature or physical exertion. Sweating seems to be more excessive at night.</p>
