      <p>SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares lost out to safe-harbour bonds on Wednesday as Sino-U.S. trade talks produced nothing but white noise, while concerns about a supply glut left oil prices nursing their biggest one-day loss in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>Graphic: Asian stock markets - https://product.datastream.com/dscharting/gateway.aspx?guid=516bc8cb-b44e-4346-bce3-06590d8e396b&amp;action=REFRESH</p>
      <p>Figures from the American Petroleum Institute out late Tuesday showed a far larger rise in crude stocks than expected. That followed reports Russia was unlikely to deepen its cuts to crude output.</p>
      <p>Brent crude (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/brent-oil">LCOc1</a>) futures eased another 10 cents to $60.81 a barrel, after sliding 2.6% overnight, while U.S. crude (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">CLc1</a>) dipped 2 cents to $55.19.</p>
      <p>The mood in share markets was sombre with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/ac-asia-p-xjp">MIAPJ0000PUS</a>) off 0.7%. Japan's Nikkei (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/japan-ni225">N225</a>) fell 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/csi300">CSI300</a>) 0.5%.</p>
      <p>Australia's main index (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/aus-200">AXJO</a>) sank 1.3% led by the banks after the country's financial crime regulator alleged Westpac had breached laws on over 23 million instances and applied for civil penalties against the lender.</p>
      <p>E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures">ESc1</a>) shed 0.2% and EUROSTOXX 50 futures (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/eu-stocks-50-futures">STXEc1</a>) 0.2%.</p>
      <p>The prospects for progress on trade dimmed when China condemned a U.S. Senate measure on Hong Kong, vowing to take the steps necessary to safeguard its sovereignty and security.</p>
      <p>The Senate unanimously passed legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Late Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to raise tariffs further if China would not agree to a deal that he liked.</p>
      <p>The aggressive tone unsettled Wall Street and the Dow (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30">DJI</a>) ended down 0.36%, while the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">SPX</a>) lost 0.06% and the Nasdaq (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite">IXIC</a>) added 0.24%.</p>
      <p>Dour forecasts from retailers Home Depot (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/home-depot">HD</a>) and Kohl's fuelled worries about consumer spending, while the energy sector (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/s-p-500-energy">SPNY</a>) was the S&amp;P's biggest loser as oil slid.</p>
      <p>COUNTING DOWN TO FED MINUTES</p>
      <p>"The immediate focus remains on the U.S.-China trade talks, and markets seem reluctant to move much in either direction until they are resolved," wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.</p>
      <p>"It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook."</p>
      <p>Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries (<a href="https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield">US10YT=RR</a>) dropped further to a two-week trough of 1.75%, with a marked flattening of the curve hinting at a possible return of recession fears.</p>
      <p>The dip in yields nudged the dollar down on the safe-haven Japanese yen and it was last at 108.47 , though still within the 107.87 to 109.48 range of the last five weeks.</p>
      <p>The euro held at $1.1074 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">EUR=</a>) but faced chart resistance around $1.1090. The dollar was steadier on a basket of currencies at 97.886 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar">DXY</a>).</p>
      <p>Investors now await minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting where it cut interest rates and signalled a pause for the time being.</p>
      <p>"The minutes will elaborate on the Fed's view that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have eased, and that a 'material reassessment' of the economic outlook will be needed for it to cut rates again," said Joseph Capurso, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>"We see the FOMC now on hold until March, 2020."</p>
      <p>The market has all but given up on the prospect of an easing in December, which is now priced at just 0.8%. A move in March is put at a probability of around 42%.</p>
      <p>The risk-off tone left <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/xau-usd">spot gold</a> a shade firmer at $1,474.30 per ounce .</p>
