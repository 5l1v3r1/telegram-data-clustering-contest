      <h1>Govt to pay billions for innovation, research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:06:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:06</time> by <a rel="author">OUR REPORTER</a></address>
      <p>With about Shs 500bn, President Yoweri Museveni has made the biggest cash injection yet into the Innovation Fund set up to help Ugandan researchers and innovators patent and commercialize their products.</p>
      <p>Dr. Elioda Tumwesigye, the minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, announced the presidential cash donation during the inauguration of Uganda’s first National Steering Committee for the Research and Innovation programme last week.</p>
      <p>He said the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) government is committed to financing the commercialization of Uganda’s innovations to create jobs and promote industrialization.</p>
      <p>While addressing the 11-member committee at the ministry head office in Kampala, Tumwesigye said now that governance structures for the Innovation Fund have been set up, the committee members led by Prof  William Bazeyo will start putting in place procedures and criteria to be followed in selecting beneficiaries. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Who is to benefit</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Innovators in both the formal and informal sectors shall be eligible to access money from the Innovation Fund. Already Shs 10bn has been released to operationalize the Fund and the first beneficiaries should come on board by January next year. The ministry shall send out calls in the national and regional media, websites and social media for innovators and researchers to apply for funds from the Innovation Fund,” the minister said.</p>
      <p>Tumwesigye said government will set up technology hubs, innovation parks and incubation centres in municipal councils and universities across the country to help homemade innovations mature into commercial products that can be marketed anywhere in the world, create jobs and generate income.</p>
      <p>“Government recognizes the role of science, technology and innovation (ST&amp;I) as fundamental drivers of socio-economic growth and transformation and that’s why the ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MoSTI) was set up in 2016. The ministry has developed a National Research and Innovation Program (NRIP) Framework which was approved by cabinet early this year,” the minister explained.</p>
      <p>He said the main goal of the National Research and Innovation Programme is to promote research and development, technology incubation and technology commercialization activities.</p>
      <p>Dr Tumwesigye said the new and first national steering committee for research and innovation is a competence-based pool of eleven (11) independent seasoned experts and practitioners, who include five women. Each member has an impeccable track record of at least 15 years of proven continuous excellence in their professional domain.</p>
      <p>The committee membership is comprised of professionals in the fields of agriculture and allied sciences; computer science, electronics and informatics; energy and minerals; industrial science (engineering and technology); medical science (human and veterinary medicine); natural and environmental science; physical science; social sciences and humanities; and economics, finance, investment and law.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who the members are</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr. William Bazeyo (acting chairman), Prof. Vinand Nantulya, Dr. Grace Nambatya, Dr. Cyprian Ebong , David Bikhado Ofungi, Barbra Mulwana, Prof Enos Kiremire (has eight patented innovations to his name), Jane Okot p’ Bitek Langoya, Annabella Habinka Ejiri, Vincent Kedi and Wardah Mummy and Rajab Gyagenda.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The functions of the committee</b>
      </p>
      <p>The committee will manage the National Research and Innovation Programme and identify key tracts to benefit from the National Research and Innovation Programme on an annual basis, among other roles.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of committee members, Dr William Bazeyo, the acting chairman, thanked the minister for setting up the committee to operationalise the Innovation Fund and said his members were eager to serve their country by promoting the growth and commercialisation of Uganda’s innovations.</p>
      <p>Bazeyo, who is a renowned researcher and innovator, said through Makerere they have developed a unique tent, the first of its kind, where doctors and relatives can get in contact with Ebola patients without contracting the deadly decease. </p>
      <p>He said they have also funded the commercialisation of many innovations including the pedal tap which saves water and is now being exported to Kigali.</p>
