        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>So Roger Stone was convicted of lying to Congress (“Roger Stone criminal trial attended by a parade of ‘alt-right’ personalities,” Web, Nov. 17). Wait a minute — I thought a “liar” who was convicted of lying to liars was forgiven for 1,000 years.</p>
      <p>After the years of lying during the Obama administration, we had to deal with the liars on the Mueller investigation — and now we must deal with the lying “whistleblower.” I can’t believe the American people will give the Democrats any credibility or votes in 2020.</p>
      <p>Roger Stone should be pardoned by President Trump, along with Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and anyone else who was railroaded by the socialist Democrats.</p>
      <p>The victims should be paid for their time in jail and their legal-fee expenses. I’m sick of these manufactured crimes.</p>
