      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - Jarrett Allen had 22 points and 17 rebounds, and the Brooklyn Nets beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Charlotte Hornets</a> 101-91 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie added 20 points apiece for Brooklyn, which was without Kyrie Irving for the third straight game because of a right shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>Terry Rozier had 18 points and Devonte’ Graham added 17 for Charlotte, which lost its second straight game.</p>
      <p>Charlotte held the Nets to two points through the first five minutes of the fourth quarter to cut the deficit to 84-81. But the Nets regrouped. Prince’s driving layup gave the Nets a 95-86 lead with 3:28 remaining and they never looked back.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn held the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charlotte-hornets/">Hornets</a> to 73 points, the fewest the Nets have allowed through three quarters this season, to take a nine-point lead into the fourth quarter. Allen led the Nets with 11 points in the third.</p>

No. I don’t think he can play through it right now quite honestly. That’s where we are. We’ll see where that goes.” … Caris LeVert (right thumb surgery) is also out for Brooklyn.</p>
