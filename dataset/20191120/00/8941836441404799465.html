      <p>BENI, Congo (AP) - Congo’s army says rebels have killed at least eight people and kidnapped about a dozen others in an attack in the eastern city of Beni.</p>
      <p>Residents angered by the ongoing violence have attacked trucks belonging to the United Nations peacekeeping mission and barricaded roads.</p>
      <p>Army spokesman Mak Hazukay Mongba says the Allied Democratic Forces rebels staged the assault overnight Tuesday into Wednesday. He says the army fought back and pushed out the rebels.</p>
      <p>Mongba says the rebels are trying to kidnap residents to dissuade them from cooperating with the army and sharing intelligence that has helped a new military offensive.</p>
