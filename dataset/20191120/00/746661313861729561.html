      <p><b>ISLAMABAD</b>: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said the government would benefit from the expertise of China in the field of agriculture by introducing technology and innovation to increase productivity.</p>
      <p>In a meeting with Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar here at the PM Office, the prime minister said agriculture was a major contributor in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with fifty percent of national workforce affiliated with this sector.</p>
      <p>Khusro Bakhtiar took the oath of his new portfolio on Tuesday after his earlier Ministry of Planning and Reforms was handed over to Member National Assembly Asad Umar.</p>
      <p>The prime minister lauded the services of Khusro Bakhtiar as planning minister in expediting the implementation of the projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).</p>
      <p>He said Khusro Bakhtiar was given new responsibilities since the second phase of CPEC covered important areas including agriculture besides poverty alleviation, industry, energy and communications.</p>
      <p>Imran Khan expressed confidence that the minister would converge his energies on bringing improvement in the field of agriculture.</p>
