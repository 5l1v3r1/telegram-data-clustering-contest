      <h1>Jose Mourinho: Miracle worker or busted flush?</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho, the new man in the Tottenham hot seat, is back in the Premier League with a point to prove.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Portuguese is a serial winner across Europe </b>but his reputation was badly tarnished in the final few months of his Manchester United reign, which ended late last year.</p>
      <p>The man who charmed English football when he arrived as a fresh-faced manager at Chelsea in 2004, labelling himself the "Special One", left Old Trafford last December under a dark cloud.</p>
      <p><b>Now Mourinho has a chance to prove his doubters wrong at a club without any silverware since 2008</b> but with a sparkling new stadium and a squad of players who reached the Champions League final in June.</p>
      <p>"I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," said the 56-year-old, hours after Mauricio Pochettino was shown the door.</p>
      <p>"<b>The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me</b>. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's arrival in English football from Champions League winners Porto had a seismic effect.</p>
      <p><b>He put Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich's billions to spectacular use</b> to end the Arsenal-Manchester United duopoly, winning the Premier League title in his first season and repeating the feat the following year before things turned sour.</p>
      <p>Next stop was Inter Milan, who became the first Italian side to complete the treble of league, cup and Champions League.</p>
      <p>At Real Madrid he tussled with Pep Guardiola's great Barcelona side, winning the league title in 2012.</p>
      <p>He failed to lead them to European glory, although he did take them to three straight Champions League semi-finals after six years without winning a knockout tie in the competition.</p>
      <p>In June 2013, Chelsea appointed Mourinho -- now the "Happy One" -- as manager for the second time.</p>

      <p>He won a <b>third Premier League title in his second season</b> in charge before a poor start to the next campaign cost him his job.</p>
      <p>Even though he failed to win the league title at Old Trafford he still added the Europa League and the League Cup to United's trophy cabinet.</p>
      <p>However, in the irritable final months of his tenure there, <b>Mourinho fell out with senior squad members including Paul Pogba</b>, blamed his superiors for a lack of backing in the transfer market and oversaw a drastic deterioration in performances and results on the pitch.</p>
      <p>Mourinho did little to help himself, particularly in a short-lived third season, which has become an unwanted hallmark of his managerial career.</p>
      <p>Although he suffered damage to his reputation, the <b>Spurs appointment shows his stock is still high</b>, with chairman Daniel Levy hailing him as "one of the most successful managers in football".</p>
      <p>But he now brings baggage as well as trophy-winning nous. Will Spurs fans get to witness the "Special One" or, perhaps, the "Surly One"?</p>
      <p>When the Portuguese joined United, there were questions about how his pragmatic approach would fit in with their famous culture of attacking football nurtured under Alex Ferguson.</p>
      <p>Those questions did not go away as he failed to recapture the Premier League title.</p>
      <p><b>He will face the same issues at Tottenham, with the club wedded to a tradition of flair and exciting forward play, summed up in their slogan, "To Dare is To Do"</b>.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has slipped down football's managerial pecking order in recent years, behind Manchester City boss Guardiola and Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>But he has been handed a golden chance to rediscover the magic formula that brought him an avalanche of honours earlier in his career and <b>give fans the silverware they crave after a grand total of two League Cups since 1991</b>.</p>
