      <p>INDIANOLA, Miss. (AP) - Work is starting on a $2.5 million expansion of a Mississippi Delta museum dedicated to a native son who became a blues legend.</p>
      <p>A groundbreaking ceremony was held Tuesday for new space at the B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center in Indianola.</p>
      <p>The museum opened in 2008 near the area where King grew up. The 15-time Grammy winner died in 2015 and is buried on the museum grounds.</p>
      <p>The 4,500-square-foot (418-square-meter) addition will house King’s tour bus and two of his vehicles, a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow and a custom painted Chevy El Camino.</p>
