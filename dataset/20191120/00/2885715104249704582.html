      <p>Close on the heels of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel announcing a tariff hike, Reliance Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries, on Tuesday hinted that it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules.</p>
      <p>“We understand that TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation process for revision of telecom tariffs. Like other operators, we will also work with the government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,” Jio said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“While ensuring Jio’s commitment to a sustainable sector, Jio will compete on the basis of quality and service in the marketplace and as a customer-obsessed organization, we will always provide the best service to all our customers,” Jio said. “Jio will always keep the customer at the centre of everything and ensure that the customer continues to benefit the most. Jio is committed to helping India to sustain its global leadership as the world’s largest data market,” it said.  However, Jio did not divulge the extent of price hike in the offing.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — reeling under huge losses — announced plans to increase tariffs for customers from December 1. Both players reported massive losses in the quarter ending September 2019, with combined losses standing at 74,000 crore.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Airtel said they will increase prices from December itself in order to keep the business viable. Vodafone Idea said that its ability to continue business will depend on reliefs sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has.</p>
      <p>Jio underlined its commitment to bringing the 40 crore 2G customers to experience and participate fully in the Digital India ecosystem, and pledged its full support to providing the best quality and experience to all its customers. “Like other operators, we will also work with the government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption, and sustains investments,” Jio said.</p>
