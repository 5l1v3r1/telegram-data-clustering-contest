      <p>The UFC’s final pay-per-view event, UFC 245, is creeping up on us. The fight card, which features three title bouts, takes place on December 14 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. With one other card between now and UFC 245, the promotion has begun its promotional push for what is, on paper, one of the biggest fight cards of 2019.In the main event, Kamaru Usman defends his welterweight title against former interim 170-pound titleholder Colby Covington. Usman won the belt in March with a unanimous decision win over Tyron Woodley. Usman is unbeaten in 10 fights with the UFC. He began his career with the promotion by winning season 21 of “The Ultimate Fighter” in 2015. Covington is 10-1 in the UFC. He has won his past seven fights and is coming off an August decision win over ex-welterweight champion Robbie Lawler.</p>
      <p>In the co-main event, featherweight kingpin Max Holloway looks to make his fourth successful defense of the 145-pound title he won in 2017 when he defeated Jose Aldo by knockout in June 2017. Holloway’s opponent is Alexander Volkanovski, who is a perfect 7-0 since he joined the promotion in 2016.</p>
      <p>The third title fight on the ESPN+ streaming pay-per-view card sees two-division women’s champion Amanda Nunes put her 135-pound title on the line against ex-women’s featherweight champion Germaine de Randamie. These two met in 2013 on a UFC Fight for the Troops event. Nunes won that bout by first-round knockout. </p>
      <p>Expect the UFC to put all of its promotional muscle behind the final pay-per-view card of 2019. </p>
      <p>UFC 245 takes place at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on December 14. The five-fight pay-per-view card streams on ESPN+, following three prelims on ESPN2 and four early prelims on ESPN+ and UFC Fight Pass. Watch the first promotional video for UFC 245 right here.</p>
