      <p>FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) - A federal judge has ruled a former University of Arkansas student can move ahead with a lawsuit alleging school officials acted with “deliberate indifference” after she reported being sexually assaulted by another student in her dorm room.</p>
      <p>U.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes III’s ruling on Monday came after University of Arkansas attorneys filed a motion seeking summary judgment in favor of the university.</p>
      <p>The woman describes the October 2014 attack in a Title IX lawsuit she filed in 2016. University spokesman Mark Rushing says the facts will show that the university promptly assisted the plaintiff, addressed the alleged misconduct and expelled the other student.</p>
      <p>The plaintiff’s attorney, George Rozzell, declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports a jury trial in the case is scheduled for March.</p>
