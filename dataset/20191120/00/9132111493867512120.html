      <p>Former Governor of the Bank of Ghana and Finance Minister Dr. Kwabena Duffuor has rejected claims suggesting he was part of financiers of the 2016 election campaign of the incumbent NPP.</p>
      <p>A news story published by mynewsgh.com alleged that the founder of defunct Unibank had been dropped from the candidates for running mates for NDC flagbearer John Mahama because he had bankrolled the election campaign of their rival party (NPP).</p>
      <p>But in a letter copied to www.ghanaweb.com, Dr. Duffuor described the reports as false and a figment of the writer’s imagination.</p>
      <p>Reacting to a different story headlined “Mahama’s running mate: Rawlings kicks against Kwesi Ahwoi as Duffuor begs to be considered” carried out by the same online portal, he stressed that he had not contacted Mr Rawlings or Mahama in that regard.</p>
      <p>Dr. Duffuor also stated that he has not had any discussions with any other parties concerning the choice of a running mate for Mr. John Mahama.</p>
      <p>The race for the selection of a running mate for the NDC remains widely opened and heavily contested although no formal communication has been made concerning the shortlisted candidates.</p>
      <p>Several names of prominent members of the party are being speculated.</p>
      <p>Some of the names which have popped up include Dr. Johnson Asiama, Dr. Kwesi Botchwey, Hannah Tetteh, Marrietta Brew Appiah Oppong, Prof. Jane Naana O. Agyemang, the youngest of the Ahwoi brothers among others.</p>
      <p>Others including the incumbent party General Secretary Johnson Asiedu Nketia has not shied away from his intentions.</p>
