      <h1>Huawei will charge you $1,000 to replace the Mate X screen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Huawei released the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_mate_x-9605.php">Mate X</a> with an outwards foldable screen at an eye-watering price tag of CNY16,999, which is the equivalent of $2,400 or €2,200. Today the company revealed the repair cost for some of the parts of the device and those aren't cheap either.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the display panel is the costliest bit - it will be CNY7,080, which is the equivalent of exactly $1,007 or €909. The next most expensive thing is the chipset, which would set you back almost half as much - CNY3,579 ($510/€460).</p>

      <p>A new battery would cost CNY278 ($39/€35), the shell of the phone is CN361 ($50/€45), while the camera combo is CNY698 ($100/€90).</p>
      <p>These are the official prices that Huawei will charge you, meaning they include the labor and part cost. However, since the phone is China-only, the costs are also adapted for the domestic market - they are likely to increase when/if the Huawei Mate X appears on the global scene.</p>

      <p>So there you have it - if you do get a Huawei Mate X, make sure you look after it well. Those foldable screens are known for being easy to scratch and being on the outside will mean it needs to be handled with care.</p>
