      <p>The Congress-Nationalist Congress Party alliance on Wednesday gave its most categorical indication about joining hands with arch rival Shiv Sena with former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan expressing confidence of forming a "stable" government soon in the state after a marathon meeting of senior leaders of the two parties in New Delhi.</p>

      <p>While the Congress leader hoped that political uncertainty will soon end in Maharashtra, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik was unambiguous about the need to join hands with the Sena, asserting that a government cannot be formed in the state without the three parties coming together.</p>
      <p>This is the most emphatic public statement by the Congress-NCP combine about their intent to join hands with the Sena to form government.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters after a marathon meeting at NCP supremo Sharad Pawar's residence in New Delhi, both leaders said the current spell of President's rule in the state has brought administration to a standstill, and the two parties are confident of ending this.</p>
      <p>The announcement, which is likely to end whatever little doubt remained over whether the Congress will back the Sena or not amid reports of opposition to such an alliance by a section of its leaders, came a day after Pawar met Congress president Sonia Gandhi.</p>
      <p>Senior Congress leaders Ahmad Patel and Mallikarjun Kharge were part of the nearly four-hour-long deliberations held at Pawar's residence.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Pawar had called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss farmers' issues in Maharashtra.</p>

      <p>Chavan, though, added that some aspects of the likely alliance are still being discussed.</p>
      <p>"We had a long and positive discussion... We are confident that we will soon be able to give a stable government in Maharashtra," he said.</p>
      <p>The Sena may get the post of chief minister in such a formation, sources had indicated earlier.</p>
      <p>The state was plunged into political crisis after the Sena broke its three-decade ties with the BJP after its partner refused to accede to its demand of sharing the chief minister's post.</p>
      <p>The BJP and Sena, which fought the October 21 assembly polls in alliance, had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats, respectively, in the 288-member assembly.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Sena then began talks with the Congress-NCP alliance.</p>
