      <h1>House Dems tap Maloney to be Oversight Committee’s first female chair</h1>

      <p>Manhattan Rep. Carolyn Maloney Tuesday cleared her first hurdle to become chair of the powerful House Oversight Committee, succeeding the late Rep. Elijah Cummings.</p>
      <p>Maloney got the nomination from the House Democratic steering committee in a meeting Tuesday afternoon and the full Democratic caucus will finalize the vote on her chairmanship Wednesday.</p>
      <p>She’d become the first female leader of the Oversight Committee at a critical time of the impeachment inquiry and intense investigations into President Trump.</p>
      <p>Maloney has been acting chair since Cumming’s sudden death. But she <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/rep-maloney-is-fighting-to-be-a-chair-of-impeachment-committee/">faced three other challengers</a> in a spirited run off for the permanent position.</p>
      <p>Maloney beat Rep. Gerald Connolly (D-Va.) in the second round of voting 36-16, according to a Democratic aide. The initial round of votes was a four-way runoff run with Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) and Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), Connolly and Maloney.</p>
      <p>Maloney’s ascension <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/11/new-york-now-has-5-house-members-leading-committees/">makes five New York chairs</a> — the most in modern history.</p>
      <p>Joining Maloney are Rep. Jerry Nadler at the Judiciary Committee; Rep. Nita Lowey at Appropriations; Rep. Eliot Engel at Foreign Affairs and Rep. Nydia Velázquez, as chair of the House Small Business Committee.</p>
