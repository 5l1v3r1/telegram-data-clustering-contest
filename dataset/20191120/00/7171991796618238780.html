      <h1>Fast Fresnel Hack Embiggens The Smallest Of Heads</h1>

      <p>Aside from frightening small children, we have absolutely no idea why anyone would need <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZY-zelPNmtw">a face-magnifying headpiece</a>. But the video below gives us a chuckle every time we see it, and we figure a good laugh that incorporates a quick optics hack is worth a look.</p>
      <p>When he’s not playing geek in a box, [Curious Marc]’s videos usually have more of a retrocomputing theme, like his <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/04/vintage-terminal-converted-for-galactic-use-in-time-for-may-the-fourth/">recent conversion of a vintage terminal to a character set from a made-up language</a>, or <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/06/18/manufacturing-new-connectors-for-the-apollo-guidance-computer/">helping to revive an Apollo Guidance Computer</a>. Given gems like those, we were surprised to learn that [Marc]’s background is physics – optics, to be precise – and that he studied at École Polytechnique, the same school famed physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel attended. Which fits right into this build since it features one of those large, plastic Fresnel lenses. After a fascinating detour into the history of Fresnel’s namesake lens, [Marc] proceeds with the build.</p>
      <p>It’s simplicity itself – a box big enough to wear on the head with one end replaced by the Fresnel lens. A strip of LEDs – warm white, please, lest the wearer takes on a deathly pall – lines the edge of the box just behind the lens. If you want to get fancy, maybe attaching a hard-hat suspension piece would make it more wearable, but even as is it’s just a hoot to see someone with a magnified and distorted head walking around. One probably should be careful not to look at the sun while wearing this, however, for reasons that become apparent beginning at the 3:24 mark of the video.</p>
      <p>Thanks to [Marc] for perhaps the oddest YouTube face-reveal yet, and for a great idea for a quick cosplay hack.</p>
