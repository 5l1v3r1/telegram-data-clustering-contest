      <h1>Kogan Share Price Down 7% Despite Chief Christmas Cheer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Kogan.com share price dropped by 7% following the companies Annual General Meeting where chief executive Ruslan Kogan expressed his Christmas cheer heading into the holiday sales period despite the decline.</p>
      <p>Mr Kogan shared his positive assessment of the online retailer’s sale outlooks, indicating strong momentum as they head into the Christmas period with a massive 1.662 million active customer base.</p>
      <p>Despite the optimism, Kogan share prices fell by 7% to $7.09 a share.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Kogan gross sales were up 12% to $551.8 million, with EBITDA up 15.6% to $30.1 million, resulting in an NPAT of $17.2 million, up by 21.9% since last year.</p>
      <p>Kogan currently holds a cash reserve of $27.5 million and an undrawn debt facility of $30 million.</p>
      <p>Operating costs fell by 8.6% following last years increase of 2.6% due in part to the operation of Kogan’s new proprietary marketing platform.</p>
      <p>However, logistics and inventory costs did see an increase following the launch of Kogan’s distribution centres, though the company says these costs have since reduced.</p>

      <p>It comes as the Australian Retailers Association (ARA) predicts a stable but average Christmas period.</p>
      <p>Australian’s are expected to spend $53 billion during the holiday period, though with bush fires plaguing the east coast, not everywhere is going to feel the Christmas cheer.</p>
      <p>Retail growth is expected to hit 2.6%, though this is down on previous years, though ARA executive director, Russell Zimmerman said, ‘it’s better than we have seen in recent months’.</p>
      <p>Kogan, however, will be looking at the ‘Other’ section which includes online, of which roughly $8 billion will be spent, and is poised to see the most substantial increase at 3.7%.</p>
      <p>The company is looking to its Exclusive Brands Product Division as an opportunity for growth, which achieved revenue growth of 41.6%.</p>

      <p>Alongside the success of its Kogan Marketplace which launched earlier this year, Kogan Mobile grew commission-based revenue by 9.8% year-on-year, showing just how widespread their business now is.</p>
      <p>In fact, within their AGM presentation, Ruslan Kogan revealed a slide showing every business venture that the online retailer now encompasses.</p>
      <p>In regards to its business portfolio, Kogan Retail represented the largest market, holding more than 1% of the $23.7 billion Australian retail market.</p>
      <p>Kogan Mobile also managed to achieve greater than 1% market share with 20 million current users.</p>
      <p>Gross sales for the Kogan Marketplace grew to $9 million on 19 Oct, which is likely to continue growing as the business works with eCommerce platforms such as Magento and Shopify to ‘accelerate the onboarding of Marketplace sellers’.</p>
