      <p>A card reader for small businesses made from recycled ocean plastic has been unveiled by financial technology firm iZettle.</p>
      <p>The PayPal-owned company has launched the Ocean Reader, which it says is 75% made from old fishing nets and ropes collected from the North and Baltic Seas.</p>
      <p>iZettle said the project has already seen the firm remove more than a tonne of plastic from the ocean and is part of a wider plan to provide products made from sustainable materials.</p>

      <p>The Swedish company has also said it will donate 20% of the sale of each card reader – which will cost £98 – to organisations working to remove plastics from the oceans.</p>
      <p>Jacob de Geer, iZettle’s co-founder, said: “Every day small businesses set out to make smart decisions, not just for their bottom line but for the planet too.</p>
      <p>“iZettle’s mission is to help them succeed and, when it comes to things like sustainability, we have a responsibility to do all we can.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud that iZettle is launching the world’s first card reader made of recycled ocean plastics but, at the same time, it’s a failure of the entire industry that this is only happening now, in 2019. We all have to do better.”</p>
      <p>The new device has been certified by Oceanworks, a global marketplace for recycled ocean plastics and products. Its chief executive, Rob Ianelli, said he hoped iZettle’s decision would prompt others to follow suit.</p>
      <p>“Oceanworks is very proud of the launch of the iZettle Ocean Reader as we share many core values with the company,” he said.</p>
      <p>“iZettle’s innovative approach to ‘payments with purpose’ will catalyse a powerful wave of change in many industries.”</p>
