      <h1>Oil prices extend losses on supply, trade war fears</h1>
      <h2>Crude inventories in the United States rose by 6 million barrels last week to 445.9 million, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said on November 19.</h2>

      <p>Oil prices slipped for a third day onÂ November 20 as a surge in US stocks reinforced concerns about lacklustre global economic growth, while hopes ebbed for any movement on the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>West Texas Intermediate crude futures erased early gains to trade down 17 cents, or 0.31%, at $55.04 a barrel by 0930 GMT. Brent crude futures were at $60.70 a barrel, down 21 cents, or 0.34%.</p>
      <p>Crude inventories in the United States rose by 6 million barrels last week to 445.9 million, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said on November 19.</p>
      <p>"The API data ... showed US inventories posted a rather robust increase last week, which if confirmed by the EIA report, could see oil prices continue to slide," said Edward Moya, an analyst at brokerage OANDA.</p>
      <p>Official US government inventory data from the Energy Information Administration is due at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT) on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Concerns also remain over a potential oversupply of oil worldwide after Reuters reported that Russia, the world's second-biggest producer, was unlikely to back deepening output cuts when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Dec. 5-6 in Vienna.</p>
      <p>Russia and other oil producers have agreed with OPEC to cut 1.2 million barrels per day of output through March to bolster prices.</p>
      <p>"This headline had bulls running for the exit, but the practical impact should not be overly concerning," said Tamas Varga of oil brokerage PVM.</p>
      <p>"This partnership will not require Russia to commit to deeper cuts, only to stick with the current one."</p>
      <p>US crude demand has slowed during a protracted trade war with China. Hopes for an end to the dispute in the signing of a so-called Phase One agreement have dimmed amid disagreements over the removal of tariffs.</p>
      <p>China on Wednesday also condemned legislation passed by the US Senate aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid a crackdown on a pro-democracy protest movement.</p>
      <p>"(The) fear here is still the trade talks with a lot of pessimism starting to filter through," said Stephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader. "If we don't get a significant roll-back on tariffs, that's quite negative."</p>
