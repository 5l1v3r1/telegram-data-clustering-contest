      <h1>NYT: Google Hires Anti-Union Consulting Firm</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">David Beasley</a></address>
      <p>Google has hired an anti-union consulting firm to help it manage conflicts between activist workers and management, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html?searchResultPosition=3">New York Times</a> reports.On its website, consulting firm <a href="https://iriconsultants.com/">IRI Consultants</a> touts helping a large health company persuade employees to avoid a union election. “Despite dedicating millions of dollars to their organizing campaigns, the unions did not gain enough support to hold an NLRB-conducted election and were not able to organize any of the employees,” the website states.</p>
      <p>Since Google employees around the world walked out last fall to protest how the company handled sexual harassment cases, workers have continued to protest company actions and policies, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/04/04/google-cancels-its-ai-ethics-board-less-than-two-weeks-after-launch-in-the-wake-of-employee-protest/">its now-disbanded ethics council</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/06/19/google-workers-join-shareholders-for-proposals-at-annual-shareholders-meeting/#193d9c26f9ca">at its shareholders meetin</a>g. While Google employees have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/03/google-employee-protests-as-part-of-new-tech-resistance.html">taken cues from unions in their organizing efforts</a> and a group of Google contractors in Pittsburgh <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-contractors-in-pittsburgh-vote-to-join-union/">voted to unionize in September</a>, there are currently no serious efforts for direct employees to create a union, The Times reports. However, organizers of the Google walkout suggest that some of the company's tactics in response to employee organizing were affected by its relationship with IRI. </p>
      <p>Google recently<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-community-guidelines-no-politics-2019-8"> limited discussions on internal message boards</a> to avoid politics or news stories, created a calendar extension to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929524/google-surveillance-tool-accused-employee-activism-protests-union-organizing">flag meetings of more than 100 people</a>, and has restructured <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/15/google-cancels-tgif-weekly-all-hands-meetings.html">its weekly all-hands meetings</a>. Many Google employees believe the calendar extension was designed to crack down on union organizing, which the company denied.</p>
      <p>Google also denies that IRI advised on its changes to its community guidelines or any other policies. </p>
      <p>"We engage dozens of outside firms to provide us with their advice on a wide range of topics," Google spokesperson Jenn Kaiser said. "To suggest this particular firm had anything whatsoever to do with the recent calendar extension - or any internal policies whatsoever - is absolutely false.”</p>
      <p>Employees discovered Google’s relationship with IRI last fall, two employees who wished to remain anonymous out of fear of relation told the Times.</p>
      <p>IRI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
