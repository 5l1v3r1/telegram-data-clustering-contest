      <p>Aston Barclay has secured a two-year contract extension with Ogilvie Fleet, becoming its remarketing partner until 2021.</p>
      <p>The contract will involve some 8,000 used vehicles and their disposal across the Aston Barclay network, including Wakefield, Prees Heath, Donington Park and Westbury.</p>
      <p>Ogilvie Fleet celebrates its 40th anniversary this year and has had a long-standing relationship with Aston Barclay, which has remained an independent business since 1984.</p>
      <p>The Ogilvie Group – Ogilvie Fleet’s parent company – celebrated its 60th birthday in 2013 and also remains a 100% independently owned business.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to continuing our relationship with Aston Barclay on the basis they offer a consistently good quality of service across its auction network,” explained Ogilvie’s operations director Jim Hannah.</p>
      <p>“Both businesses have a strong cultural fit and Aston Barclay help us optimise residual values on a diverse range of end-of-lease used cars and light vans that come back from our customers each month.”</p>
      <p>Martin Potter, Aston Barclay’s auction managing director, added: “Ogilvie Fleet continues to grow its fleet and win awards and we are pleased to contribute to their success as a key partner in their fleet supply chain.”</p>
