      <h1>Essel Group to lose controlling stake in Zee Entertainment</h1>
      <h2>After the transaction, Essel's holding will come down to five percent in Zee, out of which encumbered holding will be 1.1 percent.</h2>

      <p>Debt-laden Essel Group, promoter of <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/media-entertainment/zeeentertainmententerprises/ZEE">Zee Entertainment</a>, is looking to sell up to 16.5 percent stake in the media company.</p>
      <p>After the transaction, Essel's holding will come down to five percent in Zee, out of which encumbered holding will be 1.1 percent.</p>
      <p>"Essel Group will be left with token stake and they will have financial interest in Zee," said Utkarsh Sinha, Managing Director, Bexley Advisors.</p>
      <p>While Sinha said that the 16.5 percent stake sale was an unexpected outcome, it is one among the few good options available.</p>
      <p>"This way, the sale would proceed in an orderly fashion which is critical for maximising value," he said.</p>
      <p>He added that stake sale to financial investors is the best possible outcome they (Essel Group) could have hoped for given the fact that Zee shares have tumbled.</p>
      <p>On October 19, Brickwork Ratings downgraded Zee's six per cent Cumulative Redeemable Non-Convertible Preference Shares and the Issuer rating.</p>
      <p>The rationale behind the downgrade was deteriorating financial flexibility of the group marked by increased pledge of promoter holding, among others.</p>
      <p>The silver lining in the recent development is that 2.3 percent stake in ZEEL will be sold to OFI Global China Fund, which is a subsidiary of Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, that already holds 8.7 percent stake in Zee.</p>
      <p>Invesco has been an investor in Zee since 2002.</p>
      <p>"The fact that they (Invesco) wanted to increase their stake even via subsidiary route is a positive signal. It is always a positive signal when an existing investor doubles down. Invesco is a seasoned hand in Zee," said Sinha.</p>
      <p>Sinha added said that he does not rule out Essel reducing its stake further.</p>
