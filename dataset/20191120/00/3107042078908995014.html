      <p>Air New Zealand has launched a sale for its regional routes in a week marred by cancellations.</p>
      <p>"Today is a good day to book with our shrunk domestic fares," says an email newsletter from the airline.</p>
      <p>Air New Zealand is offering flights from $39 one way between Auckland and Kerikeri, and Auckland and New Plymouth.</p>
      <p>There are also $49 flights between Auckland and Palmerston North, Napier and Christchurch, and Rotorua and Wellington.</p>
      <p>Flying from Auckland to Dunedin will set back travellers $79.</p>
      <p>Travellers are advised that they'll find the best availability after 13 January.</p>
      <p>This comes during a torrid week for the national carrier, with it being forced to cancel a number of flights due to ongoing problems with the Rolls-Royce engines.</p>
      <p>Up to 14,000 passengers will be affected by the flight cancellations, which were largely scheduled over the holiday period.</p>
      <p>Air New Zealand is understood to be working with an alliance partner to lease another aircraft to alleviate the impact.</p>
      <p>The airline has leased five aircraft from other airlines at different times over the past 18 months to help maintain its schedule and it may take a week to firm a deal to get another.</p>
      <p>This does, however, mean that certain flight schedules will have to change.</p>
      <p>Consumer NZ chief executive Sue Chetwin said if passengers affected by Air NZ's flight cancellations were unhappy with the alternative itinerary available to them, they would be able to claim a refund and compensation.</p>
      <p>"The cancellation is within [the airline's] control, they've known about these engine issues for a while now," she said.</p>
      <p>Chetwin said it was important to get in touch with the airline or travel agent as soon as possible in an event like this.</p>
