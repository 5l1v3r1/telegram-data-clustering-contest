      <p>In good news for the U.S. economy, a new survey has found that at at least 81% of Americans plan on traveling for one or more holidays this season. The survey, conducted by <a href="https://www.hotelplanner.com/">HotelPlanner</a>, group travel booking website, surveyed Americans across a range of demographics to learn about their holiday travel plans this Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>

      <p>In what could be perceived as a sign that the American economy is growing stronger, 65% of respondents with household incomes of less than $50,000 say they are planning on traveling this holiday season, compared with 80% of respondents with a household income of $125,000. (The caveat is that only 30% of the first group are actually going on vacation; the other 70% say their primary reason for travel is to visit family.)</p>
      <p>The survey also revealed some other interesting tidbits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Staying with family or at a family home is the accommodation of choice for traveling Americans at this time of year (62%) with hotels being the next best option at 19%.</li>
        <li>Over half of respondents say theyâ€™re more likely to use points or redeem travel rewards to offset additional holiday spending. That number is significantly higher among millennials (those aged 18-35) with 70% of respondents aged 18-24 and 62% of respondents aged 25-34 saying they plan to redeem points.</li>
        <li>When it comes to phasing out plastic toiletry products in hotels, millennials are unsurprisingly in favor of doing just that: 56% of travelers aged 18-24 and 50% of travelers aged 25-34 think it is a great idea to help save the environment.</li>
        <li>While many of us believe Thanksgiving is the most traveled holiday of the year, the survey shows Christmas (41%) might overtake Thanksgiving (32%) by a 9% margin this year.</li>
