      <p>What’s the best way to pay off student loans?Here’s what you to need to know.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Student Loan Repayment</b>
      </p>
      <p>When it comes to student loan repayment, the best way to pay off student loans depends on your personal and financial circumstances and goals. That means what works for your friends and your sister might be completely different for you.</p>
      <p>Start with the four pillars of student loan repayment:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Student Loan Refinance</li>
        <li>Student Loan Consolidation</li>
        <li>Income-Driven Repayment</li>
        <li>Student Loan Forgiveness</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are four popular strategies for student loan repayment. Let’s explore the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy so you can determine which option works best for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Refinance Student Loans</b>
      </p>
      <p>If your goal is to lower your student loan interest rate and monthly payment, the best strategy is to <a href="https://www.makelemonade.co/should-i-refinance-my-student-loans/">refinance your student loans</a>. You can refinance federal student loans, private student loans or both. Student loan refinance has no fees and there is no limit how often you can refinance. So, even if you already refinanced your student loans, you can refinance again if you can qualify for a lower interest rate. You’ll need a good credit score, stable and recurring monthly income, and a low debt-to-income ratio.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/11/06/refinance-student-loans-rates/">Student loan refinance rates have dropped absurdly low</a> and are now as low as 1.81%. You can check your rate for free with no impact to your credit score in about two minutes. Then, if you like your new interest rate, you can apply online in about 10-15 minutes.</p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.makelemonade.co/calculators/student-loan-refinancing-calculator/">student loan refinance calculator</a> can show you how you can save.</p>
      <p>For example, let’s assume you have $75,000 of student loan debt with a 7% interest rate and 10-year repayment term. If you refinance student loans with a 3% interest rate, you would save $147 each month and $17,593 total.</p>
      <p><b><i>Advantages:</i></b> Lower your interest. Save money. One monthly payment. Pay off student loans faster.</p>
      <p><b><i>Disadvantages:</i></b> Not eligible for income-driven repayment or government forbearance or deferment.</p>

      <p>
        <b>2. Student Loan Consolidation</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/10/28/student-loans-changes-2020/">Student loan consolidation</a> is the process of combining your existing federal student loans into a new, Direct Consolidation Loan. Unlike student loan refinancing, student loan consolidation does <i>not</i> lower your interest rate. With student loan consolidation, your monthly payment is equal to a weighted average of the interest rates on your current federal student loans, rounded up to the nearest 1/8%. Visit Studentloans.gov or call 1-800-557-7394 for more information on student loan consolidation.</p>
      <p><b><i>Advantages:</i></b> One student loan payment. Helps manage and organize federal student loans. One student loan servicer.</p>
      <p><b><i>Disadvantages:</i></b> Doesn’t save you money. Doesn’t lower interest rate.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>3. Income-Driven Repayment</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/10/10/biden-student-loans/">Income-driven repayment</a> is provided by the federal government and enables you to pay your federal student loans based on your discretionary income. There are four income-driven repayment plans: Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). With income-driven repayment, you pay between 10-20% of your monthly discretionary income and can receive federal student loan forgiveness after 20-25 years of on-time student loan payments.</p>
      <p><b><i>Advantages:</i></b> Lower monthly payment. Can receive student loan forgiveness.</p>
      <p><b><i>Disadvantages: </i></b>Interest accrues on loan balance. Must certify income each year. Amount of student loan forgiveness subject to income tax.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>4. Student Loan Forgiveness</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2019/11/15/student-loan-forgiveness-refinance/">Student loan forgiveness</a> is available for federal student loans typically through government programs. For example, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program forgives federal student loans for public servants. The program has several requirements, including making 120 on-time monthly payments. Make sure to complete an Employer Certification Form annually.</p>
      <p><b><i>Advantages:</i></b> Potential to receive complete student loan forgiveness of federal student loans. Amount of forgiveness not taxable.</p>
      <p><b><i>Disadvantages:</i></b> Complex process and confusing requirements. 99% of applicants have been rejected. Requires 10 years of payments.</p>
