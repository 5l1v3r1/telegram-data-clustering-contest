      <p>The European Tour and European Tour Caddies Association (ETCA) have agreed a ground-breaking deal to allow caddies to benefit from sponsorship for the first time.The arrangement was hailed by leading caddies on the tour as a huge step forward to helping secure their financial well-being in what can be a highly unstable and insecure industry,</p>
      <p>While this does agreement does not provide for individual sponsorship deals, caddies who are members of the ETCA can now be utilized as a collective commercial commodity during tournaments and be remunerated for it separate of their players.</p>
      <p>Oliver Briggs, a caddie for six years and member of the ETCA committee says: “The inconsistency on the job can provide challenges for people who are married with kids and a mortgage. If you are working with a player who goes through a barren spell things can get a little bit tight.</p>
      <p>“It has always been the idea of the association to provide a secondary source of income for caddies.</p>
      <p>“The tour have been excellent with their dialogue and their openness and their willingness to go with it.</p>
      <p>“It is positive, people have their guard up to begin with but now the dialogue has gone there it has been positive. What they now see is that if there are 156 golfers there are 156 caddies.”</p>

      <p>Looking forward, Briggs believes there is even greater potential for caddies to be used commercially and provide a level of insight and involvement not seen in the game before.</p>
      <p>He adds: “If you can provide content videos with caddies branded up and this gets shared, then it is getting impressions and clicks so it works all round.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice to get to the point with social media platforms across all channels that video is made available to members and advertised to sponsors</p>
      <p>“You have captive audience of people looking at how we do our job, reminding people about all things and making it interesting and adding a new dimension to it.”</p>

      <p>Fellow committee member Ian Grimoldby, caddie for Adrian Otaegui, hailed the latest advancement secured by the ETCA. In recent years the organisation has helped secure regular health checks, better food and facilities at tournaments, as well as taking the lead on arranging event accommodation and transport.</p>
      <p>Grimboldby says: “There were things in place to stop sponsorship like this happening, to stop large group sponsorship. Historically, the caddy knew their place but it is a different environment now. We are making tangible changes.”</p>
      <p>Max Hamilton, head of commercial partnerships for the European Tour, said: “There is no question that the role of the caddie is unique, no other sportsman or sportswoman has such as a trusted advisor by their side on the actual field of play.</p>
      <p>“We believe that the story telling opportunity this offers, alongside the associated media value, is significant and we look forward to progressing discussions with many potential partners to benefit our caddies from the 2020 season onwards.”</p>
      <p>Sean Russell, Chairman of the ETCA and the man who has been the driving force behind the partnership, said: “There is no question that the commercial value of caddies has been under-exploited over the years. But with caddies now being increasingly visible on television and across a wide range of social media platforms, we believe sponsors are starting to understand their importance and value from a commercial perspective.</p>
      <p>“For the majority of caddies who do not have financial security, wellbeing, or the many things most people take for granted like notice periods, redundancy packages, pension contributions or medical insurance; this will help make a huge difference.”</p>
