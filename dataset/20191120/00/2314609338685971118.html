      <p>Two goals from Aaron Ramsey have fired Wales to Euro 2020 as a 2-0 victory over Hungary in Cardiff sealed their place in next year's finals.</p>
      <p>Juventus midfielder Ramsey struck in both halves at Cardiff City Stadium as Wales won to clinch second place in Group E for the 2016 European championship semi-finalists, while their opponents must now be content with a place in the play-offs.</p>

      <p>Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick as Germany held onto top spot in Group C with a 6-1 victory over Northern Ireland, while fellow qualifiers Netherlands thrashed Estonia 5-0 courtesy of a Georginio Wijnaldum hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Belgium sealed their 100 per cent qualifying record with an emphatic 6-1 win over Cyprus, as second-place Russia hammered San Marino 5-0 in Group I and Scotland accounted for Kazakhstan 3-1.</p>
      <p>Wales, Hungary and Slovakia were battling for the second qualifying spot behind World Cup 2018 runners-up Croatia, although each side was already assured of a spot in the play-offs if they didn't reach the tournament via the group.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs's Wales earned their passage back into the tournament after their brilliant run to the semi-finals in 2016 with the national team boss hailing the qualification.</p>

      <p>"It doesn't get any better than that," he said on Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Credit to the lads, coming back from where we were in the summer after two defeats.</p>
      <p>"We showed grit, determination and quality. It's one of the best days of my life."</p>
      <p>Ramsey broke the deadlock after 15 minutes with a close-range header from Real Madrid winger Gareth Bale's whipped cross.</p>

      <p>Two minutes after the break Ramsey struck again, blasting home after the ball fortuitously found him at the far post.</p>
