      <p>Let’s keep it real. The Derrick Lewis vs. Ilir Latifi bout that is <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28109216/sources-ufc-close-finalizing-derrick-lewis-ilir-latifi-fight">reportedly close to being finalized</a> looks like an easy fight on paper for The Black Beast, and a very practical opportunity to claim another Performance of the Night bonus. Per ESPN’s Brett Okamoto, contracts haven’t been signed, but all sides have agreed to the matchup. It’s likely the fight would be a part of a rumored February 8 card with Houston, Texas as a potential location.</p>
      <p>Lewis lives in Texas and he also did fantastic work <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/20507161/derrick-lewis-using-truck-help-hurricane-harvey-victims">helping victims of the flood in Houston back in 2017</a>. Needless to say, he’s a favorite and likely a draw in H-Town.</p>
      <p>Latifi is coming up to heavyweight after dropping two straight at light heavyweight, and three of his last five in the division. Most recently, the Swedish slugger was knocked out by Volkan Oezdemir in August.</p>

      <p>At 5’10” Latifi probably should be a light heavyweight, but for whatever reason, he’s no longer trying to make 205 pounds. Don’t group this move up in weight class with other more sensible ones like Michael Chiesa to welterweight, Anthony Johnson to light heavyweight (he’s now <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/anthony-rumble-johnson-training-ufc-172403494.html">reportedly moving up to heavyweight</a> as well), and Thiago Santos to light heavyweight.</p>
      <p>Those moves make sense because each guy has a frame best suited for their new division. Latifi is going from being a slightly undersized powerhouse at 205 pounds to a grossly undersized heavyweight.</p>
      <p>Latifi loves to stand and bang, and he’s probably set to employ that strategy against one of the best brawlers in the heavyweight division. Even if Latifi succeeds in securing a takedown, it’s hard to imagine him being able to hold Lewis down any longer than the other heavyweights–except Daniel Cormier, and Latifi is no D.C.</p>

      <p>Lewis got the nod in a close tangle with Blagoy Ivanov at UFC 244 earlier this month. The victory ended a two-fight losing streak for Lewis. He’d lost via stoppage to Junior dos Santos in his most recent fight, and prior to that he was submitted by Cormier.</p>
      <p>Before that Lewis narrowly escaped a loss against Alexander Volkov. The Russian had been dominating the entire fight before he got careless in the final 30 seconds of the last round and was knocked out. Lewis hasn’t established himself as an elite heavyweight, but he should still have more than enough to defeat Latifi.</p>

      <p>If this fight doesn’t end with Lewis taunting Latifi with his beast-alligator-sea monster celebration, I’ll be shocked. It’s a fight and stranger things have happened. However, this feels like a repeat of the recent Chris Weidman division leap, only the result could be even more brutal.</p>
      <p>If the UFC is looking to pump some life back into Lewis’ brand, Latifi could make the perfect opponent for a highlight reel.</p>
