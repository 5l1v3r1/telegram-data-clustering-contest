      <h4>Astell&amp;Kern A&amp;ultima SP2000 (£3299)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>On the rare occasions that an audiophile leaves their pressure-controlled sonic chamber and exposes their ears to the disturbing sub-standard sounds of the outside world, they need a portable solution to soften the blow. Enter Astell&amp;Kern’s latest bank-breaking player.</p>
      <p>Beneath its arrestingly angular housing resides all manner of audio wizardry, including AKM AK4499EQ dual DACs, independent channels for balanced and unbalanced outputs and support for 32bit/768kHz and DSD512 playback. And if you don’t know what any of that means, you don’t need to buy one.</p>

      <h4>Mercedes-Benz EQC (from £65,640)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>If someone’s been good enough to deserve a new ride in the drive this December, it ought to be a special one. And the Mercedes-Benz EQC qualifies as pretty special indeed, given that it’s the first all-electric road car in the German marque’s illustrious history.</p>
      <p>Suitably luxurious inside and good for an impressive 259 miles on a brimmed battery, it’s also surprisingly understated for such a seminal SUV. Until you see the price tag, that is. Thank goodness for the UK’s £3500 plug-in car grant, eh?</p>

      <h4>Bell &amp; Ross BR 05 Blue Steel (£3990)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Possibly the nicest, most expensive piece of unintentional <i>Zoolander</i> merchandise ever made, the beautifully simple Blue Steel face on this Bell &amp; Ross ticker is the antithesis of Le Tigre’s loud pouting.</p>
      <p>Also available with black and silver facades, the BR05 melds a classic round dial with the squared-off shell that’s become a signature of the aviation watchmaker’s stunning timepieces. Stylish, rugged and suitably chiselled, it’s everything Derek would want from a watch.</p>

      <h4>Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max (from £1149)</h4>

      <p>Some say Apple sets the prices of its iPhones by feeding the number of lenses, Bono’s current age and one brave decision into a secret and complex formula stored on an original Macintosh somewhere in Cupertino.</p>
      <p>And that seems to hold true, given that the U2 frontman is now 59, the iPhone Pro packs a trio of incredible lenses and the most expensive flagship – the Pro Max in 512GB guise – will set you back one pound shy of £1500. Too much? Unlike an ageing MagSafe cable, the equation never falters.</p>

      <h4>Teufel x Rosenthal (£3490)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>If you’re intending to spend more than your monthly salary on a pair of high-end Wi-Fi speakers, it helps if they’re multi-talented. Thankfully, Teufel’s groundbreaking porcelain creations can do a lot more than mere audio streaming.</p>
      <p>Besides a built-in alarm clock and hat stand functionality, the striking pieces are perfect for the role of alien tripod in your stop-motion recreation of <i>The War of the Worlds</i>. Talk about bang for buck.</p>

      <h4>Fujifilm GFX100 (£9999)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>With many pro snappers moving to the compact, speedy convenience of mirrorless, the mammoth machines of medium format might seem like a photographic anachronism. Yet if your aim is absolute quality, the GFX100 is the whopper for you this winter.</p>
      <p>As heavy as ten turtle doves and priced like five gold rings, everything about it screams festive excess: a 102MP CMOS sensor, a 5.76 million dot OEL display and a faintly ludicrous 3.76 million phase detection pixel count mean this year’s Christmas family portrait is guaranteed to be a winner.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Calling an £8000 audio system good value is like calling a Formula 1 car efficient: technically correct but only in relative terms. Still, if you’re looking for a comprehensive music setup that doesn’t require you to stick a cabinet beside your Christmas tree, the MTI100 is your answer.</p>
      <p>Topped by a turntable, it packs an amplifier, vacuum tube and phono pre-amps, Bluetooth receiver, aux, digital and optical inputs and all the outputs you could ask for. Just add speakers and you’ve got the whole hi-fi package.</p>

      <p>Many people would find themselves sweating as they stand at the top of a treacherous black run. Most would take a deep breath and brave it. Some would slowly shuffle back to the bar. A rare few, though, would stare down the ski slope, embrace the terror and hit the remote in their pocket, knowing that the more they sweat, the more effectively the electro-osmotic moisture-management membrane in their HYDRO_BOT jacket will function. Whatever it takes to get their money’s worth.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Ask a keen-eared audiophile and they’ll probably tell you that no single unit can hope to rival a full hi-fi setup for crisp, clear sound. Which means said audiophile hasn’t experienced Orbitsound’s revolutionary D1: an exquisite vertical slab a decade in the making, it’s the ultimate one-box system.</p>
      <p>Suspended on a tilting stand, the speaker’s Airsound tech projects sound into the surrounding air to create an unrivalled, distortion-free listening experience wherever you are in the room.</p>

      <p>Yes, good cinema is all about substance. And, yes, the best films are great whether you watch them on a screen the size of a house or an old iPod Video. But if movies are your thing and you’ve got a bit of bling, why wouldn’t you drop thirty grand on a 4K laser projector good for 40,000 hours and 6000 lumens?</p>
      <p>Sure, you’ll need a dedicated space to do it justice, but given you’ll be living on a popcorn diet, you can probably do away with the dining room.</p>
