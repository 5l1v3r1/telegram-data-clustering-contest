      <p>Is it possible to actually dissect the evolution of most couple conflicts?</p>
      <p>Jacobson and colleagues, (Jacobson, Christensen, Prince, Cordova, &amp; Eldridge, 2000) suggest that predicting most couple conflicts is as easy as ABC. They describe a predictable process of escalation that follows along a predictable cycle. These authors picture the evolution of this cycle from an initial problem (the content of the argument, consisting of either provocations, incompatibilities/vulnerabilities, or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/anger">anger</a>/hurts)—to the process of unsuccessful coping with the initial problem (through accusation/blame/coercion; avoidance/denial/minimization; overreaction; or forming alliances/coalitions)—and finally to the reactive problem (or the vicious cycle of the solution-generated problem in the relationship). This evolution mirrors the findings of the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/the-gottman-method">Gottman</a> group and of Wile discussed in an earlier post, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/breaking-the-cycle/201911/what-do-all-troubled-couples-share">"What do all troubled couples share?"</a></p>
      <p><b>The ABC's of Arguments:</b> The classic “ABC's” of intense arguments are referred to as a <i>toxic triad </i>or <i>toxic cures.</i> The authors state that, “Toxic cures are solutions that make the problem worse. They are treatments that aggravate the disease. Their intent is often to create change for the better: their result is to create change for the worse." These ABC's are <b><i>accusation</i></b>, <i><b>blame</b></i>, and <i><b>coercion</b></i> (and a “D” can be added for <b><i>defensiveness</i></b>).</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Accusation </b>is simply pointing out that your partner has either done or not done something implicitly or explicitly expected in the relationship. This may take the form of accusing our partner of insensitivity, neglect, lack of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/teamwork">collaboration</a>, or a range of other perceived violations embodied in the triggering event. This accusation itself may be met with defensiveness or a counter-accusation: it was our reaction to their action that was the problem. This can kick in the cycle right away.</li>
        <li>However, the addition of <b>blame </b>turns the cycle distinctly more negative. This is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/breaking-the-cycle/201911/what-do-all-troubled-couples-share">Gottman’s four horsemen, and Wile’s evolution through the vicious cycles </a>of advance-retreat through attack-defend and so on. Here we start claiming that the cause of our partner’s offense is their negative <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/personality">personality</a> characteristics. These may include their moral character, mental or emotional instabilities, personal failings, or inadequacies, to name but a few. The point is that such statements become a personal indictment of our partner. Something deeply wrong with their character is at the root of the problem. All of this breeds defensive counter-arguments from our partner.</li>
        <li>Finally, <b>coercion </b>goes beyond mere accusations and attacks. Coercion is intended to force our partner to do what we want through a barrage of demanding, nagging, criticizing, complaining and making our partner feel guilty until they finally give in. The inherent <i>trap </i>in this sort of coercion is that it most assuredly will escalate based upon how it works. One partner’s coercion is reinforced because the other finally complied. The other’s compliance is reinforced because the coercion stopped. However, future rounds of the same badgering are doomed by an intermittent ratio schedule of the partner’s compliance, and their beginning to ignore the other’s demands. In other words, we never know when our partner will finally relent and comply, and our partner may simply get used to the coercion. Thus, coercion is described as an addictive drug where early immediate effects require increasing doses to achieve the same effect. Partners may eventually deliberately ignore or actively resist these barrages and the positive feelings and loving atmosphere of the relationship eventually erodes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each successive vicious cycle is described as proceeding through three characteristic phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Escalation </b>between partners is not only the increase in tension, volume, or viciousness of the argument, but also in the expansion of its focus to include other related or unrelated issues brought in to justify points or simply to retaliate.</li>
        <li><b>Polarization </b>refers to the process of becoming rigidly fixed and extreme in our views through listening to our own reiterated arguments and using our partner’s behaviors as proof for the truth of our position.</li>
        <li><b>Alienation </b>is generally the result of escalated polarized arguments. It may be a product of frustration, or hurt, or refusal to address a problem, but it is always a negative development with partners turning away from each other. This again reflects <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/breaking-the-cycle/201911/what-do-all-troubled-couples-share">Gottman’s idea of turning away, and Wile’s withdraw-withdraw phases</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Polarization and the Mutual Trap: </b>The result of failed mutual efforts to bring about change in partners’ personality differences is alienation and polarization. Jacobson and Christensen (1996) state, “When two people engage in such change efforts simultaneously, the almost inevitable outcome is polarization or an exacerbation of the differences. When polarization occurs, the conflict increases rather than decreases” (p. 199). The <i>mutual trap</i> is the outcome of polarization. While polarization doesn’t necessarily stop, there comes a point when each partner feels trapped, stuck, helpless, and desperate. This is a separate, private, and rather implicit experience for each partner of their own sense of entrapment in the very problem each is trying to resolve.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Breaking the Cycle</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jacobson and Christensen (Jacobson &amp; Christensen, 1996; Jacobson et al., 2000) and their colleagues have spent the better part of their careers devoted to finding out the best approach to breaking these mutual traps or the inevitable vicious cycles of couple distress and intensive conflicts. The result of their work is what they call <i>Integrative Behavioral Couple Treatment</i>, or <i>IBCT</i>. IBCT has gone on to become one of the two most effective approaches to couple <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy">therapy</a>, based on the past decade of research. In the following post, we will look closer at IBCT and apply it to the couple discussed in <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/breaking-the-cycle/201904/when-our-solutions-become-the-problem">an earlier post</a>. As we shall see, there are many paths to the top of every mountain, and IBCT is one of two of the most effective <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/marriage-and-family-therapy">couples therapy</a> approaches for breaking the ABC's of escalating couple conflict.</p>
