      <h1>Louisiana Suffers Another Major Ransomware Attack</h1>

      <p>This summer a series of targeted ransomware attacks ravaged schools and district offices throughout Louisiana. Now a new wave of attacks has targeted government systems in the state.</p>

      <p>According to a statement from Governor Jon Bel Edwards, “some, but not all state servers” were affected. Numerous systems were quickly taken offline “out of an abundance of caution,” as the Louisiana Office of Technology Services worked to <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/featured/ransomware-strikes-again-state-louisiana/">prevent the spread of infection</a> and assess the damage.</p>
      <p>The Department of Children and Family Services was among the agencies that were hit. Websites, email servers, and phone systems connected to the Department – including the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline – were all impacted to varying degrees.</p>
      <p>While it’s unfortunately that government systems in Louisiana may have been compromised by ransomware yet again, the state may bet better equipped to deal with such an incident than most.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Gov. Edwards established a statewide Cyber Security Commission to share information, strategize, and help coordinate responses to attacks just like this one.</p>
      <p>The group was called into action this July to deal with the aftermath of the attacks that hit several Louisiana school districts. To ensure all necessary resources were available to combat the outbreak, Gov. Edwards <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2019/07/26/louisiana-governor-declares-state-of-emergency-after-ransomware-hits-school-systems/#25c928d6b37a">declared a state of emergency</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks in recent years, that’s not a common occurrence.</p>
      <p>There may be multiple reasons why one wasn’t warranted this time. The particular strain of ransomware may have been less potent. It may only have managed to infect a few isolated systems. Perhaps most importantly, the swift response by the OTS may have neutralized the attack before it had a chance to do any major damage.</p>
      <p>Indeed, <a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1196558130836099072">Gov. Edwards tweeted</a> that “the service interruption was due to OTS’ aggressive response to prevent additional infection of state servers and not due to the attempted ransomware attack.”</p>
      <p>That “aggressive response” may be as much about hardening systems against future attacks as it is about recovering from the current one.</p>
