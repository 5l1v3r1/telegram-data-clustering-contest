      <p>Kane Williamson explained it was a "tough" decision to leave Lockie Ferguson out of the New Zealand side for the first Test against England but insisted the paceman's time will come.</p>
      <p>The uncapped Ferguson, 28, will not make his debut when the first-ever Test at Bay Oval gets under way on Thursday, with Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Neil Wagner getting the nod.</p>
      <p>Black Caps captain Williamson hinted that the rapid Ferguson, outstanding in the Cricket World Cup, could make his bow in the longest format in the near future.</p>
      <p>Williamson said of the bowler's omission for the start of the two-match series: "It was tough.</p>
      <p>"We know what he can bring - he's certainly not far away and he's an exciting prospect.</p>
      <p>"He brings something a little different which is really exciting, no doubt he's raring to go if and when that opportunity comes. His name will always be discussed."</p>
      <p>He added: "The three that we've gone with are guys that have been in the group for a long period of time and performed really well for us, so I know they're looking forward to getting back into Test cricket.</p>
      <p>"It's great to have so many guys in the environment who are very much raring to go and all offering different things."</p>
      <p>All-rounder Todd Astle was released from the New Zealand squad along with Ferguson.</p>
      <p>For England, opening batsman Dom Sibley will make his debut and Ollie Pope returns while Sam Curran was preferred to Chris Woakes in Mount Maunganui.</p>
