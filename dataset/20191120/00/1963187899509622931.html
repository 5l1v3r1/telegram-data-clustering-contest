      <p>Al-Ahly player Ramadan Sobhy has given Egypt's qualification for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics for the fans who support the team at Cairo Stadium. <br/><br/>"Our players were real men, as I say after every game, and the audience is more than great. I thank them very much, no matter what I say, I will not give them their right," Ramadan told On Sport channel. <br/><br/>"We have gone up and achieved what is needed, and certainly ambition is doubling, and now we are thinking of winning the trophy." <br/><br/>"The fans do not benefit anything but pay money to attend, so they should be happy. <br/><br/>Egypt thrashed South Africa 3-0 on Tuesday night at the Cairo in the U-23 AFCON semi-final. <br/><br/>Egypt qualified for the tournament Final for the first time in the history in its third edition after 2011 and 2015. <br/><br/>Egypt secured qualification for the Olympics for the 12th time in its history, a historical figure that has never reached any team in Africa as the nearest team to the Pharaohs is Ghana, who qualified only six times. <br/><br/>This will be the first qualification for the Pharaohs since the 2012 London Olympics. <br/><br/>The best position Egypt has achieved in the history of its participation in the Olympics is the fourth in the Tokyo Olympics as well as held in 1964.</p>
