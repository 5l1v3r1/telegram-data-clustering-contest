      <h1>Three In Ten Young Trans People Attempt Suicide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Wareham</a></address>
      <p>Three in 10 young trans people in America have tried to take their life in the last year, according to a new report. The new report also says 6 in 10 trans and non-binary young people have seriously considered taking their lives too. </p>
      <p>Over 34,000 young LGBTQ people were surveyed for the report, the largest survey of LGBTQ youth mental health ever done. </p>
      <p>Released to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance, The Trevor Project has released its inaugural <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2019/?section=Conversion-Therapy-Change-Attempts">National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health. </a></p>
      <p>A vast 8 in 10 of the trans and non-binary respondents have faced discrimination due to their gender identity.</p>
      <p>The figures of trans young people who have tried to take their life are double their cisgender, people born in the gender they identify with, LGB counterparts.</p>
      <p>Only 15% of young lesbian, gay and bisexual people will try to take their life, compared to 29% of young trans people.</p>
      <p>Both figures are significantly higher when compared to the average in the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.sdg.3-4-data-ctry?lang=en">wider population.</a> Compared to the average among high school aged youth, just 5.4% of straight-identified students reported <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/trendsreport.pdf">attempting suicide in the past year</a>.</p>
      <p>This leaves lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth over four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.</p>

      <p>This latest report is in line with other studies that have shown a range of two in ten to nearly <a href="https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/142/4/e20174218?sso=1&amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token">half of all trans people</a> will attempt suicide at some point in their lives.</p>
      <p>The Centre for Suicide Prevention reports, based on multiple studies, that the number is somewhere between <a href="https://www.suicideinfo.ca/resource/transgender-people-suicide/">two and four in 10 trans people will try to take their life</a>. </p>
      <p>Marking the significance of these mental health numbers, just days after it was revealed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2019/11/18/murdered-hanged-and-lynched-331-trans-people-killed-this-year/">331 trans people had been killed in the last year</a>, Dr Amy E. Green, Director of Research for The Trevor Project says: </p>
      <p>“Transgender and non-binary youth may face a range of unique stressors associated with their adolescent development as well as increased experiences of internalized stigma, discrimination, and rejection from others.</p>
      <p>“No one factor causes an individual to attempt suicide, but the cumulative effect of these stressors can be detrimental to one’s mental wellness and increase the risk for suicidal ideation.”</p>

      <h3>Two in three young LGBTQ report someone trying to convince them to ‘convert’ or change their identity</h3>
      <p>The study also reveals a staggering 2 in 3 American LGBTQ youth have reported that someone tried to convince them to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
      <p>Of the LGBTQ young people who have been through conversion therapy, their likelihood of attempting suicide doubles from 2 in ten to 4 in ten. </p>
      <p>The therapy, now banned in many countries and some states in America, promises the impossible of ‘changing people’s sexualities’ often with cruel and inhumane tactics.</p>
      <p>The reality for many young LGBTQ Americans, many of whom will come from religious backgrounds is their families will send them to these types of therapies.</p>
      <p>But Dr Green says “research shows that LGBTQ youth who report having at least one accepting adult were 40% less likely to report a suicide attempt in the past year.”</p>
      <p>The Trevor Project, which provides crisis services, also noted that their respondents were much more likely to ask for help with digital support services, over phone or ‘IRL’ support. </p>
      <p>The trend is what’s sparked many youth charities to invest in text support services like ‘Shout,’ the mental health text service supported by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p>
      <p>Their Royal Highnesses met with volunteers, including trans and non-binary activists, at an event in London, UK, for the charity this week.</p>

      <h3>When is Transgender Day Of Remembrance 2019?</h3>
      <p>The statistics were released today to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance.</p>
      <p>Trans Day Of Remembrance (TDoR) is a day which remembers those trans and gender-diverse people who have been victims of homicide, held each year on November 20, 2019.</p>
      <p>Across the world, the LGBTQ community and their allies will be gathering for vigils to remember those lost this year. </p>
      <p>Many will read names from the Trans Murder Monitoring report list which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiewareham/2019/11/18/murdered-hanged-and-lynched-331-trans-people-killed-this-year/#501b3bef2d48">tracks trans homicides across the world.</a></p>
      <p>Juliana Ferreira was the first death recorded this year on October 3 2018. She was found dead and in a state of decomposition near a large stone which local media posed as the cause of death. The local media reports deadname Juliana, referring to her with a male name. </p>
      <p>Júnia Franco, the last name on the list this year, was stabbed 13 times and left in a pool of blood. They were killed on September 29 2019. </p>
