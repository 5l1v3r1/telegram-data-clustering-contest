      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:11:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/abhinav-rajput/" target="_blank">Abhinav Rajput</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> will fight the upcoming Delhi assembly elections under the leadership of incumbent state chief and MP Manoj Tiwari, as the organisational elections scheduled to be held at the end of this year will now be held after the polls, Delhi in-charge Shyam Jaju told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
      <p>He said the party will go ahead with almost the same team that fought the Lok Sabha polls, from the mandal to district and state level, effectively ending all speculation of changes in the structure ahead of the polls.</p>
      <p>Other office bearers, including general secretaries and vice-presidents, will also keep their posts.</p>
      <p>A senior leader said the party does not want to make last-minute changes as it feels it has delivered a good performance in the corporation and Lok Sabha polls, which it had fought under Tiwari’s leadership.</p>
      <p>Referring to the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) report, which ranked Delhi as the worst city for water quality in the country, Jaju said the issue would be the party’s focus this month and that a series of protests have been planned to highlight it.</p>
      <p>The BJP, including Union Consumer Affairs Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ram-vilas-paswan">Ram Vilas Paswan</a> and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, has been trying to corner the AAP government over the report.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a>, who also holds the Water portfolio, has hit back, saying politics is being played over the issue of water and that the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) would carry out its own test based on samples from all municipal wards of the city.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Delhi BJP Yuva Morcha activists staged a protest on water quality.</p>
      <p>Jaju, former Delhi BJP president Satish Upadhyay, and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta also participated in the protest near Moolchand flyover.</p>
