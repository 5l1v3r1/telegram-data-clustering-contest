      <h1>Fight leads to fatal stabbing aboard San Francisco area train</h1>

      <p>HAYWARD, Calif. — A California transit chief said a man was stabbed to death Tuesday during a fight between two men on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train.</p>
      <p>Interim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that officials began receiving 911 calls in the afternoon about a fight aboard the train.</p>
      <p>Alvarez said transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding and possibly the victim of a stabbing. He said the man died.</p>
      <p>Transit officers searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect, Alvarez said, though he gave no other details about the victim or the suspect.</p>
      <p>Alvarez said there was no threat to other riders because “it was a fight involving two individuals that engaged each other.”</p>
      <p>The station in Hayward, about 16 miles south of Oakland, was closed indefinitely while officers investigate.</p>
      <p>The stabbing came after the high-profile death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson, who was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack on her and her sister in an Oakland BART station on July 22. John Cowell, a 27-year-old parolee, has been charged with murder and attempted murder.</p>
      <p>The family claims BART failed in its duty to ensure its customers are safe and that BART has failed to sufficiently address crime on its transit lines.</p>
      <p>BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost has said the system prioritizes safety for its riders.</p>
