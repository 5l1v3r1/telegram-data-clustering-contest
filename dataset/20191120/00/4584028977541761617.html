      <h1>Tryall Golf Course chosen for 2019 Jamaica Open</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/805-leightonlevy" target="_blank">Leighton Levy</a></address>
      <p>Defending champion Hernan Borja will not be defending his Jamaica Open title this year some of the best players from the PGA Latin America tour will tee off for the 52<sup>nd</sup> staging of the tournament at the world-famous Tryall Golf Course in Hanover, Jamaica on December 12.</p>
      <p>Borja has reportedly lost his status and has to earn the points needed to qualify for the tournament and therefore will miss the 2019 edition. When the Jamaica Open was last held in 2017, Borja shot a final round 70 to win by three strokes and collected a cheque for US$17,000.</p>
      <p>His absence opens the door for the more than 50 golfers from Canada, the UK, and The Cayman Islands, Antigua, Trinidad and Tobago as well as some of Jamaica's top professional golfers, to win a share of US$100,000 prize money in the long-running pro/am tournament.</p>
      <p>They include Jamaica’s Wesley Brown, Ian Facey, Cosiar McKenzie, Sean Green and Michael Rowe. Also registered are national amateur champion Justin Burrowes, William Knibbs and Rocco Lopez.</p>
      <p>Matthew Marquez from Trinidad has also confirmed participation as well as several players on the PGA Latin American circuit including Patrick Newcomb, Thomas Lilly and Marc Casullo. Mark Hoffman from Canada is also set to take part.</p>
      <p>Peter Chin, President of the Jamaica Golf Association explained the association’s decision to move the tournament from the Half Moon Golf Course where it was held in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Tryall has been one of the iconic courses in the Caribbean hosting the Johnnie Walker World Championships and a number of other international events, so we thought why not have one of the most prestigious events at one of the most prestigious courses in Jamaica?" he said.</p>
      <p>Ewan Peebles, the Director of Golf at Tryall expressed his delight at the decision.</p>
      <p>“It's the first time we are hosting this event and frankly, it’s overdue,” he said. “With our history of tournament and championship golf, it's about time we hosted the national open. It will be the first time we have done it and hopefully, it will not be the last."</p>
      <p>Peebles said the course was upgraded recently and that included the installation of a new irrigation system. He added that the course will be open to the public to experience and view the championships.</p>
      <p>The first day of the Open will feature a pro/am tournament featuring groups of amateurs and professional golfers in a shotgun start. The professional golfers will then take to the course on Thursday, December 12 in a three-day 54-hole championship.</p>
      <p>Alacran Foundation is a major sponsor of this year’s tournament and its Co-Chairman Rohan Marley said the foundation is eager to be part of anything that helps develop young sporting talent.</p>
      <p>"Ms Alessandra LoSavio, the founder of Alacran Foundation, she would do anything for the youths of Jamaica, anything that develop athletes, whether its arts or music, she is into doing that,” he said.  “That's the main focus of why we are sponsoring the golf tournament. To know that there is potential here for youths to develop their golf skills and not just golf skills but sports in general."</p>
