      <p>That’s before we get a very special visit by none other than the President of the United States Of America — aka the UK’s No1 impressionist Lewis MacLeod.</p>
      <p>Last night “Trump” said: “I’m half-Scotch you know so I can’t wait to return to Scotchland. So come along and meet me at The Scotch-ish Sun charity shop and help Make Christmas Great Again.”</p>
      <p>All money raised this year with go to MND Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland.</p>
      <p>And they’re already on to a winner after The People’s Postcode Lottery donated £20,000 to our store.</p>
      <p>Clara Govier, managing director of People’s Postcode Lottery, said: “Supporting charities is at the heart of what we do at People’s Postcode Lottery.</p>
      <p>“Alzheimer Scotland and MND Scotland are two charities doing stand-out work caring for people and families affected by these diseases throughout the country.</p>

      <p>"I’m delighted we’ve been able to kick-start the fundraising and get the Scottish Sun’s Christmas Shop off to a flying start for another year.”</p>
      <p>Stagecoach chairman Sir Brian Souter has vowed to match every penny raised over the counter from the shop in Glasgow’s St Enoch Centre.</p>
      <p>He’ll have to dig deep if last year’s record-breaking amount is anything to go by — our wonderful readers helped us rake in an incredible £13,000 at the tills.</p>
      <p>Last night, Sir Brian said: “I’m delighted that Stagecoach will be matching the generous donations of Scottish Sun readers.</p>

      <p>“MND Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland are incredible charities. Their work not only helps fund vital research into finding cures, it also means nobody needs to face these terrible conditions alone.”</p>
      <p>Our Sunta Store opens its doors at 11am on Wednesday, November 27, on the first floor of the St Enoch Centre in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Generous big brands — including Amazon, HarperCollins, Lidl, Coop and United Wholesale (Scotland) Ltd — have donated thousands of items for sale, which will make perfect last minute Christmas gifts.</p>
      <p>As if that wasn’t enough, a galaxy of star guests will be behind the cash desk every day to greet shoppers. To kick off the week, Anton and his bum-shaving mum Sherie Ann will officially open the store.</p>
