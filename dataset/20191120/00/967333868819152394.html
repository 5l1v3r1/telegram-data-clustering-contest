        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) – The House of Representatives passed a temporary funding measure on Tuesday to keep the US government open for an additional month beyond a 21 November deadline, avoiding the prospect of a shutdown in the weeks before the Christmas holiday shopping season.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Lawmakers passed the continuing resolution in a 231– 192 vote to fund the government until 20 December. The resolution faces a Senate vote before <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907061076169322-naval-air-weapons-base-in-california-on-shutdown-as-more-quakes-possible/">being sent to the White House</a> for President Donald Trump’s signature.</blockquote>
      <p>By keeping the government running, the House impeachment probe could continue without interruption. Democrats have <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201906151075880849-chemical-weapons-destruction-resumes-at-us-depot-after-shutdown-over-leak/">indicated they want</a> the inquiry finished, a report written and a vote on whether to remove Trump from office before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>If impeached, Trump would remain in office unless convicted by a two-thirds majority in the Senate.</p>
      <p>The resolution would exclude any restrictions on funding a wall on the US Mexican border, which President Donald Trump had demanded as a price for his signature.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats in Congress has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201903101073108699-Trump-Demand-9bln-Wall-cash/">blocked progress on completing</a> 12 annual spending bills needed to fund the government in fiscal 2020, which began nearly two months earlier.</p>
