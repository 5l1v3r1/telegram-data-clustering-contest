      <h1>Loan or loan for Riqui Puig</h1>

        <b>Riqui Puig is crying out for game time, but in a saturated midfield, there is no space for the Barca youth. The only possible solution is a loan move.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Riqui Puig was amazing for Barca during preseason. The player, who <b>stepped up from the youth academy</b>, unexpectedly moved to the first team but there he was faced with De Jong, Busquets, Rakitic, Arthur and Vidal.</p>
      <p>A midfield populated as if it were a 'supercity'. Still, the <b>loan option seemed distant </b>and the club preferred him to stay in the youth team.</p>
      <p>But the <b>Segunda B has become too small</b> for him in recent months. After playing for the first team he wants more and what seemed far away before <b>now seems closer</b> than ever.</p>

      <p>Patrick Kluivert, head of the Barca youth system, said that it is best he goes out on loan. This could become a double-edged sword for Riqui Puig.</p>
      <p><b>Leaving Barca hasn't worked out well for all youth players</b>, <b>Cucurella and Oriol Busquets</b> are doing well, but <b>Juan Miranda</b> hasn't got going at Schalke.</p>
      <p><b>The winter market will determine the future</b> of Riqui Puig at Barca. For now and until January he will have to keep playing in Segunda División B.</p>
