      <p>Spider-Man: Far From Home finally swings its way to Number 1 on this week’s Official Film Chart.</p>
      <p>In his fourth week on chart, Spider-Man finally snares glory, snatching the Number 1 spot ahead of a big new entry from Disney. Spider-Man: Far From Home, starring Tom Holland, Samuel L. Jackson and Jake Gyllenhaal, also claims the week’s biggest hit on DVD and Blu-ray.</p>
      <p>Leader of the pack digitally, it’s a new entry for Disney’s The Lion King (2). Journeying to the African savannah where a future king is born, John Favreau’s photorealistic remake of the ‘90s animated classic, starring Donald Glover and Beyoncé, stampedes into second place on digital downloads alone. With 110,000 digital sales, The Lion King has been downloaded more times in its opening seven days than the rest of this week’s Top 40 combined, the Official Charts Company can confirm.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Toy Story 4 slips to Number 3, and though Paul McCartney may have been announced as Glastonbury’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary headliner next year, Beatlemania cools off on the Official Film Chart, as Danny Boyle rom-com Yesterday falls two places to Number 4. Aladdin is still in the game at Number 5, with Elton John biopic, Rocketman, falling one place to 6.</p>
      <p>Regaining this week is Avengers: Endgame, up one place to 7, but minor tumbles are unavoidable for The Secret Life of Pets 2 (8) and Men in Black: International (3).</p>
      <p>And finally, Christmas has arrived early as Benedict Cumberbatch’s The Grinch sneaks back into the Top 10 in time for the festive season (10).</p>
