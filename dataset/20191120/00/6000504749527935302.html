        <b>Westpac has built a new cloud-based platform with Microsoft which draws on data sources from across the bank to provide real-time, personalised services to customers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Data Driven Experience Platform (DDEP), a Microsoft Azure based data hub, has been built with co-investment and engineering resources from both companies.<br/><br/>Westpac says the platform will catapult it to the forefront of digital banking, providing a foundation for real time data analytics across the bank, with the goal of delivering more personalised services based on greater understanding of customer behaviour and preference.<br/><br/>Westpac Group CIO, Craig Bright, says: “The Data Driven Experience Platform gives us access to an incredibly rich set of capabilities that enable us to engage digitally in real-time with our customers in a way that’s personalised, intelligent and autonomous. Our customers will start to experience this with the rollout of our new mobile app next year.”<br/><br/>In addition to Azure, Microsoft and Westpac have been working together to develop a new set of applications over the Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 programmes. <br/><br/>Westpac’s move to Microsoft 365 is a key component of the bank's WorkSMARTER programme supporting the adoption of agile development methodologies by allowing ideas to be shared and developed across multiple locations through electronic whiteboards, chat sessions, web conferencing and real-time document editing.</p>
