      <p><i>KSRTC’s provident fund had collected money above the permissible limit from employees</i> <br/><br/>The High Court has ordered the Provident Fund Commissioner to pay higher pension to the employees of KSRTC from whom the KSRTC Employees Contributory Provident Fund Trust had collected excess Provident Fund. The Trust had collected money beyond the permissible limit which had become a contention with the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). <br/><br/>The HC has given a six-month deadline for the process to be completed. “The respondent No.5-Trust (KSRTC-ECPF) shall within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the contribution along with interest from the petitioners forward the same to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation. <br/><br/>The Provident Fund Commissioner shall thereafter pay the higher pension with respect to the retired petitioners or receive higher contribution for the serving petitioners,” the HC said. <br/><br/>The HC also directed how the KSRTC should collect the PF amount. “What is required is that when KSRTC Employees Contributory Provident Fund Trust collects the balance amount over and above the ceiling limit, the same shall be collected along with accrued interest from the employees so that it can be forwarded to the Employees Provident Fund Organisation,” it said. <br/><br/>Hundreds of retired employees of KSRTC had approached the HC after the Regional Provident Fund office refused to pay them the higher pension. <br/>The advocate for the KSRTC Trust submitted that the “Trust has already forwarded the contribution on the ceiling limit...” <br/><br/><br/>The HC therefore directed the employees to “approach the Trust to find out what is the contribution that is required to be paid along with accrued interest so that the same could be deposited with KSRTC Employees Contributory Provident Fund Trust...”</p>
