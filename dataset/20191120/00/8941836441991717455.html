      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Major League Soccer players will meet top Mexican league counterparts at Banc of California Stadium on July 29, ending a 15-year streak of MLS All-Star Games involving European clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mls/">MLS</a> Commissioner Don Garber and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/liga-mx/">Liga MX</a> Executive President Enrique Bonilla made the announcement Wednesday during a news conference at the stadium.</p>
      <p>This will be the second MLS All-Star Game in the Los Angeles area following a 3-1 win by the league’s All-Stars over Chivas in 2003 at the home of the LA Galaxy in Carson. The All-Star Game switched to an East vs. West format in 2004, then the following year to MLS playing a European club preparing for the start of its season.</p>
      <p>Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game is scheduled for July 14 at Dodger Stadium.</p>
