      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> has canceled the premiere of one of the tech company’s first original films, “The Banker” the day before it was to debut at Los Angeles’ AFI Film Festival.</p>
      <p>In a statement Wednesday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> said that last week it learned of “some concerns” surrounding “The Banker” and needs “some time to look into these matters.” An <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> spokesperson declined to elaborate.</p>
      <p>The based-on-a-true-story film stars Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie. Mackie plays Bernard Garrett who in the 1950s and ‘60s recruited a white man to pose as the face of his expansive real estate and banking business. In 1968, Garrett was convicted of misusing bank funds.</p>
      <p>The film is <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a>’s boldest step yet into moviemaking. A theatrical release is scheduled for Dec. 6, after which it would be a part of the company’s new streaming service, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/apple/">Apple</a> TV Plus.</p>

        <p>AFI said it would replace “The Banker” with a screening of Noah Baumbach’s Netflix release “Marriage Story” as its closing-night film.</p>
