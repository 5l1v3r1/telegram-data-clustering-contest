      <p>Canada’s men’s baseball team will be in Group B with Colombia, Cuba and Venezuela at the WBSC Americas Olympic qualifier next March, with the top finisher of the eight-team tournament earning a spot in the Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
      <p>The host United States headlines Group A with the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>The tournament will take place at a yet-to-be-determined venue in Arizona from March 22-26.</p>
      <p>The opening round of the qualifier will be played from March 22-24, with the top two teams of each group advancing to the superround to play two-crossover games.</p>
      <p>One final Olympic qualifier will be held in Taichung, Taiwan, from April 1-5 for the sixth and final spot. Six teams, including the second- and third-place finisher from the Americas qualifier in Arizona, will compete in that tournament.</p>
      <p>Canada failed at its first chance to qualify for the 2020 Olympics, finishing seventh at Premier 12 earlier this month. Bronze-medal-winning Mexico qualified from that tournament as the top finisher from the Americas region while silver-medalist South Korea also earned a berth.</p>
      <p>Japan won Premier 12 but was guaranteed its Olympic spot as the host country. Israel won its Europe/Africa regional qualifier in September to secure a berth.</p>
      <p>Cuba is the highest-ranked team in Canada’s group for the Americas qualifier at No. 5. Venezuela is next at No. 9, Canada is No. 10 and Columbia is No. 14.</p>
      <p>Baseball is making its return to the Olympic program for the first time since 2008.</p>
      <p>The 2020 version will feature six teams, down from eight in each of the previous five Olympic tournaments from 1992 to 2008.</p>
      <p>Canada’s best finish at an Olympic Games is fourth place in Athens in 2004, when it lost to Japan in the bronze-medal game.</p>
      <p>Cuba has won the most Olympic gold medals with three (1992, 1996 and 2004), while the U.S. won in 2000 and South Korea won the last tournament in Beijing.</p>
