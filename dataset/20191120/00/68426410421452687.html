      <p>As the Toronto-area real estate market settles into mid-November, signs are emerging that buyers and sellers are drifting away.</p>
      <p>“I feel the market has been calming down recently,” says Boris Kholodov, an agent with Johnston &amp; Daniel, a division of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.</p>
      <p>An unseasonably-early winter snowstorm in the Greater Toronto Area didn’t help, he adds.</p>
      <p>“When it’s so dark at 5 p.m., people are reluctant to go and see properties or have showings. The snow makes it difficult as well,” Mr.Kholodov says. “At the end of the day, buying a house is an emotional decision and emotions are impacted by the weather.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov adds that when sellers make fewer listings available, a chain reaction takes place as there are fewer buyers who list their existing properties in turn.</p>
      <p>Nationally, Canada’s real estate market flattened out in October after seven straight months of gaining ground.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) reported last week that sales were unchanged in October from September.</p>
      <p>Compared with October of 2018, sales jumped 12.9 per cent across Canada last month.</p>
      <p>Sales activity is now almost 20 per cent above the six-year low reached in February, 2019 but remains seven per cent below the frantic pace reached in 2016 and 2017, CREA says.</p>
      <p>Lackluster results in central Toronto dragged down the national average, while the surrounding Greater Toronto Area and Hamilton-Burlington also hit a soft patch, CREA says.</p>
      <p>The Greater Vancouver Area, meanwhile, saw a comeback in sales.</p>
      <p>The national average price in October was $525,000, up 5.8 per cent from the same month last year.</p>
      <p>“It’s a full-blown buyer’s market, or on the cusp of one, in a number of housing markets across the Prairies and in Newfoundland,” says Gregory Klump, chief economist at CREA.</p>
      <p>Mr. Klump says the mortgage “stress test” has contributed to that dynamic by reducing the number of competing buyers who can qualify for mortgage financing.</p>
      <p>In January, 2018, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions introduced a set of regulations designed to ensure sure that borrowers can afford to repay a mortgage if interest rates rise.</p>
      <p>The number of newly listed properties dipped 1.8 per cent in October compared with the same month last year.</p>
      <p>Mr. Klump says the Greater Toronto Area remains in balanced territory.</p>
      <p>Agents say the market typically winds down in late November as buyers and sellers prepare for the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov is already hearing from some sellers who want his guidance on listing a property for sale in 2020. Mr. Kholodov believes most sellers will benefit from a spring bounce.</p>
      <p>“I’m advising most people to hold off,” he says. “I do expect the market to revive itself in February, which happens almost every year.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov mainly works in the market above $2-million in central Toronto. That slice of the market is dominated by buyers looking for a family home, he says, and therefore tied to the school calendar.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov says some homeowners in neighbourhoods such as Summerhill and Yorkville are contacting him now because they want to start fixing up their houses for sale.</p>
      <p>“Now they call me months ahead. They want advice on timing and the preparation of the property for the market.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov says most buyers these days want a house to be move-in ready. Sellers who want to attract top buyers – and top dollar – need to ensure the property is renovated, stylish and worry-free.</p>
      <p>“That requires a lot of lead time so sometimes we start planning their moves months ahead.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov adds that some sellers are developers who have built a new infill house. In some cases, they are pulling existing listings or holding off on listing recently-completed projects because they expect more buyers and higher prices in the spring.</p>
      <p>Sometimes even the expense of carrying the property over the winter leads to a better final result than selling in the winter, he says.</p>
      <p>Still, the market has been unpredictable lately, he cautions, and the outlook for the spring in uncertain.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know if there will be the oceans of buyers we usually get.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov has strategically listed one property in recent days because it doesn’t fit the mold of a traditional family home.</p>
      <p>He’s marketing the four-bedroom house at 29 Edmund Ave. in Toronto’s South Hill neighbourhood as a “blank slate.” The property is being sold for land value only, Mr. Kholodov says, after a smaller neighbouring lot was severed and redeveloped with two houses.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov believes a builder might put two or three houses on this 75-foot-by-64-foot lot, which has an asking price of $3-million.</p>
      <p>The existing house has been well-maintained, he says, but it cannot compete with many of the new houses being built today, which have such enticing features as high ceilings and large windows.</p>
      <p>For that reason, he hasn’t even added interior photos to the listing.</p>
      <p>“The house is nice,” Mr. Kholodov says. “The reality is, a house similar to this one was torn down to make room for two new ones about three years ago.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kholodov is not hesitating to list this house in November because a developer needs lots of time to plan, obtain regulatory approvals and rebuild.</p>
      <p>“This is not the seasonal buyer that needs the kids to go to school in September.”</p>
