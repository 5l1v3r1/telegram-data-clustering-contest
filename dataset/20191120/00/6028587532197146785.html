      <h1>Consumers Worry Most About Losing Their Jobs During A Recession – But Few Do Anything About It</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Janet Berry-Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Talk of a recession has been practically unavoidable in recent months. An inverted yield curve, slowing GDP growth, lower earnings growth estimates, and other so-called recession indicators are leaving Americans wondering how a possible recession would impact their pocketbooks. According to a new <a href="https://creditcards.usnews.com/low-interest#us-news-survey-consumer-credit-may-not-be-ready-for-a-recession">survey</a> from U.S. News &amp; World Report, nearly 30% of consumers are concerned about a recession occurring within the next six months. Job cuts are the number one concern, with 29% of respondents worried about possible job loss.</p>
      <p>Despite these concerns, few consumers appear to be doing anything to prepare. According to the survey, almost half of consumers either don’t have an emergency fund or don’t have enough saved to cover their living expenses for more than three months.</p>
      <p>What’s more, only 22% plan to pay down their credit card debt, which is concerning because more than 15% have credit card debt that exceeds $10,000.</p>

      <p>After checking out the survey, I had a chance to chat with Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and credit card expert at U.S. News, to get her take on the survey results and advice for preparing your finances for a recession.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Janet Berry-Johnson: According to the survey, few people plan to pay off their credit card debt in anticipation of a possible recession. Why is it so important to pay down debt?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: We saw that most of the respondents we asked were most worried about losing their jobs if a recession should show up. But you know, if you've got credit card debt, and then a recession hits, things are just going to get worse for you.</p>
      <p>If you have an emergency fund, that helps a little bit. Our survey showed that not very many people have an emergency fund or can't pay their living expenses for more than three months. That's enough to make you worry right there. And with debt on top of that, people can find themselves in a lot of financial trouble.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons we did this survey was to point out some of these things and also to remind consumers to basically be prepared for a recession all the time. Get your money in order, and then if a recession hits you don't have to worry about it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berry-Johnson: Right. Most of your advice for preparing financially for a recession – have an emergency fund, pay off credit card debt – is good advice no matter what.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: You never know. Right now, it looks like recession worries are backing off a little bit, but that could change again in another month. So it's just good to be prepared because the economy goes in cycles – good times and bad times – it doesn't stay the same. It's always good to know that you can survive whatever happens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berry-Johnson: So if somebody wants to get started paying down their debt to prepare for a possible recession, would you say it’s a good idea to prioritize paying off high-interest debt like credit cards as opposed to their mortgage or auto loan?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: Yeah, it's good to pay off card debt because that's really toxic debt. The whole point of credit cards is it’s a money management tool to help you improve your credit score so you can save money on mortgages and things like that. It's very important that if you've got debt, start saving as much as you can and pay it towards the debt. Whether a recession comes or not, you do not want to have credit card debt. It's important for many reasons, but the main thing is that you’re paying compound interest and essentially throwing money away, so you're paying much more than you ever intended to pay for those purchases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berry-Johnson: Another big problem that especially impacts a lot of young people right now is student loan debt. Should paying off student loans be a priority as well?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: Yeah, you know, all of your bills are priorities to a certain extent. You want to be able to pay all your bills on time. Now, if something happens, let's say you did lose your job and you can pay your mortgage, but you don't have enough for your student loan payments. Call the lender and explain what’s going on. Try that before you miss your first payment and see if they can work something out for you.</p>
      <p>If it's a temporary situation, give the lender an honest explanation of what's happening. You can try this with credit card lenders as well. Most of them have hardship departments, and they'll work with you for about a year. They may let you miss one payment or lower your interest rate for short time, or maybe lower your minimum payment for a little while so you can get caught up. Those aren’t long term solutions, though. If you're in debt and can't pay your bills, you probably need to talk to credit counselor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berry-Johnson: If someone is looking at the results of this survey and they don’t have an emergency fund at all, where would you recommend they start?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: The important thing is to start today, even if you've just got $25 to put into a saving account, get started. Start saving everything that you can.</p>
      <p>Ideally, you want to have about six months of expenses saved up. I know that's a big chunk of change for a lot of people. It doesn't have to happen tomorrow. The most important thing is to get started. Go through your budget and see what you can cut out – even just temporarily – to get your emergency savings account funded.</p>
      <p>And if you're doing a good job at work, ask for a raise. You never know. That’s what I did to help pay off my credit card debt years ago.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Berry-Johnson: Another issue people are facing now is low interest rates. The interest rates available in savings accounts are so low. Should that be a concern when you’re trying to build an emergency fund?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Harzog: We used to have savings accounts where you could get a nice return, but those days are over. You may be able to get a higher rate with some of the online savings accounts, so check those out. Every little bit helps, but you basically have to do this yourself. Don’t worry about investing it. Just get the money in the account. You can’t really count on interest, so just count on your own hard work and your money-saving abilities.</p>
