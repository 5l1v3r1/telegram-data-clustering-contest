      <p>The Golden Ratio of Beauty originates from the time of the Greeks and Romans and was popularized during the Renaissance when artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci used this mathematical principal to compute the beauty in their masterpieces. According to the ratio, the ideal proportion between various sites of the face is 1.618. While historically different cultures were believed to have different standards of beauty, <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099629">more recent work</a> has found high consistency between people’s judgements of facial beauty within and between cultures. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016363839890011X">Research has also shown</a> that our perceptions of beauty may be hard-wired into our being such that newborn infants look longer at pictures of beautiful faces.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7574225/Bella-Hadid-declared-beautiful-woman-world.html">A recent study</a> published by facial cosmetic surgeon Julian De Silva implemented this mathematical formula to determine the world’s most beautiful woman in 2019. In the article, he claimed Bella Hadid was the world's most beautiful women followed by Beyonce.</p>

      <p>This list has led to significant controversy around the Golden Ratio and what it means to be beautiful. Take a look at Webster’s definition of beauty: “The quality or aggregate of qualities in a person or thing that gives pleasure to the senses." When discussing the physical beauty of an individual, this definition is assessed by the visual sense. Of course, when appreciating physical beauty through sight, there are certainly implications about the ways in which the subject may be pleasing to the other senses as well.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/beauty">Attractiveness</a>, on the other hand, is defined as “arousing interest or pleasure; appealing.” Beyond pleasure, the inclusion of interest and appeal into the criteria for attractiveness allows for more subjectivity. There are many factors that influence one’s perception of attractiveness to another such as sociocultural attributes and personal preferences unique to a particular individual’s tastes and life experiences. One such example is the preference for self-resemblance. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21267643">One study</a> showed that heterosexual males in particular are more likely to rate an individual of the opposite-<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> as more attractive when that individual looks more similar to their own appearance than someone who does not. This is presumably due to inferences drawn about shared genetic background. Another interesting perspective is that of perceptual narrowing, in which there is a decrease in the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/bias">discrimination</a> ability between facial attributes to which we are not regularly exposed to during critical times in our development.</p>
      <p>Although the perception of beauty is more consistent within and between groups, it is of course not universally standard. Ultimately, though, it is the additional dimensions of perceived interest and appeal inherent to the concept of attractiveness that explain why not all readers would agree that Bella Hadid is in fact the world’s most attractive woman despite her 94.35% Golden Ratio score.</p>

      <p>Might as well throw out that mathematical formula because she’s not anywhere close to beautiful or attractive or even pretty.<br/>Lots of makeup helps her but sadly she looks like her dad.</p>
      <p>Sorry but that’s the truth and everybody knows it.</p>

      <p>Interesting, and there seems to be something to those ratios, but they don't seem to provide enough to assess person's face beauty. There are lots of other factors, like shape of nose, eyes, lips.</p>
      <p>I also wonder: Do same ratios apply to male face?<br/>What about non-human animal faces?</p>

      <p>I dont think the application of the golden ratio can or should apply to the face...unless we are talking about a mannequin face. The features are "perfect" but boring and not beautiful.<br/>To name one woman the most beautiful is ludicrous, there are so many combinations of features as there people. The most stunning faces are the ones that a feature that is out of bounds of what is considered beautiful.</p>
