      <p>After starring for Ajax last season, De Ligt attracted interest from several top European clubs before eventually penning a long-term deal with the Serie A champions.</p>
      <p>However, with De Ligt having failed to produce the same consistency during the early stages of his time in Turin, Dutch compatriot Kluivert has claimed that the youngster feels like he should have chosen a different option.</p>
      <p>Kluivert told <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>: "I didn't personally try to convince him about joining Barcelona. I only told him about the positive aspects of Barcelona as a club and city.</p>
      <p>"We are obviously talking about a great defender and in the end he made a choice. I think he slightly regrets it now, but that's the way it is.</p>
      <p>"In life, you must make choices, sometimes good ones and sometimes bad. You have to learn from your decisions."</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has made 12 starts for Juventus in all competitions this season.</p>
