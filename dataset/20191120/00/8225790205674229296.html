      <p>He was wanted for violating the conditions of his supervised release. Federal authorities said they believed Manguchei was getting help from associates to evade capture.</p>
      <p>Five years ago, Manguchei also hid in the woods on Kauai for 23 days when he violated his state parole.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, authorities with the U.S. Marshals reported that they had also arrested 35-year-old Alicia Kilpatrick in relation to the case.</p>
