      <p>Puerto Rico closed League C Group C play with a 3-0 victory over Anguilla on Tuesday at the Juan Ramon Loubriel Stadium in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Puerto Rico opened the scoring in the 56th minute. Rodolfo Sulia tried a long-range shot that was deflected by Anguilla goalkeeper Ryan Liddie. However, Puerto Rico captain Sidney Rivera sprinted forward and knocked in the rebound to give his side the lead.</p>
      <p>Rivera doubled his total in the 67th minute, converting from the penalty spot by shooting a low shot to the goalkeeperâ€™s left after Anguilla was whistled for a handball in the box.</p>
      <p>Things went from bad to worse for Anguilla minutes later, with defender Kion Lee seeing his second yellow in the 70th minute and taking Anguilla down to 10 men. They also had to replace Liddie, with the captain making a diving save on a set piece but making contact with the post and suffering an injury that required Kareem Burris come in and replace him.</p>
      <p>Devin Vega chipped the ball over Burris in the 82nd minute to extend the lead to three, getting on the end of a ball over the top from substitute Jan Mateo.</p>
      <p>Guatemala topped the group with a perfect record, while Puerto Rico managed to get six points. Anguilla will go into the next edition of the CNL still looking for its first-ever points.</p>
