      <h3>Static Fire Test</h3>
      <p>SpaceX performed a static fire test on the SuperDraco engines that form its Crew Dragon spacecraft’s emergency abort system last week.</p>
      <p>And thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/Commercial_Crew/status/1197173732034396160">new footage</a> released by NASA, you can watch the fiery test in all of its slow-motion glory.</p>

      <h3>Abort!</h3>
      <p>This wasn’t the first time SpaceX tested the system — it <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1172215123777216512">tweeted</a> in September that is had already “completed over 700 tests of the spacecraft’s SuperDraco engines” — but not all of those tests went as well as this one.</p>
      <p>In April, an earlier version of SpaceX’s passenger spacecraft blew up in <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cause-spacex-explosion-april">a massive explosion</a> during a test of the very same emergency system. But luckily the space agency soon figured out what had gone wrong.</p>
      <p>“Evidence shows that a leaking component allowed liquid oxidizer — nitrogen tetroxide — to enter high-pressure helium tubes during ground processing,” SpaceX wrote in a <a href="https://www.spacex.com/news/2019/07/15/update-flight-abort-static-fire-anomaly-investigation">July statement</a>.</p>
      <h3>Safety First</h3>
      <p>SpaceX is, obviously, still working out the kinks in the Crew Dragon, but eventually, the spacecraft will use a Falcon 9 rocket to carry two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
      <p>If anything goes wrong during launch, the SuperDraco engines will allow the Crew Dragon to carry the astronauts away from the massive rocket before the system deploys parachutes to slow the capsule’s decent to the surface below.</p>
