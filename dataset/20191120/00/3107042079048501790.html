      <p>Queenstown police are warning of the dangers of taking illegal drugs after a man had a seizure in a downtown bar this morning.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Steve Watt said police assisted paramedics who attended the 28-year-old, who began having seizures in a Camp St bar about 3.25am.</p>
      <p>"He was taken outside by friends, where he became unresponsive.''</p>
      <p>Police were told the man had taken a gram of MDMA.</p>
      <p>"Ambulance were called, and after some time the male became semi-conscious and responding to voice commands.''</p>
      <p>Sgt Watt said the consequences of taking drugs were more serious than commonly believed.</p>
      <p>Drugs were often not what sellers purported them to be, and instead could be a "concoction of chemicals'' that were extremely harmful and could cause extreme reactions.</p>
      <p>A 52-year-old Arrowtown man was arrested about noon yesterday after he was found carrying 4.18gm of methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>The man appeared in the Queenstown District Court on a charge of possession of methamphetamine, and was remanded on bail.</p>
