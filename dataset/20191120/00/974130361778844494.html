      <p>Last night in Cardiff, Wales put Hungary to the sword 2-0, qualifying for Euro 2020, and in the process clarifying Ireland's path through the Euro 2020 playoffs.</p>
      <p>It means Ireland is set to play Slovakia on Thursday March 26.</p>
      <p>If Ireland win, they will play the winner of Bosnia v Northern Ireland, which will be played the same day.</p>
      <p>The date of the playoffs final is set for Tuesday March 31.Â The venue for that playoffs final will drawn on Friday in France.</p>
      <p>There is a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/ireland-set-to-face-slovakia-in-euro-2020-playoffs-1.4088808?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fsport%2Fsoccer%2Fireland-set-to-face-slovakia-in-euro-2020-playoffs-1.4088808">slight chance</a> that Ireland will be moved to Pot A should UEFA feel compelled to do so, but this is seen as unlikely.</p>
      <p>The rest of the playoffs look something like this:</p>
