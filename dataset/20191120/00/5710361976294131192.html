      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Hasso Plattner, co-founder and chairman of German software house SAP, has sold a stake worth around 100 million euros ($111 million), putting a slight dent in his multi-billion-euro holding.</p>
      <p>The divestment, disclosed in a series of regulatory filings, would reduce Plattner's holding in Europe's most valuable technology firm to an estimated 6.2% from the 6.3% disclosed in February of this year, according to an SAP spokesman.</p>
      <p>Plattner, 75, founded SAP in the early 1970s with a group of former colleagues from IBM (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/ibm">IBM</a>). He continues to exert great influence over the company, orchestrating the hiring of co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein last month.</p>
