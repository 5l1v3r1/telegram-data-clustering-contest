      <p>Former Edo State Governorship candidate, Pastor <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/edo-2020-election-drama-as-ize-iyamu-sets-to-dump-pdp-for-apc/"><u><b>Osagie Ize-Iyamu</b></u></a> has said he is leaving the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/embattled-oshiomhole-face-tougher-threats-as-edo-gov-obaseki-endorses-suspension/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b> </u></a>without malice.</p>
      <p>The former Secretary to the Edo State Government made this known in his resignation letter dated 21 November 2019 and addressed to the state chairman of the PDP, Dan Orbih.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the South-South zonal vice-chairman of the APC will formally resign from the PDP tomorrow, Thursday.</p>
      <p>Ize-Iyamu said that his decision to leave the PDP along with several leaders of the party from across the state was unanimous and was “not an easy one.</p>
      <p>He, however, admitted that he has enjoyed a warm relationship with many members of the party.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There are however many compelling reasons that have necessitated this resolution, but it would be uncharitable even to throw stones at a house we once inhabited and many friends and associates.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“We wish to state for the records that our primary motivation in politics is to effectively represent our people in the political arena and ensure that government policies and resources are for the betterment of our people,”</i> the letter stated.</p>
