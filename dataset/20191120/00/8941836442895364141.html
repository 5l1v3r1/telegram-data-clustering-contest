      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - A Caribou native on the International Space Station has had a high-flying chat with another Caribou native.</p>
      <p>U.S. Sen. Susan Collins spoke to Jessica Meir on Tuesday, telling the astronaut that she’s inspired boys and girls from Caribou to follow their dreams.</p>
      <p>The Republican from Maine also congratulated Meir for participating in the first all-women spacewalk. The spacewalk lasted more than seven hours as Meir and fellow astronaut Christina Koch installed a new battery charge-discharge unit.</p>
