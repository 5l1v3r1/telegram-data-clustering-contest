      <p>MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) - A Somali intelligence official says a U.S. drone strike has killed a senior officer with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-shabab/">al-Shabab</a> extremist group.</p>
      <p>The official says the unidentified officer had maintained links with foreign extremist groups with the aim of coordinating future attacks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.</p>
      <p>Residents said the officer’s vehicle was struck Tuesday outside the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-shabab/">al-Shabab</a>-held town of Kunya Barow in southern Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region.</p>
      <p>The U.S. military in a statement confirms the strike and says the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-shabab/">al-Shabab</a> member had direct ties to al-Qaida. The U.S. says the strike was carried out in coordination with Somalia’s government.</p>
