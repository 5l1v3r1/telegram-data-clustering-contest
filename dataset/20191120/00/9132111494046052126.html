      <p>The Auditor-General, Daniel Yaw Domelevo has since his appointment carved a remarkable niche for himself and his department in the eyes of Ghanaians for his relentless and fearless fight against corruption in the public sector.</p>
      <p>But for some time, Mr Domelovo has become a ‘target’ for some government appointees who may have been cited in several forms of financial malfeasance in their various offices.</p>
      <p>Last week, the opposition National Democratic Congress alleged that the Auditor-General has become a victim of fabricated charges for recently surcharging the Senior Minister Yaw Osafo-Maafo of $1 million in connection with the payment to a private firm Kroll &amp; Associates “for no work done”.</p>
      <p>On the back of this and other related issues arising, the executive director at the Centre of Democratic Development has added his voice to the alleged victimization of the Auditor-General who according to him, has worked hard to redeem the image of his department.</p>
      <p>Professor Henry Kwasi Prempeh said the actions of some government officials have created a perception amongst Ghanaians that the Auditor-General Daniel Dormelevo is being victimised for fighting corruption.</p>
      <p>Answering a question on whether or not the Auditor-General is being victimized for his anti-corruption campaign, Professor Prempeh said; “Absolutely, I think that is the perception that people will get and we in civil society are worried about that. We have somebody who has come to power, he has exhibited in many of the things that he has done that he means business for the republic and he’s trying to get things moving. He’s given the Auditor-General’s office some kind of profile (positive one).”</p>

      <p>But the several instances of involvement of public officials, according to Prof Kwesi Prempeh has created a perception that Mr Domelevo is being maltreated for his role in anti-corruption.</p>
      <p>“The kind of ‘every time, every move he makes’ then somebody is trying to checkmate him definitely does give the impression that he’s been persecuted which is not right. If you want to fight anti-corruption and you find somebody who is helping in the fight and standing on their constitutional role, I think that people will definitely see it as you standing in the way of somebody who is trying to do good,” he said.</p>
      <p>Professor Kwasi Prempeh was speaking on ClassFM’s Executive breakfast show, Monday, November 19, 2019.</p>
      <p>The Auditor-General is set to be investigated by the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) for an alleged breach of the Procurement Law, Act 663 in the procurement of vehicles worth almost GH¢6.2 million.</p>
      <p>This was triggered after a private citizen petitioned EOCO.</p>
      <p>But Mr Domelevo in response has argued that he was not directly involved in the said procurement of cars and so cannot be held accountable.</p>
