      <p>A Boggabilla man has been arrested for detaining and threatening another person with a machete on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Police will allege that in the early hours of Tuesday morning, November 19, a 34-year-old Boggabilla man armed himself with a machete and detained a male victim known to him in a vehicle.</p>
      <p>The accused then drove the vehicle in and around the Boggabilla township while threatening the victim with the machete.</p>
      <p>He forced the victim to purchase a number of items on his behalf at a local service station, before they both returned to the vehicle. The accused man continued to detain the victim inside the vehicle while he drove menacingly throughout Boggabilla.</p>

      <p>When the accused stopped the vehicle and accosted an unknown male in Yeoman Street, the victim escaped and sought refuge in a nearby motel.</p>
      <p>The accused male then fled the scene in the victim's car where he proceeded to drive in and around the Boggabilla township and the Toomelah mission.</p>
      <p>He evaded police before the stolen vehicle was abandoned in bushland adjacent to the Toomelah Mission.</p>
      <p>Later that afternoon, he was located and arrested without incident.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old was charged with a number of serious offences including detaining a person with intent to obtain advantage, armed with intent to commit an indictable offence, take and drive conveyance without consent and intimidation.</p>
      <p>The man has been bail refused and is next to appear before the Moree Local Court on February 3, 2020.</p>
