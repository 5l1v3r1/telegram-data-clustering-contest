        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>What Rep. Adam Schiff is hiding reveals the truth (“Democrats’ star witness shoots down ‘bribery,’ cover-up claims,” Web, Nov. 19). Mr. Schiff’s witness, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an obvious anti-Trumper, showed his illusions of grandeur by saying: “I am the director for Ukraine. I’m responsible for Ukraine. I’m the most knowledgeable. I’m the authority for Ukraine for the National Security Council and the White House.” Mr. Vindman complained about “outside Influencers” interfering with his work.</p>
      <p>Mr. Schiff has repeatedly lied and his lies are obvious. He and his staff had prior contact with the “whistleblower” before the complaint was filed, and they may have been involved in helping initiate that complaint. They certainly helped orchestrate it, arranging Trump-hating legal counsel for the whistleblower. Mr. Schiff’s prime source for all this? Mr. Vindman.</p>
      <p>If you turn to news sources outside the anti-Trump mainstream media, you find that the whistleblower worked for or with the Obama administration and others who ought to be under investigation for attempting to illegally undermine an elected president. The whistleblower was believed to have helped with the Russia-collusion hoax, too. In fact, he is so dirty that he doesn’t even come close to meeting the true definition of a whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake about it: Never in the history of our country has there been such an attempted coup to overthrow a constitutionally elected president. All Americans should be deeply concerned. The media should do their job. Nothing prevents the media from divulging the name and background of the whistleblower. It is time.</p>
