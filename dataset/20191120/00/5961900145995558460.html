      <h1>Amazon Is Already Working On S2 Of Its Huge ‘LOTR’ Series, Which Is Peak Confidence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:32:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:32</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>Amazon Studios has done the right damn thing and confirmed it’s already working on season 2 of its huge <i>Lord of the Ring </i>series. Yes, we know Amazon’s in a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/how-lord-rings-tv-series-landed-at-amazon-not-netflix-1099213">five-season <i>commitment</i></a><i>,</i> but things happen. RIP the <i>Game of Thrones </i>spin-off(s).</p>

      <p>Head of Amazon Studios <b>Jennifer Salke </b>confirmed the news to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/">Deadline</a>, revealing season 2 is already in the works.</p>
      <p>Filming hasn’t even started on season 1 yet but it’s supposed to kick off soon. We also don’t have a release date <i>and</i> the entire team will go on a four-to-five month hiatus after filming the first two episodes so the crew can assess their work and figure out what needs fixing. Deadline says this is very normal and everyone does it, but <i>still</i>… I’m an impatient lass.</p>
      <p>On the bright side, <i>Lord of the Rings </i>will officially shoot in New Zealand which is a short hop, skip, and a jump away from us… if you want to somehow crash the set / become an extra.</p>
      <p>Cast wise, we’ve got nothing. Well, we have <i>source talk. </i>And if you’re interested in source talk, here’s the gist of it. Eyebrows man <b>Will Poulter </b>(<i>Midsommer</i>) has reportedly joined the cast in an undisclosed role and <b>Markella Kavenagh </b>(<i>Romper Stomper</i>) has apparently been cast as a character named <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/lord-of-the-rings-series-amazon-cast-markella-kavenagh-1203268175/"><b>Tyra</b></a>.</p>
      <p><i>Star Trek </i><i>4 </i>writers <b>J.D. Payne </b>and <b>Patrick McKay </b>have been sworn in as showrunners. The pair are surrounded by a whole heap of talent including writers <b>Gennifer Hutchinson </b>(<i>Breaking Bad</i>), <b>Helen Shang </b>(<i>Hannibal</i>), <b>Jason Cahill </b>(<i>The Sopranos</i>) <b>Justin Doble </b>(<i>Stranger Things</i>), <b>Stephany Folson </b>(<i>Toy Story 4</i>), and <b>Bryan Cogman </b>(<i>Game of Thrones</i>). Fun fact: Cogman was supposed to helm his own <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/uncategorized/bryan-cogman-game-of-thrones-spinoff-1203197045/"><i>GoT </i>spin-off</a> but that pretty much went to shits when he jumped ship to Amazon.</p>
      <p><b>J.A. Bayona, </b>whose directing credits include <i>The Impossible, The Orphanage, A Monster Calls, </i>and <i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, </i>will direct those first two episodes. Pressure’s on.</p>
      <p>The crew also includes the original <i>Lord of the Rings </i>illustrator / concept artist <b>John Howe </b>as well as Tolkien Scholar <b>Tom Shippey</b>, who may or may not have said there are supposed to be 20 episodes in season 1.</p>
      <p>Amazon’s <i>Lord of the Rings, </i>based on the works of <b>J.R.R Tolkien</b>, will take place in the Second Age. We’ll keep you updated on that release date.</p>
