      <p>Cellphone footage of the adorable, yet scary encounter shows two corgis sitting on a red wagon fitted with bars in an effort to mimic a dinosaur enclosure. The pair are said to be dressed up as a stegosaurus and a velociraptor.</p>
      <blockquote>"This video was taken at the 3rd Annual Texas Corgi Roundup in Temple on November the 9th 2019,” reads a statement Viral Hog obtained from the video’s owner. “These Corgis belong to my stepdaughter.”</blockquote>
