      <p>The Samsung Galaxy A51 has been collecting the required certification from various agencies for the past weeks ahead of what appears to be an imminent launch. We recently also got out <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a51_appears_in_first_renders_and_passes_wifi_certification-news-40052.php">first renders</a> of the phone which revealed it will boast a centered punch-hole display and L-shaped quad camera setup.</p>
      <p>The latest clue comes from the Bluetooth certification agency which signals that we are closer to the official release. The device passed with the SM-AF15F/N model numbers and the only notable info that we got from the listing is that the phone will feature Bluetooth 5.0 support.</p>
