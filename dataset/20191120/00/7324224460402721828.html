      <p>Stormzy has revealed that his in-ear monitors failed 20 minutes into his headline performance at Glastonbury Festival, making it the “most difficult thing” he has ever done.</p>
      <p>In-ear monitors are used by musicians to hear their own songs when they are playing live, and help them stay in time and key.</p>
      <p>The Brit Award-winning grime rapper, 26, said that when he walked off stage he thought it had been “the worst thing” he had ever done.</p>

      <p>However, after speaking to festival organiser Emily Eavis he realised that it had gone “all right”.</p>
      <p>He told Q Magazine: “The thing about Glasto, and I’ve not told anybody this, but I had no sound.</p>
      <p>“My in-ears blew after about 20 minutes, so I had no sound for the whole thing. It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done.</p>
      <p>“When I walked off stage, I thought I’d f***** it. I thought it was the worst thing I’d ever done.</p>
      <p>“I came off stage and thought I’d totally, absolutely, blown it. I was crying for, like, an hour. I was in hysterics.</p>

      <p>“I thought I’d f***** it up. Heartbroken, man. Heartbroken. Then after calming down for an hour, some of the people at the festival, Emily Eavis and that, gave us a memory stick to watch it back.</p>
      <p>“And I got about halfway through and I was, like, ‘Shit, I think it all went all right’.”</p>
      <p>On Tuesday Stormzy, real name Michael Omari, announced that his second album will be called Heavy Is The Head and will be released on December 13.</p>
      <p>In a post to his 1.3 million Twitter followers, he also unveiled the album’s cover image, which shows him wearing a crown and holding the Banksy-designed Union Jack stab vest he wore at Glastonbury.</p>
      <p>Stormzy used his Friday night slot on the Pyramid Stage in June to highlight the experience of young black people in the UK.</p>

      <p>Crime statistics flashed across the big screens along with excerpts from a speech by Labour MP David Lammy about racial prejudice in the criminal justice system.</p>
      <p>Stormzy said the performance was “significant” because it felt like the “absolute summary and epitome of everything” he had done so far in his career.</p>
      <p>The rapper, who was awarded the prize for best solo artist at the Q Awards in October, also ruled himself out of running for prime minister against Boris Johnson.</p>

      <p>He said: “Oh nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. That’s not on the cards for me. I’m gonna stick to being a musician. That’s what I’m best at.”</p>
      <p>Stormzy also described meeting Beyonce and Jay-Z as “the greatest conversation of my life” and said he would like to collaborate with the couple, “God willing”.</p>
