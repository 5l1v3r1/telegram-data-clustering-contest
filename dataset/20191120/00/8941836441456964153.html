      <p>WRENTHAM, Mass. (AP) - A Rhode Island dog trainer who was caring for the beloved pet of former New England Patriots linebacker Jerod Mayo when the animal died has pleaded guilty to related charges.</p>
      <p>The Sun Chronicle reports that 42-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amelia-ferreira/">Amelia Ferreira</a>, of Cranston, was sentenced Tuesday in Massachusetts to 18 months of probation after pleading guilty to obstructing justice.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amelia-ferreira/">Ferreira</a> was caring for Knox, Mayo’s 5-year-old English bulldog, at her home in June 2018 when the dog died. Instead of telling Mayo of the death, she hid his remains and reported Knox missing.</p>
      <p>Cranston police found the dog’s remains on Aug. 5 in a trash bag in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/amelia-ferreira/">Ferreira</a>’s closet.</p>
      <p>She was not charged with causing the dog’s death, which was undetermined.</p>

      <p>She called herself a “coward” for not being honest about the death.</p>
