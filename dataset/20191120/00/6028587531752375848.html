      <p>These days the cost of college and student debt dominates much of both the policy conversation and the headlines. New Mexico recently introduced a free college program and a number of <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/education-policy/reports/2020-education-tracker/free-college">presidential candidates</a> have proposed plans to address them ranging from free community college to tuition-free public four-year colleges. Senators Sanders and Warren both have added student debt forgiveness plans—though both differing widely. These plans would certainly address college costs and student debt. However, one presidential candidate has a proposal that isn’t getting much attention and that’s Senator Cory Booker’s “baby bonds.”Rising inequality is on the minds of many in the policy world. Part of the reason this inequality exists is due to the wealth gap in the United States. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf">According to the Federal Reserve</a>, “the top ten percent of U.S. households controlled 70 percent of total household wealth,” with the top one percent holding 32 percent. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent of households held just one percent. And the racial wealth gap is even worse. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/18/upshot/black-white-wealth-gap-perceptions.html">New York Times</a>, Black families have just $5 for every $100 in wealth White families have. To combat this wealth gap, Senator Booker introduced legislation to create “opportunity accounts”—or baby bonds—to give low-income kids a source of funds to use for education, housing, or retirement. </p>
      <p>The Senator would give every child born in the United States $1,000 at birth and each year they would receive up to an additional $2,000 based on their family size and income. Controlled by the Department of the Treasury, these low-risk accounts would yield an estimated three percent interest. Final amounts would certainly differ, but <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=861">Booker’s office estimates</a> an 18-year-old in a household of four making below the federal poverty line would have over $46,000. (Booker’s office says it will be paid for by restoring previous estate tax laws, a tax impacting those with more wealth.) Proponents of baby bonds believe they are a potential way to narrow wealth inequality in the country. One <a href="https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/news-internal/2019/1/18/cpsps-naomi-zewde-finds-that-baby-bonds-would-dramatically-reduce-racial-wealth-inequality">recent study</a> found Booker’s proposal would “considerably narrow wealth inequalities by race.” </p>
      <p>Both Sanders and Warren say their plans to cancel debt would narrow the racial wealth gap, and that’s certainly likely, but only for those students who enrolled and took on debt. One criticism of free college plans is that wealthy students are more likely to attend college in the first place. And even more likely to get a degree. Other criticize it because it would require a large increase in spending, even though only <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/education-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html">42 percent</a> of Americans have a college degree. So debt cancellation does little to help those who chose not to enroll and it’s likely cost was a reason many students chose not to do so. While everyone should have the opportunity to pursue education beyond high school, the fact is not everyone will go. With scarce resources, a baby bonds approach could benefit everyone now matter if they enroll in college or if they decide to purchase a home or invest in retirement, all while closing the racial wealth gap. </p>
      <p>Beyond that, making college tuition-free without addressing living expenses for low-income students—which make up more than half of the cost of college—can continue inequity by allowing wealthy families to just use their money to save for graduate degrees or to buy homes or build other forms of wealth. (Senator Warren’s plan rightfully invests in Pell Grants to do that. She would also likely argue her wealth tax is a progressive way to ensure equity. Sanders plan also says he would do the same.) Booker’s baby bonds would provide a much larger benefit to low-income families than wealthy families.</p>
      <p>Paired with a meaningful federal-state partnership—and continued investment in Pell Grants—baby bonds would be an effect way make college more affordable for students. It would also be a more universal benefit that would help all people, regardless if they chose to enroll in college. Giving students from low-income families over $40,000 would go a long way towards leveling the playing field when it comes to going to college or other ways of building wealth. A policy helping low-income people—especially people of color—build wealth would be a huge move and Booker’s proposal appears to be one of the biggest proposals to help people do that.</p>
