      <p>Police have registered two FIRs in connection with Monday’s protest by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University students over the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>In a case registered at Lodhi Colony police station on the basis of a complaint by police personnel, it has been alleged that some students first misbehaved with women personnel and later damaged the Gypsy of the area SHO. Another case has been registered at Kishangarh police station. No arrest has been made in connection with either.</p>
      <p>The complainant, sub-inspector Lala Ram, states: “Around 2,000 students were led by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, vice-president Saket Moon, general secretary Satish Yadav, secretary Md Danish, former JNUSU president Geeta Kumari and former vice-president Sarika Chaudhary. They wanted to conduct their protest march, but police tried to stop them (using) two layers of barricades. They came to Aurobindo Marg after getting into a scuffle with personnel and breaking barricades.”</p>
      <p>“Around 2 pm, 800 students came from the side of INA Metro station carrying big banners along with sticks… they tried to cross the security layer after climbing the barricades. We made an announcement from the public address system that <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-section-144-crpc-jammu-and-kashmir-5878543/">Section 144</a> of CrPC was imposed in the area and they cannot protest. But they… started abusing police staff. They also started pushing all personnel and several personnel got injured,” the complaint states, adding that some students allegedly misbehaved with women personnel.</p>
      <p>DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur confirmed that an FIR has been filed under various IPC sections.</p>
      <p>In the second FIR, the complainant states there was heavy deployment of police and paramilitary personnel outside the JNU main gate before the march began. “Protesters took out the march around noon, broke the first set of barricades at the main gate and proceeded towards Baba Gang Nath Marg, where another set of barricades awaited them. Police detained about 100 protesters, but students took different routes. They got into a scuffle with personnel, who sustained injuries,” the complaint states.</p>
