      <p>MADISON, Wis. - After a three-week stretch of unseasonably cold weather, milder air will finally return to southern Wisconsin starting Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Tonight will be cloudy and mild with temperatures generally staying at or above freezing. As snow continues to melt and winds remain light, areas of fog are expected that could reduce visibility at times.</p>
      <p>High temperatures are expected to reach the lower 40s on Wednesday, making it the first time in more than three weeks that high temperatures will be above average in Madison. Temperatures will climb to around 50 degrees Thursday morning ahead of a cold front that will bring more seasonable weather to southern Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Light rain is expected from Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Rainfall amounts of one-half to one inch are expected by Thursday afternoon. The rain and melting snow could lead to some localized flooding in a few spots, but widespread flooding is not expected. </p>
      <p>Quiet weather is expected from Friday of this week through Monday of next week, with near-normal temperatures during this stretch.</p>
      <p>A storm system may affect the Midwest from Tuesday of next week through Wednesday night, just before the Thanksgiving holiday. Rain is likely on Tuesday, but as colder air wraps around the storm on Wednesday morning, a changeover to snow is expected. Some accumulation is possible, with the best chances for accumulating snow over Iowa, Minnesota, and western Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>It's still too early to be looking at specific impacts or snowfall amounts from this storm, but since it will affect the Midwest during a busy travel period before the Thanksgiving holiday, those planning travel during that period should watch future forecasts as details on the storm become more refined in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The snow should end on Wednesday night. The Thanksgiving holiday should be dry and colder.</p>
