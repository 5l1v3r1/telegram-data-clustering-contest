        <b>Renault Formula 1 junior Christian Lundgaard will replace Ralph Boschung at Trident for the Formula 2 finale in Abu Dhabi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Danish driver Lundgaard finished runner-up in the Formula Renault Eurocup at his first attempt in 2018, and joined GP3 dominator ART this year as the series morphed into the new FIA Formula 3 Championship.</p>
      <p>But despite the new series retaining the same chassis as and a similar format to GP3, ART struggled in 2019.</p>
      <p>Lundgaard was its strongest driver, and though the 18-year-old lost victory in the first race of the season at Barcelona after a virtual safety car infringement, he went on to win at the Hungaroring and ended up sixth in the championship.</p>
      <p>"I'm proud and excited to make my Formula 2 debut," said Lundgaard.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank Renault Sport Academy, Trident and my partners for their faith in me.</p>
      <p>"Stepping into a championship at the last round is going to be a big challenge, but it will be great experience.</p>
      <p>"F2 is a big step up, the racing is always hard-fought and you need to think strategically on how to turn the races to your advantage - I'm looking forward to getting started and seeing what we can do."</p>
      <p>Boschung has been in and out of the Trident seat this year due to budget issues.</p>

      <p>Lundgaard will partner Giuliano Alesi, the Ferrari junior having contested all F2 rounds in his rookie season.</p>
      <p>Trident boss Giacomo Ricci, the 2006 Euro and Italian F3000 champion, added: "We are very happy to welcome a talented young driver like Christian Lundgaard, as he is proving to be one of the most interesting prospects in motorsport.</p>
      <p>"This year, as a rookie, Christian delivered a great season in the FIA Formula 3 Championship.</p>
      <p>"I was impressed by his skills every time I saw him on track.</p>
      <p>"For Team Trident, to have Christian on board represents an excellent opportunity to take home good results and contribute to his growth.</p>
      <p>"We will do our best to support him on his Formula 2 debut, on a track on which he has never raced on."</p>
      <p>Speaking to Autosport about his future during the Macau Grand Prix weekend, in which he finished fourth, Lundgaard said: "It depends, this weekend [at Macau] will probably decide what's going to happen next year.</p>
      <p>"The improvement and our hard work over the whole weekend, kinda shows what we can do."</p>
