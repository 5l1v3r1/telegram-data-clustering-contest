      <p>He further said, the team will continue to replicate these performances and hope they secure qualification to the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>“We have six points and no team in our group did that in this international week so that proves that we did something good.</p>
      <p>“This is just the beginning and we have six points now and we have to continue like this and I am happy and hope we continue like this”, he ended.</p>
