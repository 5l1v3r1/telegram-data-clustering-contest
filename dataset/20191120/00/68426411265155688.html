      <p><b>How the IMF can battle gradual irrelevance: </b>This year, I didn’t attend the October annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington, DC.

In particular, the prospect of continued weakness and fragmentation pressures will compound the challenges to the credibility and effectiveness of multilateral institutions. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-how-the-imf-can-battle-gradual-irrelevance/">Opinion</a> (Mohamed A.
