        <b>Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/chemicals/aartiindustries/AI45">Aarti Industries</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>We tweak our estimates to factor in lower revenue growth from 1) lower RM prices 2) demand weakness in auto and US agrochemicals business and 3) lower tax rate. AIL with a diversified product portfolio of 200 products remain well placed to capitalize on rising investment in domestic downstream industries along with global opportunities from US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We remain structurally positive on AIL's growth prospects despite near term weakness in growth. Reiterate BUY with a revised PT of Rs988 (Rs990 earlier).</p>
