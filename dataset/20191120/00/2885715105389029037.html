      <p>The Political Science department of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) has formed a committee to probe an issue of vandalism after a portrait of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was taken off the wall in a classroom, blackened with ink, and was found on the floor on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>A group of students staged protests after the vandalism was discovered. The protesters withdrew their sit-in following intervention of the Dean and Political Science Head of Department (HoD), who assured of action against the guilty.</p>
      <p>The framed photograph of Savarkar was put up in room number 103 of the department in Social Science faculty along with other great personalities.</p>
      <p>Political Science HoD Ashok Kumar Upadhyay said: “Around 11 am on Monday some students of MA 1st year Political Science found Veer Savarkar’s portrait removed from the wall; it was blackened with what looked like ink or paint and was lying on the floor. The students got agitated and sat on a protest outside the faculty building. I assured them that a new photograph will be put up. We have replaced the photo and the students are satisfied.”</p>
      <p>Faculty Dean Prof R P Pathak said a three-member committee of professors from different departments have been formed to conduct an inquiry and submit the report within 10 days. The committee comprises Binda Paranjape, J B Komaraiah and V K Pathak, he added.</p>
      <p>Calling it a “planned” act, Pathak said, “There are portraits of Ram Manohar Lohia, Acharya Narendra Dev, Acharya Chanakya, Sardar Patel and B R Amberdkar too on the same wall but they were untouched.”</p>
      <p>Pathak said, “Prima facie it appears to be handiwork of some students who do not like Savarkar’s ideology.”</p>
