      <p>A Manhattan judge Tuesday ordered a Columbia University graduate tossed behind bars for five years for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/son-cleared-of-trying-to-kill-dad-with-wrench-over-moms-fortune/">bludgeoning his father with a metal wrench</a> during a battle over his late mom’s $2 million estate.</p>
      <p>Justice Ruth Pickholz blasted spoiled rich kid Jason Heyworth, 37, for delivering “a horrible beating” upon his 71-year-old father Eric Heyworth as she handed down the sentence in Manhattan Supreme Court Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“He had hundreds of thousands of dollars, he had an excellent education, he had all the advantages that anyone could wish for,” the judge said of the 2017 attack. “He had everything and he himself threw it away.”</p>
      <p>Despite the judge’s choice words, she did not give Heyworth the maximum of seven years on the second-degree assault conviction.</p>
      <p>In August, a jury acquitted the amateur film producer on eight of the nine counts against him, including the top charge of first-degree attempted murder for which he faced up to life in prison.</p>
      <p>The elder Heyworth <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/24/da-shows-jury-gruesome-photos-of-brutally-beaten-dad-at-sons-trial/">suffered a traumatic brain injury</a> and was “a shell of what he once was,” the judge said, adding he can no longer live independently.</p>
      <p>Court officers cuffed Heyworth, who had been free on $150,000 bond, and took him into custody.</p>
      <p>Assistant DA Sarah Marquez asked for the max, while defense lawyer Todd Spodek argued for a probation-only sentence.</p>
      <p>Heyworth was facing eviction from his apartment in June 2017 and asked his father to let him move back in — but the dad said “no,” and the son attacked him.</p>
      <p>“He ambushed his father after hiding by the door,” Marquez told jurors in closings. “Once inside, he brutally beat his father for hours, hitting his father’s hands, forearms, face and head, watching as his father’s eyes and left ear swelled and blood poured from his mouth.”</p>
      <p>Covered in blood and vomit, the elder Heyworth crawled from room to room, leaving the floors and walls streaked with blood.</p>
      <p>A neighbor in the Harlem apartment building heard the elder Heyworth’s cries and called the cops. Spodek argued that the elder Heyworth was the aggressor and his son acted in self-defense.</p>
      <p>Spodek said the dad was upset that his late wife had left him a fraction of her fortune while giving each son $1 million. He sued his children to try to get a larger cut of the estate and lost.</p>
