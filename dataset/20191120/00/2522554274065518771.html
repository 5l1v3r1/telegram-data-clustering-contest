      <h1>Ar-Ab Convicted of Running Drug Trafficking Ring, Faces at Least 15 Years in Prison: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:20:46+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/trentfitzgerald/" target="_blank">Trent Fitzgerald</a></address>
      <p>Philadelphia rapper <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/ar-ab/">Ar-Ab</a> is facing some serious prison time after being convicted on federal charges.</p>
      <p>According to a report the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/ar-ab-convicted-obh-original-block-hustlaz-abdul-west-drug-prison-20191119.html"><i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i></a> published on Tuesday (Nov. 19), jurors found the rapper, born Abdul West, guilty of turning his Original Block Hustlaz (OBH) record label into a drug trafficking ring implicated in at least two murders. West’s codefendants Jamaal “Bionickhaz” Blanding, Jameel “Melanio” Hickson and Hans “No Brakes Bras” Gadsen were reportedly also found guilty. West and his codefendants maintained that OBH was not a drug-trafficking front but a legitimate record label throughout the trial.</p>
      <p>“Every one of them had their hustles,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Everett R. Witherell said of Ar-Ab and his co-defendants in his closing argument last week. “But it all ran through Mr. West.”</p>
      <p>Ar-Ab's three co-defendants were reportedly also found guilty of conspiracy and distribution of crack, cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Five others in the case pleaded guilty before the start of trial.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, Ar-Ab smiled and blew a kiss to a group of supporters and fans in the courtroom when U.S. Marshals handcuffed him and led him out of the building. Under federal drug laws, Ar-Ab now reportedly faces a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison.</p>
      <p>This news arrives after known Ar-Ab associate Dark Lo was arrested for witness tampering in relation to Ar-Ab's hearings on Nov. 7. Lo remains in federal custody.</p>
      <p>In October of 2018, Ar-Ab was <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/ar-ab-charged-drug-trafficking-philadelphia/">indicted for running a local drug gang</a>. He was charged with selling cocaine (five kilograms), crack cocaine (280 grams or more), methamphetamine (50 grams or more) and heroin (over 100 grams), according to a statement from the United States Attorney's Office. Ar-Ab was also hit with individual charges including possession with intent to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, crack, and heroin, distribution of methamphetamine and unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
      <p>Ar-Ab first made waves in the rap game as a former artist under Philly rapper Cassidy. He later made news for his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/08/ar-ab-affiliate-dark-lo-calls-meek-mill/">rap beef with Meek Mill</a>, which was <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/01/ar-abs-beef-with-meek-mill-is-over/">later squashed</a>. In 2016, Ar-Ab <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/ar-ab-interview-cash-money/">secured a deal with Cash Money Records</a>.</p>

      <h3>Wild Style (1982)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Charlie Ahearn</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Hip-hop makes its big-screen debut, shining the spotlight on early rap immortals, influential b-boys and b-girls and celebrated graffiti pioneers.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> While Ahearn gets much-deserved credit for introducing the burgeoning Bronx-born underground culture of hip-hop to a public that could not yet see beyond The Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper’s Delight,” props should also be given to Fab Five Freddy. It was the respected street artist, tastemaker, future <i>Yo! MTV Raps</i> host and video director who co-piloted the film and helped secure the authentic talent that propelled <i>Wild Style</i> to landmark heights. When the film made its debut at Manhattan’s Embassy Theater (on 47th Street near Times Square), it became the second-highest grossing movie in New York City, right behind Terms of Endearment.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The basketball court rhyme battle sequence between Grandmaster Caz, the Cold Crush Brothers and the Fantastic Freaks.</p>

      <h3>Style Wars (1983)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Tony Silver</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> New York’s at-times maligned graffiti movement (led by the legendary likes of Kase2, Skeme, Cap, Dondi, Seen and Shy 147) finally gets the historical reverence it deserves.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> When Silver shot the first sequence of his PBS special in the spring of 1981—a breakdance battle between Rock Steady and the Dynamic Rockers—graffiti art was categorized as a quality-of-life issue, as the city spent $22.4 million on dangerous barbed wire double fences in 18 Transit Authority subway yards. But by 1983, New York Mayor Ed Koch (who was also interviewed for the documentary, dismissing graffiti as a gateway crime on the level of shoplifting) declared an all-out war on street art. There are scenes of vicious guard dogs patrolling the subway train yards as imprisonment became a serious risk for taggers. This context makes the passion, ingenuity and defiance displayed by these brilliant Black, Latino and White artists even more impressive.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Witnessing late one-armed graffiti god Kase2 work his magic.</p>

      <h3>Big Fun In The Big Town (1986)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Bram van Splunteren</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> An illuminating look at New York’s hip-hop scene on the eve of its national commercial explosion. Dutch filmmakers offer viewers a raw insider’s glimpse of an artform set to dominate youth culture for decades to come.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> <i>Big Fun in the Big Town</i> was filmed just months before the release of Run-DMC’s timeless 1986 work, <i>Raising Hell </i>(the flashing neon light presence of Run, D and the late, great Jam Master Jay anchors Splunteren’s underrated gem). The Queens trio’s third release would go on to sell more than 3 million copies, fueled by the behemoth Aerosmith-assisted crossover single, “Walk This Way.”</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Grandmaster Flash flexing his turntable skills; a 16-year-old LL Cool J, still living with his grandmother while filming, detailing his writing process; and most surreal, Philadelphia’s Schoolly D, the unsung godfather of East Coast gangsta rap, offering a prophetic view on his fear of hip-hop becoming as mainstream as rock ’n’ roll.</p>

      <h3>Public Enemy: It Takes A Nation-The First London Invasion Tour 1987 (1987)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Dominic Savage</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Public Enemy, the revolutionary prophets of rage, conquer the U.K. for what is now widely celebrated as hip-hop’s most important international live trek.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> When the booming voice of power, Chuck D, clown prince Flavor Flav, the mysterious DJ Terminator X, the intimidating Professor Griff and the S1W’s jumped across the pond for their first European concert tour in 1987, the conservatism was at the peak of its powers. Racial animus and a class war were used as ruthless weapons by both the governments of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. It’s no wonder the rabid fans that packed venues like the Hammersmith Odeon, who witnessed the fiery, politically-minded P.E., were ready for revolution.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Watching one of music’s most championed groups tear into “Rebel Without A Pause.” If you listen closely, you will hear actual London concert snippets included in P.E.’s monumental 1988 sophomore statement, <i>It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold Us Back</i>.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>The Show (1995)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Brian Robbins</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> A dream roster of hip-hop heroes, hellraisers, moguls and visionaries from both coasts flexing a seemingly endless barrage of star power, on and offstage.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Beneath the bravado of headliners like Snoop Dogg, The Notorious B.I.G. and Naughty By Nature, there’s a redemptive story of ’hood underdogs making something immensely powerful out of nothing. The elegantly shot black-and-white concert performances jump off the screen with infectious and, at times, sneering energy.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Def Jam Recordings honcho Russell Simmons visiting contrite and philosophical rap storyteller Slick Rick, who was serving five years at Rikers Island—two years for attempted murder and three years for immigration-related issues.</p>

      <h3>Rhyme &amp; Reason (1997)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Peter Spirer</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> A dizzying 90-plus-minute history lesson on America’s last original artform.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> <i>Rhyme &amp; Reason</i>’s biggest strength is in its sheer diversity. Respected old heads (Kurtis Blow) and golden age greats (KRS-One) get equal billing with unsung wordsmiths (Redman) and multi-platinum hit makers (Dr. Dre).</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Fresh-faced and fearless Lauryn Hill taking on misogyny in hip-hop.</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2019/05/Freestyle-The-Art-of-Rhyme-documentary.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Freestyle: The Art Of Rhyme (2000)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Kevin Fitzgerald</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Perhaps the deepest detailing of hip-hop’s improvisational roots in Black church oratory, the free-flowing genius instrumentation of jazz and the boundless socially conscious work of such spoken word rebels as The Last Poets.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> In today’s rap universe, freestyle equals prewritten rhymes. Fitzgerald skillfully captures a time when rap’s best lyricists like The Roots’ Black Thought, Mos Def and Freestyle Fellowship, as well as underground rhyme battle greats Supernatural, Craig G and Juice, reveled in coming off the dome.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> While you may be tempted to pick a vintage video of a 17-year-old Christopher Wallace lyrically decimating a would-be adversary on a Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn street corner circa early 1990s, the memorable freestyle showdown between Juice and Supernatural is an equally exhilarating highlight.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Backstage (2000)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Chris Fiore</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> On paper, <i>Backstage</i> comes off as a promotional kit for Def Jam Recordings’ big dogs DMX, Method Man &amp; Redman and headliner Jay-Z. The uncensored access inside 1999’s historic Hard Knock Life Tour makes a strong case for hip-hop as a riveting live medium.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> It was the best of times for Hov and his Roc-A-Fella Records crew. Co-founder Damon Dash was pushing buttons in his own cantankerous way. Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek were young hungry lions. An effortless Shawn Carter, backed by some of hip-hop’s most exciting performers, was there to lead what would become, at the time, the highest-grossing rap tour, pulling in $18 million. <i>Backstage</i> gives an all-access pass of the legendary run, both onstage and behind the scenes.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Jay and X going in on a once-in-a-lifetime cypher. And a wise-cracking Dame Dash going in on DJ Clue’s haircut.</p>

      <h3>Scratch (2001)</h3>
      <p><b>Directors:</b> Doug Pray</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Let the DJ get some. This doc covers the complete evolution of turntablism.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> During hip-hop’s early days, disc jockeys like Grandmaster Flash were the star attraction while the MC was merely there for support. Which is why the most intriguing aspect of Scratch is watching a generation of music obsessives inspired by Grand Mixer DXT—whose groundbreaking work on Herbie Hancock’s 1983 electro hip-hop classic “Rockit” became the bridge to modern turntable innovation—reclaiming the power of the ones and twos. Legendary DJ collectives Invisibl Skratch Piklz and the X-Ecutioners stand out amongst the rest.</p>

      <h3>Welcome To Death Row (2001)</h3>
      <p><b>Directors:</b> S. Leigh Savidge, Jeff Scheftel</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The meteoric, bloody rise and epic fall of mogul Suge Knight and Death Row Records.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> It’s almost inconceivable that the same sickly, fragile man who is currently serving a 28-year sentence for manslaughter at a California state prison was once the most feared figure in the music industry. But, while there are plenty of staff and artists interviews dishing on Knight ruling over the West Coast label through menacing intimidation, beatdowns and wild gunplay, <i>Welcome To Death Row</i> also focuses on the imprint’s immense talent. Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur, Tha Dogg Pound, Nate Dogg and more made the imprint seemingly unstoppable during its 1990s heyday.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The moment Dre leaves Death Row.</p>

      <h3>Biggie &amp; Tupac (2002)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Nick Bloomfield</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The murders of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, which are still unsolved.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Late ex-Los Angeles detective Russell Poole first dropped his controversial conspiratorial bombshell that Death Row label head Suge Knight was behind the shooting deaths of both Biggie and ’Pac in Bloomfield’s provocative full-length feature. Since then, there has been no shortage of whodunit specials, scripted true crime dramas and biopics featuring the larger-than-life hip-hop martyrs.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> B.I.G.’s mother Voletta Wallace humanizes her bruising son.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Beef (2003)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Peter Spirer</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Some of hip-hop’s most storied (and infamous) diss wars, and a reminder that rap’s competitive foundation of the battle did not always stay on wax.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Yes, the specter of the deadly war of words between Biggie and Tupac loom large over <i>Beef</i>. Yet, you can’t dismiss the pure excitement of reliving such monumental battles as KRS-One/Boogie Down Productions vs. MC Shan/The Juice Crew, LL Cool J vs. everybody, Ice Cube vs. N.W.A, Common vs. Ice Cube, 50 Cent vs. Ja Rule, and Jay-Z vs. Nas.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The iconic Harlem World showdown between Busy Bee and an on-fire Kool Moe Dee deserves a big shoutout. But, 50’s and Ja Rule’s violent and volatile square-off is the most infamous reminder of how beef can go off the rails.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Tupac: Resurrection (2003)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Lauren Lazin</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The triumphant, fast and volatile life of the brilliant Tupac Shakur, as told by the man himself from beyond the grave.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> There’s a reason why this deeply complex journey of the life and death of hip-hop’s ultimate idol ranks as the highest grossing hip-hop documentary of all time, pulling in nearly $7.7 million. <i>Resurrection</i> feels like a memoir come to life, as Lazin smartly avoids sanitizing some of the more problematic aspects of Tupac’s furious run, in which he played the role of clear-eyed poet, transfixing thespian and reckless gangsta rap provocateur before his Sept. 13, 1996 murder.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> When an articulate, passionate Tupac breaks down his popular and politicalized definition of Thug Life.</p>

      <h3>And You Don’t Stop: 30 Years Of Hip-Hop (2004)</h3>
      <p><b>Directors:</b> Richard Lowe, Dana Heinz Perry</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Easily the most exhaustive documentation of the history of hip-hop. From its humble 1970s beginnings at the South Bronx park jams, Run-DMC taking the artform to new commercial heights, to rap’s explosive expansion in the West Coast, the Dirty South and all in between.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> <i>And You Don’t Stop</i> was so voluminous that it was broken down into five episodes for its original VH1 airing. In fact, there are so many “firsts” in this ambitious miniseries, including the time Grandmaster Theodore accidently discovered scratching, Ice-T giving birth to gangsta rap with his monumental 1986 single “6 in the Mornin’” and the late 1980s emergence of Southern hip-hop’s first icons, the Geto Boys. The female empowerment rhymes of Lil’ Kim, Foxy Brown, Eve and Missy Elliott are front and center, too.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince teaming up with Public Enemy, Salt-N-Pepa and others to boycott the 1989 Grammys ceremony, which refused to televise presentation of the Best Rap Performance award.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Fade To Black (2004)</h3>
      <p><b>Directors:</b> Patrick Paulson, Michael John Warren</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Jay-Z’s pseudo swan song is part concert film, part career retrospective and part making of the Brooklyn superstar’s much-trumpeted <i>The Black Album</i>.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Is <i>Fade to Black</i> a shrewd marketing ploy or an audacious portrait of an ambitious, guarded artist who plays by his own rules? It’s both. While Hov’s claims of retirement would turn out to be a brazen false alarm, it’s still cool to see the lyrical giant’s on-the-fly recording process with such topflight producers as Rick Rubin, Timbaland, Pharrell Williams and Kanye West. What’s even better? Seeing Jay backed up by a Questlove-led band during a star-studded Madison Square Garden benefit, complete with show-stealing appearances by a fur-draped Foxy Brown and a regal bathrobe-clad Ghostface Killah rocking Slick Rick’s chain.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The first time Kanye plays the heart-snatching “Lucifer” for Hov.</p>

      <h3>Dave Chappelle’s Block Party (2005)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Michael Gondry</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Filmed in 2004, when the irreverent funnyman was at the zenith of his pop culture notoriety and influence, <i>Dave Chappelle’s Block Party</i> is a heartwarming celebration of Blackness in all its forms, including a HBCU marching band from Central State University.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Only Chappelle would think to put on the dopest throwdown on the corner of a Clinton Hill, Brooklyn neighborhood and invite his famous friends from both the worlds of organic and Afrocentric hip-hop (Mos Def, The Roots, Kanye West, Talib Kweli, Common, Dead Prez) and neo soul (Jill Scott, Erykah Badu and Bilal). Then there’s a totally unbowed Lauryn Hill, who after being told that her record label had refused to allow her songs for use in the film, joined backup with her old Fugees cohorts instead.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The shocking, joyful and magical reunion of the Fugees, as a pre-fame J. Cole stands amongst an astonished crowd, soaking it all in.</p>

      <h3>Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats &amp; Rhymes (2006)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Bryon Hurt</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> If you are looking for the standard music doc, this ain’t it. But, if you crave a sobering examination on the hold toxic masculinity has had on rap music and the culture, then you won’t be disappointed.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Hurt forces viewers to reconcile with some of the disturbing, pervasive third rails of hip-hop: homophobia, sexism and violence. Chuck D, Jadakiss, Doug E. Fresh, Mos Def as well as such academic scholars Dr. James Peterson of Pennsylvania State University, Spelman College’s Professor Jelani Cobb and playwright and poet Sarah Jones answer the tough questions.</p>

      <h3>Ghostride The Whip: The Hyphy Movement (2008)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> DJ Vlad</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> A deep dive into the Bay Area’s ghost riding phenomenon and street culture first nationally exposed by the video for E-40’s 2006 throwdown, “Tell Me When To Go.”</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> What’s so hip-hop about hood daredevils jumping out of moving cars as they dangerously dance alongside vehicles? It’s the music—more specifically, the Bay Area-based hyphy movement, a sound first mastered by late West Coast rap innovator Mac Dre. Bay luminaries such as Too $hort, Sway, MC Hammer and Mistah F.A.B. join in to drop some game.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Plenty of don’t-try-this-at-home ghost riding.</p>

      <p><b>Director:</b> Adam Bhala Lough</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Lil Wayne in all his mammoth, blissed-out, Carter III, rap mega star shine.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> After viewing a screening of his authorized cinéma vérité-style documentary at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, Weezy was none too happy with the final cut, launching a $50 million lawsuit against the producers of the film. According to insiders, the Cash Money general was mortified by the all-access tone of <i>The Carter</i>, which, among other things, showed the multiplatinum artist sipping on copious amounts of lean, back then his alleged addictive codeine-laced drink of choice. But Wayne also opened himself up to be the ultimate studio rat: A manic obsessive dedicated to his craft. Critics hailed the warts-and-all portrait as one of the most revealing hip-hop films of any era.</p>

      <h3>My Mic Sounds Nice: A Truth About Women And Hip-Hop (2010)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Ava DuVernay</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> It’s ladies first. The rich, historical contributions of women in hip-hop and the over-sexualization of the female MC finally gets the deep discussion it deserves in this one-hour BET special.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> In the hands of fearless future Oscar-nominated director DuVernay, the deep pool of dynamic rappers like Roxanne Shante, Salt-N-Pepa, MC Lyte, YoYo, Lady of Rage, Jean Grae, Trina, Digable Planets’ Ladybug Mecca, Crime Mob’s Princess and Missy Elliott talk about what it really means to be a female spitter—the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The notable absence of Lauryn Hill in the commercial marketplace and the emergence of Nicki Minaj as rap’s lone prominent female voice during the filming of <i>My Mic Sounds Nice</i> leads to a straight-no-chaser debate on the lack of women lyricists on the scene.</p>

      <h3>Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life: The Travels Of A Tribe Called Quest (2011)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Michael Rapaport</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The beautiful highs, gut-punching lows and complicated reunion of one of the most seminal hip-hop groups of the 1990s.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Trolling social media persona aside, veteran actor and Knicks stan Michael Rapaport manages to flip the usual rock documentary trope of a band going through a painful breakup into a story about brotherhood, stardom, toxic implosion and reconciliation with life-or-death consequences. The intense love, alienation and anger that A Tribe Called Quest’s Q-Tip, Jarobi, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and the late Phife Dawg (whose dire battles with diabetes are prominently chronicled here) unfurl throughout <i>Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life</i>, making the Beatles <i>Let It Be</i>-era squabbles look quaint. And yet, Tribe’s magic is still evident during their storied 2008 reunion show for Rock The Bells.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The moment Tip and Phife nearly come to blows.</p>

      <h3>Something From Nothing: The Art Of Rap (2012)</h3>
      <p><b>Directors:</b> Ice-T, Andy Baybutt</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Ice-T pulls out his impressive Rolodex to bring together a jaw-dropping lineup of MCs to break down the meticulous craft of rhyme writing.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> The collection of interviews alone could fill up a hip-hop lyricist hall of fame: Chuck D, Bun B, Big Daddy Kane, Eminem, Grandmaster Caz, Salt, MC Lyte, Melle Mel, Nas, Ice Cube, Rakim, Raekwon and Snoop Dogg, just for starters. It helps that Ice-T himself has penned some of gangsta rap’s most insightful lyrics, which gives the MC-turned-television star the tools to get into some serious inside baseball conversations on a topic rarely discussed out in the open.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Eminem losing his proverbial shit as he recites Treach’s tongue-twisting lyrics to Naughty By Nature’s 1991 track, “Yoke the Joker.”</p>

      <h3>Uprising: Hip-Hop &amp; The L.A. Riots (2012)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Mark Ford</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Snoop Dogg narrates this unapologetic look back at the Los Angeles rebellion following the shocking 1992 Rodney King beating verdict.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> By using rap as a warning shot and soundtrack for what would become one of America’s most visceral and destructive riots, Ford distinguishes his work from other standout documentaries on this searing, violent event that forced America to come to terms with its painful history of racial injustice and police brutality. Hearing the music of N.W.A (“Fuck Tha Police”), Ice Cube (“We Had To Tear This Mothafucka Up”), Ice-T &amp; Bodycount (“Cop Killer”) and Tupac Shakur (“If My Homie Calls”) amplifies the hair-raising memories of King, who passed away in 2012, and the men and women who experienced the horrific and chaotic uprising.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Snoop and Kurupt recounting the making of Dr. Dre’s “The Day The Niggaz Took Over” as the riots were taking place.</p>

      <h3>Nas: Time Is Illmatic (2014)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> One9</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The making of Nas’ <i>Illmatic</i>, one of hip-hop’s ultimate masterpieces.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Before the revered rhyme giant ever set foot in a studio to record his monumental 1994 debut, 17-year-old Nas was already on his way to legend status thanks to his song-stealing appearance on Main Source’s throat-grabbing 1991 posse cut, “Live at the Barbeque.” That’s just one of the nuggets One9 and his partner, writer and producer Erik Parker unearth in this unsentimental capturing of a record that was as influenced by Nas’ volatile Queensbridge Projects as it was by his father and blues musician, Olu Dara, and loving mother, Ann Jones.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> Nas’ protective younger brother Jungle details a 1992 shooting that nearly killed him and took the life of Nas’ best friend, Willie “Ill Will” Graham, a scarring event that still looms over the tight siblings.</p>

      <h3>Fresh Dressed (2015)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Sacha Jenkins</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Hip-hop fashion in all of its trend-setting, street-paced, flamboyant, you-will-respect-me majesty.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> It’s not just Kangol hats, leather outfits, Adidas suits, unlaced shell toes, Dapper Dan, Tommy Hilfiger shirts, Cross Colours and Karl Kani baggy jeans. Along with a nostalgic look back at some of the fashion statements that symbolized the fake-it-’til-you-make-it spirit of hip-hop for many Black and Brown kids, there are some powerful connections made. Among them, the impact clothes had on African-American culture going as far back to the slave days, as well as the flamboyant spirit of 1950s rock ’n’ roll as exemplified by the architect himself, Little Richard.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> When the likes of Kid ’n Play and Big Daddy Kane share war stories on avoiding getting robbed for their clothes and prized sneakers.</p>

      <h3>Stretch And Bobbito: Radio That Changed Lives (2015)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Bobbito Garcia</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> How New York’s WKCR, a small, underground college radio station at Columbia University, became the epicenter for a remarkable East Coast hip-hop scene.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> When DJ Stretch Armstrong and partner/host Garcia weren’t bickering or snapping jokes on one another and their Motley crew of hip-hop fanatics, they were breaking some of rap’s most storied names of the late 1980s and 1990s like Nas, Busta Rhymes, Big Pun, the Wu-Tang Clan and DMX.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> A tie between Jigga marveling over his legendary mid-1990s radio cypher with Big L and the unearthing of a rare Biggie freestyle.</p>

      <h3>The Art Of Organized Noize (2016)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Quincy Jones III</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Production trio Rico Wade, Ray Murray and Sleepy Brown remake Atlanta’s hip-hop and R&amp;B scene dominated by Jermaine Dupri’s So So Def Recordings, L.A. Reid and Babyface in their own smoked-out image, launching the blazing careers of Goodie Mob, Cool Breeze, Witchdoctor and the mighty, game-changing OutKast, who have a legit case as the greatest hip-hop group of all time.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> If it weren’t for T-Boz, there would most likely be no Organized Noize. And there certainly wouldn’t have been a Dungeon Family, the combustible collective of adventurous rappers, poets and beat majors. It was the sultry-voiced lead singer of TLC who introduced Brown and Wade. The rest is Dirty South history.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> When Organized Noize let their own addictive demons get in the way of $17 million deal with Jimmy Iovine’s Interscope Records.</p>

      <h3>The Defiant Ones (2017)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Alan Hughes</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> Music’s most unlikely partnership—gangsta rap’s greatest conductor-turned mogul Dr. Dre and Interscope Records co-founder and made rock man Jimmy Iovine—is examined in a four-part HBO mini-series.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> Long before the co-founders of Beats Electronics’ historic $3 billion Apple deal, Dre and Jimmy were just trying to fight their way through the music industry on totally opposite paths, where they both experienced success, failure, tragedy and comebacks. Ice Cube, Kendrick Lamar, Nas, Snoop Dogg, Eminem and others make appearances.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The creation of Beats Electronic leading to a table-flipping mega deal for the ages.</p>

      <h3>Remastered: Who Killed Jam Master Jay (2018)</h3>
      <p><b>Director:</b> Brian Oakes</p>
      <p><b>Focus:</b> The tragic, still unsolved, 2002 murder of Run-DMC’s Jam Master Jay.</p>
      <p><b>You Must Learn:</b> The shooting death of Jason Mizell may be rap’s saddest loss because it was so heartbreakingly sudden. A detailed narration by veteran hip-hop journalist Rahman Dukes (the presence of the documentarian and fellow Hollis, N.Y. native, who helped bring the confounding mystery to Netflix as part of their excellent <i>Remastered</i> series, is indispensable) and the careful eye of Oakes reveals that there were six witnesses in JMJ’s Queens studio at the time of his killing. Randy Allen, Jay’s longtime friend and business partner, and Big D, who worked with Run-DMC during their early run, are still part of the puzzle. Mizell owed back taxes and struggled financially in later years due to his generosity to friends and family. The names of several alleged suspects floated out on the streets, like imprisoned Southside Queens drug trafficker Kenneth “Supreme” McGriff, with murmurs of a drug deal gone wrong. We learn about the NYPD’s indifference to the case and that Jam Master Jay deserved better.</p>
      <p><b>Money Shot:</b> The emergence of Ronald “Tinard” Washington, a childhood friend of JMJ, as an alleged prime suspect.</p>
