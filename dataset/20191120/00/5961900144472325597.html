      <h1>‘Sword &amp; Shield’ Bleached A Coral Pokémon To Death Cos Climate Change Is Coming For Us All</h1>

      <p>The climate crisis is coming for us all, and that includes Pokémon.</p>
      <p>Anyone playing Pokemon Sword and Shield, which was released last Friday, might have noticed a few climate-related angles to the game. (No spoilers – I’m only three hours in.)</p>
      <p>The most obvious – and least spoiler-y – example of this is Corsola, a coral Pokémon which has been literally bleached to death.</p>
      <p>The former Corsola, introduced in the Pokémon Gold and Silver games, was a delightful, cheerful, pink Water and Rock-type Pokémon.</p>

      <p>In the new games, it’s a bleached, sad, cursed looking thing, which the game says was wiped out by “sudden climate change”.</p>

      <p>It’s estimated that up to 70% of the world’s coral reefs have been damaged due to climate change, including about two-thirds of the Great Barrier Reef during back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Prof. <b>Terry Hughes</b>, Director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies who completed aerial surveys of the reef, said the “most pressing” issue for the reef was – you guessed it – global warming.</p>

      <p>“Clearly the reef is struggling with multiple impacts,” Hughes said in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Without a doubt the most pressing of these is global warming. As temperatures continue to rise the corals will experience more and more of these events: 1°C of warming so far has already caused four events in the past 19 years.</p>
      <p>“Ultimately, we need to cut carbon emissions, and the window to do so is rapidly closing.”</p>
      <p>Cool!</p>
