      <p><b>Topline:</b> President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani deleted and then reposted a tweet Wednesday claiming he never met and rarely talked with EU ambassador Gordon Sondland⁠—despite <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-envoy-who-denied-quid-pro-quo-now-says-he-isnt-certain/2019/10/12/4abe0902-bc19-44e8-8c38-9aa35c544859_story.html">previously saying</a> he spoke with Sondland about six times over the summer about Ukraine. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“I came into this at Volker’s request. Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact. I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker. Volker testified I answered their questions and described them as my opinions, NOT demands. I.E., no quid pro quo!” Giuliani tweeted.</li>
        <li>The tweet was deleted and then reposted approximately about an hour later, but multiple outlets <a href="https://twitter.com/derekwillis/status/1197212827821494272">preserved</a> it; Giuliani’s Twitter account gave no explanation of the post’s disappearance and reappearance. </li>
        <li>Giuliani’s tweet was in response to Sondland’s public testimony Wednesday in Trump’s impeachment inquiry.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/11/20/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-says-pence-and-pompeo-knew-about-ukraine-pressure-campaign/#6063517f22b3">Sondland said</a> that, despite having no desire to do so, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Ambassador Kurt Volker and himself were instructed to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, to cement the U.S./Ukraine relationship.</li>
        <li>If they didn’t work with Giuliani, it would mean they would lose the chance to improve relations between the two countries, “so we followed the president’s orders,” said Sondland.</li>
        <li>Although Giuliani denied meeting with and talking to Sondland, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-envoy-who-denied-quid-pro-quo-now-says-he-isnt-certain/2019/10/12/4abe0902-bc19-44e8-8c38-9aa35c544859_story.html">he told</a> the<i> Washington Post </i>in October that they had at least six phone calls on Ukraine over the summer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/10/01/heres-how-giuliani-is-linked-to-the-ukraine-scandal/#6c67e65d6bdd">Giuliani</a> is under investigation by New York federal prosecutors for his ties to two Ukrainian businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/us/politics/rudy-giuliani-investigation.html"><i>New York Times</i></a>, federal prosecutors are looking into whether Giuliani broke federal lobbying laws. Parnas and Fruman were <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/10/10/two-giuliani-business-associates-arrested-on-campaign-finance-charges/">indicted separately</a> in October on federal campaign finance charges. Before he was appointed as an ambassador, Sondland was a GOP donor and the CEO of Provenance Hotels, a hospitality company based in Portland, Oregon. He also <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/04/250-donors-shelled-out-100k-or-more-for-trumps-inauguration/">donated</a> $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee before his appointment.</p>
      <p><b>News peg: </b>House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions in response to a July phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. On the call, Trump directed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption. Trump and Rudy Giuliani claim that during the Obama presidency then-vice president Biden pushed for the resignation of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in an effort to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a board seat.</p>
