      <h1>Michael Bisping: ‘Charismatic’ Tyson Fury can sing and knock people out, would be big business for UFC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:02:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Guillen Jr.</a></address>
      <p>While Tyson Fury has set the combat world buzzing by expressing his <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/15/20967303/tyson-fury-details-plans-to-train-conor-mcgregor-for-mma-crossover-till-mma-wilder-ufc-boxing-espn">interest in jumping over to mixed martial arts (MMA)</a>, that likely won’t happen for a while, as he is still <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/2/18/18230011/tyson-fury-signs-multi-fight-deal-espn-100-million-boxing-news">under a boxing contract with ESPN.</a></p>
      <p>But that hasn’t stopped the boxing champion from starting his MMA training early, nor has it halted UFC big men from <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/11/20959721/ufc-stipe-miocic-intrigued-fighting-tyson-fury-daniel-cormier-championship-trilogy-mma">calling out the pugilist</a>. While Dana White doesn’t see Tyson having much success inside the Octagon, he <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/6/20950270/midnight-mania-dana-white-boxing-tyson-fury-claressa-shields-ufc">hasn’t quite ruled out the move.</a></p>
      <p>According to former UFC Middleweight champion, Michael Bisping, UFC passing on Fury would be a mistake since the big man is a triple threat and would be big business for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>“If Tyson Fury was to come over, I’m not gonna say the word ‘groom,’ but they would stagger his matchups and give him logical matchups,” Bisping said on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f9d6SjSZyw">Believe You Me podcast</a> (transcript by <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/michael-bisping-thinks-tyson-fury-would-be-formidable-in-ufc/">BJPenn.com</a>).</p>
      <p>For Bisping’s money, if UFC is looking for entertainers, “The Gypsy King” is the perfect man for the job, as he can talk shit, knock you out and sing a song post-fight.</p>
      <p>“Listen, look at the UFC. People call it the entertainment era and Fury ties into that perfectly. The guy can talk, he can talk sh-t for days. He’s very, very funny. He can put people down, he sings on the microphone,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Not only is he the heavyweight champion of the world but he’s massively charismatic. He’s an absolute huge star and if he can come over win a couple of fights and then get a title fight, for the UFC that’s big business. That’d be a massive, massive pay-per-view.”</p>
      <p>Of course, “The Count” also feels should UFC take a chance on him, throwing him to the fire right off the bat won’t be wise, much like the promotion did with <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2010/8/28/1656280/did-james-toney-beat-randy-couture">James Toney by giving him Randy Couture.</a></p>
      <p>As Bisping puts it, with Daniel Cormier <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/9/23/20880526/daniel-cormier-closes-door-on-jon-jones-trilogy-will-retire-following-stipe-miocic-rubber-match-ufc">set to retire in 2020</a>, the promotion is going to need some polarizing figures to help fill the void. For now, Tyson still has plenty of work to do in the boxing arena, including a big-money rematch against Deontay Wilder sometime in 2020.</p>
