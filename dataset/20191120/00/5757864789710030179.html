      <p>On November 26, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60540/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-galaxy-quest"><i>Galaxy Quest</i></a>—the beloved sci-fi satire that ended up being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/diehard-star-trek-fans-rank-the-best-and-worst-movies">voted</a> the seventh greatest <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/star-trek"><i>Star Trek</i></a> film ever made—will celebrate its 20th anniversary with <i>Never Surrender</i>, a brand-new documentary about the making of the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/movies">movie</a>.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, E! News celebrated the movie’s 15th anniversary with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjT0KWn6T7I&amp;feature=emb_logo">mockumentary</a> starring the actors from the show-within-the-show, but don’t worry—this documentary is totally real. <i>Never Surrender: A Galaxy Quest Documentary</i> will include behind-the-scenes interviews and footage featuring the film's stars, including Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, and Rainn Wilson. The documentary examines how fandom shaped the creation of <i>Galaxy Quest</i> and also ensured the film’s enduring legacy.</p>

      <p>“Fandom is powered by fans who deeply care about the movies, shows, and games they love,” Michael Chiang, the senior vice president of programming for Fandom (which produced the documentary with Screen Junkies), said in a press release. "<i>Galaxy Quest</i> was the first film that put fans at the center of the action and really foretold the era we’re in now, where fans are the most powerful force in entertainment.”</p>
      <p>The documentary will be shown for one night only in about 600 movie theaters across the United States, courtesy of Fathom Events. The full list of theaters is available on the Fathom Events <a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/events/never-surrender?date=2019-11-26">website</a>.
