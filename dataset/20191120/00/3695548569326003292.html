        <b>Sebastien Ogier has spoken exclusively to Autosport to explain his decision to leave Citroen's World Rally Championship team with a year to run on his contract.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Citroen's cited Ogier's departure for Toyota - a deal expected to be announced next week - as the reason for its <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/news/147264/citroen-quits-wrc-and-blames-ogier-exit">withdrawal from the WRC</a> in an announcement made on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The six-time champion admitted he was surprised at the wording of Citroen's communication, but refused to comment on speculation that he first read the press release on the internet.</p>
      <p>Ogier told Autosport: "Maybe communication hasn't always been the strongest point for Citroen..."</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Citroen's exit - read for free</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.autosport.com/wrc/feature/9694/everyone-loses-if-citroen-wrc-pullout-goes-ahead">A sad end for a great team - and a huge blow to the WRC</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>He was also concerned about the message Citroen had sent to other competitors in the WRC, adding: "When they say there is no other drivers available, in this moment, I feel this is disrespectful for my colleagues in the sport."</p>
      <p>Talking specifically about why he was leaving his second stint with Citroen early, Ogier said: "One of the main things which drove this decision was the rhythm of development on the car and the speed the car was progressing, which was not enough.</p>
      <p>"Already this year, we could agree there wasn't enough development coming and we were down in performance against our competitors and it's not just me saying that - it's anybody who drove this car, I think, is feeling the same way."</p>

      <p>Despite his departure and the nature of Citroen's announcement, Ogier said he had no regrets about returning to the team where he started his professional career.</p>
      <p>"I was aware since I joined the team about the difficulty of this challenge and I was never afraid of this," he said.</p>
      <p>"That's why, even today, I have absolutely no regrets to try this challenge, even if it failed."</p>
      <p>As previously outlined on Autosport, Ogier will be revealed as a Toyota WRC driver alongside Elfyn Evans and Kalle Rovanpera on Monday.</p>
      <p>Ogier declined to comment on his plans for 2020.</p>
