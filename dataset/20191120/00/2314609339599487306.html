      <h1>Woodman was 'someone I believed would come and buy tickets': Pakula</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:23:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author">Sumeyya Ilanbey</a></address>
      <p>Senior Victorian minister Martin Pakula says the property developer at the centre of the Casey land scandal was invited to his campaign fundraiser last year because he was "someone who I believed would come and buy tickets".</p>
      <p>John Woodman, the developer and key witness in public hearings about alleged corruption at the City of Casey, contributed $3300 to Mr Pakula’s fundraiser in 2018 and had attended two other fundraisers in the past seven years.</p>

      <p>Mr Pakula has denied claims made in Independent and Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission hearings this week that he received a separate donation of $20,800.</p>
      <p>Under pressure to explain his involvement with the developer, Mr Pakula took to ABC radio on Wednesday morning to defend his conduct during the last election.</p>
      <p>“Developers, unions, companies, businesspeople, all sorts of people were invited to attend fundraisers or invited to attend lunches or invited to make a donation,” Mr Pakula told ABC Radio.</p>
      <p>“I always took the view, why should a developer be any less able to be invited to a fundraiser than a bank or law firm or trade union?”</p>

      <p>He said there was “no evidence whatsoever” that Mr Woodman had influenced government decisions.</p>
      <p>“It’s all good and well to run general smear, but unless there’s direct observable benefits, people shouldn’t be put through this kind of suspicion.”</p>
      <p>Along with "a couple of other MPs" Mr Pakula had run a fundraiser at ZINC at Federation Square, attended by 100 people, in the lead up to the election.</p>

      <p>“And Watsons [the planning firm where Mr Woodman is director] bought a few tickets to the value of $3300,” he said.</p>
      <p>When pressed why he invited Mr Woodman, Mr Pakula said: “Because by definition he was someone who attended fundraisers of mine in the past.</p>
      <p>“[He was] someone who I believed would come and buy tickets. I’ve never approached people for donation because I didn’t run my fundraisers.</p>
      <p>“It’s quite normal when you run a fundraiser, either yourself, or someone else, will send out invitations to fundraisers and he was someone who an invitation was sent to.”</p>
      <p>Mr Woodman contributed to local campaigns for the then-roads minister Luke Donnellan and aspiring Cranbourne MP Pauline Richards.</p>
      <p>There is no suggestion that the donations and fundraisers have influenced any particular planning decisions by the Andrews government to favour Mr Woodman or his clients.</p>
      <p>Mr Pakula said he understood why Mr Woodman’s donations to his fundraising campaign were a “troubling perception” but said donation laws had changed to prevent undue influence, and perceptions of undue influence.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Woodman’s links to the Casey land scandal had only been revealed in the Independent and Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission hearings over the past two days, and that he wouldn’t have known about it last year.</p>
