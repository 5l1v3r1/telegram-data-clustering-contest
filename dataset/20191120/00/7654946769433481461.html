      <h1>Suspect in Brooklyn pizzeria slaying ‘a patsy,’ lawyer says</h1>

      <p>He’s just a pizza patsy.</p>
      <p>A Long Island man charged with gunning down the owner of an iconic Brooklyn pizza joint in 2016 is being framed, his lawyer said at <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/murder-trial-to-begin-in-death-of-iconic-brooklyn-pizza-joint-owner/">the opening of his murder trial</a> Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The lawyer for Andres Fernandez, who is charged with the slaying of L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens pizzeria owner Louis Barbati, said prosecutors just don’t have the ingredients to put his client behind bars.</p>
      <p>“It’s a setup,” defense attorney Javier Solano told the jury during opening arguments in Brooklyn Supreme Court. “That’s what this case is, it’s a setup. Andy Fernandez is being used as the fall guy in this case, in this crime.”</p>
      <p>“You know what they call that in Brooklyn? He’s a patsy,” he added, without elaborating on how Fernandez was set up.</p>
      <p>The Melville resident was nabbed five months after Barbati was shot five times outside his Dyker Heights home on June 20, 2016, clutching a <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/07/01/iconic-brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-killed-holding-10k-in-cash/">bag loaded with food, beer and $15,483</a> in cash.</p>
      <p>The FBI first <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/06/30/owner-of-iconic-brooklyn-pizza-joint-fatally-shot-outside-home/">called the shooting a mob hit</a>, possibly from a beef over the theft of L&amp;B Spumani’s secret pizza sauce recipe by a former employee.</p>

      <p>The saucy theft ticked off a Colombo crime family associate who was married to an L&amp;B co-owner, but the feud was settled at a sit-down for $4,000.</p>
      <p>The feds instead turned the case over to the NYPD, who investigated it as an armed robbery.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors at the trial have not disclosed a possible motive but said they have enough evidence to prove that Fernandez pulled the trigger.</p>
      <p>Assistant District Attorney Emily Dean told jurors Tuesday it was simply “the killing of a family man on a sunny summer night, that’s where this investigation began.”</p>
      <p>She said Barbati’s wife, JoAnna, was in the house making dinner when the shots rang out.</p>
      <p>“As she ran over she saw her husband come through the gate to their backyard, bleeding and saying, ‘Help, I’ve been shot,'” Dean said. “You’ll hear he died right there in his backyard.”</p>
      <p>She said Fernandez “laid in wait” for hours before the shooting.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage shows a white Acura matching one owned by Fernandez pulling up at the scene of the shooting, and was spotted at the restaurant earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Fernandez is charged with robbery and second-degree murder.</p>
      <p>The trial is expected to last about three weeks.</p>
