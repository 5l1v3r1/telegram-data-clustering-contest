      <p>Major electoral boundary changes proposed for Canterbury could see Selwyn redrawn and a name change for the Port Hills electorate.</p>
      <p>The Representation Commission, an independent organisation that reviews the boundaries and names of electorates, released a report on Wednesday proposing adjustments and name changes to half of New Zealand’s electorates for the next two general elections.</p>
      <p>The changes would see Selwyn's map redrawn to no longer include Banks Peninsula, which could mean the current Port Hills electorate would be re-named Banks Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Changes have also been proposed for Ilam, Wigram, Christchurch East and Rangitata.</p>

      <p>Said Representation Commission chairman Craig Thompson: “Boundary changes are needed to electorates in the Christchurch area because of significant population growth in Selwyn, which is the fastest growing electorate in the country.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://vote.nz/boundary-review-2019-2020/">The public will now be able to have their say before the boundaries are finalised in April 2020.</a>
      </p>
      <p>“Where possible the current boundaries have been retained to minimise the number of people affected by electorate boundary and name changes," Judge Thompson said. </p>
      <p>"Of the 71 existing electorates, 36 are unchanged. The adjustments in other electorates reflect changes in population since 2014 when the boundaries were last reviewed.</p>
      <p>“We encourage people to have a closer look at the changes and what it means for them.</p>
      <p>"The public can make objections on the proposed boundaries and names until 20 December."</p>
      <p>There will be a counter-objections period from January 10-24, and public hearings will be held in February.</p>
