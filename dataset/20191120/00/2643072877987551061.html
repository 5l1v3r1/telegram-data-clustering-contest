      <p>One Precious Mensah, the 2019 winner of Atinka TV’s plus size women reality show ‘Di Asa’ in Ghana, has allegedly been refused entry into the Emirates Airlines’ plane to Dubai.</p>
      <p>Naija News understands that she was not allowed in after the airline complained that her body size is bigger than a single seat on Emirates Airlines’ flight.</p>
      <p>Precious alongside two runners-up, Maafia and Gaza, were given a sponsored trip to Dubai, as a price for coming on top during the competition.</p>
      <p>The runners-up, however, were able to go with the flight.</p>
