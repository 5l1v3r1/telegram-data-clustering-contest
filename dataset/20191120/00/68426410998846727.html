      <h1>Opinion: Why is it okay that cars kill?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Denise Balkissoon</a></address>
      <p>Torontonians are full of stories about near-misses with a driver, about almost being hit by someone running a red light, or ignoring pedestrians’ right of way. A couple of weeks ago, during their not-even 10-minute walk to school, my husband and kindergartner were almost hit when a driver failed to even slow down while turning right. The car only stopped when my husband thumped the hood so hard that his hand hurt the next day.</p>
      <p>For years, such tales have just been anecdotal evidence. There was no proof drivers here were becoming increasingly rude, dangerous and simply heartless – in October, there was a hit-and-run of a mother, grandmother and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/baby-hit-run-suspects-1.5325549">a baby</a> in a stroller, on the sidewalk. Then, last Thursday, Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders produced <a href="http://www.tpsb.ca/images/agendas/PUBLIC_AGENDA_Nov21.pdf">a report </a>that verified that gut instinct: As enforcement of traffic laws has plummeted, collisions in the city have spiked.</p>
      <p>In 2012, when there were about 50,000 collisions, police handed out almost 600,000 traffic tickets. By 2018, the number of tickets had dropped to just more than 200,000 – and collisions had jumped to almost 80,000. Annual<a href="http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/fatalities"> pedestrian deaths</a> almost doubled in that same time frame. This is why I don’t call car crashes “accidents": The word obscures how many are entirely preventable.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2018/en/">report on road safety</a> put out by the World Health Organization last year, collisions are up globally, to about 1.35 million annual crash deaths. In New York, cyclist fatalities have <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/02/87-year-old-cyclist-dead-brooklyn/">more than doubled</a> since last year, one reason why families of road death victims held a public <a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/11/17/world-day-of-remembrance-for-road-traffic-victims-manhattan-new-york-city/">memorial </a>on Sunday. In Britain’s capital, it’s Road Safety Week, drawing attention to the <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/latest-fleet-news/2019/11/19/tfl-and-the-police-committed-to-road-safety-week">112 people</a> killed in traffic collisions in London in 2018.</p>
      <p>The WHO makes special note of “middle-income” countries in Europe, Asia and Africa, where deaths are rising as more cars get on the road. In a stat that doesn’t quell a mother’s anxiety, collisions are the leading international cause of death among those ages five to 29.</p>
      <p>The frustrating part is that many of the solutions outlined by the WHO, <a href="https://www.un.org/undss/sites/www.un.org.undss/files/general/road_safety_strategy_-_booklet.pdf">the United Nations</a> and others are well known. Implementing them – from <a href="https://www.toronto.com/news-story/9613720-scarborough-north-councillor-takes-three-roads-out-of-vision-zero-plan/">lower speed limits,</a> to <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/bike-lanes-on-main-streets-debate-over-109-street-questions-basic-edmonton-approach-to-cycling">cyclist-friendly</a> streets – is what’s unnecessarily difficult. Changing attitudes isn’t impossible: While about 90 per cent of Canadians wear seat belts, it wasn’t mandatory nationally until 1991. The obstacle now is complacency, the acceptance of collisions as a part of life. The<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/11/14/she-was-paralyzed-in-a-toronto-bike-lane-by-a-careless-driver-her-family-wants-to-know-why-he-didnt-face-stricter-penalties-under-new-law.html"> injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-distracted-driving-prevention-canada/">fatalities</a> caused by motor vehicles have become less important than drivers’ need to get places, fast.</p>
      <p>Of Canadian cities, Toronto has the worst record for pedestrian deaths. We’re at <a href="http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/traffic">31 </a>this year, while Calgary, with just under half the population, is at three. Nineteen pedestrians have <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/allison-hanes-pedestrian-deaths-in-montreal-hit-ominous-high">died this year</a> in Montreal, which has about 60 per cent of Toronto’s population. That’s still more than last year and plans are under way to <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/pedestrian-safety-montreal-to-invest-in-new-crossing-lights-add-time-to-cross-1.4690627">add four to six seconds</a> of crossing time to almost 2,000 traffic lights by 2022.</p>
      <p>It’s a good move, but won’t eliminate the attitude that streets are made for cars, first and foremost. "A pedestrian is the most vulnerable user of the road. With that comes a responsibility to be careful for your safety,” Montreal police officer André Durocher told CTV. “If I’m in a situation where I’m the most vulnerable, I’m going to be twice as careful.”</p>
      <p>That’s fairly callous, when the vast majority of pedestrians killed in Toronto so far this year have been <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/80-of-pedestrian-deaths-so-far-in-2019-are-older-adults-seniors-1.5298439">seniors</a> attempting to cross in the meagre time allotted to them. If they can’t drive any more, their options are to walk, take transit or lose their independence. Getting into a car doesn’t guarantee safety, anyway, as most global road deaths are passengers.</p>
      <p>Plus, reducing emissions is another life-and-death issue. In related silliness, BBC ran a story last month singling out a type of asthma inhaler for its heavy carbon footprint, as though respiratory problems are a cause, <a href="https://grist.org/article/the-irony-of-blaming-inhalers-for-climate-change/">not an effect, </a>of the carbon problem. Somehow, the ripple effects of a societal addiction to motor vehicles have become the fault of those suffering preventable illnesses, or even death.</p>
      <p>In late September, Chief Saunders denied on CBC Radio that there had been a significant reduction in traffic enforcement. This Thursday, he will be asking Toronto council for $1-million to reinstate a dedicated traffic safety team. Extra money for fulfilling a basic job requirement isn’t justified, but the situation is so dire, there’s no other choice. Hopefully soon I’ll be able to walk my kid to school without having a panic attack.</p>
