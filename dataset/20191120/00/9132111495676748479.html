      <p>The Hajj Pilgrimage fare will remain unchanged for the 2020 Hajj pilgrimage after the government absorbed an $80 increase to the 2019 fare of GH¢19,500, an equivalent of $3,500 dollars.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrimage Affairs Office of Ghana (PAOG), in collaboration with Hajj Agents Association, has announced that an additional $80 fee has been imposed by the Saudi Arabian government for the 2020 Hajj but the government has absorbed that increase.</p>
      <p>The unsubsidized Hajj Pilgrimage fare is GH¢24,000 but the Ghanaian government pays a GH¢4,500 subsidy for all pilgrims.</p>
      <p>The new fare was announced by the Chairman of the PAOG, Sheikh I.C. Quaye, at a 2019 Hajj Thanksgiving Service held today at the Hajj Village in Accra</p>
