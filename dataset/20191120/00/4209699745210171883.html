      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has arrested Vivian Igwe, a typist at the Protocol Unit of the Ebonyi State Government House, Abakaliki, over allegation o N17m fraud.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria Police Force gave Igwe, 25, to the commission following her arrest by the Special Anti- Robbery Squared.</p>
      <p>Igwe was arrested by the squad at an ATM point on Ezza Road branch of Ecobank in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital.</p>
      <p>The funds were said to have been transferred into her account by an unknown person about three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Director of Protocol, Ebonyi Government House, Nnenna Okorie, while reacting to the incident, said the suspect had earlier complained of her inability to make withdrawals from her Ecobank account.</p>
      <p>She said the suspect had gone to the bank to apply for reactivation of her ATM card when she was arrested.</p>
      <p>She described the suspect as a humble and honest staff and called for proper investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>Okorie said, “The last information I got from her was that she was going for the reactivation of her ATM as directed by the bank only to be arrested on Monday.</p>
      <p>“She was later handed over to EFCC personnel from Enugu.”</p>
