      <h2>Annual event kicks off the holiday shopping season in downtown Cloverdale</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/malin-jordan/" target="_blank">Malin Jordan</a></address>
      <p>Ladies’ Night Out is returning to Cloverdale.</p>
      <p>The annual shopping event will see thousands of shoppers descend upon downtown Cloverdale Nov. 28 to visit businesses along 176 Street (between Highway 10 and 58A Avenue).</p>
      <p>“Ladies Night Out is really our way to say thanks to all of our customers,” said Paige Hardy, owner of Clothesline Consignment and president of the Cloverdale Arts &amp; Entertainment Association. The Cloverdale Arts and Entertainment Association organizes the event each year.</p>
      <p>“It’s a customer appreciation evening and it’s more about the businesses saying ‘thank you for continuing to shop local,’ than anything else.”</p>
      <p>Hardy said there will be lots of pre-Christmas deals at all the shops.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has specials,” said Hardy. “There are big sales in each store and most of the stores have some sort of appreciation gift or free food.”</p>
      <p>“The evening is always a lot of fun and a lot of people anticipate the night. It’s a small community so most of the loyal customers have been going to these stores and businesses for years.”</p>
      <p>Hardy said there will also be shops within shops, where businesses that don’t have their own bricks-and-mortar location will set up a booth inside a Cloverdale storefront.</p>
      <p>“We want to support those businesses too,” added Hardy.</p>
      <p>Hardy also noted shoppers who visit three stores or more during Ladies Night Out will have their names entered in a draw to win one of three gift baskets which are valued at roughly $350 each.</p>
      <p>With 70 business participating in Ladies Night Out, Hardy believes each shopper will be able to find gifts for even the hardest-to-buy-for individuals.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://surreyfirefighters.com/charitablesociety/">Surrey Fire Fighters Charitable Society</a> will also be on hand collecting donations of new and unwrapped toys, non-perishable food items, and money in support of Cloverdale’s Christmas Hamper program. Last year the Charitable society raised more than $1,000 in cash donations alone.</p>
      <p>Ladies Night Out runs from 5 – 9 p.m.</p>
