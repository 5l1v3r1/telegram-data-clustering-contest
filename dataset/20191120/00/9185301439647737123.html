      <p>Gliha graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a B.A. in Economics from Claremont McKenna College. She is very familiar with NHRA, its business and its events, including its historic facility and events in Pomona, Calif.</p>
      <p>"We are honored and excited that Lee Ann has agreed to join NHRA’s board of directors. We think her business experience and her love of the sport will help NHRA confidently stride forward and continue to grow,” said NHRA board chair and CEO Peter Clifford.</p>
      <p>“I had the chance to work with NHRA several years ago, and through that I gained a strong understanding of the sport and the business,” said Gliha. “The sport’s history is remarkable and its events are thoroughly entertaining with many rounds of mindboggling fast racing and a unique opportunity for fans to interact with the teams between races in the pits. NHRA events are truly fun for everyone and I hope more people will get out to an NHRA event. I’m honored to join the board and be in a position to learn even more and contribute to the sport’s continued prosperity.”</p>
      <p>Gliha will join current board members Michael Cohen, Ed Desser, Clifford, and Glen Cromwell, effective Dec. 3, 2019.</p>
