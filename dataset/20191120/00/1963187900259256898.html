Ministers from the Arab region, policymakers, decision-makers, and representatives from civil society from the league member states including Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Palestine, Somalia, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen will participate in the conference. Academics and researchers will also attend to share knowledge and best cross-regional practices related to post-conflict situations from the region and beyond. <br/><br/>The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) was the first global document to develop a link between gender, sustainable peace and security maintenance.
