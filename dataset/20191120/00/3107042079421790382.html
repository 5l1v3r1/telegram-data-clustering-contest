      <p>Residents in Doyleston no longer need to boil their water.</p>
      <p>The Selwyn District Council has received enough test results to show the water is clear of E. coli and safe to drink.</p>
      <p>A district council spokesman said: "The council wishes to thank residents for their patience while the notice was in place."</p>
      <p>The boil water notice was put in place on November 13 after test results showed E. coli levels were above the recommended level in the Doyleston water supply.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/star-news/star-christchurch/no-need-boil-water-leeston">Residents connected to the Leeston water supply also no longer need to boil their water.</a>
