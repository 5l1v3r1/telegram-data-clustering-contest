      <p>Johannesburg. Inflation in South Africa reached an eight-year low last month on the back of low fuel prices, official figures showed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Annual consumer inflation continued its downward streak, dropping to 3.7% in October from 4.1% in September," South Africa's statistics department StatsSA said Wednesday, adding that the figure was the lowest since February 2011.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes as a relief to Africa's most industrialised economy, whose currency has been weakened by years of low growth and mass layoffs.</p>
      <p>StatsSA said the drop was mainly fuelled by a 4.9-percent decline in fuel prices from October last year. Â </p>
      <p>Food and non-alcoholic beverages, housing, and goods and services were the main contributors to the annual rise in prices.</p>
      <p>Among food, the most notable price increases were observed among bread and cereal, fish and fruit.</p>
