      <p>World Heavyweight Champion, Andy Ruiz Jnr has ominously told Anthony Joshua that he wasn’t that hurt when he caused one of the greatest heavyweight shocks of the generation.</p>
      <p>Joshua had previously claimed that he lost to a “lucky punch sent by the gods” but Ruiz Jr has now responded by denying that he was never hurt, even when he was knocked down.</p>

      <p>Ruiz says it was a lucky shot and it did not hurt him as he wasn’t wobbling after the knockdown.</p>
      <p>He said that he had the will and fire inside him to keep him fighting and win the fight.</p>

      <p>Joshua will have the chance to reclaim his IBF, WBA and WBO belts and avenge the only loss of his career when he faces Ruiz again next month.</p>
      <p>Joshua will fight Ruiz on the 8th of next month in Saudi Arabia.</p>
