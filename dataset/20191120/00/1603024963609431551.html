        <b>Angel Broking's currency report on EURINR</b>
      </p>
      <p>EURUSD appreciated by 0.07 percent yesterday while EURINR appreciated by 0.15 percent during the same time frame. Christine Lagarde has taken the helm of the European Central Bank at a time of rising scepticism over the power of monetary policy. Many believe that ECB will now be just a helpless by stander but there is plenty more the ECB can do, from further rate cuts to more flexible asset purchases. In September, ECB cut the deposit rate to - 0.5% and restarted net asset purchases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>OUTLOOK</b>
      </p>
      <p>EURINR is expected to move sideways in today’s session.</p>
