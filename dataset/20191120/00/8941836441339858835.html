      <p>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Rennia Davis scored 15 points and Rae Burrell had a double-double as the 23rd-ranked Lady Volunteers rolled to a 73-46 victory over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stetson/">Stetson</a> on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Burrell had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Jordan Horston scored 14 points, Jazmine Massengill had 12 and Kasiyahna Kushkituah added 11.</p>
      <p>Tennessee (5-0) never trailed Tuesday in a marked contrast from its matchup with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stetson/">Stetson</a> last season, when the Lady Vols won 65-55 only after erasing a 20-point, second-half deficit.</p>
      <p>The Lady Vols broke open a close game by going on a 17-2 spurt midway through the contest. Tennessee scored the last nine points of the second quarter to grab a 39-24 halftime edge and then opened the third period with an 8-2 run.</p>
      <p>Day’Neshia Banks scored 21 points for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stetson/">Stetson</a> (2-3). Kennedi Colclough added 10 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
