      <h1>Steelers’ Rudolph: ‘No acceptable excuse’ for role in brawl</h1>

      <p>PITTSBURGH (AP) - Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Mason Rudolph</a> wanted to get away from Cleveland Browns defensive end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles Garrett</a>.</p>
      <p>The way <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> went about it - a process that contributed to a brawl that culminated with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> getting smacked in the head with his own helmet and led to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> getting suspended by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> indefinitely - is one of the first-year starter’s regrets.</p>
      <p>Saying “there is no acceptable excuse,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said his behavior in the final moments of last Thursday’s 21-7 loss to the Browns fell short of the standard set by the league and the Steelers.</p>
      <p>“The bottom line is I should have done a better job keeping my composure in that situation,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said Wednesday while reading from a prepared statement before briefly taking questions from reporters.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> became entangled on the next-to-last Steelers snap of Cleveland’s lopsided 21-7 victory. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> flipped a short pass to running back Jaylen Samuels just before getting hit by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>, who twisted <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> to the ground as play continued downfield.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> took exception to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> wrapping him up, calling it “late.” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said he was trying to separate himself from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> - who was not flagged on the play - when he briefly grabbed the back of the 6-foot-4, 272-pound <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>’s helmet.</p>
      <p>“It was the last play of the game and I was just trying to get him from off on top of me,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> responded by tugging at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a>’s facemask, eventually ripping it off and holding it high while Steelers guard David DeCastro attempted to separate them. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> scrambled to his feet and gave chase in an apparent attempt to retrieve his helmet. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> then swung the helmet at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a>, connecting on the right side of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a>’s head. The chaos that followed included Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey punching and kicking <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> getting knocked to the ground by a blind-side hit from Cleveland defensive tackle Larry Ogunjobi.</p>
      <p>In addition to handing out a record suspension to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> banned Pouncey for three games and ordered Ogunjobi to sit out on Sunday when the Browns host Miami. All three players are appealing. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said he has not been notified of any fine for his actions but will accept whatever punishment the league metes out.</p>

        <p>“I have no ill will toward <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles Garrett</a>, great respect for his ability as a player,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said. “And I know if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Myles</a> could go back he would handle the situation differently.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said he “definitely didn’t say anything” to escalate the situation with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a>, calling the ordeal “an unfortunate situation for both teams involved.” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> lamented that his actions led directly to Pouncey’s retaliation against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/myles-garrett/">Garrett</a> that resulted in Pittsburgh (5-5) potentially losing the seven-time Pro Bowler during a critical stretch that will go a long way to determining whether they stay in the playoff picture.</p>
        <p>“Probably one of the best teammates I’ve ever had.,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mason-rudolph/">Rudolph</a> said of Pouncey. “A guy that you want on your team. He has your back. He has everybody’s back on this team. … I put him in a bad spot and we’re looking to get him back as soon as possible whenever that is.”</p>
