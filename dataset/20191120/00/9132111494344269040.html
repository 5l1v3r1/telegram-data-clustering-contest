      <p>Managing Editor of the Insight newspaper, Kwesi Pratt, has urged political parties in the country to agitate for what he described as the “sanitization of the Electoral Commission”.</p>
      <p>Sharing his thoughts on Dr Bossman Asare’s call for a 'Yes' vote in the impending referendum, Mr Pratt said it is about time political parties took steps to get rid of characters such as the deputy commissioner from the EC.</p>
      <p>Dr Eric Bossman Asare’s recent call for a 'Yes' vote has attracted a storm of criticism from a section of the public and some civil society groups.</p>
      <p>His conduct has roundly been described as highly unprofessional and unethical.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Metro TV’s “Good Morning Ghana” show on Wednesday, the veteran journalist who was visibly enraged by the turn of event, called for the immediate removal of Dr Bossman Asare from office.</p>
      <p>In the estimation of Mr Pratt, the continues stay of Dr Bossman Asare in office could jeopardize the 2020 elections.</p>
      <p>“I am scandalized by his conduct. Is this the EC that is going to conduct the 2020 elections? What confidence do I have participating in this election when I know that its vice chairman has a position?</p>
      <p>“I am shocked by his conduct and this is not the type of electoral commission we want in this country,” Mr Kwesi Pratt stressed.</p>
      <p>Next month’s referendum is to enable citizens to vote on the proposed amendment of Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution that bars political parties from participating in District Level Elections.</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) which is an entrenched position states that: “…Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character, and sponsor candidates for elections to any public office other than to District Assemblies or lower local government units”.</p>
      <p>The provision can only be amended through a referendum which per Article 290(4) of the 1992 constitution, can be approved when at least 40% of persons entitled to vote, vote at the referendum and at least 75% of the persons who vote cast their votes in favour of passing the bill.</p>
      <p>If carried, the proposed amendment will introduce multi-party participation in the local government system in Ghana.</p>
