      <p>The Nigerian Senate has opposed the idea of banning the importation of power-generating sets to address the challenges in the country’s power sector.<br/><br/>Chukwuka Utazi, senator representing Enugu North, moved a motion for an urgent solution to the perennial problems in the power sector.<br/><br/>He asked the Senate to probe power firms in the country.<br/><br/>However, Francis Fadahunsi, senator representing Osun East, suggested a five-year temporary ban on the importation of generators into the country in order to address the electricity challenges, TheCable reports.<br/><br/>But when Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, called for a voice vote, the lawmakers voted against Fadahunsi’s prayer.<br/><br/>Gershon Bassey, senator representing Cross River South, said what Nigeria needs to resolve its power problem was to develop its transmission infrastructure.<br/><br/>According to him, Nigeria’s transmission infrastructure currently lacks the capacity to withstand an increase in power generation.<br/><br/>He advised the government to build on existing policy framework inherited from past administrations.<br/><br/>The Senate asked the government to upgrade the transmission infrastructure in the electricity grid for a more efficient delivery of power.<br/><br/>The Senate Committee on Power was given four weeks to submit its report on the matter for consideration.</p>
