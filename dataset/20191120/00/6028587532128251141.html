      <p>Last week’s Tableau Conference 2019 was interesting both for what was said and what wasn’t. I’m sure this week’s Dreamforce will be the same. Back in August, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/salesforce-com-inc-tableau-software-inc-merger-inquiry">UK government began investigating the acquisition</a>. The investigation meant a limited ability for Tableau and Salesforce to communicate. What I was told at this conference is the barrier to communications was lifted the week before Tableau’s event. Given the timing, there’s not much that can be said. A Salesforce contingent was at the show, with Marc Benioff did make an appearance during the keynote, and there will be a Tableau contingent at Dreamforce, but many things have been slowed by the investigation. The result means that there were no answers to my questions about the changes that will happen to one, large, stakeholder group at both companies: partners.It’s very clear that the merger will help both companies in both reaching new customers. It also definitely means a benefit to the existing Salesforce customer base. As someone who has worked with Salesforce partners, I can state that their user interface still leaves a lot to be desired. It’s clunky and much of it isn’t intuitive. They’ve been trying to address that issue for a while, with not much success.</p>
      <p>One way it has been addressed is through the Salesforce partner program. The Salesforce AppExchange is where many partners provide add-ons to the core product. Much of what’s there provides business intelligence (BI), with analytics and visualizations needed to better understand the customers’ sales environments.</p>
      <p>Now, think about Tableau, a leader in the BI space. It’s clear that Salesforce will have as the number one task a very tight integration between the two systems. What happens to those Salesforce partner? The odds are that it will be nothing good.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I saw a number of Tableau partners who describe how they help customers integrate the software into the Salesforce environment. That’s a lucrative business that will be minimized. I’m sure there will still be a need to have some help, but most of that business will go away.</p>
      <p>Change is constant. It’s good that Tableau and Salesforce will integrate. The question is what they will do to help partners adapt. Both companies have a strong history of partner involvement, so I hope that means the two companies will create programs that will help partners adapt to the new environment. Companies love to talk about ecosystems, so I look forward, with great interest, to what the merged companies will do to manage that ecosystem.</p>
