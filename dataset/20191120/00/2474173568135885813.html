      <p>It's nearly the holidays which means one thing: The <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/11/8851913/billie-eilish-hitmaker-of-the-year-2019-grammy">Grammy nominations</a> are here.</p>
      <p>This year, the new Recording Academy President/CEO Deborah Dugan presented the nominees alongside the Chair of the Board of Trustees Harvey Mason Jr.. Alicia Keys, who hosted the 2019 <a href="http://www.grammy.com/">Grammys</a> and is returning — despite her own promise not to — as a host for the 2020 ceremony. Keys popped by the announcements after being introduced by Gayle King to help share the rest of the nominees.</p>
