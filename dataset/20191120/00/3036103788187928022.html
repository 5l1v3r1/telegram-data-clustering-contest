      <h1>Why Telkom is getting killed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/328165-telkom-getting-hammered.html"><b>Telkom’s share price has plummeted</b></a> from around R100 per share to just over R50 per share over the last five months, which points to the investment community losing trust in the company.</p>
      <p>There are many reasons for the lack of trust, including a rapid decline in fixed-line customers, lower enterprise voice and data revenue, increasing debt, and Telkom’s plan to buy Cell C.</p>
      <p>Jean Pierre Verster from Protea Capital Management <a href="https://youtu.be/tPtdv-aEo0U?t=123"><b>highlighted that</b></a> Telkom’s free cashflow generation is negative and that the decline in fixed-line revenue is severe.</p>
      <p>While Telkom’s mobile unit is growing, the company is spending a lot of money on this part of the business and is taking on a lot of debt to fund it (its net debt increased to R12 billion).</p>
      <p>Stakeholders highlighted that Telkom’s debt is reaching worrying levels and are questioning whether the company accurately assessed the finance charges related to this debt.</p>
      <h3>Telkom losing fibre market share</h3>
      <p>Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko said the company will increasingly focus on its mobile services, which comes at the detriment to its fixed-line operations.</p>
      <p>Maseko, however, <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/fibre/327807-telkom-not-losing-the-fibre-war-ceo.html"><b>does not seem concerned</b></a> about losing large numbers of fixed-line and fixed-broadband subscribers.</p>
      <p>Telkom’s fixed-line broadband subscribers – which include ADSL, VDSL, and fibre-to-the-home customers – declined from 974,181 in September 2018 to 781,255 in September 2019.</p>
      <p>Instead of doubling down on its fibre network investment, Telkom has cut capital expenditure on its fibre network by 36.3% over the last year.</p>
      <p>Telkom is focussing its spend on fibre-to-the-base-station to support its mobile operations instead of fibre-to-the-home.</p>
      <p>The company said it has a strong focus on fibre-to-the-business and fibre-to-the-base-station because they have significantly higher ARPU than FTTH passed.</p>
      <p>This means that Telkom is allowing other fibre network operators like Vumatel, Octotel, and Frogfoot to eat into its fixed-line market share, where it used to be completely dominant.</p>
      <h3>Questionable strategy</h3>
      <p>Wayne McCurrie from FNB Wealth and Investments questioned Telkom’s strategy, saying the company is trying to compete in a saturated environment.</p>
      <p>He said Telkom relies on its roaming agreement to offer a decent service, which means its only competitive advantage is price.</p>
      <p>This “race to the bottom” is good news for consumers but puts tremendous pressure on Telkom’s bottom line.</p>
      <p>Excelsia analyst Mark Narramore also questioned Telkom’s strategy, saying it was spending money with cashflow which it does not have.</p>
      <p>Narramore highlighted that Telkom’s share price has been declining over the last four months and that he anticipates the company to be downgraded.</p>
      <h3>Telkom’s plan to buy Cell C</h3>
      <p>Commenting on Telkom’s plan to buy Cell C, Verster said these two mobile operators are not great businesses on their own as the number three and four mobile operators in a saturated and mature market.</p>
      <p>“When you put them together it is even worse,” said Verster. It is like having a concrete boot on the left foot, and then putting a concrete boot on the right foot as well.</p>
      <p>Verster said he hopes there is a good strategy behind Telkom’s plan to buy Cell C and that they have access to the “real numbers”.</p>
      <p>“There was an accounting opinion [related to Cell C’s results] which was withheld, and Cell C has still not issued its own audited results,” said Verster.</p>
      <p>He added that there is no private company which made higher cumulative losses than Cell C in South Africa.</p>
