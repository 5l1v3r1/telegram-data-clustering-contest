      <p>BURNABY, B.C. - As one Metro Vancouver transit union gets set to escalate strike action another is taking a strike vote, adding to the potential for chaos for area commuters.</p>
      <p>CUPE 7000 represents about 900 SkyTrain workers and has announced that a strike vote is underway for its members.</p>
      <p>Unifor announced that it would be holding a news conference Wednesday to reveal its next phase of job action after the employer, Coast Mountain Bus Company, failed to make a new offer at the bargaining table.</p>
      <p>Unifor represents about 5,000 mechanics, bus and SeaBus operators and has been refusing overtime on a rotating basis after contract talks broke off.</p>
      <p>CUPE says in a statement issued Tuesday that the B.C. Rapid Transit Company, which operates SkyTrain, turned down its latest proposal for new bargaining dates, setting off the strike vote.</p>
      <p>The union says the vote will be complete by Thursday and results will be announced shortly afterward.</p>
