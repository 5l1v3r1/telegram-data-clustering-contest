      <h1>Legal Differences Between The Tobacco And Cannabis Vape Industries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Kovacevich</a></address>
      <p>The term “vape” wasn’t used  a decade ago, but now you can hardly go a day without hearing it; and yet there is often confusion surrounding the term as it doesn’t denote what is being vaped, just the method of inhalation. A distinction is important since the two main types of vape products—tobacco and cannabis—are distinguished by much more than their psychoactive effects. Cannabis and tobacco have different laws and regulations surrounding their sale, use, packaging and marketing.These distinctions have become critical as we have seen a rise in both nicotine and THC vape use among teens with the introduction of vape technology. The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/teens-using-vaping-devices-record-numbers">National Institutes of Health study on teens and vaping</a> reported that 37.3 percent of 12th graders reporting “any vaping” in the past 12 months, compared to just 27.8 percent in 2017. A more recent study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse shows that vaping has now more than doubled in eighth, 10th and 12th grades since 2017. </p>
      <p>The sudden rise in vaping amongst teens is due in part to flavoring like “Cookies and Cream,” which gives the misconception of a benign and safe product and downplays the fact that some vape products contain the highly-addictive drug, nicotine. As Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director of NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, explains, “Teens are clearly attracted to the marketable technology and flavorings seen in vaping devices.” </p>
      <p>While the industry has presented e-cigarettes and vaping products as a healthier alternative to regular cigarettes, they are also recruiting thousands of more teen consumers by offering them prettier packages and slick devices, even though vape liquids can still contain nicotine.</p>
      <p>For clarity on the legal requirements surrounding the sale, packaging, marketing and use of vape products, I’ve put together a brief breakdown, of some of the key differences in the tobacco vape and the cannabis vape industries. Please note: this breakdown is specific to California.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Age</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis</p>
      <ul>
        <li>California law states use and purchase has an age minimum of 21 for cannabis products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tobacco</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The federal minimum age for purchasing and using any tobacco product is 18. California raised the age to 21 in 2016.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Packaging</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Must be child-resistant</li>
        <li>Must list all pharmacologically active ingredients</li>
        <li>Must have the following warning label: “Government warning: this product contains cannabis, a schedule I controlled substance. Keep out of reach of children and animals. Cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient. The intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours. Cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful. Consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery. Please use extreme caution.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tobacco</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Must have the following warning:“WARNING: This product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Advertising</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising is only permitted where the audience is at least 71.6% over the age of 21.</li>
        <li>Advertisements are banned from within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds.</li>
        <li>Cannot be advertised on TV</li>
      </ul>

        <li>The nicotine warning must accompany all text or imagery promoting a tobacco or nicotine vape brand.</li>
        <li>Advertisements are banned from within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds.</li>
        <li>While tobacco products can not be advertised on TV, nicotine vape products are currently permitted to do so. More recently, however, many of the major network TV stations are pulling nicotine vape ads despite there not being an official ban from the FCC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Retail Regulations</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All cannabis vape sales must be tracked and reported to the California government through METRC (Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Reporting Compliance).</li>
        <li>Retailers must maintain an annual California cannabis retailer license.</li>
        <li>Retailers must follow the following security measures:</li>
        <li>ID badges for all employees</li>
        <li>Limited-access areas within the facility</li>
        <li>Security personnel</li>
        <li>24-hour video surveillance of all areas containing cannabis vape products and all point of sale areas</li>
        <li>Alarm systems</li>
        <li>Commercial-grade locks</li>
        <li>Secure storage of all cannabis vape products</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Retail stores must check photo ID of anyone under the age of 27 who attempts to purchase nicotine vape products.</li>
        <li>Nicotine vape products can not be sold through a vending machine unless in an adult-only facility.</li>

        <li>Nicotine vape free samples can not be given to consumers, including any of their components or parts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Use</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cannabis</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Illegal to drive or operate heavy machinery following the use of any cannabis product</li>
        <li>Illegal to vape cannabis in public (ie.parks, sidewalks, business and residential areas, etc.).</li>
        <li>Illegal to open a package containing cannabis vape in public.</li>
        <li>Illegal to vape cannabis in any location in which it is also illegal to smoke (ie. bars, restaurants, public buildings, places of employment and an area within 15 feet of doors or ventilation openings.)</li>
        <li>Illegal to vape cannabis in federal park even if that federal park is within California</li>
        <li>While it is not illegal to vape cannabis on private property, owners can reserve the right to ban its use on their property.</li>
        <li>It is illegal to take cannabis vape products out of California, even if it is to another state where it is legal.</li>
        <li>Cannabis vape products may only be purchased from state licensed establishments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tobacco</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Federally the minimum legal age for e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery systems is 18, however some states, like California, which is 21, have their own higher limits.</li>
        <li>In most states, like California, e-cigarette laws fall under the same laws as smoking. States that do not have a state-wide ban on vaping in public will often have certain cities or counties that have elected to apply their own public use ban.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While there is a great deal of crossover and similarity between the two vape industries, it’s important to note for operators and consumers alike that there are a few key differences, particularly in the categories of retail regulations and packaging.</p>
      <p>While these regulations are as accurate as possible at the time of this writing, it’s important to note that the FDA and state level governing bodies change these policies regularly.</p>
