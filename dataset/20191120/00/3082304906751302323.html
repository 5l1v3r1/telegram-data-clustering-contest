        <b>Ryan Giggs is one of the most decorated players in football history but, as a manager, Wales have given him one of his best days.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A delighted Ryan Giggs hailed one of the best days of his life after Wales secured a place at Euro 2020 with a 2-0 win over Hungary.</p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey was the hero in Cardiff, scoring a goal in each half as Wales clinched the second qualifying spot behind Croatia in Group E – earning a shot at matching their Euro 2016 exploits following a semi-final run.</p>
      <p>An uneven start to his first campaign in charge meant Giggs’ men needed to win both of their closing matches to progress.</p>
      <p>Victory in Azerbaijan over the weekend before success before their fervent home support saw them come good when it mattered.</p>
      <p>“It’s doesn’t get any better,” Wales manager Giggs told Sky Sports. “It’s amazing. From where we were in the summer with those two defeats [away to Croatia and Hungary], credit to the lads the way they’ve come back.</p>
      <p>“They’ve show grit, determination and quality. It’s one of the best days of my life.”</p>

      <p>Ramsey’s injury problems meant the Juventus star was making his first start of qualification on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“He’s just showed that quality, that class,” Giggs said. “The finishes… we missed him, but better late than never, I suppose.”</p>
      <p>Having never managed to represent Wales at a major tournament as a player, Manchester United great Giggs will revel in leading his country on such a grand stage.</p>
      <p>“To be honest I haven’t really thought about that,” he added, referencing those playing disappointments.</p>
      <p>“It’s one of the greatest days of my life. There was a lot of hard work put in. Not only am I blessed with a good set of players but also the best staff I could ask for.</p>
      <p>“The atmosphere every time we play in Cardiff… the fans are part of it. I was watching it in 2016 – you could tell the fans loved it then and they’ll love this even more.”</p>
