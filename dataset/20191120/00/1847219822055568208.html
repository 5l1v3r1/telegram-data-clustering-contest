        <b>Maltese authorities have arrested in the murder case of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia on Wednesday a well-known entrepreneur Yorgen Fenech.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50485721">BBC</a> and Times of Malta report that Yorgen Fenech was detained by armed officers and his yacht has been searched, the Times of Malta reported.</p>
      <p>It comes a day after Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said he would consider a pardon for an alleged money launderer suspected of being the middleman in the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb in 2017. Malta’s handling of the case has drawn international criticism.</p>
      <p>Witnesses quoted by the Times of Malta said Fenech’s luxury yacht was intercepted by an armed patrol boat as it left the port of Portomaso, north of Valletta, early on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Police and Fenech himself have not yet commented publicly on the operation, BBC reports.</p>
