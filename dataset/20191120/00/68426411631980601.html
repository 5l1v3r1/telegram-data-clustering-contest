      <p>The Somali government says a Somali-Canadian human rights activist and diplomat has been killed.</p>
      <p>The Somali ministry of information says Almaas Elman was murdered in the capital city of Mogadishu.</p>
      <p>The government said in a tweet that it is investigating and will bring those responsible to justice.</p>
      <p>A Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman said the department was prepared to help the family.</p>
      <p>“Our deepest thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the Canadian citizen who died in a shooting in Somalia,” Natasha Nystrom said in an email Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Consular officials stand ready to provide consular services to the family.”</p>
      <p>She said consular officials in Kenya are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information.</p>
      <p>Nystrom said due to the Privacy Act no further information would be disclosed.</p>
      <p>Media reports in Somalia say Elman was shot in her vehicle while heading to the airport.</p>
      <p>She was involved with the Elman Centre for Peace and Human Rights in Mogadishu, a non-governmental agency founded by her family.</p>
      <p>Her sister, Ilwad Elman, made international headlines in October when she was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the Elman Centre.</p>
