      <p>The summit of heads of state of the East African Community (EAC) scheduled for November 30 in Arusha, Tanzania, has been postponed due to a lack of quorum.</p>
      <p>Representatives from one member country were absent. The bloc is made up of six member countries.</p>
      <p>According to official correspondence from the Rwandan minister of State in charge of East African Community (EAC) Affairs, Olivier Nduhungirehe, a new date in January or February will be communicated after consultations among EAC heads of state.</p>
      <p>Other reports indicated that Burundi requested for a postponement.</p>
      <p>The postponement comes at a time when the EAC Secretariat has expressed concerns about low budget support by member states, which has caused several programmes to stall.</p>
      <p>Estimates show that South Sudan and Burundi have been the main defaulters.</p>
