      <p><b>NEW ORLEANSÂ (AP)</b> - Portland coach Terry Stotts says Carmelo Anthony will start at forward in his Trail Blazers debut against the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Anthony agreed to contract terms with Portland last week but was officially signed Tuesday after passing a recent physical.</p>
      <p>The 16-year veteran's first game with his fifth NBA team comes in the same city - and across the street - from where he led Syracuse to an NCAA national title in 2003.</p>
      <p>The 6-foot-8 Anthony began his NBA career in Denver, where he played seven-plus seasons before being traded in 2011 to the New York Knicks, where he spent six-plus seasons. He also has played one each with Oklahoma City and Houston. The Rockets traded him to Chicago last January, but the Bulls cut him before he played a game.</p>
      <p>He has averaged 24 points in 1,064 career regular season games.</p>
