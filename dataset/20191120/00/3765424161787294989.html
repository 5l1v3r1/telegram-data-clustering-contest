      <p>WARRIORS coach Joe Antipas has sensationally announced his departure from the national team, exactly 24 hours after masterminding the downfall of Zambia in a Total Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Heroes Stadium in Zambia.</p>
      <p>The Warriors, against all odds, shocked the 2012 African champions, beating them 2-1 through a brace by poster boy Khama Billiat, who scored in either side of the half to register Zimbabwe’s first win over Chipolopolo in an Afcon qualifier.</p>
      <p>“I take a bow,” said Antipas whose local club Chicken Inn is in the hunt for their second league title in five years.</p>
