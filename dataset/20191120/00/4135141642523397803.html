      <h1>Gophers fall to No. 10 in College Football Playoff rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:11:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 00:11</time> by <a rel="author">FOX Sports North</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/minnesota-golden-gophers-team">Minnesota</a> (9-1, 6-1 Big Ten) fell two spots to No. 10 in the latest edition of the College Football Playoff rankings, released Tuesday, following a 23-19 loss to <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/iowa-hawkeyes-team">Iowa</a>.</p>
      <p>The Gophers jumped from No. 17 to No. 8 following their win over then-No. 4 Penn State but struggled to keep up with the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/iowa-hawkeyes-team">Hawkeyes</a> in Iowa City.</p>
      <p>Iowa, which rose three spots to No. 17 this week, scored on its first three possessions, then held off a second-half rally to secure the upset. Gophers quarterback <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/tanner-morgan-2-player-stats">Tanner Morgan</a> exited with a concussion late in the fourth quarter. His status for Saturday’s game at Northwestern is up in the air.</p>
      <p>The loss hurt the Gophers’ chances of making the playoff, but they remain atop the Big Ten West.</p>
      <p>Minnesota leads second-place <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/wisconsin-badgers-team">Wisconsin</a> by one game. The Gophers visit Northwestern on Saturday, before hosting the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/wisconsin-badgers-team">Badgers</a> on Nov. 30.</p>
