      <p>UNICEF is supporting the Government of Samoa to respond to a measles outbreak in the country which has reportedly claimed the lives of 14 children under-five years old and one adult.</p>
      <p>All schools have also been temporarily closed in Samoa and children under 17 years old have been advised by the Government not to attend public gatherings to contain the spread of the disease.</p>
      <p>UNICEF has deployed health and communication staff in Samoa to boost the governmentâ€™s immunization campaign and delivered a total of 110,500 doses of measles containing vaccines (100,000 MR and 10,500 MMR) and 30, 000 Vitamin A tablets.</p>
      <p>In addition, 6 refrigerators and three emergency response trolleys used as immunization service stations are being shipped to Samoa.</p>
      <p>UNICEF has also delivered vaccines to Tonga, Fiji and Niue, and has worked with the governments of Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Cook Islands, Niue, Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in conducting their measles immunization campaigns and developing their preparedness plans for an outbreak.</p>
