      <h1>Paul George: ‘I Wanted to Be Traded to San Antonio’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/paul-george">Paul George</a> initially wanted to join <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> in San Antonio.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to go to San Antonio first,” George recalls of his initial trade demand from the Indiana Pacers back in June 2017.</p>

      <p>PG says he and Leonard—the LA Clippers’ new superstar duo will hit the floor together for the first time Wednesday night—were “destined” to join forces.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28111598/clippers-paul-george-kawhi-leonard-destined-play-together">ESPN</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I wanted to be traded to San Antonio,” George says. “We wanted to go to San Antonio first, and we didn’t make that happen.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>A league source confirmed that the Pacers and Spurs talked, but San Antonio lacked the assets to pair George with Leonard. The Lakers also wanted George, but then team-president Magic Johnson would not trade the 2017 second overall pick (which would become Lonzo Ball) and Brandon Ingram, believing the team could eventually sign George as a free agent.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“As far as the Lakers, I wanted to go to L.A.,” George says. “They didn’t make that happen. They didn’t put nothing together. So that’s in the back of my mind [when I became a free agent]. That was in the back of my mind.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Sam Presti of the Oklahoma City Thunder would eventually swoop in and acquire the Pacers star, but the idea of teaming up with Leonard lingered.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“Just seems like it was destined,” George said when officially introduced to L.A. “We were supposed to play together.”</i>
