      <h1>Spurs appoint Mourinho: Jose raids Lille for two coaches</h1>

      <p>Tottenham have agreed a deal with Lille to bring in coaches Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos to work with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho was appointed Spurs' new head coach on Wednesday following Mauricio Pochettino's departure the previous day.</p>
      <p>Spurs moved quickly to begin securing the desired backroom setup for their new coach, as Lille confirmed the departure of Sacramento and Santos.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have reportedly paid Â£3million for the duo, with Sacramento expected to become Mourinho's assistant. Santos joins as goalkeeping coach.</p>
      <p>"To Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos, LOSC wish all the success in this new project," a Lille statement read.</p>
      <p>ESPN report Spurs may yet return to Lille for sporting director Luis Campos, who previously worked with Mourinho at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's time at Tottenham saw numerous reports of tensions between the manager and chairman Daniel Levy over transfers.</p>
      <p>The arrival of Campos as sporting director would seemingly act as a buffer, and Mourinho is said to have funds to make signings in January.</p>
