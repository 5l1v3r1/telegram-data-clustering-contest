      <p>A Massachusetts man is currently in police custody after his five-year-old son took a baggie filled with a white substance to school. The young boy claimed that the powder made him feel "like Spiderman," which shouldn't be a surprise when considering the drugs were contained in a Spiderman stamped baggie. When the teacher noticed realized what the boy had in his possession, authorities were alerted. </p>
      <p>Police later searched the home of 29-year-old Benny Garcia, finding roughly 170 bags of heroin, some of which sported the Spiderman branding. Garcia's son was taken to the hospital after it was determined that he ingested some of the drugs but is expected to be fine. </p>
      <p>Garcia is being held without bail until his November 20th hearing. </p>
