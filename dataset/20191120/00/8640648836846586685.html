      <p>The Southern Nevada Water Authority board will no longer be voting on a 10-year marketing and <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/water-agency-seeks-ok-for-30m-marketing-deal-with-raiders-1894137/">advertising partnership</a> with the Raiders Thursday.</p>
      <p>Instead, the authority’s citizens advisory committee, formed last month, will be evaluating the proposal at a January meeting.</p>
      <p>The proposal entails the authority having the ability to use the Raiders’ name and logo, identify itself as a partner of the team and place ads on TV, radio, social media and billboards and within Allegiant Stadium. A large portion of the stadium advertising would take place in the restrooms on the main and upper concourse.</p>
      <p>After the committee makes a recommendation on the proposal, the authority’s board will evaluate the partnership at a subsequent meeting — probably in March.</p>
      <p>“After consultation from the board, our executive team decided that (delaying the vote) would be the best move,” said SNWA spokesman Scott Huntley.</p>
      <p>The 10-year deal would cost $30 million in tax dollars, and would also have the Raiders contribute $600,000 annually to convert two local high school grass football fields to synthetic turf and agree to invite members of the SNWA Youth Advisory Council for a tour of Allegiant Stadium each year.</p>
