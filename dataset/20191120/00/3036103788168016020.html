      <h1>PlayStation 5 price and launch date leaked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T00:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Sony’s next-generation console, the PlayStation 5, could be arriving in November next year.</p>
      <p>This is according to a <a href="https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1196654395070582784"><b>series of tweets</b></a> from Sony tech leaker @PSErebus, who said that the upcoming console will be available in “several countries” in the holiday season of 2020, with the US getting a release date of 20 November 2020.</p>
      <p>The leak also asserted that the PlayStation 5 will launch at a price of $499, which is $100 more than the initial price of the PS4 and PS4 Pro, but still less than many expected given the hardware it will pack inside.</p>
      <p>These specifications include a bespoke octa-core AMD Ryzen chipset with a GPU based on AMD’s Radeon Navi architecture, 8K TV support, SSD storage, and 3D audio, with backwards compatibility for PS4 games and PlayStation VR hardware.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Sony has said that the PlayStation 5 will offer improved cloud gaming performance.</p>
      <h3>Previous leaks</h3>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/328177-playstation-5-controller-a-first-look.html"><b>images</b></a> filed with the Japanese Patent Office provided an early look at the PlayStation 5 controller.</p>
      <p>Sketches of the controller revealed a near-identical design to the PS4 version, albeit with an adjusted colour scheme.</p>
      <p>Another <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/320953-sony-to-launch-playstation-5-pro-alongside-standard-model-report.html"><b>leak</b> </a>from September suggested that Sony could launch a PlayStation 5 Pro model along with the standard PS5 console.</p>
