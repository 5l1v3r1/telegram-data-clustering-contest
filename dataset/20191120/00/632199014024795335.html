      <p>Domenico Mariconda has been hired as managing director of The Right Fuelcard Company, which is part of the Edenred Group.</p>
      <p>The company offers a variety of fuel card solutions and telematics services for fleet operators.</p>
      <p>Mariconda will take over from Adam Walsh, who has decided to relinquish the role.</p>
      <p>Antoine Dumurgier, chief operating officer, <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/fleet-management/future-proofing-your-fleet">fleet and mobilty solutions</a> at Edenred, said: “His strong background and expertise in the automotive services industry, in particular in telematics, will be a key asset for The Right Fuelcard Company, in particular in the development of new services beyond fuel cards.</p>
      <p>“We warmly thank Adam Walsh for his outstanding work at The Right Fuelcard Company to facilitate the integration of the company within the Edenred Group."</p>
      <p>Mariconda will develop the company’s customer base with existing solutions, but he will also be taksed with bringing in new fleet services, which will allow operators control and cost management accessibility of their fleets.</p>
      <p>He will use Edenred’s ‘beyond fuel’ strategy, recently presented by the group in the framework of its next frontier strategic plan for 2019-2022.</p>
      <p>The new appointment graduated from the University of Salerno in Italy and <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/fleet-industry-news/2017/11/03/fmg-appoints-domenico-mariconda-as-sales-and-marketing-director">went on to work in various management consultant and leadership positions</a> in the automotive, financial services and telematics industries in Europe.</p>
      <p>His previous role <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/tag/telematics">was as chief executive officer of Axon Telematics Limited.</a></p>
      <p>Mariconda added: “Given the level of companywide commitment to innovation and passion for the industry that I have already witnessed, I am excited to join The Right Fuelcard Company and its terrific teams.</p>
      <p>“We have a clear vision for the growth of our company, and I am looking forward to developing its full potential and bringing new value-added services to our clients, through digital innovation and best in class user experience.”</p>
