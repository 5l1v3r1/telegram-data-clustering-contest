      <p>Mimecast has warned that <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday"><b>Black Friday</b></a> is a busy time for cybercriminals, who are using a wide variety of scams to steal money and sensitive information from shoppers.</p>
      <p>The company said it is important that companies take appropriate measures to ensure systems and employees are protected on Black Friday.</p>
      <p>One of the scams used by cybercriminals is fake domains and subdomains which mimic legitimate ecommerce websites.</p>
      <p>“We discovered 4,000 suspicious Amazon domains and subdomains, and more than 100 live attacks targeting Amazon customers over 11 days in July,” said Segasec CEO Elad Schulman.</p>
      <p>“We can assume that Amazon was unaware of these phishing scams that were targeting their customers to steal sensitive information under the brand’s name,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Black Friday Tips</h3>
      <p>Mimecast has provided 5 tips to help consumers to safeguard themselves against Black Friday scams.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Do your shopping on a secure network – To keep your information like your name, address, credit card and devices safe, always connect to a secure network.</li>
        <li>Don’t click on pop-up ads. Go directly to the vendor’s website or even better, go to their app.</li>
        <li>Use a unique password when signing up for vendor rewards.</li>
        <li>Delete any amazing deals with attachments. Vendors will include their deals directly in an email, so don’t download an attachment, as it may contain malware.</li>
        <li>Do not forward vendor emails to your friends, family or colleagues. Have them go directly to the source.</li>
      </ol>
