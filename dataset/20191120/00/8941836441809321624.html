      <p>BEREA, Ohio (AP) - Cleveland Browns tight end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">David Njoku</a> has returned to practice after missing eight games with a broken right wrist.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> was injured in Cleveland’s victory over the New York Jets on Sept. 16, when he landed awkwardly after getting his legs taken out while trying to make a leaping catch. The Browns designated <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> for return from injured reserve on Wednesday. He’s eligible to play this Sunday against Miami, but coach Freddie Kitchens wants to assess <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> on the practice field first.</p>
      <p>In his third season out of Miami, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> has 92 career catches for 1,062 yards and nine touchdowns. Before he got hurt, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> had four catches for 37 yards and a TD this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-njoku/">Njoku</a> had 56 catches for 639 yards and four TDs in 2018.</p>
      <p>His return gives quarterback Baker Mayfield another weapon as the Browns (4-6) try to stay in the playoff hunt.</p>
