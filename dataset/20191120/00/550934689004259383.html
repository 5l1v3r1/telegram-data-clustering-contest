      <p>The proprietor's son was one of several wounded and taken to hospital in Palermo, Sicily's capital, with severe injuries.</p>
      <p>Another person injured was spotted by firefighters under the rubble and extracted alive before being transferred to a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>Employees were preparing for the New Year festivities, which traditionally include firework displays. These are particularly common in Italy's south, including Sicily, and are intended to deter evil spirits.</p>
      <p>Italian newspaper <i><a href="https://palermo.repubblica.it/cronaca/2019/11/20/news/barcellona_esplosione_in_fabbrica_di_fuochi_d_artificio_cinque_morti-241508833/?refresh_ce">La Repubblica</a></i> reported that the factory had experienced an explosion roughly 20 years ago, but that there were no deaths on that occasion.</p>
