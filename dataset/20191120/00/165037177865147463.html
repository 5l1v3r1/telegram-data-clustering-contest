      <p>The first episode of what promises to be a long saga - with considerable back and forth - has started. Although both sides seem willing to get the same result, the negotiations for <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic to come back to AC Milan will no doubt be a lengthy process.</b>  </p>
      <p>According to the Italian channel, the Swede's agent, <b>Mino Raiola</b>, was in the club's offices talking to the directors. Although at first it was thought that it could be to talk about the <b>Donnarumma's possible departure to Juve</b>, 'Sky' said that ibrahimovic was the subject of conversation.</p>
