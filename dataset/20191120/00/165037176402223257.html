      <p>This setback is another injury in his career. The discal herniation operation will be his 2nd important operation in <b>less than a year</b>, as on 4th December 2018 he had to get a toe operation.</p>
      <p>Injuries have plagued Costa since his return to Atlético Madrid. A multitude of injuries, with the culmination of operations, have prevented the forward from playing the same as he did to help Simeone's side <b>win the league</b> in 2014.</p>
