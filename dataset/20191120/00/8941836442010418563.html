      <p>LITTLEVILLE, Ala. (AP) - An Alabama sheriff says two football fans “got into it” while watching the Louisiana State University-Alabama game and one is accused of fatally shooting the other during a fight.</p>
      <p>Colbert County Sheriff Frank Williamson told the Florence TimesDaily that a group gathered to watch the Nov. 9 game at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-allen-fulkerson/">David Allen Fulkerson</a>’s home in Littleville. James Michael Roland Merritt was cheering for LSU, who beat Alabama that day 46-41.</p>
      <p>Court documents say the fight escalated when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-allen-fulkerson/">Fulkerson</a> thought Merritt called him an expletive. Williamson says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-allen-fulkerson/">Fulkerson</a> shot Merritt and added that alcohol was a “big” factor. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-allen-fulkerson/">Fulkerson</a> contends he acted in self-defense during the fight.</p>

        <p>News outlets report Merritt died Friday after nearly a week on life support. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/david-allen-fulkerson/">Fulkerson</a> is charged with murder.</p>
