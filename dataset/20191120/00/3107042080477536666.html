      <p>Another weather blast in Christchurch on Wednesday afternoon saw lightning strikes around the airport which led to aircraft being held on the tarmac.</p>
      <p>Peter Gatonyi was having a coffee outside the Antarctic Centre when he says he saw lightning strike near the Christchurch Airport control tower.</p>
      <p>"It was just a big hit of lightning it was like a massive noise it was pretty cool," he said.Â </p>
      <p>Said a Christchurch Airport spokeswoman Yvonne Densem: "I can confirm there was a lightning strike here which hit the ground in a car park near the airways control tower.</p>
      <p>"There are no reports of injury or damage.</p>
      <p>"Three aircraft were held on the taxiway, and any aircraft due to depart waited until operations resumed, which is standard practice."</p>
      <p>Passengers at the airport were warned to stay inside the terminal.</p>
      <p>An announcement was made, recommending people remain indoors until the lightning storm was over.</p>
      <p>"Airways, which manages air traffic movements, also has two aircraft sitting on taxiways awaiting clearance to move," she said.</p>
