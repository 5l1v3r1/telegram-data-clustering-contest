      <p>Buttigieg, who has experienced a significant boost in Iowa in recent weeks, is also soaring in New Hampshire, a poll released Tuesday indicated.</p>
      <p>The survey, taken November 13-18, 2019, among 255 likely Democratic primary voters, showed Buttigieg leading the pack with 25 percent support – a full ten points ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden (D) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), both of whom garnered 15 percent support.</p>
      <p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) came in fourth place with nine percent support. Due to the relatively small sampling, the margin of error is +/- 6.1 percent, although Buttigieg’s lead is outside of statistical uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) came in behind Sanders with six percent support, followed by billionaire Tom Steyer (D) with five percent support, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) with three percent each. The remaining candidates garnered two percent support or less.</p>
      <p>Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who recently closed three offices in New Hampshire, is polling at just one percent in the Granite State:</p>

      <p>The poll also showed that over three-fourths of Democrat voters, 77 percent, do not believe former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg should jump into the Democrat primary race.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/saint-anselm-poll-buttigieg-surges-to-10-percentage-point-lead-over-biden-warren-in-nh/29849189">WMUR</a>, “62 percent would discourage former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick from running and 91 percent would discourage 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton from running again.”</p>
      <p>The poll comes on the eve of the fifth Democrat primary debate in Atlanta, which will bring the top four contenders – Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg – on the same stage once again.</p>
