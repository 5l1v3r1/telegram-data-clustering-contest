      <p><b>A brand new trailer from stealthy supergroup teases a gorgeous and truly mixed reality experience.</b>As a journalist, I field pitches about a lot of XR products—often really solid ones—but every once in a while, something comes my way that I can immediately and intuitively can sense will be a <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/secrets-strangers-where-thoughts-go-social-vr-storyworld/">big</a> <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/view-xr-varjo-worlds-first-human-eye-resolution-headset/">deal</a> for the industry.</p>
      <p>Encountering Aconite and its debut game, <a href="http://www.enterholovista.com/"><i>HoloVista</i></a>,<i> </i>was one of those times. The teaser dropped today:</p>
      <p>The game is a mixed reality game for smartphones, set to launch next year. Gameplay occurs over the course of a week in a near-future world through the lens—literally—of Carmen, the game’s protagonist. She’s been sent to photograph the inside of an ornate new building at the behest of a mysterious architecture firm called Mesmer &amp; Braid.</p>
      <p>“As she continues exploring the house, she discovers that the job is not what it seems, and that the firm is up to more than just making buildings,” Aconite Co-Founder Nadya Lev said in an interview with the author.</p>
      <p>We learn about this world through objects Carmen photographs, the characters she interacts with, and what she posts to social media. Through the mechanic of a fictional social media app, we access lush 3D environments, search for clues, and solve puzzles using gyroscopic 360° views.</p>
      <p>It’s a novel use of the 360 format, allowing players to access immersive environments (what Lev calls “that magic window into another world”) while simultaneously offering them the same high degree of agency found in mobile games.</p>
      <p>“In our game, you don’t just look around the 360 environments,” Lev said. “You photograph objects in them, and post the photos to the game’s fictitious social media app. There’s a wish-fulfillment element to that: we’ve all had that moment when we see a gorgeous photo of some exotic location in our feed and think to ourselves, ‘Ugh I wish I could be there, taking that photo.’ Our playtesters sometimes tell us that they feel like they’ve traveled to another place after using the 360 camera. I knew we were on the right track when I playtested the game with a stranger I’d just met in a crowded bar. After she finished the ten-minute demo, she put down her phone, looked around the bar studiously, and said to me, ‘Give me a few moments: I need to adjust back to our reality.’”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Beyond tapping the zeitgeist, the choice to produce a game this way was motivated by Aconite’s commitment to accessibility in emerging storytelling formats.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to us that our stories are accessible to all, not just people with the latest or most expensive phones,” Lev said.” The most interesting AR effects require phones with depth cameras, and a lot of people don’t have those yet—especially not teens or those in the developing world. AR’s close cousin, 360°, on the other hand, works on any phone with a gyroscope: that is, most smartphones built since 2011.”</p>
      <p>As I’ve <a href="https://vrscout.com/news/writing-vr-definitive-guide-vr-storytelling/">written</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessedamiani/2018/06/21/vr-and-ar-mark-the-greatest-revolution-in-the-history-of-uxui-design/#213120e068a6">elsewhere</a>, I’m a firm believer that, in immersive media, space is a key driver of narrative. As is obvious in early concept art and screenshots, the Aconite team put an incredible amount of work and detail into the environments because they are the core means through which narrative unfolds.</p>
      <p>“The house is one of the most important characters in our story,” Lev said. “Our amazing narrative designer, <a href="http://www.strixwerks.com/">Strix</a>, initially described it as a ‘a strange ode to post-modernism and Western capitalism, bathed in vaporwave-y aesthetics.’ When we put together the mood board for the house, we were inspired by the opulent gaudiness of MTV Cribs, the eternal elegance of Art Deco, the calculated polish of a well-funded selfie museum, the multiplicative interiors of photographer <a href="http://www.artnet.com/artists/sandy-skoglund/">Sandy Skoglund</a>, and ’90s graphic adventure puzzle games such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-8CFun3nEw">Myst</a>.”</p>

      <p>The final product is testament to an open creative process.</p>
      <p>“There are three of us working on 360° scenes; [Aconite Co-Founder] Star St.Germain, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blakekathryn/">Blake Kathryn</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dreamfibre/">Andrew Morgan</a>,” Lev said. “Blake is known for building hyperreal, iridescent pleasure-domes in 3D. When Blake came on board, suddenly our environments began crawling with ferns and vines. A certain hazy, dreamlike glow appeared. Andrew’s personal portfolio has a lot of retro-future neon ’80s vibes. His rooms tend to look sharp, mysterious, beckoning. The artists often do a cohesion pass on each other’s scenes to make it all look like they’re all from the same world, but everyone has their own recognizable signatures as well.”</p>

      <h3>The People Behind the Game</h3>
      <p>The platform behind this game, Aconite—and in particular, its two founders—began the creative process for what would become <i>HoloVista</i> years before it took shape.</p>
      <p>“My co-founder Star and I are always asking each other: ‘what if...?’” Lev said. “That question is at the core of our collaborations and our friendship. Most often, the subject matter at hand when that question comes up has to do with media, storytelling, and technology. Our questions started out small (the first time was: ‘what if we make a <a href="http://www.thisisstar.com/work/139/">cute parallax website</a> using these hand-drawn illustrations?’), and the questions got bigger over the years.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As their creative collaboration deepened, this “what if” process took on a more vectored approach. The early success of projects like Lev's Coilhouse and St.Germain's design/development agency, ThisIsStar,<i> </i>led them toward the founding of <a href="http://www.aconite.co/">Aconite</a>, a mixed reality storytelling platform.</p>
      <p>“By the time we started Aconite, the question was something like: ‘What if we build a place where people can discover and play multimedia stories that are all part of the same giant recursive universe? Stories that weave in and out of people’s everyday life, the places they go, the various platforms they’re on, the media they consume? And what if those stories really blur the line between what’s real and what’s fiction: experiences in which you’re not sure where the story ends and life begins?’</p>
      <p>For that, the duo turned to emerging technologies.</p>
      <p>“We found that technology—XR, geolocation, haptics, photorealistic 3D creation tools, etc.—provided us with some roadmaps for achieving our aims, as did certain storytelling traditions: ARGs, role-playing. and immersive theater, to name a few,” Lev said.</p>
      <p>With these ambitions in mind, it was time for the collective to expand—and they managed to assemble an oddball dream team, with many members offering not only stellar pedigree, but rich, idiosyncratic backgrounds—and Lev is openly excited about each of them.</p>
      <p>“I love this team because everyone is a polymath,” Lev said.</p>
      <p>Co-Founder St.Germain’s background in theatre tech, for instance, gave her a unique vantage point in art directing and generally managing <i>HoloVista’s</i> 3D workflow.</p>
      <p>“Set design and lighting design are all about making a facsimile of a physical space,” Lev said. “You have to be selective about what you represent on stage; you have to pick really potent things to build that facsimile. Scenes need to be legible from afar to the audience, and sometimes abstraction achieves that better than verisimilitude. In other words, a scene needs to be iconic more than it needs to be realistic. Games are like that, too. Star’s background helps her to block out the scenes in our game, and to make sure that the scenes not only look good, but move you through a story.”</p>
      <p>And it extends deeper into the team’s ranks.</p>

      <p>“Our Lead Engineer, <a href="http://treatgames.com/">Jay Treat</a>, is a prolific game designer in the tabletop world of card, board and role-playing games,” Lev said. “At every phase of the dev process, Jay is asking thoughtful questions that a person from a more traditional coding background wouldn’t think of. Jay is really good at asking the question, “What experience do we want the player to have?” and working backwards from there. Another example: our lead game designer, <a href="https://numberless.net/">Scott Jon Siegel,</a> is a veteran of digital games. Scott has designed record-breaking casual games played by millions of people...Scott studied literature in college: they are deeply attuned to the importance of narrative, to making sure that gameplay delivers the story.”</p>
      <p>While there is no specific release date yet, <i>HoloVista</i> is slated to launch in 2020. As for Aconite, this is intended to be the first of many, from an organization that is somewhat different in structure than typical game studios.</p>
      <p>“The goal is to eventually have an interconnected universe of games across different media and using various different kinds of tech,” Lev said. “We want to build our own games, and we also want to curate interesting games that other people make. We may not look like a platform today because we currently have only one game title, but that will change. We’re always on the lookout for interesting artists, storytellers, and game-makers who are using XR or other tech.”</p>
