      <p>Premier League football is just around the corner.</p>
      <p>And it's going to be a hectic period.</p>
      <p>Games come thick and fast at this stage of the season, although with the form that the Gunners are in, that might not be a good thing right now.</p>
      <p>Next up for Arsenal is a game against struggling Southampton - a match they will be expecting to get three points from.</p>
      <p>Here we round-up the biggest and best news stories from around the Emirates in the past 24 hours in one bitesize place.</p>
      <h3>Stan Kroenke's finances</h3>
      <p>He is one of the Premier League's richest owners.</p>
      <p>But Stan Kroenke's ownership of Arsenal has never been well received by the supporters at the Emirates.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That is because the fans have never got on board with the way the American runs the club - without investing his own money into the project.</p>
      <p>But just how much has he put into Arsenal and how much has been taken out during his tenure?</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Xhaka's message</h3>
      <p>Granit Xhaka remains on the sidelines for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Not because of an injury, but because of his falling out with the club's fans ad having been stripped of the captain's armband.</p>

      <p>Spending time with Switzerland during the international break would have been a welcome escape for the midfielder.</p>
      <p>And he sent a message to the Arsenal fans following the Swiss' 6-1 win over Gibraltar on Monday night.</p>

      <h3>How Arsenal can save millions</h3>
      <p>Arsenal fans will be hoping the side are active in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>But one member of the backroom staff does not think they need to be.</p>

      <p>The Gunners are eight points adrift of the top four already this season, just 12 games in, and are in need of something to boost their hopes of finishing in the Champions League places come the end of the season.</p>
      <p>But rather than spending millions on new signings, there is something else the club can do.</p>

      <h3>Signing to save Unai Emery</h3>
      <p>If Arsenal do go into the transfer market, however, there will be no shortage of links.</p>
      <p>A number of defenders have already been linked with a move to the Emirates, including the likes of Dayot Upamecano.</p>

      <p>But should the Gunners hierarchy be looking in central midfield, rather than their back-line?</p>
      <p>There's one player, who played against them recently, that stands out as the perfect January signing.</p>
