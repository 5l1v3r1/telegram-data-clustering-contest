      <h3>Frequent flier</h3>
      <p>Pep Clotet seems genuinely enthused by the delivery of a new attacking toy, Jeremie Bela.</p>
      <p>Birmingham City’s <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">caretaker head coach</a> gave the Frenchman his debut within a couple of training sessions after his arrival at Wast Hills.</p>
      <p>Bela gave an intriguing half-hour cameo and was particularly effective when playing in his preferred left wing position.</p>
      <p>However, the 26-year-old brings both pace and versatility to the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues </a>squad, with Clotet noting the wealth of attacking possibilities.</p>
      <p>“That makes me happy because I think he is a player who can help us, he adds options to us, the fact we are using two forwards to attack and we can turn that into three forwards to attack,” Clotet noted after the Fulham game.</p>

      <p>“That’s a massive thing tactically for us, it opens a massive range of tactical opportunities that I really like.”</p>
      <p>Blues writer Brian Dick looked at some of those opportunities which have become available to the Spaniard - keeping as consistent an XI as possible to limit the variables.</p>
      <h3>Lone drummer</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> have called St Andrew’s ‘home’ since 1906 - and the old place has survived two World Wars, one World Cup and every one of the joys and sorrows that comes with being a Bluenose.</p>
      <p>It was renamed 18 months ago and while it might officially be St Andrew’s Trillion Trophy Stadium, for everyone it’s still St Ans, sacred ground where the faithful come for collective worship.</p>
      <p>There has been talk of modernisation, even of a move away to another purpose-built venue - but for now Blues and St Andrew’s remain inextricably linked as the old place continues to evolve into the modern era.</p>
      <p>But like every ground there are areas for development and we asked Blues fans: “What improvements would you like to see made to St Andrew’s?”</p>
      <p>The question generated more than 200 replies and while there is an element of consistency about many, with the Main Stand clearly needing some attention, there’s also some real fresh ideas too.</p>
      <p>Here’s a selection of your suggestions.</p>
      <p><b>Morgan Meredith:</b> Increase the paddocks and fill all the corners, when we score play a goal tune to hype the atmosphere up and get the flag people to wave the big flags whilst the goal tune is being played . Plus bring the drums and some blue and white flags to bring more atmosphere like how Bristol City do it</p>
      <p><b>Cameron Harris:</b> Atmosphere like we used to have maybe ticket prices come down £10 adults and kids for quid every game. New stand and i know it would cost a lot but would be better as well as the big thing away fans mention is the old stand needs to be done up which we all agree</p>

      <h3>Coming to Town</h3>
      <p>Birmingham City resume their Championship campaign on Saturday with a trip to rejuvenated Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p>The Terriers were little short of terrible at the start of the season after dropping out of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, the Cowley brothers Danny and Nicky have steadied the listing ship and this weekends jaunt to the John Smith’s Stadium is rather more difficult than it might have been a couple of months ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues </a>go there hoping to have discovered the secret of footballing alchemy during the international break, how to turn base goal-scoring chances into actual goals.</p>
      <p>We spoke to Huddersfield’s <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/all-about/huddersfield-town-fc">ExaminerLive </a>sports editor Mel Booth for an insight into what to expect.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Have the Cowleys turned Huddersfield’s season around?</h4>
      <p>Most definitely. Town were careering towards a second successive relegation, having taken just one point from the opening six Championship matches, when the Cowley brothers were appointed.</p>
      <p>Town had also suffered a miserable Carabao Cup exit at the hands of the Cowleys’ Lincoln City and confidence within the squad was completely shot.</p>
      <p>Even though Town lost their first two matches under the Cowleys, leaving the club with a record of just one win in 35 matches, there were signs of improvement and that proved the case as they went on a seven-match unbeaten run, including four wins, to lift themselves out of the Championship relegation zone.</p>
      <h4>What have you made of Birmingham’s season so far?</h4>
      <p>Looking in from the outside, the biggest problem seems to be consistency for the Blues - it’s been win or lose pretty much throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>Those two away wins at Brentford and, particularly, high-riding Charlton stand out, however, and will be a worry to Town fans, especially with Birmingham looking to recover from successive defeats.</p>

      <h3>Transfer recap</h3>
      <p>The January transfer window is now just six weeks away- and Birmingham City have drawn up shortlists of targets ahead of the turn of the year.</p>
      <p>Blues have already added to their squad in recent weeks, with attacker Jeremie Bela arriving on a three-year deal.</p>
      <p>Both caretaker head coach Pep Clotet and director Edward Zheng have faced questions, from the media and supporters respectively, about what we can expect in the January sales.</p>
      <p>This is what they have said.</p>
