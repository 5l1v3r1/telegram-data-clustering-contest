      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This week, we saw a sharp decline in ripple below the $0.2500 support area against the US Dollar. Moreover, XRP/USD broke the $0.2450 support area and settled well below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Finally, the price tested the $0.2400 support area and recently started an upside correction. It broke the $0.2450 and $0.2480 levels to start the current correction wave. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $0.2500 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Ripple is now trading above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2660 high to $0.2400 swing low. On the upside, there is a strong resistance near the $0.2580 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2660 high to $0.2400 swing low seems to be preventing gains. The main resistance on the upside is near the $0.2600 level.</p>
      <p>More importantly, this week’s crucial bearish trend line is intact with resistance near $0.2600 on the same chart. Therefore, a clear break above the $0.2580 and $0.2600 resistance levels might push the price back into a bullish zone.</p>
      <p>In the mentioned bullish scenario, the price is likely to rise towards the $0.2720 and $0.2750 resistance levels. Conversely, the price may perhaps struggle to break the $0.2600 resistance and it could start a fresh decline.</p>
      <p>An initial support is near the $0.2520 level, followed by $0.2500. Any further losses might lead the price back towards the $0.2400 support area in the near term.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/">chart</a>, ripple price is nicely correcting above the $0.2520 resistance. Having said that, the bulls are clearly facing an uphill task near the $0.2580 and $0.2600 resistance levels. If they fail to gain momentum above $0.2600, the price could resume its decline.</p>
