      <p>Google Earth is getting a new content creation feature set. From a report:<i> You'll now be able to make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/google-earth-gets-content-creation-tools-for-geography-focused-presentations/">presentations using Google's vast 3D Earth imagery and point-of-interest information</a>. It's sort of like a geography-focused Powerpoint. Back in 2017, Google Earth was completely rebuilt from a desktop application to a WebGL-based browser app at earth.google.com/web. Starting today, on the left side of the website, you'll see a new "Projects" button, which will let you create a presentation. Just like a Google Doc or Sheet or Slide, these Google Earth Projects get saved as files on your Google Drive. And like a normal presentation, you can create slides and attach text, images, and videos.</i></p>
