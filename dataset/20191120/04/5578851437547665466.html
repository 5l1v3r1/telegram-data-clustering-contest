        <b>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani met with Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa on Tuesday and told him that “Without a doubt, the United States’ military presence and base in Afghanistan has boosted up its issues,” Mehr News Agency reported.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We all know that the solution is the cooperation of all groups and different ethnic groups in determining the future of the country, and it is the people of Afghanistan who can decide without the interference of foreign powers,” Rouhani said.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, Rouhani called for all-out efforts to broaden the range of cooperation between Iran and Pakistan.</p>
      <p>"Close relations between the Iranian and Pakistani nations is a valuable asset that can be used to further develop relations in different fields of mutual interest,” he said.</p>
      <p>"Tehran-Islamabad relations must develop beyond their current state,” he added.</p>
      <p>Referring to a long-delayed gas pipeline project between the two countries, Rouhani said, "The Islamic Republic of Iran has laid the Peace Pipelines to the Pakistani border and we are completely ready to boost cooperation in this regard.”</p>
      <p>On the importance of security in borders, Rouhani said: "Fortunately, we are witnessing positive developments in this regard and we are confident that with determination on both sides, we can well confront smuggling and smugglers.”</p>
      <p>Bajwah said, “No country can undermine the good relations between Pakistan and Iran.”</p>
      <p>“Pakistan will use all potentials and different methods to further deepen the trade and economic cooperation, and is ready to promote its current cooperation,” he said.</p>
