      <h1>Forest old boy keen to see his own City Ground dynasty as defender delivers some fighting talk</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds will return to action at Bristol City this weekend following the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <h3>STAND AND DELIVER</h3>
      <p>Owner <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> has had a key influence on the plans to redevelop Nottingham Forest’s City Ground.</p>
      <p>Following the initial announcement earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">fresh images of how the stadium could look</a> were released last week as a planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Phase one of the project centres on the Peter Taylor Stand, which will be rebuilt to an increased capacity of 10,000 and accommodate new facilities such as a museum and club shop.</p>
      <p>And in the intervening months between the plans being unveiled and going to public consultation, Marinakis has helped to instigate some “subtle changes” to the Peter Taylor Stand proposals.</p>

      <h3>RISING SON</h3>
      <p>Lars Bohinen played a key role in Nottingham Forest's rapid rise from Division One strugglers to Premier League contenders in the 90s and is now hoping his son can do the same 25 years later.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian midfielder had a special relationship with the City Ground faithful and still looks back on his time playing for the Reds with great affection.</p>
      <p>Now managing Aelsund, Lars has guided his team to the top division where he will come up against his talented son, although Bohinen senior is hoping Emil can use his form as a stepping stone to English football.</p>
      <p>Emil currently has four goals and six assists in the Eliteserien and his dad feels he is well suited to the rigours of Championship football.</p>

      <h3>DAWS OPENING</h3>
      <p>Skipper <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/michael-dawson">Michael Dawson</a> jokes he has had to be “held back”, so keen is he to get back out on the pitch for Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>But the defender knows there are no guarantees he will walk straight into Sabri Lamouchi’s line-up after recovering from a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Dawson had started each of the Reds’ opening nine league games of the season before being forced off <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-stoke-3370516">in the 3-2 victory over Stoke City</a> at the end of September.</p>
      <p>Since then, he has watched on as Forest have maintained their push towards the top of the Championship table, with summer signing Chema and Tobias Figueiredo fighting it out to partner Joe Worrall in defence.</p>

      <h3>INJURY LATEST</h3>
      <p>Nottingham Forest make the trip to Ashton Gate on Saturday looking to make it three wins on the spin.</p>
      <p>It will be two weeks since their last game by the time they kick off against Bristol City, but Sabri Lamouchi’s men will be hoping to carry the momentum from the win over Derby last time out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> start the game above this weekend’s opponents on goal difference alone, with both sides sat on 28 points, although the Reds do have a game in hand.</p>
      <p>But Lee Johnson’s men go into the game with their injury worries easing.</p>
