      <h1>Don’t wanna spend on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars edition?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:59:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p>Samsung recently <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/19/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-kylo-ren-star-wars/">announced</a> a special, Star Wars edition of the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus">Galaxy Note 10+</a> for select markets, although we aren’t sure if the awesome-looking variant will make its way across to Malaysian shores. Part of the special edition is a red S Pen, red accents on the body of the phone, along with First Order and Star Wars logos printed on the back of the device.</p>

      <p>It will reportedly go for around RM5,404 in December 2019, but if you’re not keen to pay the more premium price (likely more if you’re buying a grey import set), we’ve found a way to still still deck out your Note 10+ in Star Wars colours. <i><a href="https://www.ytechb.com/download-samsung-galaxy-note-10-star-wars-wallpapers/">Ytechb.com</a></i> has posted a high-resolution <i>The Last Jedi Kylo Ren Mask</i> wallpaper that appears to be identical to Samsung’s Star Wars edition.</p>
      <p>Do note that we aren’t sure if this is a leaked version of the wallpaper, or if someone did a very good job at replicating the graphic—nonetheless, it still looks pretty cool. The wallpaper is 1440 × 3040, which fits perfectly with the resolution of the Note 10+’s Quad HD+ screen.</p>

      <p>You can download the wallpaper on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UB9kff2q-x2pNdetrPG1h1NpMuQ47Lpd">Google Drive</a> or <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DEvHehjsJQmJ3gsy7">Google Photos</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Note 10+ Star Wars edition will be available in select markets starting in December of 2019, with U.S. pricing stated as US$1,299 (about RM5,404). Sales will begin on 13 December on Amazon, selected Best Buy outlets, Microsoft Stores, Samsung.com and Samsung Experience stores.</p>
      <p>There doesn’t seem to be concrete news regarding the internal configurations of the device just yet, but it could be a 512GB storage variant—the rest of the specs should tally with a standard Note 10+. If it doesn’t come to Malaysia, you can always check with reputable dealers to see if any of the Star Wars-themed smartphones are being imported to Malaysia.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the wallpaper should be a decent enough stop-gap.</p>
