      <h1>Pengrowth Energy: Deal Or No Deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:16:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jim Wallingford</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shareholders are being offered C$.05 per share.</li>
        <li>Creditors can't wipe the smiles off their faces.</li>
        <li>Cona Resources is buying the company at a distressed price.</li>
        <li>Pengrowth will be debt-free with C$2.3 billion in tax pools.</li>
        <li>Look for a higher offer as the bid here is too low.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On November 1, Cona Resources offered to buy Pengrowth Energy Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGHEF">OTCQX:PGHEF</a>) (PGF.TO) for $C740 million. Shareholders were offered the generous sum of C$.05 per share or C$28 million plus a contingent payout related to a legal matter.</p>
      <p>That legal matter is a deposit of C$18 million paid by Grand Valley Resources for the purchase of some Alberta oil assets for C$180 million in 2017 (<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/pengrowth-arranges-300-million-sale-of-production-assets/article35653014/">Globe &amp; Mail 7/17</a>). Since the deal fell through, Pengrowth is asking the courts to release the $18 million. So, doing the math, 18 divided by 560 equals about C$.03 per share, 60% better than the current firm offer. Now we're excited!</p>
      <p>Waterous Energy Fund bought Cona in 2018, offering C$2.55 per share for the shares it didn't already own, a 31% premium. For Pengrowth, not so lucky. Waterous specializes in picking up distressed oil companies with attractive assets, investing more capital and turning them around. Pengrowth? Check! Here's what it bought:</p>

      <p>As you can see from the above numbers, this deal looks pretty solid for Waterous. It is buying proven oil reserves valued at C$1.6 billion for C$740 million. This number doesn't include Groundbirch, so the NPV10 would be even larger. And, with the debt gone, Waterous is going to see about C$90 million per year in earnings before depletion, depreciation and impairments, which are non-cash items. And the huge tax pool means cash flow is maximized. This assumes a status quo outlook. Some reduction in expenses is probably in store as the two companies combine. There will certainly be increased capex, boosting production and profits further. And, if oil prices rise, the results will look even fatter.</p>
      <p>So looking at the whole picture, there's probably going to be a higher offer. One obvious source: Seymour Schulich. He owns 170 million shares (about 30%) as of July. In an Early Warning report dated March 23, 2016, on Sedar (<a href="http://www.sedar.com/">www.sedar.com</a>), Nevada Capital Corporation reported buying 26 million shares, adding to its previous holdings of 44 million shares. Mr. Schulich's foundation also reported holding 10 million shares. I can find no record of the cost of these 54 million shares. I've estimated he paid C$1.40 for the 26 million and have calculated his purchases after that. Here is a rough guess:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>54 mil initial holdings as per Sedar report dated March 23, '16 <b>C$100 million</b></li>
        <li>26 million bought March '16 <b>C$36 million</b></li>
        <li>Subsequent buys through July '19 (source: SEDI) <b>C$128 million</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Total: C$264 million</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Obviously, with two of the amounts being guesses, the total could be off by many millions. But it's pretty safe to say that it's C$200 million plus. The question that comes to mind is: will Mr. Schulich write off over C$115 million, given his firm belief that Lindbergh is a gem? I think not.</p>
      <p>There could also be other opportunistic investors that like the looks of the assets here. A little more for the shareholders and still makes a decent return on investment. Whatever happens, this is not a done deal.</p>
      <p>

          <b>Caveat Emptor (x 10)</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>There is substantial risk in buying this now. A total loss could result. This is a Vegas-style speculation. On the other hand, it could be a double in a short time. You're paying a nickel for something that supposedly will return a nickel if the current deal completes. The 100% downside is if the deal falls through and the "alternative transaction" kicks in:</p>
      <blockquote>In the event of an Alternative Transaction, there is no expectation that Pengrowth shareholders will receive any consideration in exchange for their Shares and Shareholders are therefore encouraged to vote in favor of the Transaction"</blockquote>
