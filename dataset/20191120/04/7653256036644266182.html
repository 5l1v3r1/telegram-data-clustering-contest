      <p>In the US markets, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/gold-prices">gold prices</a> rose on Wednesday on heightened worries that a Sino-US trade deal could hit a snag after President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs on Beijing as the US Senate passed a bill supporting Hong Kong anti-government protesters.</p>
      <p>Spot gold rose 0.2 per cent to $1,474.42 per ounce at 0144 GMT, reported Reuters. US gold futures were little changed at $1,474.80 per ounce.</p>
      <p>According to technical charts, spot gold may rise into a range of $1,480-$1,485 per ounce, driven by a wave c, said a Reuters technical analyst.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the metal has more or less broken $1,474. The next resistance will be at $1,480, the 50 per cent retracement of the downtrend from $1,515.41 to $1,445.18.</p>
      <p>A break below $1,462 could confirm the completion of the bounce and the resumption of the downtrend. On the daily chart, gold seems to be edging up towards $1,500, the channel line resistance.</p>
