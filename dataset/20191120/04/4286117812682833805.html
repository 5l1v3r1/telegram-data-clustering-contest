      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Shiv Sena has said govt formation in Maharashtra has been finalised</li>
        <li>Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the obstacles of the past 10-15 are not there anymore</li>
        <li>NCP and Congress will be holding a meeting on govt formation today</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Shiv Sena has once again asserted that they will form the government in Maharashtra before the end of this month and the process to finalise the modalities will be completed in 5-6 days.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Wednesday, "The process to form the government will complete in next 5-6 days and a popular and strong government will be formed in Maharashtra before December. The process is going on."</p>
      <p>"All the obstructions which were there in last 10-15 days regarding the government formation in Maharashtra are not there anymore. You will get to know by 12 pm tomorrow that all the obstructions are gone. The picture will be clear by tomorrow afternoon," said Raut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/have-170-mlas-will-form-govt-by-december-shiv-sena-1619894-2019-11-17">Sanjay Raut has maintained that Shiv Sena has the support of 170 MLAs</a> in the 288-member Maharashtra assembly where a party needs 145 MLAs to stake claim to form the government.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena won 56 seats in the Maharashtra assembly elections that it fought in an alliance with the BJP. While BJP is the single largest party with 105 MLAs, they refused to form the government failing to accept Shiv Sena's power-sharing demands.</p>
      <p>Now, Shiv Sena is in talks with arch rivals NCP and Congress while the Sharad Pawar-led alliance remains non-committal towards showing support to the saffron party.</p>
      <p>On Monday, after holding talks with Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, Pawar said the two of them discussed various aspects of the NCP-Congress alliance, the political situation in Maharashtra. Pawar said any decision on government formation will have to be discussed with other allies.</p>
      <p>He also said that the BJP and Shiv Sena should find their own path in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/congress-ncp-meet-shiv-sena-maharashtra-government-formation-1620681-2019-11-20">senior leaders of the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are expected to meet on Wednesday</a> to firm up a stand and hammer out the issues on forming government in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra was placed under the President's rule on November 12 after no party or alliance staked claim to form government in the state. A day after the President's rule was imposed, the Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP leaders held hectic parleys to work out a CMP for government formation.</p>
