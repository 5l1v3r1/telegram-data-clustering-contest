      <h1>Ex-boyfriend of missing NJ woman sent her angry texts on night she disappeared</h1>

      <p>The ex-boyfriend of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-goes-missing-after-visit-to-psychic/">the New Jersey woman missing for nearly three weeks</a> sent her a slew of angry, expletive-laced messages the night she disappeared, prosecutors said in court Tuesday.</p>
      <p>John Ozbilgen fired off at least 10 texts and Facebook messages to his ex, Stephanie Parze, on Oct. 30, telling her “she always has to make their relationship suck” and calling her a “f–king c—t,” Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Caitlin Sidley said, <a href="https://www.app.com/story/news/local/courts/2019/11/19/freehold-missing-woman-stephanie-parze-john-ozbilgen-free-from-jail/4205620002/">according to the Asbury Park Press</a>.</p>
      <p>Parze, a 25-year-old nanny from Freehold Township, on Sept. 23 had filed a simple assault domestic violence complaint against Ozbilgen, the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>Detectives noticed marks around Ozbilgen’s neck when they were investigating Parze’s disappearance, Sidley said.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old stockbroker was named as a “person of interest” in Parze’s disappearance, though he hasn’t been charged in the missing persons case.</p>
      <p>The revelations came as Sidley tried to convince Superior Court Judge Paul Escandon to keep Ozbilgen in jail <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/11/missing-nj-womans-ex-charged-with-child-porn-eyed-in-her-disappearance/">on unrelated child pornography charges</a>. In the end, the judge ordered his release on bail.</p>
      <p>Investigators executed a search warrant on Ozbilgen’s phone, finding at least nine images of children as young as 3 being sexually abused, Sidley said, <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2019/11/ex-boyfriend-of-missing-woman-sent-her-angry-texts-the-night-before-she-disappeared-prosecutor-says.html">according to NJ.com</a>.</p>
      <p>He’s previously been accused of domestic violence by at least two other women this year.</p>

      <p>“[Ozbilgen’s] violence against women is borne out in his history, as well as pornography he seeks out of very young children. There are no conditions that can keep this community safe,” Sidley said.</p>
      <p>His attorney, Robert Honecker Jr., said his client denied the child porn charges while acknowledging he remained a person of interest in Parze’s disappearance.</p>
      <p>“My client maintains that he did not have these things on his phone intentionally,” Honecker said after the hearing. “That count in and of itself didn’t rise to the level that he should be kept in custody … He’s been held 11 days in jail on this.”</p>
      <p>Authorities have recently <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/hunt-for-missing-new-jersey-woman-stephanie-parze-moves-to-staten-island-park/">searched a wooded area on Staten Island</a> several times in the hopes of finding Parze, though they haven’t publicly said what, if anything, was found. Ozbilgen previously lived on Staten Island.</p>
      <p>Parze vanished after a girls’ night out to see a psychic in New Brunswick on Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>Her parents, Edward and Sharlene Parze, said they found her car in her driveway and her phone in her couch — but haven’t heard from her since a Snapchat photo she sent her mother while driving home the night of the outing.</p>
      <p>The family is planning a search for Parze this week in Freehold.</p>
