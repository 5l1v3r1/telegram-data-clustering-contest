      <p>The Indian archers won’t be able to compete in the upcoming South Asian Games (SAG) in Nepal due to the suspension of the Archery Association of India (AAI) by the sports global body.</p>
      <p>AAI was suspended earlier this year after it failed to follow World Archery’s (WA) guidelines by appointing two parallel bodies.</p>
      <p>According to a report in The Times of India, the decision to not allow Indian archers to compete at the SAG 2019 was taken during a meeting of the South Asian Archery Federation (SAAF) in Dhaka.</p>
      <p>The reason cited is the Indian federation’s suspension by WA.</p>
      <p>“Indian Archery Association has already been suspended by World Archery from participation in all international and regional tournaments,” the report quoted minutes of the SAAF meeting as saying. “The SAAF Board decided to adhere to the directive given by the World Archery in participation of archers of India in any competitions registered under World Archery. The Board has unanimously decided not to permit the archers of AAI in the forthcoming 13th South Asian Games to be held in Nepal as the members of World Archery are compelled to adhere to the guidelines.”</p>
      <p>The suspension has wide-ranging repercussions including the fact that Indian archers of the likes of Deepika Kumar, Atanu Das among others will compete at the Asian archery championships, an Olympic qualifier, under world archery’s flag and not AAI. In addition, the medals won by the contingent will not be added as India’s but added to world archery’s tally.</p>
      <p>Indian men’s recurve team has already booked their Tokyo 2020 berth but their women counterparts are yet to qualify.</p>
