      <h1>Volkswagen ID.Space Vizzion Concept Previews A Sleek Future</h1>
      <h2>VW's new all-electric concept has series production potential.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:30:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Following the reveal of the production-spec ID.3 all-electric hatchback, which replaces the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/volkswagen/e-golf">e-Golf</a>, Volkswagen continues to expand the ID-branded family with a new concept also built on the MEB platform. Meet the ID.Space Vizzion Concept, which is making its global debut at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles on the sidelines of the 2019 LA Auto Show. This four-seat cross between a Gran Turismo and SUV could potentially become a production model if there's enough positive reaction.</p>
      <p>With 50:50 weight distribution, the ID.Space Vizzion is powered by a 275-horsepower, rear-mounted electric motor that receives its juice from an 82 kWh lithium-ion battery. There are power electronics at both front and rear axles to control the high-voltage between the motor and battery. VW claims that the concept can be further fitted with a 101-hp coaxial drive that increases total output to 335 hp. VW's 4Motion system enables permanent all-wheel drive. Acceleration is brisk, going from 0 to 60 mph in 5.0 seconds while top speed is electronically limited to 109 mph.</p>

      <p>On the EPA cycle, projected range on a single charge is 300 miles. VW says it gave designers and engineers exterior styling freedom but optimizing aerodynamics was still essential. Drag coefficient was reduced to 0.24 while air flows under a horizontal panel between the headlights and over the hood before being directed to the rear. That hood's high-gloss black paint finish is intended to help it blend in better with the tinted windshield and panoramic sunroof. Also notice the unique vents in the bumper and hood panel, designed not only to look cool but are also functional in terms of improved air flow.</p>
      <p>A slender white light stripe stretching to each side up front has an illuminated VW logo. This stripe then extends across the front and into the fenders and side, continuing all the way to the rear. Honeycomb-style LED daytime running lights and X-shaped turn signals are also nice touches.</p>
      <p>And because aerodynamics is key, conventional door handles were left out, replaced by illuminated touch surfaces that light up once the Keyless Advanced function detects someone approaching with a key or a synchronized mobile key on their smartphone. Simply make contact with the door's surface and it will open.</p>

      <p>A set of 22-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, designed with five turbine-style aero flaps also help with airflow. Meanwhile, the roof spoiler opens at the bottom and works in conjunction with the spoiler lip and diffuser to reduce turbulence at the rear which helps improve range. The Saintly Blue Pearl Effect paint contrasts nicely with the black roof.</p>
      <p>The interior's main objectives are to make maximum use of space, utilize sustainable materials, and offer user-friendly controls. A traditional cockpit is gone, replaced by an all-digital cockpit with a 15.6-inch touchscreen that incorporates all vital information. Between the seats is a fold-out center console with enough space for cupholders, USB-C ports, and general storage. Instead of cloth or traditional leather upholstery, VW went with a new AppleSkin material developed in-house. In fact, AppleSkin replaces plastic decorative inserts in all ID models. A multifunction steering wheel and a new right-hand steering column switch that replaces the shift lever, round out the advanced interior.</p>

      <p>There's also a new feature called ID.Light, a system that highlights instructions sent by the driver assistance systems and navigation. For example, it informs drivers of battery charging status, an incoming phone call, navigation instructions, and numerous other voice control.</p>
      <p>Given that the ID.Space Vizzion has a working electric motor and battery, driver assist systems, and functional exterior aerodynamics, chances are high that VW is seriously considering putting this car into production.</p>
