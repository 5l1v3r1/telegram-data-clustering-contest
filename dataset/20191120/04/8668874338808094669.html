      <h1>The South African sevens legend who is 'absolutely convinced' about becoming a Springbok</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:01:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>He’s become one of South Africa’s most lethal weapons on the World Rugby Sevens Series, but things haven’t panned out so smoothly for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/seabelo-senatla/">Seabelo Senatla</a> in the XVs version of rugby.</p>
      <p>With a whopping 224 tries in 203 matches for the Blitzboks on the world sevens circuit, the 26-year-old flyer sits in fourth place on the series’ all-time try-scorer list, trailing only England’s Dan Norton (338 tries), Kenya’s Collins Injera (271) and Argentina’s Santiago Gomez Cora (230).</p>
      <p>Senatla’s nose for the tryline in the abbreviated format of the game has yielded plenty of international success.</p>

      <p>He played a key role in South Africa’s back-to-back World Sevens series titles in 2017 and 2018, claimed a gold medal at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> and won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
      <p>However, despite being apart of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/western-province">Western Province</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers">Stormers</a> set-ups since 2014, Senatla hasn’t been able to replicate that success in the game’s traditional XVs format.</p>
      <p>Injuries and sevens commitments restricted him from pushing for higher honours beyond <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> and the Currie Cup, although he did win a solitary appearance for a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> A side against the touring French Barbarians in 2017.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, that hasn’t quelled his desire to represent the Springboks at test level and put his 2020 Tokyo Olympics ambitions on hold, according to new Stormers coach John Dobson.</p>
      <p>“Seabelo is absolutely convinced that he can become a Springbok,” he said at a media briefing in Bellville on Monday.</p>
      <p>That is his focus. He is actually discounting quite a bit in terms of wages to be able to do that. I hope he makes it. He is really keen.”</p>
      <p>It’s a big ask for Senatla to crack into the Springboks set-up, especially considering the impact incumbent wingers <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks/players/makazole-mapimpi/">Makazole Mapimpi</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/toulouse/players/cheslin-kolbe/">Cheslin Kolbe</a> had on the South African side en route to their World Cup title tilt in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Senatla will join Stormers teammate <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/stormers/players/ruhan-nel/">Ruhan Nel</a> in the Blitzboks’ opening two tournaments of the 2019-20 World Rugby Sevens Series in Dubai and Cape Town next month before fully committing himself to the upcoming <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> campaign.</p>
      <p>Dobson said Nel could leave the squad later in the season if he is selected for the Olympics in August.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got Angelo Davids, Ruhan and Seabelo. Angelo is staying with the Sevens for the whole season, while Seabelo and Ruhan will join us at our pre-season camp after the Cape Town Sevens,” Dobson said.</p>
      <p>“Seabelo will be with us full-time. If he gets selected, Ruhan will go to the Olympics and miss the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> playoffs.”</p>
      <p>The Stormers open their 2020 <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> season against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes">Hurricanes</a> at Newlands in Cape Town on February 1.</p>
