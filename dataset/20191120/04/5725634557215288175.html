        <li>The three-month average of starts also made a new expansion high.</li>
        <li>Since interest rates have been declining through most of this year, expect the housing rebound to continue.</li>
        <li>The positive news in these long leading indicators is strong evidence that the economy will strengthen in 2020.</li>

          <b>Introduction</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>This morning’s release of housing permits and starts shows that the housing rebound continues.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Important metrics made new expansion highs</b>
      </p>

      <p>Starts increased, although not to an expansion high. More importantly, the more leading and less volatile permits *did* increase to a new expansion high:On a three-month average basis, starts also made a new expansion high.</p>

      <p>When we turn to the even less volatile single-family permits and starts, we see the same thing:The rebound in single-family permits is particularly impressive.</p>

      <p>Only once in the past 50 years has a recession started after housing bottomed. That was the producer-led 2001 recession, which started 8 months after the bottom, and there the pre-recession rebound was less than 10%:By contrast, since their recent bottom 6 months ago, housing permits have rebounded by more than 15% as of this month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Expect the rebound to continue</b>
      </p>
      <p>Further, because interest rates lead housing, usually by about 6 months or so, and interest rates have been declining all year until recently, we can expect the housing data to continue to improve. The below graph is one I have run many times over the past 5+ years, showing the YoY change in mortgage interest rates (blue, inverted) vs. the YoY% change in single-family permits (red):</p>

      <p>
        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both mortgage interest rates and housing permits and starts are long leading indicators. While it isn’t conclusive (no single indicator is), this is a very strong argument that recession risk is receding, particularly as we go through 2020.</p>
