        <b>The second deputy chief executive, Mohammad Mohaqiq, while visiting the northern province of Jawzjan with a group of Afghan politicians and MPs, accused the Independent Election Commission, or IEC, of favoring President Ghani’s campaign team, and described the situation as “critical.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mohaqiq held a meeting with the first vice president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, who has been living in Jawzjan over the past few months.</p>
      <p>Mohaqiq also accused the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) of taking bribes and said the country will not achieve peace unless the crisis is prevented.</p>
      <p>The delegation which visited Jawzjan mostly discussed peace efforts and the election during their meeting with the first vice president.</p>
      <p>“They are really taking the election to a crisis. There is no rule and regulation. The commission wants to implement the government’s order,” Mohaqiq said.</p>
      <p>At one point, Mohaqiq directly called out UNAMA chief Tadamichi Yamamoto and accused him of favoring a certain election campaign team.</p>
      <p>UNAMA has not commented on Mohaqiq’s remarks but recently it has rejected some allegations against it as “baseless.”</p>
      <p>At the same event, Dostum criticized the “use of security forces” against protestors in some northern provinces and warned that such acts will result in anger among the people.</p>
      <p>“As far I know, the Defense and Interior ministries did not order the attack on protesters (in north), but they did it under the order of Ashraf Ghani,” Dostum said.</p>
      <p>Dostum, meanwhile, said that he has never been against peace and that he has always stressed that war is not the solution.</p>
      <p>Dostum and Mohaqiq also welcomed the release of Anas Haqqani and two other members of the Haqqani network.</p>
