      <p>The Club can today announce that Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez have been relieved of their duties," read a statement on the club website.</p>
      <p>"Chairman, Daniel Levy, said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests</p>
      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>"We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.</p>
      <p>"We shall provide an update on new coaching staff in due course."</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is the runaway favourite to take over the role from the Argentine, with some reports suggesting that a deal with the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager is close.</p>
      <p>Spurs are in a terrible run of form, with just three wins from their 12 Premier League matches so far.</p>

      <h3>The perfect January signing</h3>
      <p>Tottenham fans will be hoping to see the team busy in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Fourteenth place in the Premier League after 12 games is not exactly what the supporters would have been expecting or hoping for ahead of the campaign.</p>

      <p>And if they are to get out of their current predicament and move up the table, new signings could help that.</p>

      <h3>Lo Celso boost</h3>
      <p>Tottenham are hoping Giovani Lo Celso can play a big role between now and the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Lo Celso joined on a season-long loan from Real Betis on transfer deadline day and Spurs have an option to make the move permanent in January or the summer.</p>

      <p>The midfielder was signed as a potential replacement for Christian Eriksen, who, although did not leave in the summer, is expected to move on next summer.</p>
      <p>And Spurs have been handed a boost in terms of Lo Celso's ability to make an impact between now and the rest of the season.</p>

      <h3>Blame the players</h3>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood has defended his successor Mauricio Pochettino from criticism, stating that the players must carry the responsibility for the club's struggles.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> return from the international break with an 11-point deficit to make up in the hunt for Champions League football again next season, with the gap potentially being extended this weekend if they cannot defeat West Ham, form which has led to Pochettino losing his job.</p>

      <p>Before the sacking was announced many thought that the next match would be do or die for Pochettino, with Sherwood being no different.</p>
