      <p>MUMBAI: Noted para-athlete Deepa Malik, the only Indian woman to have won a medal (silver) at the Paralympic Games (Rio 2016), said it is good to see star cricketers opening up about the mental issues which are part of high-pressure nature of sports today.</p>
      <p>"It was great to hear a highly successful cricketer like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> talking about the mental issues," Malik told TOI on the sidelines of launch of a new course at the International Institute of Sports Management to help working professionals to deal with failures.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> has become very demanding and that puts cricketers under tremendous pressure to perform. This leads them to depression like situations and they find it difficult to deal with it," said the 50-year-old Khel Ratna awardee. "I would suggest them to take a break from the monotonous routine. Give free time to themselves which will do wonders for them," she added.</p>
      <p>Malik stressed that adapting to new changes and rising to face new challenges is crucial not only in sports but in all walks of life. Giving her example, Malik said: "I prepared for javelin for almost five years and then just a year before the Rio Olympics, I found out that javelin in my category was dropped and I had to now compete in shot put. But I did not lose heart and in a short time of 11 months, I prepared so well that I ended up winning silver in Rio," she recalled.</p>
      <p>Former India <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/hockey">hockey</a> captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Viren-Rasquinha">Viren Rasquinha</a> felt dealing with failures is a must if one needs to succeed. "In hockey, we lose more than we win and one needs to learn to deal with it," Rasquinha observed.</p>
