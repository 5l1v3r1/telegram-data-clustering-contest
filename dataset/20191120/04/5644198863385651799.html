      <p>MADRID: Former Spanish footballer Sergio Contreras, who played for Marseille, was arrested on Tuesday (Nov 19) on suspicion of heading a drugs ring, police said following a string of raids in southern Spain.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old was arrested in the seaside town of Estepona during a string of simultaneous police raids which also took place in Malaga, Granada and Sevilla, police said.</p>

      <p>"Some 20 people were arrested. They were in possession of nearly a tonne of hashish and 700,000 euros (US$775,000)," a police spokeswoman said, indicating the operation was "still under way".</p>
      <p>Speaking to AFP, a police source said Contreras was "in charge" of the smuggling outfit.</p>
      <p>"He was the head of the organisation," the source told AFP, saying the raids had also turned up various weapons, including sidearms and rifles, as well as paperwork.</p>
      <p>Contreras is currently being held at a police station in Malaga.</p>
      <p>After starting out with Malaga, Contreras then spent several seasons at Marseille before moving to Greek side Aris Thessaloniki in a career which took him to Azerbaijan, Germany, Bolivia and the US.</p>
      <p>The police operation was dubbed "Operation MasKoke" in a nod to the former striker's nickname "Koke" -Â not to be confused with the current Atletico Madrid captain Jorge Resurreccion Merodio, who goes by the same moniker.</p>
