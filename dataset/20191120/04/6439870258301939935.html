      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A study by the American Psychological Association is getting attention. It says Millennials turn more to Astrology to help them process work, love and life.</p>
      <p>What’s written in the stars, is helping guide a generation. ​</p>
      <p>“I guess I’m like one of those people who that’s like hippy-ish I guess,” said Brianna Mandat who’s in her early 20s. ​</p>
      <p>According to Mandat’s birth chart, she’s a Cancer. She says she checks her horoscope every day to help bring a sense of self-awareness. ​</p>
      <p>“Being that I am a Cancer, I’m very emotional, very sensitive,” she added.</p>
      <p>Depending on your age, you may think this is a joke. It’s not. The study is real and the more Millennials find themselves interested in Astrology, you can bet more books there are to support the habit. ​</p>

      <p>There are also plenty of apps out there that brings the ancient practice straight to your phone like Co-Star. ​</p>
      <p>“That’s probably the most popular one,” Mandat said. ​</p>
      <p>Mandat says daily readings help her to find her life’s purpose, which gives her complete comfort.​</p>
      <p>“I’ve learned so much about myself and I understand myself so much more too,” she confirmed. ​</p>
      <p>Even though she feels like horoscopes are a source of personal power, she understands not everyone gets it. ​</p>
      <p>“People don’t really tend to believe in what’s not tangible so I guess they just don’t see it as real or solid evidence of proof of anything,” said Mandat. ​</p>
      <p>Trey Greene is a licensed mental health specialist out of East Charlotte, who says there is no harm in the recreational study, “I think, as long as we’re not hurting other people."​</p>
      <p>He also says most of his Millennial clients believe in the wave of astrology. ​</p>
      <p>“I feel like there is a lot of search for meaning,” Greene confirmed. ​</p>
      <p>He says readings are a therapeutic tool for his clients as they help them to connect the dots with life - which can be beneficial and a healthy way to mentally process day to day situations.​</p>
      <p>“That happens in therapy all the time. You reflect on something that’s worded in a different way,” said Greene. ​</p>
      <p>Mandat added, “It’s just a way of life. You can use astrology to take care of yourself” ​</p>
