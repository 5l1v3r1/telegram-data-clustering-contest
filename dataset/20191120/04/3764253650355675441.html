      <p>The following John Muir quotes about nature will prompt you to think about life from a different perspective. They will make you question your thoughts and beliefs as well as teach you something new.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>John alludes that the fastest way to learn about the world is to go through the thickets of a forest. The flora and fauna in forests are diverse.
