      <p>Dozens of pro-democracy protesters stood firm within a besieged Hong Kong university on Wednesday, where an "SOS" sign was laid out as supporters took up calls to distract police surrounding the campus by disrupting city transport.</p>
      <p>The four-day standoff between demonstrators and police at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) rippled overseas, with the UN's human rights office urging a peaceful resolution, while the US senate passed new legislation supporting protesters' demands.</p>
      <p>The epicentre of nearly six months of increasingly savage anti-China protests has shifted to the PolyU campus, a stone's throw from the city's harbour, where hardcore protesters have held off riot police with Molotov cocktails, bricks and arrows.</p>
      <p>The confrontation has been the most intense and prolonged in nearly six months of unrest that began over a now-shelved bill to allow extraditions to China, which revived fears that Beijing was slicing into the city's freedoms.</p>
      <p>Millions of angry citizens have hit the streets in a movement that snowballed into wider calls for free elections and an inquiry into alleged police brutality, demands that Hong Kong's Beijing-appointed leaders have rebuffed.</p>

      <p>Protesters at PolyU said around 50 of their number remained after hundreds had fled deteriorating conditions and officials warned that police may fire live rounds.</p>
      <p>Exhausted bands of youths continued to wander the debris-strewn campus, preparing Molotov cocktails while others slept on a gym floor.</p>
      <p>A large "SOS" sign was laid out across an open courtyard, apparently intended to be viewed from above.</p>
      <p>A 20-year-old protester who gave his name as Ken said food and water were running low.</p>
      <p>"We will die because they don't let me out. Some people want to get out but they cannot. So we left this SOS," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>The holdouts included around 20 of the university's students, a PolyU official said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam called Tuesday for protesters to surrender, adding that those over 18 would face rioting charges, but minors would not be arrested.</p>
      <p>- 'Never give up' -</p>
      <p>"I don’t ever give up. Yes, I will fight until the end," said a 15-year-old holdout armed with bow and arrow who identified himself as William.</p>
      <p>"But... it’s very dangerous, because when you use the bow, the police must shoot you, with some unknown bullets. Maybe real bullets."</p>

      <p>Others were medically evacuated overnight, and on Wednesday before dawn AFP journalists watched as police chased down and arrested around a dozen students making a break for it.</p>
      <p>Police said that since the siege began nearly 900 people at the campus had turned themselves in as of Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The UN human rights office was watching the university situation with "deepening concern", spokesman Rupert Colville said in Geneva.</p>
      <p>Colville acknowledged protesters' "deep-seated grievances" but condemned the "extreme violence" of some demonstrators and called on authorities to seek a peaceful resolution.</p>
      <p>A "Blossom Everywhere" strategy of disruptive vandalism lasting more than a week has brought much of the city's transport network to a standstill and shuttered schools.</p>

      <p>Some of the busiest subway lines were disrupted yet again on Wednesday, with huge queues of commuters in the morning as protesters reportedly blocked train doors from closing.</p>
      <p>Police said 213 people were charged in court on Wednesday with rioting for one of the diversionary actions earlier this week. The charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison.</p>
      <p>But online protest appeals again brought citizens to the streets in some places Wednesday.</p>
      <p>- US pressure -</p>
      <p>The city's education bureau reopened primary and secondary schools on Wednesday after a suspension that began last week. Kindergartens remained closed.</p>

      <p>China has repeatedly condemned protesters as violent criminals and rejected any foreign criticism.</p>
      <p>But the US Senate on Tuesday unanimously adopted new legislation threatening to revoke the favourable trade status that the semi-autonomous Chinese territory enjoys with the United States if its freedoms are quashed.</p>
      <p>Lawmakers also approved a measure that would ban sales of tear gas, rubber bullets and other equipment used by Hong Kong security forces.</p>
      <p>Beijing shot back on Wednesday, warning of "strong countermeasures" if the bill becomes law, and summoning acting US charge d'affaires William Klein to lodge a protest.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong on Sunday holds district elections to its legislature, half of which is directly elected, the other half stacked with pro-Beijing lawmakers.</p>
      <p>But Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung warned Wednesday that further violence could "ruin" the chances of holding the polls, in which China-aligned candidates are expected to take a drubbing.</p>
