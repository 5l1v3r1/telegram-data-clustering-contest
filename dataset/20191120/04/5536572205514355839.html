      <h1>Jalen Ramsey Was Mic’d Up vs. Bears &amp; Talked Trash To Everyone (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Jalen Ramsey has never been shy about talking trash about oppsoing players, as he proudly displayed last season when he just about ripped every QB in the entire league as a member of the Jaguars.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night against the Bears, he was tasked with covering Allen Robinson, who was his former teammate on the franchise.</p>
      <p>Ramsey put together a solid performance that limited Robinson to just 15 yards on four catches. Of course, he was seen trash talking on just about every single play, and thanks to him being mic’d up, we get to hear what was said.</p>
      <p>“Big stop A-Rob! Just like we used to do in practice, boy!”</p>
      <p>Ramsey threw shade at Robinson on another play by saying “that double-move was not it, A-Rob.”</p>
      <p>He then told one of his teammates on the bench, “it was so weak.”</p>

      <p>Later on in the video, he told 5-foot-7 Taylor Gabriel “Get your little [expletive] back over there.”</p>
      <p>“We’re not playing with these kids,” Ramsey said to another Ram. “We’re not playing with nobody’s children today.”</p>
      <p>“That would’ve been a pick. Can’t believe he looked this way.”</p>
