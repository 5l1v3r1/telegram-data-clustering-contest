      <h1>Cleared by Trump, Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher could still be ousted from unit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:59:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>The Navy SEAL who was accused of numerous war crimes, including shooting unarmed civilians in Iraq, will likely be dismissed from his elite unit on Wednesday — days after President Trump <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-pardons-2-ex-military-officers-promotes-navy-seal-eddie-gallagher/">opted to restore his rank</a>, a report said.</p>
      <p>Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher has been ordered to appear in front of Navy high-ups on Wednesday morning, who will likely strip him of his Trident pin and oust him from the SEALs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/us/navy-seals-edward-gallagher-trident.html">the New York Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The move will effectively end Gallagher’s career in the SEALs, but will not demote him in rank, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Gallagher already planned to retire from the unit, so the move is largely a rebuke to cast him out of the elite unit.</p>
      <p>He had been bumped down to a lower pay grade after he was convicted in July of posing for a photograph with the corpse of an ISIS fighter while on deployment in Iraq in 2017 — but cleared of murder charges stemming from the fighter’s fatal stabbing.</p>
