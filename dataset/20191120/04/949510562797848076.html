      <p>PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Kosovo prosecutors have filed terrorism charges against two people suspected of supporting or fighting with the Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
      <p>A prosecutors’ statement Tuesday said they had accused a woman, identified only as F.Z., as fighting with the Islamic State group in Syria. She was among 110 Kosovo citizens repatriated from Syria in April.</p>
      <p>A man identified as F.Ll. was accused Wednesday of using his Facebook page to encourage people to join terror groups, downloading hate speeches from IS and hailing a recent murderous attack in Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>If convicted, the woman could face a prison sentence of more than 15 years and the man up to five years.</p>
      <p>Kosovo authorities say 30 of the country’s citizens are still actively supporting terror groups in Syria.</p>
