      <p>“We have invited the entire legal team led by K. Parasaran. Most of the people have confirmed they will come,” Rai told ET.</p>
      <p>The VHP has also invited lawyers who fought the case in the high court and lower court.</p>
      <p>On November 23, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy will visit Ayodhya, where those invited by the VHP include former solicitor general Mohan Parasaran, BJP leader and lawyer Bhupender Yadav, additional solicitor general Vikramjeet Bannerjee and senior advocates CS Vaidyanathan, Ranjit Kumar and PS Narsimha.</p>
