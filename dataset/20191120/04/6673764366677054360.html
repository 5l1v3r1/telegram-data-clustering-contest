      <p><b>HONG KONG – </b>A Japanese student was released late Tuesday in Hong Kong after local police arrested him on suspicion of participating in rioting during pro-democracy protests near a university campus, Japan’s Consulate-General in the territory said.</p>
      <p>Hikaru Ida, a 21-year-old student at the Tokyo University of Agriculture, is not injured and has no health problems, according to the consulate.</p>
      <p>He was arrested Sunday for allegedly taking part in a riot near the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in the Kowloon area, where clashes between protesters and police have been taking place, the consulate said.</p>
      <p>The Japanese government had been working to secure his release, saying he was a tourist.</p>
      <p>The police continued on Wednesday to surround the campus, where the protesters remain holed up.</p>
