      <p>Oyeniyi said: “MAPAMA is a preeminent body with large membership of men and women who have proven their mettles in all walks of life across the globe. The National Convention is akin to a general meeting and it brings together all members to discuss topical national issues within the perspective of organisational and individual benefits.”</p>
