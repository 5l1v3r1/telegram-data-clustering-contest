      <p>Now <i>The Post</i> actor is sharing how one of Mister Rogers’ valuable life-lessons keeps his marriage to Rita Wilson going strong. Hanks sat down with <i>Entertainment Tonight</i> to talk about how the teachable lesson from Rogers has put an end to some squabbles in his 31-year-marriage.</p>
      <p>“When my wife and I are going at it on those rare occasions, when she is letting me know that I’m not really listening to her and I’m trying to establish what the ground rules are [for the argument], when we’re going at it like that, one of us will say, ‘Well, you know what? You know what, honey? It’s good to talk. It’s good to say the things we feel,” the 63-year-old stated to <i>ET’s</i> Kevin Frazier.</p>
      <p>Hanks also shared he and Wilson enjoy making soup together when they have time off from work. It sounds like something Mister Rogers would recommend for all couples.</p>

      <p>“I don’t allow anyone to take advantage of my good nature and I don’t know that Fred did either,” Wilson’s husband admitted.</p>
      <p>Other than that, Hanks shares the two men were quite different. Their significant differences are one of the reasons the actor was happy to take on the challenge of playing Mister Rogers.</p>
