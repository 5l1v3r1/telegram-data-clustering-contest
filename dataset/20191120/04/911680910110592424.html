      <h1>Online shopping could be considered an addiction</h1>

      <p>Researchers in Germany have recently published a study finding that a small percentage of people have developed an addiction to shopping.</p>
      <p>The October 2019 study released in Comprehensive Psychiatry explores the addictive response to shopping. The study found that 1 in 20 of adults developed an addiction to shopping.</p>
      <p>The researchers dubbed the addiction as "buying-shopping disorder" (BSD), which "is characterized by extreme preoccupations with and craving for buying/shopping and by irresistible and identity-seeking urges to possess consumer goods."</p>
      <p>While the study looked at shopping more broadly, the researchers believe that the ability to shop online is feeding the addiction.</p>
      <p>"As e-commerce provides an important shopping environment, traditional BSD may migrate into the online retail market," the study states. "The internet offers a vast variety of shopping information and simultaneous access to many online stores, thereby meeting expectations for immediate reward, emotional enhancement and identity gain."</p>
