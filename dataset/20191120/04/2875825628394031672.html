      <h1>Tottenham move training to afternoon in preparation of new manager arrival</h1>
      <h2>Spurs are expected to name their new boss within the next 24 hours following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino, with Jose Mourinho the favourite to take over</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:09:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham have reportedly re-scheduled Wednesday's training session from the morning to the afternoon as the club look to move quickly to confirm Mauricio Pochettino's successor.</p>
      <p>The Argentinean was relieved of his duties on Tuesday evening following a dreadful start to the season which has seen Spurs win just three of 12 Premier League games so far.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager Jose Mourinho is the early favourite to be placed in charge, with the likes of Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and ex-Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri also among the names mentioned.</p>
      <p>Whoever it is, a new manager appears likely to be in place by the end of Wednesday morning, with Spurs allegedly moving the time of training so that Pochettino's successor can lead the session.</p>

      <p>Journalist David Ornstein tweeted in the early hours on Wednesday: " <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> training on Wednesday has been moved from morning to afternoon with aim of appointing Mauricio Pochettino successor early in day &amp; new boss leading squad in that session. Jose Mourinho in frame but not only option as Spurs close in on final decision."</p>
      <p>Many Spurs fans have reacted negatively to the news of Pochettino's sacking, but chairman Daniel Levy issued a statement following the news insisting it was the correct decision to take.</p>
      <p>Levy said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>

      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>
      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history."</p>
