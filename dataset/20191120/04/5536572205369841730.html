      <p>Lamar Jackson is freakishly fast. There aren’t too many defenders in the league that can catch him from behind. You’d be lucky to grab a foot and hope he trips as full speed.</p>
      <p>Such was the case when the Baltimore Ravens faced off against the Seattle Seahawks a few weeks ago when Jackson got loose out of the pocket and was tripped up, because a few Seahawks defenders couldn’t catch him.</p>
      <p>One of them could be heard saying, “That motherf*cka fast” while on the bench.</p>

      <p>Indeed he is. That’s the reason the Ravens won that game 30-16.</p>
