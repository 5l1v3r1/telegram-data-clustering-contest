      <h3>Manchester United are interested in a deal to sign young Reading striker Danny Loader, according to reports.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11864054/manchester-united-considering-danny-loader-bid-with-several-premier-league-clubs-also-interested">Sky Sports</a> is reporting that the Red Devils are one of a number of clubs interested in signing the 20-year-old as the clock ticks down on his contract.</p>
      <p>Loader’s current deal at Reading is due to expire in the summer and talks over a new contract have stalled, according to the same article.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Manchester United are one of “several” Premier League clubs interested in signing Loader next year.</p>
      <p>Loader made his Reading debut for Jaap Stam as a 16-year-old and almost completed a move to Wolves last summer before the deal fell through.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are thought to be on the lookout for a number of new signings in the January transfer window as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to bolster his options up front.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are currently in seventh place in the Premier League table after having won just four of their opening 12 games in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Manchester United will aim to seal their fifth Premier League win of the season on Sunday when they travel to Sheffield United.</p>
