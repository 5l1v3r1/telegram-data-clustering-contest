      <p>North West is not allowed to wear makeup but was permitted to wear a septum ring.</p>
      <p>North West, the daughter of <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> and Kim Kardashian, is 6-years-old and is not allowed to wear makeup. At least, that is what Kardashian revealed in a recent interview regarding how her parenting style differs from that of her husband. However, the eldest of the couple’s children was recently seen with a nose ring, much to the confusion of talk show host Wendy Williams, according to<a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/19/wendy-williams-north-west-nose-ring-reaction-confused-kanye/"><i> Hollywood Life</i></a>.</p>
      <p>During Tuesday’s episode of <i>The Wendy Williams Show</i>, Williams had some questions for West. North was photographed with a sparkling silver septum ring in her nose while heading off to attend her great grandmother, Mary Jo Campbell’s, 85th birthday celebration. Due to this, Williams wanted to know why West is so against his 6-year-old wearing makeup but is fine with her wearing a nose ring.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t want his daughter wearing makeup, but she can wear a full-on nose ring? So, where are we going with this?”, Williams said of North’s accessory piece.</p>
      <p>Kardashian did comment on the photo to clarify that her daughter doesn’t actually have a real septum piercing.</p>
      <p>“Fake nose ring alert!!!” she wrote.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview, Kardashian revealed that her husband wants to take on a more conservative parenting style with regard to raising their four children, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. This includes not allowing North to wear makeup until she is a teenager, something Kardashian initially disagreed with, as <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5711916/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-north-makeup/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported.</p>

      <p>Kardashian didn’t see anything wrong with letting her daughter wear a little lipstick and experiment once in a while on special occasions. However, West stayed firm with regard to his opinion on this topic, leading to some tension between him and his wife. They eventually had to come to a compromise.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think he had it, he changed all the rules. ‘I’d let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I’d let her wear a red lip, or I’d let her do one pop of something. I’d let her, if she’s wearing a black dress, a black lip. So, I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it’s now no more makeup.”</blockquote>

      <p>North has frequently been photographed in some pretty mature outfits, makeup looks, and hairstyles. She’s also been seen wearing large hoop earrings and other arguably bold accessories for her age. This is not especially surprising due to her famous family’s passion for fashion.</p>
      <p>Even though North won’t be able to experiment with makeup, her mother said she will still get to express herself through her clothing choices.</p>
