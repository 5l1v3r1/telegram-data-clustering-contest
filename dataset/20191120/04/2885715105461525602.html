      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:13:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>After an eventful Weekend Ka Vaar with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a>, the contestants of Bigg Boss got another chance to ensure a safe place for themselves this week and make sure their rivals get voted out.</p>
      <p>Like every week, Bigg Boss introduced a twist in the nomination process. This time, the housemates had to take names of two contestants who they want to save from nominations. The contestants with the minimum votes got nominated at the end of the process. Since Sidharth Shukla was nominated by Bigg Boss as a punishment, he was not a part of the process.</p>
      <p>Those who got nominated with just one vote were Rashami Desai, Arti Singh, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devoleena-bhattacharjee">Devoleena Bhattacharjee</a>, Kesari Lal Yadav and Sidharth Shukla. Who do you think will get evicted from the Bigg Boss 13 house this week? Cast your votes here.</p>

        <p>From among the nominated contestants, it is difficult to say who has more chances of leaving the house this weekend. All of them have been trying to grab the attention of the cameras in some way or the other. Still, Arti and Kesari need to pull up their socks if they wish to go ahead in the show. They are mostly seen playing from behind the stronger contestants like Sidharth and Paras, instead of playing the game individually.</p>
        <p>Devoleena is finally in her elements and has realised the way to stay relevant in the show. Her chemistry with Sidharth is being loved by the audience. Now, if the audience will save her from eviction this week or not, will be known during the Weekend Ka Vaar episodes on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
