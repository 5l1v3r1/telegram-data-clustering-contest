      <p>There was a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> reunion as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/amber-gill">Amber Gill</a> shone as she showed off her new collection at her big launch in London.</p>
      <p>The star didn't disappoint at the Amber Rose Gill X MissPap party dinner at trendy London hot spot Restaurant Ours on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>She was joined by Anna Vakili as well as former contestants India Reynolds, Francesca Allen, Yewande Biala and Kaz Crossley.</p>
      <p>As expected it was the 2019 winner who stole the show as her gold mini dress wowed everyone.</p>
      <p>Her pals were on hand to support her as the 22-year-old got down to work after she secured the big money contract.</p>

      <p>The Love Island winner, who was cruelly dumped by Greg O'Shea via text, landed the £1million fashion deal weeks after leaving the show.</p>
      <p>Molly-Mae Hague was nowhere to be seen as her old rival steered clear.</p>
      <p>The runner up only scooped a £500,000 deal with her Pretty Little Thing collection.</p>

      <p>A source close to Amber told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9912125/amber-gill-love-island-millionaire-miss-pap/">The Sun Online</a> : "Amber is on cloud nine - she signed the £1million deal and couldn't be happier.</p>
      <p>"She's had every major brand in the UK fighting to sign her - it's been insane. Amber couldn't be more excited about the future and what else is in store."</p>
      <p>Amber is clearly excited and told her fans: "Oh hey it's just me your NEW MISS PAP babe.</p>
