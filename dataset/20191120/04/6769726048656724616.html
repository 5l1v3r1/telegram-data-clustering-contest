      <h1>Reiwa backs Salvation Army Christmas appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>REIWA is supporting The Salvation Army’s Christmas appeal and is urging West Australians to also help those in need.</p>
      <p>President Damian Collins said the holiday period could be especially challenging for those struggling to make ends meet, with more than 300,000 people seeking help from The Salvation Army during the festive season each year.</p>
      <p>“This is the sixth consecutive year Reiwa has been involved in the Christmas Appeal and I’m hoping the community digs deep to help make 2019 our most successful appeal yet,” he said.</p>
      <p>“For those wanting to get involved, you can donate unwrapped gifts or non-perishable food items to one of the <a href="https://view.publitas.com/reiwa-1/2019-christmas-appeal-designated-collection-points/page/1">30 designated Reiwa agency collection points</a> near you.</p>
      <p>“The Salvos need gifts to suit all age groups, so any item you donate will be put to good use.</p>
      <p>“Alternatively, you can make a monetary donation on the <a href="https://reiwa.com.au/about-us/in-the-community/">Reiwa website</a>.</p>
      <p>“Every contribution, no matter how big or small, can make a difference to the lives of our fellow West Australians who are doing it tough.”</p>
      <p>The Salvation Army public relations secretary Warren Palmer said while the festive season could be a joyous time of year, it could also be an exceptionally difficult time given the added pressures the cost of Christmas brings.</p>
      <p>“We are really grateful for the support that Reiwa, its agents and the wider community provide,” he said.</p>
      <p>“More and more people are turning to The Salvation Army for assistance.</p>
      <p>“Through the generosity of Reiwa agents and their communities, we are able to help those in need fill their cupboards with festive foods and provide gifts for their children bringing some cheer in an otherwise difficult time.”</p>
      <p>The Christmas Appeal will run until Thursday, December 12.</p>
      <p>Reiwa staff members will pick up the donations from the agency collection points and drop them off to The Salvation Army in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Gifts can also be dropped off to Reiwa at 215 Hay Street, Subiaco.</p>
