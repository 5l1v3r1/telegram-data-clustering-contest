      <p>When Access Bank Plc cemented its merger with former Diamond Bank Plc last year, many people saw the move  as savvy, but were not sure the level of benefits the synergy would bring.</p>
      <p>But the picture of what to come became clearer after Access Bank Plc’s nine months ended September 2019 results were announced. The bank posted a growth of 44 per cent in profit after tax (PAT) to N90.7 billion in 2019, up from N62.9 billion in the corresponding period of 2018. The bank equally achieved N103.1 billion profit before tax (PBT) as against N70.26 billion, representing 46.73 per cent year-on-year growth when compared to 2018 results for same period.</p>
      <p>Other major gains were recorded on forex trading gain of N23 billion, compared to loss of N24 billion in second quarter. The bank also booked N4.6 billion write-back on previous impairment of financial assets, which moderated total provisioning over third quarter of 2019 to N5.7 billion.</p>
      <p>The results summarised the significant improved performance, reflecting the positive impact of the merger.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the performance showed that Access Bank Plc ended the period with net interest income of N210 billion, compared with N123 billion in 2018, while non-fee income rose from N37 billion to N56 billion. Impairment charges stood at N10.611 billion, compared with N8.353 billion in 2018.</p>
      <p>Personal expenses rose from N41.4 billion to N54.6 billion, while other operating expenses increased from N82 billion to N121 billion in 2019. Despite the high costs recorded, Access  Bank Plc posted a profit before tax of N103 billion in 2019, up from N70.2 billion in 2018, while PAT rose by 44 per cent to N90.7 billion, from N62.9 billion in 2018.</p>
      <p>A further breakdown of results indicated that its merger with defunct Diamond Bank is yielding fruits as deposits soared from N2.56 trillion to N4.24 trillion. Total assets jumped from N4.942 trillion to N6.58 trillion.</p>
      <p>Assessing the results, analysts at FBN Quest said: ‘’Access Bank’s   PAT implies return on average equity (ROAE) of 23 per cent, much higher than management’s guidance of 20 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Pre-provision profits grew by 60 per cent to N105.7 billion, thanks to strong double-digit growth on both revenue lines. Although funding income grew by 46 per cent, growth on the non-interest income line was even stronger at 77 per cent.</p>
      <p>“The solid growth on this line contrasts starkly with the lackluster performance on the line in second quarter 2019. The strong growth on the line was underpinned by a 150 per cent growth in fee and commission income and forex trading gains which were up by around 474 per cent. Substantial recoveries of around N8.9 billion made during the quarter as against N1.4 billion in third quarter 2018 were also supportive,” the analysts explained.</p>
      <p>Access Bank Plc Group Managing Director/CEO Herbert Wigwe  had emphasised the bank’s  strong acquisition and integration track record.</p>

      <p>Financial market analysts insist the merger brought together the two banks’ shared focus on innovation, financial inclusion, and sustainability to the benefit of the customers, staff and shareholders.</p>
      <p>When Access Bank Plc posted similarly impressive performance in half year ended June, the Group Managing Director/CEO, Herbert Wigwe, said their focus  on retail market gained momentum and would be maintained going forward.</p>
      <p>“The strong retail contribution demonstrates the effectiveness of our continued drive around low-cost deposits, on the back of an innovative digital platform. Asset quality improved as guided, to 6.4 per cent on the bank of a robust risk management approach. This is expected to trend into the future as we strive to hit and surpass the standard we had built in the industry prior to the merger. Similarly, liquidity ratio improved year on year to 49.7 per cent, reflecting deliberate steps to optimise our balance sheet in order to ensure the group’s liquidity position remains robust,” Wigwe said.</p>

      <p>Access Bank Plc had last month announced completion of the second phase of its post-merger integration, where it has brought together all its core banking platforms.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the bank said that the completion of this phase heralds the delivery of one of the most robust banking platforms in the world that will serve its  growing base of over 30 million customers seamlessly and enhance its service delivery and uptime targets.</p>
      <p>“One of the benefits of the integration is the simplicity of initiating and receiving bank transfers, as customers will no longer need to select between ‘Access’ or ‘Access (Diamond)’ when transacting. Customers simply need to select ‘Access Bank’ for all transactions,” it said.</p>
      <p>Wigwe lauded the various committees for their effort during the period of the integration, saying, “A special thank you to the integration committee for ensuring all the milestones expected at the various stages of integration were achieved within the scheduled timeframe.”</p>
      <p>Appreciating customers for their  trust and support throughout the integration phase, the Executive Director, Retail Banking, Access Bank Plc, Victor Etuokwu, added that the Bank is now better positioned than ever to serve its customers with the best solutions and service the industry has to offer.</p>
      <p>He said: “Delivering the best services possible to our customers remains our highest priority.  We can now offer the best digitally-driven financial solutions that will make our customers’ transactions simpler, faster and convenient.”</p>

      <p>The bank said the merger has brought  the power of banking to millions across Nigeria. It is  focused on speed, service and security. “We are determined to ensure that our customers will experience no disruption to normal banking services while we join forces to create Nigeria and Africa’s largest retail bank by customers. While there may be some changes in due course, we are committed to inform you ahead of time and in a way that is most convenient for you,” the bank said.</p>
      <p>Executive Director, Personal Banking, Access Bank Plc,  Victor Etuokwu, had during a media briefing in Lagos said: “ It is a merger of two big banks to meet the needs of customers. We are going to run the mobile Apps of both banks side-by-side until when they will look alike, and when eventually integrated, customers will not even know. We know that Diamond Bank Mobile App is a market leader and we will leave it that way and same thing applies to the Diamond Extra.”</p>
      <p>Continuing, he explained that where there are two close branches of both lenders, the customers will be the ones to determine which one will be closed, based on performance.</p>
      <p>“If we have two branches like in Gbagada, Lagos, we will keep both of them open for one or two years. Then we will see where the customers go. Our customers will decide where they want to go. For us, we believe that the customer is king, and this merger is about giving the customer the best of services and value,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Findings also showed that existing Diamondxtra customers have nothing to worry about as the reward scheme is not changing and winners has continued being paid while new winners continued to emerge. In fact, with the merger with Access Bank, Diamondxtra has become bigger and better as the scheme has been opened to Access Bank customers<i>. </i>The merger has created over 13 million mobile customers, 3,100 Automated Teller Machines, over 600 branches and 30 million customers.</p>
      <p>Analysts said some other objectives behind mergers of the banks include increasing customer base and expanding into new activities. Another important advantage of merger is that the process reduces competition and eliminates competitors from the banking industry.</p>
      <p>Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) Director-General, Muda Yusuf, said the first gain of the takeover is that former Diamond Bank has been saved from going under and the economy protected from the consequences of such occurrence.</p>
      <p>“Today, the good thing is that depositors fund is safe. Some of the employees are not likely to lose their jobs since it is acquisition, and that is good for the economy. If Diamond Bank had failed completely, there would be systemic effect. In terms of foreign perception, acquisition or merger is better than bank failure,” he said.</p>
