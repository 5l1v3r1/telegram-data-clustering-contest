      <h1>GoFundMe set up for ‘throuple’ pol Katie Hill</h1>

      <p>A GoFundMe page was established to help cover the costs of former Congresswoman Katie Hill’s legal efforts to bring down those responsible for leaking nude photos of her that ended up being published in the media.</p>
      <p>The series of pictures ultimately prompted <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/27/rep-katie-hill-resigning-amid-snowballing-throuple-scandal/">Hill’s resignation from Congress</a> after the House opened up an ethics probe against her over whether she engaged in an improper relationship with a staffer.</p>
      <p>The former lawmaker has said that she believes her estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, played a role in the leak. She even retained noted Brooklyn attorney Carrie Goldberg, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/31/katie-hill-hires-revenge-porn-lawyer-carrie-goldberg-to-sue-over-leaked-nude-photos/">specializes revenge porn cases</a>, in her legal pursuits.</p>
      <p>Hill — who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/freshman-congresswomans-throuple-uncovered-amid-bitter-divorce/">admitted to being in a “Throuple” relationship</a> with her estranged husband and a former female campaign worker, but not her former legislative director — <a href="https://twitter.com/KatieHill4CA/status/1196970339432980480?s=20">tweeted out a link</a> of the crowdfunding page Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>“I am so incredibly grateful to my friends and family who came together to support my effort to hold everyone involved in my cyber exploitation accountable,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>The page, which wasn’t organized by the former lawmaker herself, says, “Katie seeks justice against everybody responsible,” for the leaked photos.</p>
      <p>“Litigation is an important tool to fight back against offenders and those who prosper from the humiliation of innocent people,” the post continued.</p>
      <p>As of Tuesday night, the page had raised over $5,000.</p>
