        <i>Utilizing the evidence and documents sent in by fans as well as evidence we have obtained through our own monitoring, we will be responding with strong legal action without any settlements, and also clarify that various lawsuits we filed against malicious commenters in the past have come to a conclusion with the offenders receiving strict punishments for their crimes. <br/><br/></i>
        <i>Observing some of the recent cases involving malicious online attacks, we can see that the court has strengthened punishments against offenders who take part in activities such as listed above. We also promise to respond to such actions very strongly to ensure that such actions do not happen again in the future, and also promise to do our best in protecting our label artists at all times. <br/><br/></i>
