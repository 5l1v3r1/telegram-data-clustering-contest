      <p>Cruise ship RCGS RESOLUTE docked at Buenos Aires on Nov 4, with 162 passengers and 98 crew on board, in a final stop before sailing to cruise destination, waters of Antarctic. The ship called Buenos Aires on Oct 19 then left, and sailed to Puerto Madryn port Argentina, but was refused bunkering, due to outstanding debts of operator company. The ship returned to Buenos Aires, and was berthed at cargo/passenger pier, disrupting its’ operations. Bunkering was again, refused. Passengers had to disembark and return home, reportedly on their own account. RCGS RESOLUTE remains berthed in the same position, accumulating debts. Port and terminal officials require the ship to be relocated to some other, non-commercial, berth. Understood crew remain on board, they are not restricted in their movements.<br/>Cruise ship RCGS RESOLUTE, IMO 9000168, GT 8445, built 1991, flag Portugal, operator One Ocean Expeditions, capacity 184 passengers, crew 125.</p>
