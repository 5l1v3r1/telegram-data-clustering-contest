      <p>Hundreds of widows and widowers have benefited from the medical outreach organised by a Non-Governmental organisation, Glance Fancier International Foundation (GFIF) in conjunction with Ojodu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) and Rotary International.</p>
      <p>The one-day Free Family Medical Outreach was held at Omole Estate in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Doctors and nurses offered various medical services, including, tests on malaria, blood pressure, HIV, sugar level and eye test, among others.</p>
      <p>There was also the distribution of mosquito nets, medication and eyeglasses to the participants.</p>
      <p>Medical experts also gave talks on wellness, healthy living and cancer awareness.</p>
      <p>According to GFIF’s Chief Executive Officer Mrs Gbemisola Fatiha Rufai, said the outreach was in furtherance of the NGO’s humanitarian service.</p>
      <p>The retired civil servant said the event was to take care of the less privileged individuals, especially widows.</p>
      <p>Mrs Rufai said: “Today, we have empowered over a hundred people with this outreach. We distributed mosquito nets as well as drugs. Doctors and Nurses are here to check participants’ sugar and blood levels, HIV and malaria tests. Those that are HIV positive will be referred to the appropriate quarters.</p>

      <p>“We have a doctor from Houston, Texas in the United States, Dr. Sunkanmi Adeyinka to give the participants talk on well-being and healthy living. Another doctor will give talk on Cancer of the breast so that our women will not die of cancer when they are detected early.”</p>
      <p>Rufai explained that over 5,000 youths and widows have been empowered by the foundation since its establishment in 1989.</p>
      <p>“We are specialised in empowering the less privileged widows and youths with financial assistance and vocational training. We know the plight of widows and what we can do for them is to elevate their standard of living,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dr.  Adeyinka told the participants to eat healthy and engage in regular exercise.</p>
      <p>She said those who don’t do regular exercise are prone to having diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and kidney disease.</p>
      <p>“Eating of fruits, vegetables, engaging in daily exercises and consultation of medical experts for medical check-up may prevent the body from diseases,” she said.</p>
