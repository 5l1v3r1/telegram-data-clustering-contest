      <h1>Scots child killer refused prison freedom bid as victim's family warn 'beast must stay locked up'</h1>
      <h2>Paedophile Steven Leisk strangled schoolboy Scott Simpson after luring him into undergrowth to sexually assault him.</h2>

      <p>One of Scotland’s most <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sex-crime">notorious child killers</a> has failed in a bid for freedom – with his victim’s family saying he should never get out.</p>
      <p>Vile paedophile Steven Leisk’s plea for release has been refused by the Parole Board for Scotland and he remains in prison for the murder of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> schoolboy Scott Simpson in 1997.</p>
      <p>Scott’s sisters and brother were relieved to learn the news in a letter from the board, having outlined to it the devastating and ongoing effect of Leisk’s appalling crime on their family.</p>

      <p>The monster <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/keep-monster-locked-up-familys-18909259">has served 22 years for the murder</a> but they insist he will always be a danger and must stay locked up to protect other children.</p>
      <p>Scott’s family were disappointed to learn the next review will be in May 2021.</p>
      <p>“At least kids are safe from him for now but it is only for 18 months and knowing he can try again so soon for freedom is worrying,” said Scott’s oldest sister, Sarah.</p>

      <p>Her younger sister, Charlene, added: “We are all relieved but there is a bit of frustration that they don’t explain anything. Is he still a danger? Does he admit that himself as he did in court? Or has he done something in prison?”</p>
      <p>Like all murderers, Leisk was sentenced to life imprisonment and became eligible for parole two years ago as the minimum term set for him was 20 years, but he was kept in prison.</p>
      <p>This time, thousands of people signed an online petition started by Scott’s family demanding he stay in jail.</p>
      <p>Scott’s siblings are grateful to the public, including many Record readers, for supporting them.</p>
      <p>His brother Billy said: “It’s important to know that ordinary people are behind you and support you.”</p>

      <p>Scott was less than three weeks from his 10th birthday when devious Leisk murdered him on July 17, 1997.</p>
      <p>Leisk had been convicted of sex offences against children on four previous occasions and had only been out of jail for seven months when he lured Scott with a promise to play computer games.</p>
      <p>Instead, he led him into undergrowth, tried to sexually assault him, then strangled him when Scott resisted.</p>
      <p>Leisk hid Scott’s body in bushes, went to work next day and quickly turned his attention to other potential victims.</p>
      <p>But media coverage of the missing nine-year-old prompted one of Leisk’s relatives, who knew he lived near the park where Scott was last seen, to call police on July 21, 1997.</p>
      <p>Officers arrived at his door, catching Leisk with two teenage boys.</p>
      <p>Leisk, now 56, confessed to killing Scott.</p>
      <p>The Record revealed this year that Scott’s parents Patsy and Denny had been so desperate to learn all that had happened to him that they sent Leisk 22 questions in 1998 and he replied.</p>

      <p>The most poignant question was: “Did he suffer for long?”</p>
      <p>Leisk’s chilling reply: “I cannot say for certain but I believe and hope not.”</p>
      <p>He also claimed “nothing physical happened to him before his death”, later stating there had been no sexual contact between them.</p>
      <p>He maintained he did not intend to kill Scott and had not targeted him, adding: “He was an unfortunate random choice.”</p>
      <p>Scott’s siblings, still angry at the cut in his sentence, told the parole board of the impact of Leisk’s crime on their family and how it still affects them.</p>
      <p>They pointed out the extreme violence used – their late mother had been haunted by the sight of her son’s body.</p>
      <p>Sarah said: “It breaks our hearts to think of our wee brother and his last moments, terrified of that monster.</p>
      <p>“Scott was the sweetest, kindest wee boy who would have done anything for anyone.”</p>
      <p>Charlene said of Leisk: “He’s only in his 50s. He could be a danger to kids for another 30 years.”</p>
      <p>The parole board said: “We never comment on individual cases.”</p>
