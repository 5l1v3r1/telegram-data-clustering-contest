      <p><a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2019/11/10/improvements-announced-for-gullivers-ship-in-animal-crossing-pocket-camp/">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</a> is getting a <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2019/11/17/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-will-be-getting-a-paid-membership-service/">paid subscription service</a>, and Nintendo has shared the corresponding launch video below to let fans know about what they can expect from it. Known as the Pocket Camp Club, the service will officially begin on November 20 at 10 p.m. PT. It consists of two different plans; one lets you pick an animal to follow you around and help out, and the other gives you access to storage warehouses and a monthly supply of fortune cookies.</p>
