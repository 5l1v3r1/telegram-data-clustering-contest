      <h1>Thai opposition leader Thanathorn to learn fate in court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:05:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The billionaire frontman of Thailand’s anti-military parliamentary bloc is set to hear a controversial ruling Wednesday that could see him banned from politics and jailed for up to 10 years.</p>
      <p>The leader of the upstart Future Forward party, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 40, has been a fierce critic of the army’s role in Thailand’s turbulent politics, which has seen at least 12 coups since 1932.</p>
      <p>His success at the ballot box has shaken up the arch-royalist power structure after millions of youthful supporters helped Future Forward become the third-largest party in March elections ending five years of outright junta rule.</p>
      <p>The party’s popularity also earned the charismatic leader a spot in Time’s 100 Next list released earlier this month.</p>
      <p>But he has been suspended from attending parliament since the Election Commission accused him of breaking polling laws by holding media shares.</p>
      <p>Thailand’s Constitutional Court is set to rule on the case at 2pm Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn says the legal challenge is intended to hobble the party, which has called for an end to military conscription and a slash in defence spending.</p>
      <p>The court disbanded a different anti-military opposition party linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra right before the March vote.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn has repeatedly insisted the 675,000 shares he held in V-Luck Media were sold to his mother on January 8 — weeks before he registered to run as a candidate.</p>
      <p>But he told AFP last week that regardless of the decision the reformist Future Forward is much stronger than it was a year ago.</p>
      <p>“It is not about me; it is about other dreams,” he said, adding that whatever ruling is handed down he will not step away from politics.</p>
      <p>His rival is Thai premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha, a general who led the coup in 2014 and was voted in as civilian premier with the help of junta-appointed senators.</p>
      <p>Future Forward has also come under fire for being a rare voice of criticism against Thailand’s royalist establishment.</p>
      <p>The monarchy, one of the world’s richest and headed by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, is at the apex of Thai power.</p>
      <p>Last month, 70 Future Forward MPs voted against a royal decree transferring two key army units to the direct control of the king — an unprecedented political objection to a royal command.</p>
      <p>The decree still passed parliament with an overwhelming majority.</p>
