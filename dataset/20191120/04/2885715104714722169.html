      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T04:49:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 04:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sukrita-baruah/" target="_blank">Sukrita Baruah</a></address>
      <p>Of 1,145 private schools across eight districts in Delhi, 976 are not paying their teachers as per the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/7th-pay-commission/">7th Pay Commission</a>. Even as the education department said showcause notices are being prepared for all of them, a large number of these schools claimed their fees are not high enough for them to pay their teachers more.</p>
      <p>In an affidavit submitted to the Delhi High Court Tuesday, the Directorate of Education (DoE) stated that according to data collected from eight out of 12 administrative districts, with a total of 1,145 recognised private schools operating in them, only 169 have implemented the 7th Pay Commission salaries.</p>
      <p>In fact, out of 302 private schools in the North East district, only seven have implemented it.</p>
      <p>The DoE submitted that showcause notices are being issued to these schools and that as per the law, they can either derecognise the school or take over its management.</p>
      <p>The affidavit was in response to a petition filed in court to direct the schools to implement the revised pay scales, referring to the difference in pay between government and private school teachers as discriminatory.</p>
      <p>The affidavit also included responses from some schools — almost all have claimed that their fees are not sufficient to implement the same.</p>
      <p>Several submitted that the fees they collect are too modest. For instance, Rockvale Public School in Naraina village claimed it does not have sufficient funds as its students are from low-income families and they charge a monthly fee of Rs 855. Many are among private schools built on public land which cannot increase their fees without DoE approval, after an audit of their finances.</p>
      <p>“We have found ourselves sandwiched. Necessary fee increases have been pending for the last three-four years. We want to pay our teachers more but how do we do it with present resources?,” said Sunita Swaraj, principal, The Heritage School, Vasant Kunj.</p>
