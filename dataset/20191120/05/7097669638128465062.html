      <p>"I am extremely proud of the agents' heightened vigilance and hard work in stopping this unusual smuggling scheme," San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Douglas Harrison <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/smuggler-uses-remote-controlled-car-transport-meth?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">said in a press release Tuesday</a>.</p>
