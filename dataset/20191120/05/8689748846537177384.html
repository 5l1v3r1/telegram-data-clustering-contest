      <p>One of the biggest performances recorded at the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards which was held on November 16 at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra was that of Medikal.</p>
      <p>The rapper appeared on stage with new internet sensation, Mmebusem aka local Jesus, sending the crowd into a state of frenzy.</p>
      <p>Their well rehearsed stagecraft excited the audience and it made Medikal arguably the standout performer of the evening.</p>
      <p>It seems Medikal was so impressed with what Mmebusem brought to the table so he decided to reward him handsomely after the show.</p>
      <p>In a new photo, the local Jesus is seen posing with a beautiful bike which seems to be a gift from the VGMA Best Rapper of the Year.</p>
