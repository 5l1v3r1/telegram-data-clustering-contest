      <p>Bayelsa governor, Seriake Dickson, has described the just concluded governorship election in the state as a military coup.</p>
      <p>Addressing journalists in Yenagoa on Tuesday, November 19, Governor Dickson tendered video evidence to support his claims that the poll was rigged in the state to favour the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>According to him, the election was a charade and a carefully orchestrated plan to forcefully take over Bayelsa state towards entrenching a one-party system in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He alleged that there was connivance of security agents particularly the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/nigeria-army.html">Nigerian Army</a> with the APC thugs to hijack electoral materials in most local government areas.</p>

      </p>
      <p>His words:<i> “What has happened in Bayelsa is one of the most brazen acts of distortion and r*ape of our democracy.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“What took place was not a democratic election. It was a military coup. It was the height of conspiracy by the federal government and security agencies to subvert the democratic rights of our people for the sole purpose of foisting the APC on the people.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It has never been like this before. In 2015, it wasn’t as bad as this. In this case, not only was the army directed to take over our place, but to collude with the APC thugs to unleash terror on our people.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Dickson also dismissed the notion that it was disagreement between him and former President Goodluck Jonathan that led to the defeat of the PDP at the poll.</p>
      <p>He said Jonathan remained a leader of the entire country whose image and reputation was too weighty to be dragged in the mud by the APC.</p>

      <p><i>“No politician has stood by Jonathan more than me. They simply used his name and image to legitimize an illegitimacy. I can see the strategic content,”</i> he said.</p>
