      <p>A parent standing up for their children is often expected and regarded as the responsible thing to do. However, it appears some parents take this expectation to the extreme and as is with this case, trend for all the wrong reasons.</p>
      <p>Currently causing a buzz on social media is a video of a woman fighting a school security guard in broad daylight. According to the gist, the woman whose daughter is a student of the famous Queens College had brought her daughter to school.</p>
      <p>However, due to the fact that the teenage girl was spotted with eyelash extensions, she was asked to go back home. Though the details of what exactly was said is quite sketchy, a fight soon ensued between the mother of the girl and one of the security guard.</p>
