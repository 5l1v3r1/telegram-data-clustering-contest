      <p>Those who answered ‘don’t know’ were removed from the result.</p>
      <p>Further questioning showed 45% regarded Labour’s Mr Corbyn was more trustworthy compared with 40% for the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>On who came across as more likeable, 54% said Mr Johnson and 37% Mr Corbyn.</p>

      <p>The PM was judged to have performed better on Brexit (63%-27%) and Mr Corbyn won on the NHS (54%-38%).</p>
      <p>A total of 60% said it was right to have just two party leaders involved in the debate, 30% would have preferred more, 9% did not mind either way and 1% answered ‘don’t know’.</p>
      <p>YouGov said 1,646 people were surveyed for the poll.</p>
      <h3>Their best and worst moments</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Jeremy Corbyn</b>
      </p>

        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_985749151.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C360&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>People liked his stance on the NHS but his Brexit stance drew ridicule (Picture: PA)</figcaption>

      <p>
        <b>Best</b>
      </p>
      <p>The applause was loud when Mr Corbyn criticised the Tories for putting the NHS under ‘incredible pressure’ and called for an end to privatisation and for proper funding.</p>
      <p>He also evoked a powerful image when he discussed his friend, the campaigner Jayne Rae, who died from breast cancer days after describing being left in ‘extreme pain’ in hospital without treatment for hours.</p>
      <p>Perhaps his wittiest response was when the PM accused him of wanting to form a ‘chaotic coalition’ with the SNP and, in a reference to the Conservative-Lib Dem government, Mr Corbyn replied: ‘We’ve witnessed nine years of chaotic coalition already.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Worst</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn was under pressure over his stance on Brexit and whether there would be a further referendum on Scottish independence if Labour came to power.</p>
      <p>When pressed by the PM, Mr Corbyn could not rule out another IndyRef if he became prime minister and could only say it would not come in the ‘early years’.</p>
      <p>And, after declining to say whether he would campaign for any new Brexit deal he might broker with Brussels, Mr Corbyn was met with laughter when he said: ‘I’ve made the position clear.’</p>

        <b>Boris Johnson</b>

        <figcaption>Boris was praised for pressing Corbyn on Brexit but his private life was a thorn (Picture: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Best</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservative leader repeatedly asked Mr Corbyn whether he would campaign for Leave or Remain in his proposed second referendum.</p>
      <p>But Mr Corbyn repeatedly sidestepped the question, playing into Mr Johnson’s hand as he sought to suggest that Labour’s policy on Brexit is unclear.</p>
      <p>Conservative cabinet ministers seized on the moment, with Michael Gove saying: ‘There was open laughter at Jeremy Corbyn’s failure to answer the questions on Brexit. People want Brexit done, they want an end to the paralysis.’</p>
      <p>
        <b>Worst</b>
      </p>
      <p>Questions about the Prime Minister’s private life – and his use of disputed figures – have prompted questions about whether he is a trustworthy character.</p>
      <p>Audience members laughed when Mr Johnson answered a question about trust and personal integrity during the debate – and there were further chuckles when he said the truth matters in the election.</p>
      <p>He brought yet more laughter when he asked voters instead to ‘look at what I’ve said I’m going to do as a politician and look at what I’ve delivered’.</p>
