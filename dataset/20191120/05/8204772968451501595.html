      <p>Agent Harvey is offering a well-located warehouse and office premises in Johnstown, Co Kildare for sale/to let at a guide price of €6.25 million and a quoting rent of €675,000 per annum.</p>
      <p>Located within a two-minute drive of the N7 and a 15-minute drive from the M50 motorway, the subject property extends to a gross external area of 10,554sq m (113,603sq ft), and sits on a site of 2.26 hectares (5.6 acres), which is fully utilised to provide a large yard for loading and truck-parking areas.</p>
      <p>A total of 8,213sq m (88,404sq ft) of warehouse space is available, with a clear internal height of 6.7m. The majority of this space is racked in a wide-aisle format at present, but could be adjusted to provide more pallet spaces. Loading access is via eight dock levellers and four level access doors.</p>
      <p>The unit also provides 1,870sq m (20,128sq ft) of two-storey headquarter offices, which are in turnkey condition. The office space includes a light-filled atrium at reception, a large board room, meeting rooms, toilet and shower facilities, a large canteen and a mixture of cellular and open-plan offices. There is generous car parking provided to the front of the offices.</p>
      <p>Johnstown itself is located just 3.3 km from Naas town centre, and 34km from Dublin.</p>
      <p>Kevin McHugh of Harvey says: “Given its excellent, accessible location and the specification on offer, this property offers great value for a warehouse and office headquarters.”</p>
