      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York officials plan to spend up to $60 million to make sure state residents are fully counted in the 2020 Census.</p>
      <p>Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday said up to $40 million from existing resources will be used to help encourage residents to complete the Census questionnaire. Another $20 million will support targeted efforts in hard-to-reach communities.</p>
      <p>Census counts affect the flow of federal funding and determine how many seats each state has in the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>The Trump Administration was unsuccessful in its effort to include a citizenship question on the Census. But many advocates and public officials in New York fear publicity about the attempt spread fear in immigrant communities.</p>
