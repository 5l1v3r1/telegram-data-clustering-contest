      <p>The <a href="http://futurearchitectureplatform.org/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com">Future Architecture Platform</a> has issued its 5th Call for Ideas asking multi-disciplinary creatives who work on transformative projects and ideas for the future of architecture to apply for participation in the <a href="http://futurearchitectureplatform.org/open-call/?utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=archdaily.com">2020 European Architecture Program</a>. The <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/future-architecture-platform">Future Architecture Platform</a> acts as a platform for exchange and networking for European architecture and integrates some of Europe’s most important architectural events.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/future-architecture-platform">Future Architecture Platform</a> enables practices and participants to easily connect and build joint projects. As organizers state, Future Architecture is changing the "very foundations of architecture in Europe and beyond. Its goal is to explore boundaries. To break down walls. To build new systems. To form new coalitions." Practices can exchange ideas and projects with peers from all over the world as well as high-profile institutions – museums, galleries, publishing houses, biennials and festivals – to find avenues toward international recognition.</p>
      <p>
        <b>From the organizers:</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are inviting multidisciplinary emerging professionals from all over the globe to apply with transformative projects related to our living environments. Send us your completed projects, your theoretical or conceptual propositions for spatial, social or cultural innovation, and join our discussion about the future of architecture. We welcome projects that address:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Systemic changes (prototypes and systems)</li>
        <li>Site-specific cases (projects customized for certain contexts and tasks; cannot be replicated)</li>
        <li>Next alliances (cross-, trans- and multi-disciplinary projects, exploring new design processes and methodology)</li>
        <li>New written narratives (Writing Grant for writers exploring the worlds, landscapes and realities faced by emerging practices shaping future urban environments)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Future Architecture’s board of members will invite selected applicants to present their projects at the Creative Exchange in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and to engage in possible activities within the European Architecture program. The platform will cover travel (from within the EU) and accommodation costs for selected participants. Platform members will cover travel (from within the EU) and accommodation costs, and will provide an honorarium to the participants that they invite to contribute to their events. All applications will be published on the website of the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/future-architecture">Future Architecture</a> platform. The applications will be judged by the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/future-architecture">Future Architecture</a> board of members, the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/future-architecture">Future Architecture</a> alumni, and members of the public through online voting.</p>
