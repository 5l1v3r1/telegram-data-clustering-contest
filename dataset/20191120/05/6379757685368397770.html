      <p>Naturally, one would expect, Esteemed Reader, that you are beginning to draw-up elaborate plans which will be implemented in due time as family members from far and wide begin to converge at home which, of course, will be the focal point of the End-of-Year festivities for so many families across our great and beloved country.</p>
      <p>Pleasingly though, despite the significance of this special period in the year, we sports buffs will doubtlessly glean a lot of hearty cheer from the fact that in the ever-dynamic sports industry, there is absolutely no rest for the wicked.</p>
      <p>This then, brings me to the central argument of this commentary, which concerns our readiness for the quadrennial Olympic Games that will take place next year in one of the world's leading and most prominent cities, Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is alarming to note that precious few words have been uttered that relate to our readiness or lack thereof for an extraordinary sporting spectacle which in some circles has been dubbed the 'Greatest Show on Earth'.</p>
      <p>The really unsettling thing about our seemingly perpetual failure to meticulously prepare for big-time events like the Olympics and All Africa Games is that we relive or re-enact this same deeply frustrating episode out of a truly nightmarish movie every four years.</p>
      <p>Just in case, Dear Reader, you may need more details to sufficiently recall the infuriating episode in question, I shall endeavor to do just that.</p>
      <p>Our modus operandi where prepping for the Olympic Games is concerned has astonishingly and unfailingly followed the same self-destructive pattern for many a year now.</p>
      <p>Sadly, it has become our custom to dilly-dally where our preparations are concerned right up to the Eleventh Hour, which is when all of a sudden our sports administrators see the light and purposefully swing into action.</p>
      <p>Naturally, as one would expect, last-minute preparations in any walk of life rarely yield the desired results and this is especially true of the cutthroat realm of sports where no quarters are asked for and none given.</p>
      <p>Indeed, our exceedingly poor preparations for events like the Olympics have meant that our athletes usually return home with no medals and egg smashed all over their faces, the heroics of Alphonce Simbu at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics notwithstanding.</p>
      <p>However, the recurring vexatious episode does not merely end there. In the immediate aftermath of our woeful showings at Olympic Games of yesteryear, our sports officials would customarily promise us the earth, moon and the stars where winning medals are concerned but predictably this never comes to pass.</p>
      <p>As stated earlier, apart from Simbu's impeccable exertions, we replay this same sequence of events of leaving things until the last gasp every four years, almost as if we are inherently programmed to do so. Doubtlessly, it is a fitting example of deja vu if ever there was one.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, despite the mammoth size of this problem, we are all aware of the only solution that can effectively address this major predicament.</p>
      <p>It is just a shame that we have yet to engage in early preparations for the Olympic Games to date.</p>
