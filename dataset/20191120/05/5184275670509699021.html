      <p>Lyricist Irshad Kamil, popular for his work in films such as <i>Jab We Met</i>, <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/rockstar-review-2/"><i>Rockstar</i></a> and <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/reviews/aashiqui-2-movie-review/"><i>Aashiqui 2</i></a>, has penned a song for young singer Shyamoli Sanghi. The song,<i> Ladka mamula sa</i>, has been composed by Ravi Singhal.</p>
      <p>Shyamoli said: “I think that the combination of the song’s intricate orchestration by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra, lilting melody and unique lyrical imagery makes it extremely enchanting.</p>

      <p>“I’m honoured to work with veteran lyricist Irshad Kamil Sir who gave us this unique interpretation of love that we often imagine a dream of an extraordinary person who will enter our lives and immediately sweep us off our feet, but more often than not, it is someone who is seemingly normal but is extraordinary in a way we perceive them that makes us fall in love with them. This was relatable and was brought to life by both Irshad Sir and Ravi. Also, the intense orchestral composition warranted nothing short of a live orchestral recording to justify its intensity. Singing in Budapest along with such a well-prepared, powerful orchestra was truly a dream come true.”</p>
      <p>Speaking about its animated video, Shyamoli said: “I think the concept of the video definitely resonates with me because I realise how imperative it is to protect our environment and nature around us. As we all know and hopefully believe, climate change is the harshest reality of today and we must leave no stone unturned to make sure that we try to conserve whatever resources we have on this planet. The video of the song conveys this idea through the story of two people who deeply care about our environment.”</p>
      <p>Irshad heaped praise on Shyamoli, calling her “an extremely talented young girl”.</p>
      <p>“When I heard the intense orchestral composition, I knew this had to tell a powerful story. From there was born the idea of a unique love story. We travelled all the way to Budapest to record it live and I feel the harmony along with the lyrics will definitely strike a chord with the audience,” he said.</p>
      <p>The song has been released by ZEE music company in India and is marketed by Masala Chai Productions.</p>
