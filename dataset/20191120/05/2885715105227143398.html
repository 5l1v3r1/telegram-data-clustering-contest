      <h1>Hitler’s birthplace to be turned into police station</h1>
      <h2>Austria's government has struggled for years to decide what to do with the house where Adolf Hitler was born, including considering tearing it down. The building will now house a police station to deter neo-Nazi tourism.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:36:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/deutsche-welle/" target="_blank">Deutsche Welle</a></address>
      <p>The building where <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/adolf-hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> spent the first few months of his life will now be turned into a regional police headquarters, the Austrian government announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“The future use of the building by police will be an unmistakable signal that this building shall never serve to commemorate National Socialism,” Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Extremists have been traveling to the town to have their pictures taken in front of the house, news agency DPA reported, citing local witnesses.</p>

        <b>Legal battle over Hitler house</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police won’t move in right away, as the government is holding an EU-wide architectural competition to redesign the building and outer facade.</p>
      <p>According to the Interior Ministry, the winner of the contest is expected to be announced in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s decision comes after a lengthy legal battle between the Austrian government and the previous owner of the house.</p>
      <p>In early 2017, the government expropriated the building from its private owner, triggering a years-long legal battle over compensation.</p>
      <p>The legal battle finished in August this year, with the government paying €810,000 ($897,600 at today’s exchange rates).</p>

        <b>From Nazi cult site to police station</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hitler, who led Nazi Germany into a global war that killed more than 50 million people, was born in an apartment on the top floor of the building in 1889. He lived there for a few months before his parents moved to Passau, Germany.</p>
      <p>When the Nazis came to power, they turned the house in Braunau am Inn into a form of fascist center.</p>
      <p>After World War II, the building was used as a library, a care center for the disabled and a technical school.</p>
      <p>The Austrian government previously considered a range of proposals for the building, including possibly demolishing it.</p>
