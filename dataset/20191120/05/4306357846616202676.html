      <h3>Xherdan Shaqiri has told friends that he wants to quit Liverpool FC next summer due to his lack of playing time, according to reports.</h3>
      <p><i>Football Insider</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205288/Liverpool-transfer-news-Mohamed-Salah-Sadio-Mane-Xherdan-Shaqiri-future">Daily Express</a>, is reporting that the Switzerland international is keen on a move away from Anfield next year because of his lack of first-team opportunities.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has suffered from a calf injury in recent weeks but he is said to be unhappy at Anfield because of his lack of opportunities – and he will seek a move away in the summer.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri has found his opportunities to be few and far between this season, with the 28-year-old only having featured twice in the Premier League, and both times as a substitute.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the midfielder has only made three appearances this season in all competitions and has played a mere 14 minutes of first-team football for the Reds.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Shaqiri is now closing in on a return to full fitness for the Merseyside outfit as he looks to try and force himself back into the first team at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool FC are currently preparing for their trip to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.</p>
