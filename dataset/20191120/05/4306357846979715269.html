      <p>According to the same story, the Belgian club have a good relationship with Chelsea FC after they previously sold the west London side Kevin De Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois.</p>
      <p>The report adds that the club’s sporting director Dimitri De Conde confirmed interest from Liverpool FC and Napoli in a recent interview with <i>Radio Punto Nuovo</i>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC and Napoli had the opportunity to view Norwegian prospect Berge at close quarters in their Champions League games against the Belgian side in Group E.</p>
      <p>The Reds are sitting at the top of their Champions League group following a 2-1 victory over Genk in their most recent meeting at Anfield earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten in the Premier League following a return of 11 victories and one draw in their 12 games in the English top-flight so far.</p>
