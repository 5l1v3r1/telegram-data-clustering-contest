      <p>When the Sonic movie director Jeff Fowler announced the blue blur would receive a makeover, it admittedly left us wondering how much it was going to cost Paramount Pictures, financially. There was a tweet that went viral, suggesting the redesign would cost $35 million â€“ increasing the film's total budget to $125 million, but apparently that's <i>not</i> the correct figure.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/sonic-redesign-cost-paramount-five-million-1202190493/">IndieWire</a>, a source "close to production" estimated Sonic's new look cost Paramount less than $5 million. When the decision was originally made to rework the iconic character's design and delay the film, VFX work on the film was apparently still "far from" complete. The only Sonic VFX believed to have been finished at this point was the footage on display in the original trailer, released on 30th April this year.</p>
      <p>The same source goes onto explain how the redesign was not as expensive as most believed and said any rumours about the VFX team suffering during this period were simply not true. The latest reworked trailer, which featured Sonic's redesign, was dropped earlier this month on 12th November and widely praised by fans and critics alike. The movie is due out in cinemas on Valentine's Day next year.</p>
