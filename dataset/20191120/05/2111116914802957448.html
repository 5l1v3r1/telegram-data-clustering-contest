      <p>Amazon Hub – an alternative parcel delivery network that allows customers to retrieve their goods from self-service lockers or pickup counters – has been available to Amazon's US customers since 2011. </p>
      <p>As of today, that same pickup service is available in Australia, meaning consumers can choose to have their upcoming <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday 2019</a> orders shipped to over a hundred Amazon Hub locations situated in Commonwealth Bank branches, Victorian Authorised Newsagents Association locations and Stockland shopping centres across the country. </p>
      <p>The online retail behemoth has already announced that hundreds of additional locations will become available by the end of the year, with thousands more set to open throughout 2020. </p>

      <h4>Locker and Counter options</h4>
      <p>As the name would suggest, Amazon Hub's Locker service lets users pick up their items from a self-service kiosk at a location of their choosing, while its Counter service invites customers to collect their parcels from store partners – the idea being that increased on-foot shop traffic will drive new customers.</p>
      <p>In order to use Amazon Hub, customers must simply proceed to checkout during the purchase process, where they can choose the Locker or Counter pickup point that's nearest to them. </p>
      <p>Locker customers get three days to collect their goods before they're returned to the Amazon warehouse, while stores that offer Counter pickup will hold on to your items for 14-days.</p>
      <p>
