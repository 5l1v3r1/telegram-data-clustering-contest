      <p>President of the Jamaica Teachers’ Association Owen Speid is insisting that primary schools need to be provided with school nurses.</p>
      <p>“The dengue virus is spiralling out of control,” Speid told <b>The Gleaner</b> on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Almost every day we are getting reports that children are going out with the dengue – whether they are dying or they are getting real sick. I think it is the right time for the Government to look at putting school nurses in, so that at least there is a medical person who can help to identify [symptoms],” he said.</p>
      <p>It is suspected that some 80 persons have died of dengue since the start of the year.</p>
      <p>Speid said young children attending the just over 700 primary schools are sometimes unable to express how they are feeling.</p>
      <p>Currently, guidance counsellors or teachers provide basic first-aid assistance to students.</p>
