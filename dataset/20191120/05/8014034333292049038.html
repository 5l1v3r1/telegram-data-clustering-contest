      <p>HAYWARD, Calif. — The Latest on a deadly stabbing on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train (all times local):</p>
      <p>10 p.m.</p>
      <p>Authorities say a stabbing that killed a passenger on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train may have occurred after the attacker tried to steal another rider’s shoes.</p>
      <p>The fight broke out Tuesday afternoon on a BART train pulling into a station in Hayward.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco Chronicle says police are looking into whether the victim was a good Samaritan who tried to stop the suspect from stealing items from another person, possibly shoes.</p>
      <p>The man ran from the station. The Chronicle says he was arrested a block away after employees of a car dealership said he tried to steal a van.</p>
      <p>Employee Steve Castro tells the paper that he fought with the shirtless man, who snatched the keys from his hand as he was showing the van to a customer.</p>

      <p>A California transit chief says a man has been stabbed to death on a San Francisco Bay Area commuter train during a fight.</p>
      <p>Interim BART Police Chief Ed Alvarez told reporters at a news conference that officials began receiving 911 calls Tuesday afternoon about a fight aboard a train between two men.</p>
      <p>He says transit officers boarded the train at the next stop and found a man bleeding, who was possibly the victim of a stabbing. He says the man died.</p>
      <p>Alvarez says transit officers quickly searched the area and were able to apprehend a suspect.</p>
      <p>He said there is no threat to the public because it was a fight between two people who engaged each other.</p>
      <p>Officials did not immediately provide any other details.</p>
