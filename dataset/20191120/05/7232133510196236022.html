        <i>Bitcoin (BTC) and the crypto market cap are now in a downtrend. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/ethereum-eth-correcting-higher-but-bears-remain-in-control/">Ethereum</a> (ETH), LTC, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/ripple-xrp-price-trading-near-crucial-juncture-can-bulls-make-it/">ripple</a>, bitcoin cash, EOS, TRX, and stellar are currently correcting higher.</i>

      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a downside break, BCH price even failed to stay above the $265 support area. It declined heavily and settled below the $250 level. The price is now consolidating above the $225 support and it could correct higher. On the upside, there are many resistances near $255 and $265.</p>
      <p>On the downside, the main support is now near $225, below which the price is likely to test the $200 support area in the near term.</p>
      <h3>Litecoin (LTC), EOS and Stellar (XLM) Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Litecoin price declined heavily after it broke the $60.00 support area. Moreover, LTC price declined below the $58.00 support area and tested the $55.00 level. It is currently consolidating losses and it might correct higher to test the $58.00 resistance area in the near term.</p>
      <p>EOS price fell significantly below the $3.500 and $3.350 support levels. It even tested the $3.050 support area and remains at a risk of more losses. If the bears push the price below the $3.050 support area, there are chances of a break below the $3.000 support area.</p>
      <p>Stellar price is trading in a bearish zone below the key $0.0700 support area. XLM price broke the $0.0685 and $0.0650 support levels. The price is currently correcting higher, but it is likely to face resistance near $0.0685. On the downside, the key supports are near $0.0650 and $0.0635.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL/">chart</a>, there is a strong downward move below the $230.0B and $220.0B support levels. The crypto market cap even tested the $210.0B support area, coinciding with bitcoin testing the $8,000 level. The market cap is currently correcting higher, but upsides may face hurdles near $220.0B and $225.0B levels. On the downside, a break below $210.0B could lead the cap towards the $200.0B level.</p>
      <p>Therefore, rallies or recovery remain limited in bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, litecoin, ripple, XLM, BCH, ADA, BNB, TRX, ICX, and other altcoins in the near term.</p>
