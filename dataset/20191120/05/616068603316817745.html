      <p>The man accused of <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Salmon-Arm/254043/shock-and-disbelief">shooting and killing</a> a 78-year-old church elder in Salmon Arm earlier this year has completed a psychiatric assessment to determine if he can be held criminally responsible.</p>
      <p>Matrix Gathergood, 25, was arrested on the morning of April 14, after he allegedly walked into Salmon Arm's Church of Christ during a church service and shot two people inside. Gordon Parmenter died at the scene, while Paul Derkach was seriously injured.</p>
      <p>The shooting <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Salmon-Arm/254938/600-mourn-shooting-victim">shocked the Shuswap community</a>. Salmon Arm Mayor Alan Harrison described Parmenter as a “very caring” man who fostered many young people in the community.</p>
      <p>Gathergood is facing charges of first-degree murder and aggravated assault. He has remained in custody since his arrest.</p>
      <p>The psychiatric assessment of Gathergood will help determine if he can be found not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder.</p>
      <p>Gathergood's case came through Salmon Arm's provincial court Tuesday, but since the report had just recently been completed, the court date was adjourned to allow the Crown and defence to thoroughly review the report.</p>
      <p>The case will be back before the courts on Dec. 3.</p>
