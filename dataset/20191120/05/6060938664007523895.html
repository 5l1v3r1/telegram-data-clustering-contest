      <p>SYDNEY: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s 16-year-old seamer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Naseem-Shah">Naseem Shah</a> will make his debut against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Australia">Australia</a> in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, the touring side's captain Azhar Ali said on Wednesday on the eve of the first Test.</p>
      <p>The schoolboy cricketer from Lower Dir district on the Afghanistan border would eclipse former home captain Ian Craig as the youngest Test debutant on Australian soil.</p>
      <p>Craig took the field as a 17-year-old against South Africa in 1953, scoring a half-century at the Melbourne <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Ground.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely looking to play him," Ali told reporters in Brisbane. "He's bowling really well. We'll announce the side tomorrow (Thursday) but he's definitely going to be part of it."</p>
      <p>Naseem has only seven first-class matches under his belt but could hardly ask for a better pitch for his first Test outing, with the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gabba">Gabba</a> usually serving up a fast and bouncy wicket.</p>
