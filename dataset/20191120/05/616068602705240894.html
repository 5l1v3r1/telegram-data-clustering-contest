      <p>Monday morning, a group of environmental and animal rights activists chained themselves to the doors of Interior Savings in Kelowna in an effort to get the credit union to stop sponsoringÂ Ribfest.</p>
      <p>The group's demands were not met, and members were removed by RCMP after several hours.</p>
      <p>Castanet hit the streets to find out if people think this way of protesting is effective.</p>
