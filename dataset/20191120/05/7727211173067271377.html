      <h1>Campaign to honour Liverpool man who changed the way we see the night sky</h1>
      <h2>Jeremiah Horrocks from Toxteth was just 22 when he died but made a major astronomical discovery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/lisa-rand/" target="_blank">Lisa Rand</a></address>
      <p>A group of local artists are campaigning for a permanent memorial in the city to Liverpool astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks.</p>
      <p>The astronomer, who was brought up in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/toxteth">Toxteth</a>, came from a "humble background" yet went on to make a remarkable discovery - mapping the Transit of Venus and in the process transforming our understanding of astronomy.</p>
      <p>The campaign, led by Liverpool artist Philip Garrett, is being launched at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/central-library">Liverpool Central Library</a> on November 30.</p>
      <p>Plans include a crowdfunding campaign for a life-size bronze statue in Liverpool and Lancashire, where he made his discovery.</p>

      <p>Jeremiah Horrocks was born in Toxteth Park in 1618.</p>
      <p>He was a member of the congregation at what is now known as the Ancient Chapel of Toxteth, and came from a "humble background."</p>
      <p>His talents were recognised at an early age and with the help of the congregation at the chapel he went on to win a place at University of Cambridge, where he worked his way through university as a sizar, waiting on the dinner tables of the university's wealthier students.</p>

      <p>He left Cambridge in 1635 without graduating and ended up back in Liverpool helping out his father in the watch-making trade.</p>
      <p>He then moved to Much Hoole, where he correctly predicted the transit of Venus on November 24, 1639, dying just two years later of unknown causes.</p>
      <p>His treatise on the transit of Venus was published 20 years after his death and secured his place in astronomical history.</p>

      <p>In Liverpool, there is a large plaque in the Ancient Chapel of Toxteth to the remarkable astronomer, yet no other public memorials exist in the city.</p>
      <p>The Jeremiah Horrocks Statue Campaign is being launched at the Hornby Reading Room in Liverpool Central Library on November 30 at 2.45pm and will include speeches by astronomical historian Dr Allan Chapman from University of Oxford as well as film maker and author Frank Cottrell Boyce.</p>
      <p>Artist and sculptor Philip Garrett has already produced a miniature model of the sculpture.</p>

      <p>Although there are no surviving pictures of Jeremiah Horrocks, Philip has imagined the young astronomer using clothes from the day and posed mid-investigation, holding a cross-staff - an instrument he would have used to help him with his calculations.</p>
      <p>Philip told the ECHO: "I'm passionate about Horrocks.</p>
      <p>"He was making discoveries from the age of 14 and was operating when people said the earth was the centre of the universe. His work could have got him into a lot of trouble.</p>
      <p>"He had the hands of a craftsman, the mind of a mathematician and a big heart. When Newton talked about standing on the shoulders of giants - one of those giants was Horrocks.</p>
      <p>"If he lived longer, who knows what else he would have discovered."</p>
      <p>The campaign is being supported by the Liverpool Astronomical Society and the aim is to gain support from other astronomical organisations and from industry, and the campaign is also hoping to build in educational links, following a successful programme earlier this year with UTC Life Sciences, which is based in the Baltic Triangle.</p>

      <p>Philip said: "We're in troubled times. It's not about asking the man in the street - many industries use trigonometry, magnetism and gravity - we're asking for corporations to come forward who could lose a little money and help us tell the general public about this remarkable man.</p>
      <p>“He was only 22 when he died, yet in his brief life he changed the course of Science. </p>
      <p>"A statue in the public domain would inspire future generations and be a reminder that someone from a humble background achieved greatness and influenced the rest of the world.”</p>
