      <p>Air quality in the Delhi-NCR region remained in the poor category on Wednesday with an AQI of 282. According to the Safar prediction the pollution may rise in the next few days due to low winds and farm fires.</p>
      <p>According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the city''s overall air quality index (AQI) read 282 at 8.50 am. The neighbouring areas of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded AQI at 364 and 349 respectively. Noida had an AQI of 323.</p>
      <p>The weatherman has forecast partly cloudy skies for the day.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Delhi recorded a high of 27.1 degrees Celsius and a low of 12.3 degrees Celsius.</p>
      <p>After a brief respite, air quality in the national capital deteriorated again yesterday due to calm winds and increased impact of farm fires, official said.</p>
      <p>An AQI between 201 and 300 is considered "poor", 301-400 "very poor" and 401-500 "severe".</p>
      <p>Calm winds and low ventilation index are predicted for the next few days and the condition is conducive for the sudden accumulation of pollutants in the Delhi region, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) had said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The air quality is likely to deteriorate to the higher end of the "very poor" category today and to the lower end of the "severe" category by November 21, it had warned, adding from November 23, a fresh western disturbance is expected to increase the wind speed and improve ventilation.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court-mandated anti-pollution authority, EPCA, had asked Delhi and NCR states on Monday to step up surveillance and enforcement to check local sources of pollution and crop burning in view of the predicted dip in air quality.</p>
      <p>It had warned that the situation will worsen if there is light rain, which would be inadequate to wash away the pollutants and add to the moisture instead. EPCA had said hot mix plants, ready mix plants, and stone crushers will continue to remain closed in Delhi-NCR.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court on November 4 banned construction and demolition activities in the region till further notice. <br/><i><br/>(Inputs from ANI and PTI)</i></p>
