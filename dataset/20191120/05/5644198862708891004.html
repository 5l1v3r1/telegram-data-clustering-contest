      <p>DUBAI: Hong Kong fans turned their backs to the Chinese national anthem once again but supported their team and were rewarded with a 2-0 win in Asian qualifying over Cambodia on Tuesday (Nov 19).</p>
      <p>Before the match, home fans jeered and turned their backs to the pitch as the Chinese national anthem played. FIFA fined the Hong Kong Football Association 15,000 Swiss francs (13,700 euros or HK$117,944) following a similar incident before the Sep 10 match against Iran.</p>

      <p>Despite the disparity in numbers, the hard-working Roberto Affonso Junior was still surrounded by four Cambodian defenders when he spun on the edge of the box five minutes later and curled the ball into the net.</p>

      <p>Qatar, the 2022 World Cup hosts, secured their third successive win in Group E with a 1-0 away triumph over a battling Afghanistan. The all-important goal at the neutral venue in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, was scored by forward Akram Afif when he converted a penalty in the 76th minute.</p>
      <p>Also in Group E, Oman beat India, 1-0, with a goal by Mohsin Al Ghassani in the 33rd minute. Oman have 12 points from five matches, one behind the Qatar. India, who needed a win to keep their hopes alive, are fourth behind Afghanistan with three points from three draws in five matches.</p>
