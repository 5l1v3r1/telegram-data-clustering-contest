      <h1>Friends iconic props up for grabs and fans can bid to own bits of TV history</h1>
      <h2>Would you like to have Chandler's canoe in your front room? What about Hugsy? You could even get your hands on Monica’s famous front door frame if you have the money!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:44:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:44</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>If you have ever fancied owning a little bit of television history, then your wait could be over.</p>
      <p>Props from telly hit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/friends">Friends</a> are about to go up for auction - with the <a href="https://propstore.com/Friends/">cash going towards an LGBTQ+ charity.</a></p>
      <p>Tempted? You could get your hands on Hugsy, Joey's much-loved stuffed penguin.</p>
      <p>Monica and Chandler’s wedding invitation is also going under the hammer - both items are expected to raise around $1,500.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Chandler, the wood canoe he was forced to used as makeshift living room furniture is also up for grabs. That could sell for $6,000 (£4,600).</p>
      <p>Yes, even the turkey head with sunglasses which Monica wore to cheer up Chandler is on offer.... we thought it was real, too.</p>

      <p>Looking for Christmas inspiration? Bidding is set to begin in early December. But there's more.</p>
      <p>You can even own a bit of friends porn, if that floats your boat.</p>
      <p>The film made by Phoebe’s sister Ursula - Buffay the Vampire Layer - is in need of a home.</p>
      <p>But if you want Monica's iconic peep hole - one of the last things shown before the curtain came down in 2004 - you better act fast and have deep pockets.</p>

      <p>It could go for as much as $50,000.</p>
      <p>Brandon Alinger, COO of Prop Store, said: "Prop Store is thrilled to be working with Warner Bros to auction some incredible material from all 10 seasons of Friends.</p>
      <p>"The series gave us so many laughs during its original run and continues to entertain and inspire fans around the world.</p>

      <p>"It’s an honour to be able to bring some amazing original pieces to the fans, such as Joey’s original Hugsy doll.</p>
      <p>"We’re also happy to offer detailed studio-edition reproductions, including the Holiday Armadillo costume, Central Perk couch and 10 copies of Monica’s peephole door frame, straight from the Warner Bros props department."</p>
