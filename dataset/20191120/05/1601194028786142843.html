      <p>When <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> was hired by Fox to be on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Backstage, it was hinted that he wasn't going to hold back on his opinions.</p>
      <p>Well, according to <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/cm-punk-says-big-dog-segment-is-bad-creative-blue-wwe-title-is-stupid-praises-rey-mysterio-brock-lesnar-feud/?fbclid=IwAR37GJrsRPHxzjFyUA8iHAckkqEfqVLbeiv7vCsw33hWt49fQabQU3d1hAE">wrestlingnews.co</a>, it looks like Punk doesn't care for the new look of the WWE Universal Title, which <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> revealed recently on WWE SmackDown.</p>
      <p>It's been interesting to see how fans have reacted to the recent designs of WWE Championship belts. Some wrestling fans have liked the look of it while others wish that WWE would go back to the old look of the titles.</p>
      <p>It's suffice to say that in terms of belt designs, nothing comes close to the "Winged Eagle" belt but that's beside the point.</p>

      <p>With Bray Wyatt as WWE Universal Champion, fans were looking to see what kind of interesting designs would be revealed with it. In that respect, some wrestling fans felt that changing it to blue was not what they expected.</p>
      <p>On WWE Backstage, CM Punk said that the blue WWE Universal Title is "stupid" and tried to get Paige to agree with him. Paige just laughed it off, without actually saying otherwise.</p>
      <p>It looks like Punk is staying true to his word and trying to be himself as he becomes an integral part of WWE Backstage. It's going to be interesting to see what he says the next time around.</p>
