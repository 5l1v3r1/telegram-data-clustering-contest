        <b>The General Medical Council is planning to work more closely with NHS trusts and other organisations on how they investigate staff conduct locally.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a letter sent earlier this month to NHS chief people officer Prerana Issar, GMC chief executive Charlie Massey set out plans to develop a pilot project called “local first”.</p>
      <p>The project aims to enable the GMC to make fitness to practise decisions based on evidence gathered in local investigations to “streamline and speed up the process”.</p>
      <p>The regulator said it is currently choosing the pilot sites and will develop the scheme in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Mr Massey said the scheme would involve the GMC “quality assuring pilot trusts’ local processes based on our principles for a good investigation”, and the pilot should improve the “consistency of approach in local investigations”.</p>
      <p>Mr Massey was responding to a letter sent by Ms Issar to all healthcare professional regulatory bodies earlier this month, which called for “initial thoughts” on a common framework for handling concerns about NHS staff.</p>
      <p>She said there would be “extensive engagement” on this, adding there was “an appetite” for the development of common framework from human resources directors.</p>
      <p>The recommendation for a common framework was set out by an advisory group, which was developed by the national regulators in response to the death of nurse Amin Abdullah in February 2016.</p>
      <p>A senior nurse at Charing Cross Hospital, <a href="https://www.verita.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Imperial-Final-report-9-August-18.pdf">Mr Abdullah was suspended from Imperial College Healthcare Trust in September 2015 and dismissed in December.</a> He went on to take his own life in February 2016.</p>
      <p>Ms Issar also said all regulators and professional bodies should consider offering guidance on a “range of specific issues that are relevant to management responsibilities exercised by registrants”.</p>
      <p>Mr Massey said the GMC would welcome a new common framework and said a reformed approach could support “greater openness and opportunities for learning for all healthcare professionals”.</p>
      <p>“The NHS People Plan provides a good opportunity to better align regulatory responses on a number of issues which arise frequently,” Mr Massey said. “These include how we and system regulators assess and support leadership and governance, induction, professional behaviours and continuing professional development.”</p>
      <p>Mr Massey added: “Working with local clinical governance systems to ensure consistent local investigations that are fair, robust and<b> </b>transparent, we can cut needless duplication and reduce the stress of our investigations on everyone involved.”</p>
