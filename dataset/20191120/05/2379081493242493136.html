      <h1>Yuan slips to fresh 2-week low on Trump's tariff warning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:20:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:20</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>SHANGHAI — China’s yuan slipped to a new</p>
      <p>two-week low against the dollar on Wednesday morning, in</p>
      <p>response to a much weaker midpoint and signs of tension between</p>
      <p>Beijing and Washington.</p>
      <p>Prospects for a trade deal turned bleaker after U.S.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump threatened to raise fresh tariffs on</p>
      <p>Chinese goods if negotiations fail.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said</p>
      <p>he had a good relationship with China, noting that China was</p>
      <p>“moving along.” However, he said China would have to make a deal</p>
      <p>“I like.”</p>
      <p>China on Wednesday also condemned the U.S. Senate passing</p>
      <p>legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong,</p>
      <p>vowing to take the steps necessary to safeguard its sovereignty</p>
      <p>and security.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty around Sino-U.S. relations dented market</p>
      <p>sentiment, with both corporate clients and proprietary traders</p>
      <p>unwilling to pick a direction for the yuan for now.</p>
      <p>Prior to market opening, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)</p>
      <p>set the midpoint rate at 7.0118 per dollar, 88 pips</p>
      <p>weaker than the previous fix of 7.003, and was the weakest since</p>
      <p>Nov. 5.</p>
      <p>In the spot market, onshore yuan opened at 7.0330</p>
      <p>per dollar and eased to a low of 7.0345 at one point in morning</p>
      <p>trade, the weakest since Nov. 4.</p>
      <p>As of midday, the spot yuan was changing hands at 7.0304, 32</p>
      <p>pips weaker than the previous late session close.</p>
      <p>“Any tiny news around the trade talks could bring volatility</p>
      <p>to the market for now,” said a trader at a Chinese bank, adding</p>
      <p>investors were awaiting confirmation before making huge bets on</p>
      <p>the yuan.</p>
      <p>OCBC Wing Hang Bank said in a note that the yuan’s</p>
      <p>short-term movements will largely depend on the dollar’s</p>
      <p>performance and the developments in the Sino-U.S. trade talks,</p>
      <p>“especially if the two sides will roll back existing tariffs and</p>
      <p>how big the size would be.”</p>
      <p>Separately, China announced a lower new benchmark lending</p>
      <p>rate on Wednesday, as widely expected, moving to drive down</p>
      <p>funding costs and shore up an economy hurt by slowing demand and</p>
      <p>trade tariffs.</p>
      <p>The global dollar index rose to 97.884 at midday from</p>
      <p>the previous close of 97.856.</p>
      <p>The offshore yuan was trading at 7.0333 per dollar</p>
      <p>as of midday.</p>
