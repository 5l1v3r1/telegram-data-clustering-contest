      <p>Four witnesses testified in the House Intelligence Committee's marathon public impeachment hearings on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The witnesses — Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council's Ukraine expert; Tim Morrison, the former NSC director for Russia and European affairs; Jennifer Williams, a Russia adviser for Vice President Mike Pence; and former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker — testified for a combined 9.5 hours over two separate hearings. Here's a look at five key moments:</p>
      <p>
        <b>White House attacks Vindman during his testimony</b>
      </p>
      <p>The White House, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-live-updates/2019/11/15/c4b9f0f4-0726-11ea-8292-c46ee8cb3dce_story.html">following Trump's lead,</a> tweeted <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1196848072929796096">an attack</a> against Vindman while he testified Tuesday. The White House tweeted that Morrison, briefly Vindman's boss at the NSC, testified he had "concerns" about "Vindman's judgment." Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) pounced on this quote, and Vindman responded by reading parts of a glowing evaluation written by his <i>other</i> former boss, Fiona Hill. "He is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment," Hill wrote.</p>

        <b>Former Ukraine envoy revises earlier testimony</b>
      </p>
      <p>Volker had previously testified to House impeachment investigators that during a July 10 meeting with a Ukrainian defense leader, nobody discussed investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. In his opening statement Tuesday, Volker said he <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879521/kurt-volker-reverses-past-testimony-admits-sondland-brought-biden-investigations-meeting-ukraine">now remembers</a> that the meeting was "essentially over" when U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland "made a generic comment about investigations." He also backtracked on Trump's freeze of $400 million in military aid, saying he never told Ukraine there were strings attached to the money, but he "did not know" if others "were conveying a different message to them around that same time."</p>

        <b>Former National Security Council official confirms Ukraine quid pro quo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morrison revealed that Sondland told him that in a Sept. 1 meeting with Andriy Yermak, a Ukrainian official,<a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879534/former-nsc-official-tim-morrison-confirms-ukraine-quid-pro-quo-during-public-testimony"> he had informed Yermak</a> that "the Ukrainians would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted."</p>

        <b>Vindman sends a touching message to his father</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the end of his testimony, Vindman — who came to the United States from the Soviet Union as a small child — praised America and <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879391/vindman-closes-impeachment-opening-statement-touching-message-immigrant-father">spoke directly to his father</a>: "Dad, my sitting here today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision."</p>

        <b>Williams and Vindman react to being called 'Never Trumpers'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) gave Vindman and Williams the opportunity to respond to accusations — <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879089/trump-calls-pence-aide-set-publicly-testify-impeachment-inquiry-never-trumper">from Trump</a> and some of his allies — that they are "Never Trumpers," out to get the president. Williams said she's not "sure I know an official definition of a 'Never Trumper,'" but she wouldn't classify herself as one and was "surprised" Trump characterized her that way. Vindman said he would call himself "Never Partisan." Catherine Garcia</p>
