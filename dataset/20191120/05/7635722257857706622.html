      <h1>Almost 500% increase in children on prescribed psychiatric medication</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:50:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/eoghanmurphy" target="_blank">Eoghan Murphy</a></address>

        <b>The number of children who have been prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rise amounts to more than 5,300 medical card patients.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/number-teenagers-reporting-severe-anxiety-doubled-past-seven-years-survey-926573">A study by University College Dublin (UCD) and Jigsaw</a> </b>on Tuesday showed one-in-four young people in Ireland suffers from anxiety.</p>
      <p>New figures released by the HSE, under the Freedom of Information Act, shed a light on the number of people in Ireland who are being treated with medication for mental health issues.</p>
      <p>In 2009, 1,150 children under 15-years-old were prescribed psychiatric medication under the medical card scheme.</p>

      <p>But this has increased noticeably every year since then - rising to just under 6,500 children last year.</p>
      <p>Brendan Kelly is professor of psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.</p>
      <p>He says a recruitment crisis in the HSE's child and adolescent services is a factor in the trend.</p>
      <p>"We know referrals to child and adolescent psychiatry have increased by 40% over the past six or seven years or so.</p>
      <p>"And the child and adolescent mental health services have just 57% of the staff that the national policy recommends they should have.</p>
      <p>"So in this situation, you often see an increase in both referrals and an increase in prescribing".</p>
      <p>The trend is out of sync with the same statistics for general population, which has seen only a 12% rise in the same time frame.</p>
