        <b>Afghanistan’s National Football Team lost 0-1 to Asian Cup champions Qatar during their FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 and AFC Asian Cup China 2023 joint qualifying match on Tuesday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Qataris were never allowed to settle by an Afghan side that pressed the Asian Cup champions from the front, with the tactic frustrating the visitors throughout the 90 minutes of the match.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan looked the more likely to score in the early exchanges, exciting Afghan fans who attended the match to cheer their team in Tajikistan’s capital, Dushanbe.</p>
      <p>With Tuesday night’s result, Qatar remains unbeaten in their first five qualifiers and sits on top of Group E with 13 points while Afghanistan still has four points with three games left in the second phase of qualifying.</p>
      <p>Qatar, who has already qualified for the 2022 World Cup as hosts, plays India next on March 26, with Afghanistan taking on Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>In another match on Tuesday night, the Indian football team was knocked out of the 2022 World Cup qualifying round after losing 0-1 to Oman.</p>
      <p>Mohsin Al Ghassani scored the all-important goal in the 33rd minute at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex Stadium as Oman beat India for the second time in the campaign.</p>
      <p>Oman had defeated India 2-1 in their first match in September in Guwahati.</p>
