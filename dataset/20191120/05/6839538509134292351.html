      <p>A woman was abducted by her stepfather when she was 11 and taken to Mexico where she gave birth to her abuser’s eight kids.</p>
      <p>Rosalynn McGinnis was abducted from her school by her stepfather Henri Piette in 1997. <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/87ab5f427639b2a1093cc5fecdbc54ea">The kidnapping</a>, which happened in Oklahoma, was Piette’s retaliation against his wife, McGinnis’s mother.</p>
      <p>Ms McGinnis told investigators earlier this year that she met Piette when she was around 10 years old when her mother began a relationship with him.</p>
      <p>By the time she was 11, Piette had starting raping her at their home in Wagoner, Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10374791/woman-paedo-stepdad-mexico-strangers-escape/">The Sun</a>, Piette forced Ms McGinnis to “marry” him and took his stepdaughter to Mexico where she has nine of his children while living in a tent and evading US authorities.</p>

      <p>Ms McGinnis was able to flee with eight of her children and go to a US embassy in 2016 thanks to the help of strangers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/9545dd5a9e45c1b97d9d68232599519d">Piette was convicted </a>of kidnapping earlier this year, and is still waiting for an answer on rape charges.</p>
      <p>To this day he denies any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The case bears similarities to that of rapist Fritzl, who imprisoned his own daughter in a sex dungeon in Austria and fathered seven kids with her over a 24 year period.</p>
      <p>Ms McGinnis recalled the moment she was saved by observant strangers in an interview on The Dr. Oz Show, which will aired in the US on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Ms McGinnis, now 34, said: “We were in the grocery store, we were in front of them, and we had a bunch of kids, of course, and it was me and Henri Piette.</p>
      <p>“The age difference and all the children. Actually, we were short on the bill to pay for the groceries and they paid it for us.</p>
      <p>“They asked … where we lived. It started like that. Henri was the type that always kept people away.</p>
      <p>“But they knew something wasn’t right. So, they decided to do something about it.”</p>
      <p>The strangers were couple Lisa and Ian, who met Ms McGinnis and Piette while living Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
      <p>Ms McGinnis introduced herself as Stephanie and Piette as Bill – one of the many aliases they assumed over the years.</p>

      <p>The couple had made friends with Rosalynn and her eight children, but immediately began to suspect something was wrong when Piette accidentally revealed he was 62.</p>
      <p>In June this year, Lisa told KSHB: “You had eight children living in three cubicles that were little more than walk-in closet size.</p>
      <p>“(They) were all skinny as rakes. And the children said that he (Piette) said he didn’t love any of them.</p>
      <p>“We went home, and I said, ‘[McGinnis is] 32 years old.</p>
      <p>“ ‘Her oldest kid would be turning — I think at that point he was to be turning 17 — and I said, ‘That’s wrong.’</p>
      <p>“You take 17 from 32 that’s 15. He’s 62.”</p>

      <p>Lisa called ms McGinnis and said: “We know there’s something wrong. If you can get your husband either in jail or in rehab jail, which is something they do with drug addicts and alcoholics, we’ll help you.</p>
      <p>“And at that point, Bill came home and we hung up. And that’s all I ever said.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after, Ms McGinnis showed up to Lisa and Ian’s home with her children.</p>
      <p>The family was brought back to the US with the help of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and then were put in touch with the US embassy.</p>
      <p>Piette was on the run, but was arrested shortly after September 2017 when he tried to enter the US.</p>

      <p>Ms McGinnis revealed to Dr. Oz that she took her children without telling them they were fleeing and detailed the campaign of terror Piette had unleashed on them.</p>
      <p>She said: “They didn’t know. I kept the truth from them until I escaped from Mexico.</p>
      <p>“They were really shocked. ... The reason I didn’t tell them, of course, was because what I knew inside was how much it’s damaged me. I didn’t want them to grow up knowing that.</p>
      <p>“He would tell them they’re animals. He would treat them like animals.”</p>
      <p>Ms McGinnis says he threatened to kill the children.</p>

      <p>“Any kind of abuse that you can think of, he did to me.”</p>
      <p>She said Piette unleashed horrific abuse on her, beating her with an assault rifle, baseball bat and beer bottles.</p>

      <p>Ms McGinnis revealed she was sexually abused and first fell pregnant at 13.</p>
      <p>However, she said she suffered a miscarriage and Piette forced her to flush the foetus down the toilet.</p>
      <p>Ms McGinnis waived her anonymity to shed light on her stepfather monster, who was convicted of rape earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In 1997 her mum – who has never spoken publicly about the case – split up with Piette because he was hitting her.</p>
      <p>Piette then retaliated by kidnapping her daughter from school and going on the run.</p>
