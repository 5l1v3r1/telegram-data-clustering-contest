      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:07:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:07</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Gilpin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andrew-gilpin/</a></address>
      <p>Former NBA star Charles Barkley has been accused of making a 'horrible and gross' comment to a female reporter.</p>
      <p>The former Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets player - now a pundit for Inside the NBA - is said to have made the 'threat' during a media scrum.</p>
      <p>Barkley, famous for being part of the US Olympic 'Dream Team' was pictured talking in a huddle of people - including Axios political reporter Alexi McCammond.</p>
      <p>She then claimed on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>: "Just FYI Charles Barkley told me tonight 'I don’t hit women but if I did I would hit you,' and then when I objected to that he told me I 'couldn’t take a joke.'"</p>
      <p>She added: "There are almost no times I will beak an OTR (off the record) 'agreement' but this is not OK.</p>
      <p>"And it was all because he came in talking about how he loves Deval Patrick and once someone from Pete‘s campaign came around he said he loved Pete and I reminded him he previously said he was a Deval fan."</p>
      <p>Deval Patrick is an American politician standing in the American Presidential campaign in 2020.</p>
      <p>He is a former governor of Massachussetts.</p>
      <p>People were quick to slam the ex-NBA star with one saying: "Not cool at all, Charles Barkley. Abuse is never a laughing matter."</p>
      <p>Another added: "So horrible and gross."</p>

      <p>While another person said: "That's not a joke. It's a threat. Pure and simple. A threat."</p>
      <p>Others suggested that although he believes was 'joking' what he has been accused of saying was unnacceptable.</p>
      <p>In 1990 Barkley, then with the Philadelphia 76ers made a quip in a post match interview.</p>
      <p>He told the LA Times:  “This is a game that if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids. Did you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That’s because she knew I wasn’t going to beat her."</p>

      <p>That comment prompted an apology from the basketball star.</p>
      <p>Following his role in the hit movir Space Jam and retiring as a professional basketball player, Barkley has had a successful career as a television NBA analyst.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Barkley became a spokesman for WeightWatchers, promoting their "Lose Like a Man" program and appearing in both television and online ads.</p>
