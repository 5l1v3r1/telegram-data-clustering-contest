      <h1>Code with Apple sessions coming to Apple Stores around the world in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:07:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelsteeber/" target="_blank">Michael Steeber</a></address>
      <p>Apple is promoting the importance of coding and app development in its retail stores around the world with a collection of free <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/today-at-apple/">Today at Apple</a> sessions held from December 1-15. <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/collection/codewithapple/">The lineup</a> will include exclusive labs with designers and developers at flagship stores, and a new Coding Lab for Kids based on the Apple TV+ Original <i>Helpsters</i>.</p>
      <p>Hosted in cooperation with <a href="https://csedweek.org/">Computer Science Education Week</a>, Code with Apple is a new name for Apple’s annual <a href="https://code.org/">Hour of Code</a> series at Apple Stores. For the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/11/apple-brings-coding-education-to-more-students-for-computer-science-education-week/">seventh year</a>, people of all skill levels can participate in hands-on activities. At most locations, Apple will offer its standard Coding and Apps sessions on a more frequent basis:</p>

        <li>
          <a href="https://www.apple.com/today/event/coding-lab-kids-sphero-robot-challenge-collection/">Coding Lab for Kids: Sphero Robot Obstacle Challenge</a>

Kids will learn how to put simple steps in a sequence with characters from the <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/helpsters/umc.cmc.kfh7cellb1a3dmiehxhvq8gl">Apple TV+ series</a>. The session is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/23/today-at-apple-tv-plus/">inspired by an event</a> held earlier this fall at Apple Fifth Avenue and is the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/28/today-at-apple-snoopy-in-space/">second</a> widespread Today at Apple session based on an Apple Original.</p>
