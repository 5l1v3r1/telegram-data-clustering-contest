      <p>Yet another record has been surpassed by <i>Bala</i>. In 12 days flat, the film has surpassed the lifetime numbers of Luka Chuppi, one of the earliest superhits of 2019. That film had collected <b>95 crores</b> in its lifetime and now Bala stands at <b>95.04 crores.</b></p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the film collected <b>2.05 crores</b> and that was a nominal drop when compared to Monday numbers of <b>2.25 crores</b>. The film should go on to accumulate around <b>3.25-3.50</b> <b>crores</b> more before the end of week and then enter the 100 Crore Club in the third weekend.</p>

      <p>For producer Dinesh Vijan this is good news indeed as Luka Chuppi as well as Bala are his productions. Even former had the potential to cross the <b>100 crores</b> milestone but then <i>Badla</i> too was running alongside and that film did business on the same lines. In case of <i>Bala,</i> there would be competition in the form of <i>Pagalpanti</i> next week, so it has to be seen where does it eventually land up.</p>
      <p>The film is a <b>Super Hit</b> nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Note: All collections as per production and distribution sources</p>
