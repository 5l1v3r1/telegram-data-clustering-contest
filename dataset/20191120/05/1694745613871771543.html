      <h1>Are You Emotionally Healthy? Here Are the Signs That You Prioritize Your Well-Being</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:20:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:20</time> by <a rel="author">Corinne Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>Sure, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Ab-Exercises-42388725">abs are sexy</a>, but there's a much better indicator of a healthy person than a hot physique: <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Mental-Health-Month-2019-46038499">mental wellness</a>. Emotional health has nothing to do with a person's workout routine and everything to do with how you treat others and how you treat yourself. Your <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Best-Apps-Mental-Health-46034918">mental well-being</a> affects every facet of your life, and taking care of your mind is just as — if not more — important as taking care of your body. How do you know if you're emotionally healthy? Read on for the signs that you prioritize your well-being, both inside and out.</p>
      <h3>1 You Treat Others Well</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Daily-Habits-Manage-Mental-Health-44365851">Mental health</a> is all about being kind to yourself, and when you're kind to yourself, it's much easier to be kind to others. An intent to benefit others is called prosocial behavior, and the ability to approach other people with compassion and take their feelings and needs into consideration is a hallmark of your own well-being.</p>
      <h3>2 You Exercise and Eat Well</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Ways-Practice-Self-Care-42692633">Respecting yourself</a> as a person means respecting your body and treating it well. Healthy habits make a person feel better inside and out, and when you <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/How-Start-Working-Out-44474915">prioritize your physical health</a>, it means that you care enough about yourself to know that you deserve to feel good.</p>
      <h3>3 You Forgive and Repair Damaged Relationships</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Holding grudges isn't productive and healthy, and a person with mental wellness knows when to relinquish pride and control in order to heal a relationship that has soured. <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/love/When-Time-Stop-Being-Friends-Someone-44702154">Not all relationships can be mended</a>, but you make an effort to do so anyway if only to see the other person's side of things.</p>
      <h3>4 You're Flexible</h3>

        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/0q3aY8lBXA1t9O79aiQc7ihSDl4/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/11/17/222/n/3019466/9074fef65dd21c1ac59c89.81881322_GettyImages-/i/Youre-Flexible.jpg"/>

      <p>Emotionally healthy people are adaptable, and no matter what life throws at them, they're equipped to handle it. Even the best-laid plans go awry, but rather than panicking and throwing in the towel, you know how to adjust your expectations accordingly to avoid disappointment.</p>
      <h3>5 You Value Experiences More Than Possessions</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Rather than filling your life with material possessions, you find yourself <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Why-OK-Spend-Money-When-Traveling-44028427">prioritizing trips</a>, activities, and meals with friends, preferring life's intangible things to the tangible. Same goes for social media — a person with mental well-being will spend more time enjoying an experience than trying to document it for other people to see.</p>
      <h3>6 You're in Touch With Your Emotions</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/C75nUjttaGb0xcnPdfd9x039zes/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/05/06/864/n/44701584/ca8daac56e250130_GettyImages-1067570710/i/Youre-Touch-Your-Emotions.jpg"/>

      <p>Another sign of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Tips-Better-Mental-Health-44734389">emotional wellness</a> is that you embrace your emotions as a natural and normal part of life rather than something to hide or dismiss. Whether you feel excitement and joy or anxiety and sadness, you're willing to explore and learn to cope with those feelings (and even express them to others).</p>
      <h3>7 You Feel Gratitude For Your Loved Ones</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/gLTpqkxpthjnenCzFA7Rv-pGtpg/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/11/17/222/n/3019466/e5f76e425dd21c1bcb82a3.71984111_GettyImages-/i/You-Feel-Gratitude-Your-Loved-Ones.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Things-Grateful-36053829">Showing gratitude</a> indicates that you can purposefully look at your life with a sense of appreciation for the things that you have rather than simply seeing what you're lacking. You focus on all of the relationships and blessings surrounding you, and you don't mourn whatever it is that you perceive as missing.</p>
      <h3>8 You Know When to Ask For Help</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/YmvawzY5LsyoPiKgaudM4KLG14E/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/05/06/865/n/44701584/a415c4d35b956985_GettyImages-949554268/i/You-Know-When-Ask-Help.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Asking for help is often humbling and intimidating, but you know that reaching out when you need some assistance is not a sign of weakness, but actually of strength. By recognizing your need for others, you indicate that you feel confident enough in yourself and your relationships to know that you won't be perceived as a burden.</p>
      <h3>9 You're Always Open to New Experiences</h3>

      <p>Mental wellness has a lot to do with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/How-Have-Productive-Week-43477581">staying productive</a>, and emotionally healthy people are always prepared to take on new challenges in order to keep their minds active. Though new experiences might feel scary, you're able to step outside your comfort zone in order to embrace that stimulation.</p>
      <h3>10 You Place a High Value on Personal Development</h3>

      <p>You love seeing yourself grow as a person, and you recognize the things you must do in order to allow yourself to grow. By <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/bad-habits-to-break-46670939">breaking bad habits</a>, ending destructive relationships, trying new things, and making time for yourself, you're better able to understand yourself and focus on your personal goals.</p>
