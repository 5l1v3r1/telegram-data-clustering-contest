      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> The air quality will deteriorate from Wednesday owing to a gradual dip in wind speed. On Wednesday morning, PM 2.5 was recorded at 210 in the ‘moderate’ category. PM 10, too, was in the ‘moderate’ category.</p>
      <p>“Forecast shows AQI will slightly deteriorate to the poor category by the end of today and then further deteriorate to the lower end of the ‘Very Poor’ category by tomorrow. Pollutant accumulation leading to quick deterioration is predicted by November 20 and probability of AQI touching the lower end of the Severe category on November 21 is high,” SAFAR said.</p>
