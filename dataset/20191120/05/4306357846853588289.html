      <h2>Fikayo Tomori reflects on his rise to prominence at Chelsea FC under Frank Lampard this season</h2>

      <h3>Fikayo Tomori has admitted that his rise to prominence in the Chelsea FC team under Frank Lampard has been “pretty mad”.</h3>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been a regular fixture in the Blues first team in central defence this season following injuries to both Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen.</p>
      <p>Tomori has started nine of Chelsea FC’s 12 Premier League games this season and has netted one goal for Lampard’s men to help them up into third place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>The young defender has also made one assist in four Champions League outings for the west London side as they aim to progress through to the last 16.</p>
      <p>Lampard has been earning lots of praise for placing his faith in Chelsea FC’s young players such as Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham this season.</p>
      <p>And Tomori has admitted that it has been a whirlwind start to the season for him and his young team-mates.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1206149/Chelsea-news-Fikayo-Tomori-Mason-Mount-Tammy-Abraham-Premier-League">Daily Express</a>, Tomori said: “I can’t believe this last 12 months.</p>
      <p>“It’s pretty mad. If you told me 12 months ago that I’d make my England debut I’d probably have looked at you funny. It seemed so far away.</p>
      <p>“But now that I’m here I’m grateful. It’s been a lot of hard work and determination, a lot of focus, and hopefully I can make more caps and maintain that focus I’ve shown.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are currently in third place in the table and eight points behind leaders Liverpool FC after 12 games.</p>
      <p>They will return to Premier League action with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday evening.</p>
