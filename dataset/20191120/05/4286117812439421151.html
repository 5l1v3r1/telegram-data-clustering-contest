      <p>India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh feels that pink-ball Tests won't rapidly increase the turnout in cricket stadiums and instead urged authorities to "take the game to smaller centres" to attract more fans.</p>
      <p>India are all set to play their first-ever day-night Test against Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens stadium in Kolkata from November 22. The match will see both teams playing with pink balls for the first time in their cricketing history.</p>
      <p>Cricket Association of Bengal has made grand plans to make the match a historic occasion but Bhajji is of the opinion that the game needs to be played in smaller cities and infrastructure of the current cricket stadiums in the country needs to improve first.</p>
      <p>"I don't see pink ball bringing a lot of people to the ground, it might not be the case. You have to do something about Test cricket. Probably taking the game to the smaller centres where people have not seen their heroes in action," the 39-year-old told reporters here at a promotional event.</p>
      <p>"For instance, take the game from Mohali to Amristar. Your people will come to watch it. No matter what the format is whether you play with red/pink ball will not matter to them. One of the keys is to take the game to smaller centres," he opined.</p>
      <p>For bringing people to the ground, Harbhajan advised, "If you have two strong teams playing against each other then only people will come to enjoy the game. Also, another big factor which I feel is that there is not much infrastructure for people. There are not good toilets and seats so people prefer to stay back in their home."</p>
      <p>But despite Harbhajan's reservations, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday confirmed that the <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/india-bangladesh-kolkata-eden-gardens-day-night-test-tickets-1620616-2019-11-19">tickets for the first four days</a></b> of the Kolkata Test have been sold out.</p>
      <p>"It's sold out and I'm extremely happy (about it)," said Ganguly here after visiting the BCCI headquarters.</p>
      <p>Asked for how many days it was sold out, Ganguly informed four. The countdown of the historic Test began in Kolkata on Sunday with the City of Joy turning pink.</p>
      <p>The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.</p>
      <p>This will be followed by the ringing of the customary Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.</p>
      <p>Then at the 20-minute tea break, former captains and the galaxy of sport stars from other disciplines will be taken out on carts making a round of the ground along the boundary lines.</p>
      <p>During the 40-minute supper break, CAB has organised a talk show featuring the 'Fabulous Five' of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman who will walk down the memory lane, delving on the epic 2001 Test win against Australia here.</p>
