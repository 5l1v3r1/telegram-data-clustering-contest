      <p>A Peachland couple is warning neighbours to be vigilant after a wheel came flying off their vehicle on Drought Hill – the result of an apparent act of vandalism.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Tammy Bremner's partner was driving back to their Peachland home off Princeton Avenue, after working in Glenrosa.</p>
      <p>“Coming down Drought Hill, he felt a massive wobble all of a sudden, and he was smart enough to pull over, and as soon as he pulled over (the wheel) fell off,” Bremner said.</p>
      <p>Upon closer inspection, they realized all of their wheels' lug nuts had been loosened.</p>
      <p>“It's disgusting. I can't wrap my head around why someone would want to do that,” Bremner said.</p>
      <p>She believes the vandalism happened at their Peachland home sometime between Thursday night and Friday morning. She doesn't think it could have occurred while her partner was at work, as he was parked inside a job site all day.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time Peachland and West Kelowna residents have dealt with this type of vandalism. Police have been warning the public about <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/West-Kelowna/257307/loosened-lug-nut-warning">multiple incidents</a> dating back to May of this year, and last June, a Peachland mother noticed her front wheels' <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/West-Kelowna/259504/mothers-lug-nuts-loosened">lug nuts were loose</a> while she was driving with her three-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Bremner said she hadn't called police about her own incident.</p>
      <p>“What can they really do, right? Nobody in my neighbourhood has cameras,” she said. “I just let my neighbours know and put it out there so everybody's aware.”</p>
