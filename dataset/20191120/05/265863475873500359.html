      <h1>Tom Hanks Reveals He Originally Didn’t Want To Be Mister Rogers – But The Director Convinced Him</h1>

      <p>According to a report from UPI.com, Tom Hanks revealed on the<i> Today</i> show this Tuesday that he initially said “no” to the role of Mister Rogers in the film,<i> A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood</i>, until he was eventually persuaded to take it on by the director of the project, Marielle Heller.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Savannah Guthrie, Hanks said the director told him she wasn’t interested in any kind of “comment” or “editorial” on Mister Rogers’ character. The actor was told he would receive a wig, changed eyebrows, and the rest was up to Mr. Hanks.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Hanks explained that the show was never designed for grown-up adults. It was for children, and it was created by someone who wanted to connect with them and show them how he cared.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the actor claims he sat down with Joanne Rogers, his widow, and she dished on what she might’ve thought about the state of the world today, and how Rogers would’ve behaved in it. Regarding what Joanne Rogers said, she stated Roger would just try and do the best thing he could.</p>

      <p>As most know, Tom Hanks has had a long and illustrious career in the entertainment industry. However, a busy actor can’t always appear in the productions they want to. In fact, during NBC’s ten-year run of <i>Friends,</i> Tom Hanks was actually invited on to the show, but he couldn’t appear on it on account of scheduling problems.</p>
      <p>During a chat with reporters from Entertainment Weekly, Freddie Prinze Junior – who took the role as the nanny, Sandy, in the 2002 episode called, “The One With The Male Nanny” – revealed the role was originally intended for Mr. Tom Hanks, however, he turned it down at the last minute.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old actor stated Tom was supposed to be Sandy initially, however, the <i>Cast Away</i> alum was busy filming another movie, and couldn’t make it to <i>Friends</i> on time. His agent called Freddie Prinze Junior and asked him if he wanted to be on the legendary series, and Mr. Prinze Junior happily obliged.</p>
