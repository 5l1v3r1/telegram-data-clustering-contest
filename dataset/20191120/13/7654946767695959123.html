      <h1>Ghislaine Maxwell is too loyal to Prince Andrew to implicate him in FBI interview, insider says</h1>

      <p>Jeffrey Epstein’s accused madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, is so loyal to Prince Andrew, she would never implicate him if interviewed by the FBI, according to a report.</p>
      <p>“It is impossible,” a source familiar with Maxwell <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/19/ghislaine-maxwell-would-never-implicate-prince-andrew-epstein/">told the Telegraph</a> of the woman who has been repeatedly named in court filings as being central to Epstein’s depraved activities.</p>
      <p>Maxwell is so close to the prince that he once even asked his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, for permission to take her on an official work trip, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ghislaine-maxwell-and-prince-andrew-a-man-of-few-friends-hhtn2q506">according to the Times of London</a>, which said the request was denied.</p>
      <p>As well as not wanting to drag a longtime friend into further trouble, the Telegraph’s source also insisted that Maxwell maintains that the Duke of York is innocent of the claims against him.</p>
      <p>“Her position is very clear: Prince Andrew did nothing wrong,” she said of the accusations that Andrew again denied during his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/devine-no-honor-in-prince-andrews-self-pity-over-epstein-friendship/">ill-fated interview with the BBC</a>.</p>

      <p>Maxwell is now <a href="https://thenypost.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=14697112&amp;action=edit">assumed to be in hiding</a> after seemingly becoming central in an ever-widening investigation into Epstein’s accused accomplices since the convicted pedophile’s death in a Manhattan lockup in August.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10381601/ghislaine-maxwell-reward-10000/">The Sun on Wednesday</a> even offered a reward of almost $13,000 for information on the whereabouts of the daughter of the late media tycoon Robert Maxwell.</p>
