        <b>Four men have been arrested in connection with the investigation into recent robberies and assaults on sex workers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three addresses were searched yesterday as apart of the investigation.</p>
      <p>The four men - aged between 18 and 37 years of age - are being held for questioning under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at Garda stations in Dublin.</p>
      <p>A fifth man was also arrested on foot of a bench warrant, and is now before the District Court.</p>
      <p>In a statement, gardaí said: "An Garda Síochána is continuing to appeal to any sex worker who may have been subject to a similar attack to immediately report the incident. Anyone who comes forward will be treated confidentially with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
      <blockquote>"An Garda Síochána is also appealing to any person with information on these callous, targeted attacks to please contact Gardaí to assist in bringing these dangerous attackers to justice."</blockquote>
      <p>Anybody with information is being asked to contact the Garda Confidential Line on 1800-666-111 or any Garda station.</p>
      <p>Gardaí also highlighted a list of victim support groups <b><a href="https://www.garda.ie/en/Victim-Services/Where-else-can-I-get-support-/Victim-Support-Services.html">available on their website</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Last week, gardaí said that since mid-October <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/gardai-appeal-information-several-attacks-sex-workers-924887">seven attacks had occurred nationwide</a></b> on sex workers advertising services on online sites.</p>
      <p>They said the motive for the attacks appeared to be for money - although violence was used.</p>
      <p>The force described the incidents as "terrifying" for the injured parties, who are both women and men.</p>
      <p>On each occasion an online appointment is made, but when the 'client' arrives the sex worker is attacked and robbed by a number of men.</p>
