      <h1>Discounts and late payment fees could go under new rules for energy retailers</h1>

      <p>Gas and electricity retailers would be barred from profiting off customers in financial hardship under a new plan from the federal government.</p>
      <p>Proposed rule changes to stop retailers charging energy consumers unreasonable fees for late payments would require retailers to limit the value of their discount offers to the cost savings they could reasonably expect to make if a customer met the payment deadline.</p>

      <p>"For too long, the big energy companies have focused on their profits and not on their customers," Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said.</p>
      <p>"This rule change builds on the work we've already done to help ensure a fair playing field for customers when negotiating their energy bill.</p>
      <p>"The current rules are for the most part impacting customers who are already doing it tough, experiencing financial hardship."</p>
      <p>People under financial stress are disproportionately impacted by the conditional discounts currently offered by energy retailers.</p>

      <p>About 59 per cent of customers in this category cannot meet discount conditions and miss out on reduced bills.</p>
      <p>The new rule would also mean customers who currently enjoy discounts for paying their bills on time, or using direct debit, would have their discount limited to the value of meeting those payment conditions.</p>
      <p>Retailers would still be able to offer discounts on a non-conditional basis, such as sign-up offers, benefits for installing batteries and other energy equipment, discounts for bundling gas and electricity, or services like mobile phones.</p>

      <p>The Australian Energy Market Commission sets the rules for electricity and gas retail markets. Acting chief executive Suzanne Falvi said while retailers would still be able to manage the risk of late payment by offering discounts or charging late fees, the draft rule would cap these to the reasonable cost incurred when payments are late.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately some retailers have used conditional discounts to profit from customers who struggle to pay their electricity and gas bills on time. This draft rule puts a stop to that," Ms Falvi said.</p>
      <p>The AEMC has recommended the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council adopt new civil penalties to punish retailers $100,000 per breach if they fail to limit conditional discounts.</p>
      <p>In July the government introduced a default market offer, which set a base power price for customers in South Australia, NSW and Queensland based on a set average usage amount.</p>
      <p>The federal government in February introduced rule changes to improve conditions for energy customers, introducing deadlines for meter installation, requiring retailers to give advance notice of price changes, and allowing customers to read their own meters.</p>
      <p>The proposed rule changes are open for public consultation until January 16, 2020.</p>
