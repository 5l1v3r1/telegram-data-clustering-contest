      <h1>Dutch Soccer Assn. Trials Blockchain App at EU Championship Qualifying Match</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:24:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) trialed a new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a>-based ticketing app during yesterday’s Netherlands-Estonia European Championship qualifying match.</p>
      <p>The news was <a href="https://www.ajaxlife.nl/2019/11/19/knvb-doet-interessant-experiment-met-kaartjes-nederland-estland/">reported</a> by Ajax Life, a fanzine associated with the top tier Dutch football club AFC Ajax, on Nov. 19.</p>
      <h3>Replacing tickets with an app</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s match was hosted at the Johan Cruijff Arena in Amsterdam, which the Netherlands won 5-0, as the BBC has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50477974">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>According to Ajax Life, the KNVB used the event as an opportunity to trial its new blockchain-based app, designed to combat ticket counterfeiting and black market sales.</p>
      <p>The solution dispenses with ticket PDFs, granting visitors access to the stadium via an app. A barcode used to activate visitors' access to the stadium is only operational at a set time and within a specific radius of the stadium on match day. This ostensibly makes it impossible to resell tickets for a competition multiple times.</p>
      <p>Ajax Life reporters note that if the blockchain pilot’s results are deemed successful, the solution will be developed and scaled further with the support of the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
      <p>Both KNVB and AFC Ajax were participants in developing a series of innovative products for trial implementation during yesterday’s match, under the aegis of a so-dubbed “<a href="https://www.knvb.nl/nieuws/organisatie/berichten/58166/innovaties-getest-bij-nederland-estland">Change the Game Challenge</a>,” jointly initiated with the Johan Cruijff Arena.</p>
      <h3>Blockchain in the sports and entertainment industries</h3>
      <p>This October, Broadway’s largest ticket operator, the Shubert Organization, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/broadways-biggest-ticket-operator-to-use-ibm-blockchain-against-scams">revealed</a> plans to pilot an IBM blockchain-powered mobile ticketing solution and is eyeing integrating the product into its business in the future.</p>
      <p>In international soccer, blockchain platform Socios.com has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-premier-league-soccer-club-west-ham-to-launch-fan-token-in-partnership-with-socios">partnered</a> with numerous leading clubs — including French soccer club <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/paris-saint-germain-soccer-club-to-launch-fan-token">Paris Saint-Germain</a>, Italy’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/italian-soccer-club-juventus-follows-frances-paris-saint-germain-to-launch-fan-token">Juventus</a> and London-based West Ham United — to launch club-branded fan tokens.</p>
