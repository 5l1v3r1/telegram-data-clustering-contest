      <blockquote>“What an honor to sit [with] The First Lady at the White House. @FLOTUS Your sincerity was truly inspiring. You/your team were so engaged to Channing’s grieving father &amp; brother &amp; brought ideas/strategy to make the world a safer better place for the youth in America,” tweeted Cyrus on 19 November.</blockquote>

      <p>​Channing Smith, a junior at Coffee County Central High School in Manchester, Tennessee reportedly killed himself in September after learning that sexually explicit messages he had exchanged with another boy had allegedly been posted on social media by some of his classmates.</p>
      <p>Before the messages were leaked, Channing had not discussed his sexuality publicly.</p>
      <blockquote>"They were graphic texts and there was no room for Channing to be able to claim it was a misunderstanding," his brother Joshua Smith had said.</blockquote>
      <p>The teen’s death sent shock waves through the community.</p>
      <p>The news caught the attention of country music star Billy Ray Cyrus, 58, who made a trip to Manchester to perform at a memorial for Channing.</p>
      <p>Melania Trump had referred to Smith's death as "tragic" and noted her work against cyberbullying in a Twitter post.</p>
      <blockquote>“Highlighting online safety is one of my #BeBest priorities. Yesterday, [Billy Ray Cyrus] introduced me to the Smith family to hear about the tragic loss of their loved one from cyberbullying. Teaching positive online behaviors can ensure a safer future for our children.”</blockquote>

      <p>The First Lady referred to social media as “an inevitable part of our children’s daily lives” that can be “destructive and harmful when used incorrectly.”</p>
