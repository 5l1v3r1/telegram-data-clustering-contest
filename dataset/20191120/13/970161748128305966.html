        <b>James Maddison is considering a new contract at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/leicester-city-fc/">Leicester City</a>, which would throw a spanner in the works of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s pursuit of the midfielder.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The England international is one of United’s top transfer targets with the Red Devils preparing to test Leicester’s resolve in January or next summer.</p>
      <p>The Foxes do not want to let one of their star players leave and are trying to secure him to a deal beyond the end of his current contract, which expires in 2023.</p>
      <p>Although his future is far from decided, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-united-transfer-james-maddison-17279744">MEN</a> reports that Maddison is considering re-signing with Leicester, despite the interest from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Whether that means a contract extension, an improved salary, or most likely both, is not known.</p>

      <p>Manchester United are reportedly confident of getting their man, nonetheless, as Maddison grew up as a fan of the club and is good friends with Harry Maguire who made the switch from Leicester to Old Trafford over the summer.</p>

      <p>With the midfielder’s contract still running for another three-and-a-half years, and Leicester not being under any financial need to sell the player, he would be extremely expensive.</p>
      <p>The Foxes held out for £80m when they sold Maguire to the Red Devils and may well expect a figure in the same region for their latest bright young English talent.</p>
      <p>England manager Gareth Southgate was full of praise for Maddison as he gave him his international debut last week against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>‘He’s a player of outstanding technical ability. He has an eye for an incisive pass, his set-play delivery is world class – absolutely top,’ said Southgate.</p>
      <p>‘With his club now he is in a position as a number eight that he’s really learning more and more about work off the ball.</p>
      <p>‘His club are pressing in the way we want to press, pretty much. I know Brendan has a focus on that.</p>
      <p>‘In those areas, work off the ball is as important as with it. Especially the higher level of opponents and tighter games.</p>
      <p>‘He’s developing well and he has a lot to offer us.’</p>
