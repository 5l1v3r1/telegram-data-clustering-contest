      <h1>Ghislaine Maxwell compared to James Bond character who will never be found</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:28:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Brown</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew’s socialite ex on Wednesday compared <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/14/jeffrey-epstein-accuser-sues-gal-pal-ghislaine-maxwell-claims-she-oversaw-the-process/">Jeffrey Epstein’s accused madam</a>, Ghislaine Maxwell, to a James Bond character — and predicted she will never be found.</p>
      <p>Lady Victoria Hervey, 43, revealed on UK TV that fellow socialite Maxwell had first introduced her to the royal in 1999, sparking a brief romance.</p>
      <p>The friendship also led her into Epstein’s world, with her staying at the pedophile’s Manhattan mansion — and even attending an “intimate dinner” with Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, she said.</p>
      <p>Hervey <a href="https://twitter.com/GMB/status/1197060810759118848">told ITV’s “Good Morning Britain”</a> that she was in “disbelief” at hearing that her 57-year-old longtime friend had been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/ghislaine-maxwell-prowled-central-park-to-recruit-women-for-jeffrey-epstein-accuser/">accused of procuring young girls</a> for the moneyman’s sex ring.</p>
      <p>But she predicted failure in the hunt for Maxwell, which on Wednesday even saw The Sun newspaper <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10381601/ghislaine-maxwell-reward-10">offering a “reward”</a> of almost $13,000 for information on her whereabouts.</p>
      <p>“Ghislaine is like a James Bond character — she is quite a unique person,” Hervey told the show, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10383519/ghislaine-maxwell-prince-andrew-epstein-madam/">according to The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t believe that anyone is going to find her.”</p>
      <p>Hervey said she had last seen Maxwell in September last year, predicting, “She’s gone far, far away.”</p>
      <p>Maxwell and Epstein had great “teamwork” together, Hervey recalled on the show. “He had the finance, she had the black book,” she said. “They were a great pair together — together, they were taking over the world.”</p>
      <p>Most amazingly, it led to the party in 2000 with now-rivals Clinton and Trump joining Epstein’s friends, including Andrew, which she called “a very intimate dinner, and very relaxed,” according to The Sun.</p>

      <p>“He was a very well-liked guy, you could see that,” she said of Epstein.</p>
      <p>“There was chemistry between him and all these powerful people.”</p>
      <p>However, she insisted that Epstein’s mansion “didn’t feel right,” saying, “I remember feeling like there were cameras in the room spying on me, that I was being watched. I just felt it in my gut.”</p>
      <p>However, Hervey stood by her ex Andrew, insisting the Duke of York would never have given his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/just-6-of-the-public-believes-prince-andrew-poll/">widely panned BBC interview</a> if he had been guilty of having sex with an Epstein accuser.</p>
      <p>“There is no way if he is guilty that he would go onto television and do an interview like that. There’s no way,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I think he didn’t do it because there’s no way he would go onto television and put himself in that situation.”</p>
