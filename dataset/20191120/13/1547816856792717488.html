Next evening at 4 pm, Mouni Roy met the producer and the two also had a chat around the casting.

      <p>For those who don’t know why Kriti Kharbandra left the film, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/kriti-kharbanda-did-not-want-to-kiss-and-seduce-in-chehre-quit-the-film-on-a-very-discomforting-note-exclusive/5dd3d9ac87fb571eff7e4190">SpotboyE.com dug the real reason and told you that the actress was not comfortable shooting for an intimate scene </a>that also involved her to lock lips. Unfortunately, reports stated that it were her starry tantrums that cost her the film, but that wasn’t the case as the actress had her reservations around the particular scene and we think it’s absolutely okay to not do something that you’re not comfy with. <b><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/photos/photo-gallery/pagalpanti-lovebirds-kriti-kharbanda-pulkit-samrat-can-t-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-at-promotions/5dd4f72f87fb571eff7e4257">(ALSO READ: Pagalpanti: Lovebirds Kriti Kharbanda-Pulkit Samrat Can't Keep Their Hands Off Each Other At Promotions)<br/></a></b><br/>However, Anand Pandit tweeted out saying that they parted ways on mutual terms, "In the light of recent media reports, we wish to clarify that <a href="https://twitter.com/kriti_official">@kriti_official</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/apmpictures">@apmpictures</a> have mutually agreed to part ways on a cordial and professional note. We wish her success in all her future endeavours."</p>
