      <h1>DUP candidate says party will still have 'leverage' over Tories after election</h1>
      <h2>Lagan Valley candidate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is not convinced that Boris Johnson's Tory Party will have a huge majority after the general election next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:05:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>The DUP will still have 'leverage' over the Tories after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> , according to a candidate for the unionist party.</p>
      <p>Lagan Valley candidate Sir Jeffrey Donaldson reckons that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> will not enjoy a 'huge majority' come December 13.</p>
      <p>And that means the Tories could still rely on the DUP to push through crucial votes in parliament - although the party is set against his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> deal.</p>
      <p>Theresa May's disastrous 2017 election performance meant she was forced to enter into a 'confidence and supply' arrangement with the party which had secured 10 MPs.</p>
      <p>And the DUP were able to secure more than £1bn for Northern Ireland as part of the deal.</p>

      <p>Speaking as part of a panel of representatives from the five main political parties in Northern Ireland who were invited to address business leaders, Sir Jeffrey said: "I am not convinced Boris Johnson is going to come back with a huge majority and I think that gives us leverage.</p>
      <p>"Whilst we can go to Westminster and we can do what we do, I believe it is ultimately much more powerful if there is a collective voice from Northern Ireland saying what we need."</p>
      <p>Today Boris Johnson visited a washing machine manufacturer in the north-east of England as he embarks on a series of election campaign visits in the region.</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister met workers and tried his hand at moulding parts at the Ebac factory in Newton Aycliffe.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson posed through drums and placed "Made in Britain" stickers on new machines as he toured the factory - the UK's only washing machine manufacturer.</p>
