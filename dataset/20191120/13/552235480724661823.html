      <h2>Dedicated Boots optician wins Best of the Best award</h2>

      <p>Delivering excellent customer care with a genuine passion for their patients is what makes Boots Opticians in Kilmarnock an award winning store.</p>
      <p>And one of their colleagues, optometrist Philip Lee has been crowned the Best Optometrist of the Year at the Best of the Best awards.</p>
      <p>Philip Lee is a truly an exceptional Optometrist, his clinical knowledge and customer care is second to none and he has played a pivotal part in creating an exceptional customer journey in Kilmarnock during his 11 years in the King Street branch, bringing together Pharmacy, and working closely with his team to offer a memorable experience.</p>
      <p>As an Independent Prescribing Optometrist Philip offers this additional service to our patient base, and with this qualification he can prescribe medication that patients would otherwise have to see an ophthalmologist for.</p>
      <p>The Pharmacist-Optometrist relationship in Kilmarnock is truly exemplar so much so, Philip has treated the Pharmacist in the branch next door for a corneal ulcer.</p>
      <p>Ordinarily she would need to be seen in a hospital setting, but Philip’s additional training allowed her to be seen immediately and offered aftercare that suited around her working hours.</p>

        <b>1. Eyes are an important health check</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's easy to neglect your eyes because they often do not hurt when there's a problem. Having an eye test will not just tell you if you need new glasses or a change of prescription – it's also an important eye health check. An optician can spot many general health problems and early signs of eye conditions before you're aware of any symptoms, many of which can be treated if found early enough.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Detect eye diseases early</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eye problems don’t always show themselves until they have reached a point of damaging your eye. At times, deterioration can be so gradual that you don’t notice the regression. Glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy have few, if any, symptoms in early stages. In these situations, a thorough eye exam can help detect these issues early on and action can be taken to prevent vision loss.</p>

        <b>3.  Optometrists can monitor changes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Your eyes are unique, and they may experience unique changes. When you have regular eye exams, it allows the optician to notice changes whether large or small and treat accordingly. These changes may seem insignificant to you, but to your optometrist, could be signs of underlying conditions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Be aware of symptoms</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, they may be caused by changes to your vision:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headaches from straining</li>
        <li>Loss of focus</li>
        <li>Light sensitivity</li>
        <li>Infections</li>
        <li>Blurry sight</li>
        <li>Floaters</li>
        <li>Flashing lights</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These may all be signs that you need glasses, a new prescription or even just an anti-glare coating on your lenses. It’s better to know the underlying cause of these than to deal with them on your own.</p>
      <p>Boots Opticians has one of the best ranges of frames in the town, offering affordable styles in the Boots ranges and designer frames too.</p>
      <p>And you can enjoy £20 off glasses when you spend £90 or over on glasses or sunglasses.</p>
