      <h1>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield TR list: every Technical Record move teaching item in the game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Donaldson</a></address>
      <p>All-new to <b>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</b> are <b>Technical Records</b> – <b>TRs</b> for short – though these new items are actually a little familiar, as our complete TR List shows.</p>
      <p>Typically in Pokemon games, you can teach your Pokemon moves that they don’t learn ‘naturally’ through the level up process through the use of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/20/pokemon-sword-shield-tm-list-locations-technical-machine/">TMs, also known as technical machines</a>. TMs used to be one-time-use items, but a few games ago the team at Game Freak decided to go easy on Pokemon fans and made the items – at last – unlimited usage. Once you got a TM, you could use it as many times and on as many Pokemon as you liked. Teaching moves this way is useful for building out a Pokemon’s move set to go against the grain and cover various strengths and weaknesses <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/pokemon-sword-shield-type-chart-strength-weakness-resistance/">as shown on the type chart</a>.</p>
      <p>They’re going back on that a little with Sword &amp; Shield, however – TMs still exist and are multiple-use, but now we’ve got TRs. Technical Records are functionally the same item, and serve to teach a Pokemon a new move, often one that they can’t learn naturally, but TRs are back to being one-time use. If you want to teach a move multiple times, you’ll need to find multiple TRs. On that topic…</p>
      <h4>How to get TRs in Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</h4>
      <p>If you want to get your hands on TRs, there are essentially three ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Very rarely, some NPCs will hand over TRs. This varies between Sword &amp; Shield and doesn’t happen all that often.</li>
        <li><b>You can buy TRs from the Watt Trader out in the Wild Area</b> – but the Watt Trader has an entirely random selection of TRs on any given day. Every real-world day, his selection of TRs for sale changes.</li>
        <li>Finally, <b>TRs are provided as rewards for successfully winning Max Raid Battles</b>. The TR you get will generally be of a type related to the Pokemon to beat – so if you beat a Fire Pokemon, you’ll get a Fire-type TR and so on and so forth. Remember, you can tackle Max Raid Battles alone with the help of NPCs, but they’ll be easiest if you take it on with others via online multiplayer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now that’s made clear, let’s get to the full TR list. Unfortunately, Sword &amp; Shield’s developers have moved a lot of staple competitive Pokemon moves from TM to TR – so those who want to put together a strong competitive team might find themselves grinding out for Watts in order to buy TRs, or Max Raid Battles to force the drop they want.</p>
