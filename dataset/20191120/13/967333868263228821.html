      <h1>Concerned about Public Health, Indian Home Ministry Asks States to Enforce E-Cigarettes Ban</h1>

      <p>The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs on Wednesday asked all state governments to strictly enforce an <a href="http://sputniknews.com/asia/20191009/1076993263.html">e-cigarette ban</a> in their territories as per the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes Ordinance.</p>
      <p>In a letter to the Chief Secretaries and the Director Generals of Police across India, the Home Ministry has empowered sub-inspectors across states to "enter, search and seize" prohibited items without any warrant.</p>
      <p>The ministry says that the ban is due to the “deleterious” impact of e-cigarettes on public health, especially on young people in schools and colleges.</p>
      <blockquote>"Further, congruent capacity building and sensitisation of the enforcement personnel may be done for effective implementation of the Ordinance," the letter said.</blockquote>
      <p>Those violating the provision may face up to three years in <a href="http://sputniknews.com/us/20191119/1077352172.html">prison</a> plus a fine.</p>
      <p>With the ban on e-cigarettes, India has come into line with countries including Brazil, Japan, and Australia.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, New Delhi does not have manufacturing units for e-cigarettes despite being a market for nearly 400 brands.</p>
      <p>On 31 May, which is World Tobacco Day, the Indian Council of Medical Research released a white paper pointing out the <a href="http://sputniknews.com/science/20191116/1077320209.html">detrimental effects</a> of e-cigarettes.</p>
