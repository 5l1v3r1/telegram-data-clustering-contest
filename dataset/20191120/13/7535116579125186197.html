      <p>It can get tricky when discussing money in a relationship, especially if both of you are still students and don’t have much financial ability. Sometimes, it’s best to go Dutch on your dating and living costs so that the financial burden doesn’t fall solely on one person and this is exactly what this Taiwanese university couple did.</p>

      <p><b>The girl posted her experience on Dcard and at first, it was all going well until her boyfriend got too <s>stingy</s> calculative over a small amount of money.</b> The post has since been removed but according to <a href="https://today.line.me/tw/pc/article/%E7%94%B7%E5%8F%8B%E3%80%8C%E7%B5%82%E6%A5%B5AA%E5%88%B6%E3%80%8D%E7%8C%9B%E8%A6%8111%E5%85%83%EF%BC%81%E5%A5%B3%E5%A4%A7%E7%94%9F%E5%82%BB%E7%9C%BC%EF%BC%9A%E6%83%B3%E7%9B%B4%E6%8E%A5%E5%96%AE%E8%BA%AB-o2Gyxo">Line Today</a>, she got so frustrated that she wanted to break up with her boyfriend.</p>
      <p>“I have a boyfriend, and we’ve been together for more than a year. He usually keeps a tight rein on our finances and makes sure to count every cent. <b>Normally, he would make sure to count the cost of everything including one cup of drink, parking fees and even condoms and asks me to pay my half.</b> I didn’t mind as I used the stuff too and I didn’t want to take advantage of him.”</p>

      <p><b>She was very understanding and even when her boyfriend bought a hairdryer for his room, she agreed to share the cost as she would often use it when she was at his place.</b> When she offered to pay for half of the hairdryer, he didn’t say anything and just accepted the money.</p>
      <p>However, she reached her breaking point one day when her boyfriend’s motorcycle broke down, and they had to rent an electric scooter to their lunch place. Suddenly, while they were eating lunch, he told her, “Baby, later remember to pay me 11 TWD (RM1.50).”</p>

      <p>She was surprised and asked him what was that for, and he said that the rental for the electric scooter was 22 TWD (RM3). She added that she was disgusted that he would ask for that 1 TWD (13sens) when he could have just asked for 10 TWD (RM1.36) and wants to dump him for being so calculative.</p>
      <p>Netizens were shocked by the boyfriend’s behaviour and said that he was being too calculative and stingy. Some of them advised her to dump him and said he wouldn’t be a good husband. Others said she should give him 100 TWD (RM13.60) and ask him to keep the change as a breakup fee.</p>
