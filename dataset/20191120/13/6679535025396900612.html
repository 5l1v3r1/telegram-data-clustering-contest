      <h2>Lok Satta criticises harassment of honest official who put up board against corruption</h2>

      <p>Hailing the practice of NPDCL ADE Podeti Ashok, who had erected a board in his office stating that “I am uncorrupted and I will not accept bribes”, the Lok Satta Udyama Samstha, Karimnagar district unit urged all the government officials to voluntarily come forward and display boards in their offices pledging that they would not accept bribes.</p>
      <p>Calling upon the officials to crusade against corruption, the Lok Satta criticised the officials of NPDCL for harassing the honest officer and threatening him with dire consequences for displaying a board against corruption.</p>
      <p>The news item ‘An officer who swears by his honesty’ published in these columns on Tuesday created ripples among the officials of NPDCL (Northern Power Distribution Company Limited) in Karimnagar district. Some of the senior officials and others threatened Mr. Ashok of dire consequences for claiming himself to be a sincere and honest officer and exposing the entire department as corrupt.</p>
      <p>At this juncture, the Lok Satta district unit came to his rescue and wrote a letter to the ACB seeking protection to the honest officer. Lok Satta district president N Srinivas also urged the ACB to conduct a thorough inquiry into the properties disproportionate to the income of some of the NPDCL officials in Karimnagar district and take appropriate action. Mr Srinivas also urged the ACB authorities not to disclose the details of the persons who provide information about the corrupt officials.</p>
      <p>Expressing concern over farmers resorting to attacks on revenue officials for lethargy on their part and rampant corruption in the department, he said that the farmers were forced to the bizarre attempts because of delay in the work. When the government was imposing fines for violations of various rules, the government should impose fines on employees not discharging their duties as per norms in a time-bound programme, he said and demanded that the government implement Citizens Guarantee Act and make the government employees accountable and ensure transparency in discharge of their duties.</p>
