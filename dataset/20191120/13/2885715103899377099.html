      <h1>Man prints AirPod stickers and puts them across San Francisco to prank people</h1>
      <h2>As the prank tweet went viral, people demanded to see if citizens really fell for it, and he furnished proof that it worked, leaving people in splits. He also provided the sticker template for all, in case someone else too wants to prank others.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:05:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/trends-desk/" target="_blank">Trends Desk</a></address>
      <p>Digital artist Pablo Rochat decided to have some fun with the fear that all <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/apple/">Apple</a> AirPod owners have of losing the device. He printed life-size AirPod stickers and stuck them across the city, documenting the process on video.</p>
      <p>Rochat, who also owns AirPods, said he fears <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/airpods-detachable-ear-rings-viral-video-5560929/">losing the wireless headphones</a> since he drops them often.</p>
      <p>“I often see people drop their AirPods, so I thought it would be funny to make it look like people are dropping their AirPods all over the city and see if people would try to pick them up,” he told <i>Mashable.</i></p>

      <p>As the tweet went viral, people wanted proof that someone actually fell for the prank. Rochat tweeted a video of the prank and it had people in splits. He also provided the template of the sticker, in case someone else wanted to carry out the same prank.</p>

      <p>While some said they would pick up and use an AirPod only after sanitising it, others said the joke was “pure evil”.</p>

      <p>AirPods owners know the risk of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/trending-globally/airpods-detachable-ear-rings-viral-video-5560929/">losing the headphones</a>, especially the possibility of it <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/bizarre/man-swallows-airpod-5708516/">falling out of a ear without the user realising</a>.</p>
