      <p>Bulawayo pressure groups have stood in support of the local business community which has made several calls requesting that the Competition and Tarrif Commission be decentralised to cover Bulawayo. <br/><br/>The calls fell on deaf ears as the Director of the Competition and Tarrif Commission Ellen Ruparanganda ignored and refused to address the request.<br/><br/>Acting Director of Southern Stars Foundation Ndodana Moyo said the we are not impressed by the behaviour of the CTCÂ  which refused to come and meet the people of Bulawayo so that we can discuss how the Bulawayo businesses can be protected. As residents we invited them in goodwill and they snubbed us. We are now writing a petition to call for the dissolution of the Commission and the immediate resignation of the Director."<br/><br/>Ruparanganda has been accused of prioritising her African Competition role while ignoring the needs and demands of the local office.<br/><br/>A petition to the Minister of Industry and Commerce is currently in circulation and is being signed by the people of Bulawayo who are demanding an immediate resignation of Ellen Ruparanganda from the post of Director CTC.<br/><br/>Career economist, Ruparanganda was appointed director for Competition and Tariffs Commission (CTC) when she replaced Alexander Kubuda who left the Commission in 2014.<br/><br/>CTC is a statutory board which was established in 2001 through an Act of Parliament to implement and enforce competition policy and law as well as execute the country's trade tariffs.<br/><br/>Recently Bulawayo Residents Association invited the Commission but their invitation was snubbed.<br/><br/>"We are aware that your commission recently made a decision to stop industry self-price regulation initiatives by GMAZ which were meant to protect consumers from unjustified price increases of maize meal.<br/><br/>"We, therefore, invite your commission to address Bulawayo residents on the 19th of October 2019, on these important national issues," the invitation letter read.</p>
