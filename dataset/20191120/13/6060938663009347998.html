      <p>KOLKATA: India's chief <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Badminton">badminton</a> coach <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pullela-Gopichand">Pullela Gopichand</a> on Wednesday attributed PV Sindhu's lean run since her <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Championship">World Championship</a> triumph to hectic scheduling.</p>
      <p>Sindhu has fallen in the early stages at all tournaments except the French Open since winning her maiden World Championship title in August.</p>
      <p>"Sindhu has had tough times in the last few matches, but I am sure she'll bounce back. I think she's had a tough schedule after the World Championships.</p>
      <p>"Doing intercontinental with matches from China, Korea. Then she went to Denmark, France and then she comes back to play China, Hong Kong again... So I think it's been a tough last two months for her," Gopichand told PTI.</p>
      <p>He, however, said Sindhu would bounce back strongly.</p>
      <p>"A lot of players in the world are finding it difficult and we've had many players not doing the best in these tournaments because of the schedule. I think she is somebody who's a contender any day and I am sure she'll bounce back."</p>
      <p>Gopichand also said India's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tokyo-2020">Tokyo 2020</a> preparation is on the right track.</p>
      <p>"I think every athlete who goes as part of the Indian team for the Olympics has a chance to get a medal. I hope we finish our qualifications early and go in (into the tournament) without any injuries and have a good preparation period," said Gopichand.</p>
      <p>Gopichand and PV Sindhu are among the galaxy of sport stars who will be felicitated on the sidelines of the India-Bangladesh pink ball Test beginning here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The former all-England champion recalled his younger days when he was an avid cricket watcher.</p>
      <p>"My younger days were filled with watching cricket. We spent a lot of time watching Tests when there was a lot less entertainment available on TV. I really enjoyed watching some intense Tests," Gopichand said.</p>
      <p>"It's very exciting. We have all grown up watching white clothing and red ball cricket. This is a new era. I'm looking forward to it (to day-night Test)."</p>
