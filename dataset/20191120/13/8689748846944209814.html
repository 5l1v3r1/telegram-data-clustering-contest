      <p>Ghanaian Reggae/dancehall and Afro beats musician, Kojo Kurankye, known in showbiz as Ras Kuuku, has taken a swipe at Ghanaian musicians and referred to their tracks as trash.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Dr. Cann on Happy FM’s “Showbiz Xtra” Ra’s Kuku stated” People patronize my song because when they compare my music to the ‘borla’, they prefer mine. A lot of songs are ‘borla’ songs because they do not have any impact on our thoughts unlike my songs”.</p>

      <p>According to Ras Kuku, even though most songs  produced by our Ghanaian artists are not good, he believes there are few artistes who are producing good songs and as such they need much support from the music industry.</p>
      <p>“I believe Iwan and Obibini are very good artistes who need support from the industry. Their songs are of good content”. He added.</p>
      <p>He advised key industry players, the media and public to not wait till there is a negative hype about these good musicians before supporting their music.</p>
      <p>Ras Kuuku is currently promoting his new  Reggae album titled “Kuntunkununku” which consists of 15 tracks.</p>
