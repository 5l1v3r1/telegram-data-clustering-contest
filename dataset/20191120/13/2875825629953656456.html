      <h2>Mick McCarthy's men are set to face Pavel Hapal's side in either Bratislava or Trnava</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:31:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland will travel to Slovakia for their Euro 2020 play-off in March.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's men are set to face Pavel Hapal's side in either Bratislava or Trnava, which is under an hour away from the capital.</p>
      <p>The match is set to take place on Thursday, March 26 and direct flights in and out of Bratislava from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> are already costing a couple of hundred quid.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we decided to look at alternative ways of getting there.</p>
      <p>We do warn that there is plenty of travelling involved in this route, but it will get you to Slovakia for under €90.</p>

      <p>Flying out of Dublin the day before the game, you can catch a flight to Milan for €29.07 with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ryanair">Ryanair</a> at 1.30pm.</p>
      <p>You'll then have to wait over four hours in Italy before getting a flight to Vienna with Wizz Air for €9.99.</p>
      <p>It's just 90 minutes from Vienna to Bratislava and you can get a bus ticket online with Flixbus for only €1.</p>
      <p>Coming home, you will be getting back on board the €1 bus to Austria and catching a flight with Laudamotion for €14.99 to Copenhagen.</p>
      <p>You'll have two hours to kill in Denmark before getting a Ryanair flight to Dublin for €33.19.</p>
