      <p>Sally Lindsay has given <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> fans hope that she will one day return to the ITV soap to reprise her role as popular character Shelley Unwin.</p>
      <p>The actress, 46, hasn't been seen in Weatherfield since 2006 when her character walked away from her abusive ex-Charlie Stubbs.</p>

      <p>Pregnant with his child, she vowed never to let him "control" her again and told him he would have no part in the life of her unborn baby.</p>
      <p>Viewers of the ITV soap were sad to see the fan favourite leave, but glad she got her happy ending.</p>
      <aside>I loved it - it was brilliant, it still is brilliant.</aside>
      <p>And we all know what happened to Charlie in the end... Tracy Barlow + statue = death.</p>

      <p>Sally joined the cast as Shelley in 2001, before leaving in 2006 and going on to star in a number of TV shows including Ordinary Lies, Scott And Bailey, Mount Pleasant and Still Open All Hours.</p>
      <p>Now, the mother-of-twins has hinted that she may return to the Street in future. After all, she wasn't killed off!</p>
      <p>Addressing rumours she's returning after being spotted on set, Sally explained her real reasons for being in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> on Tuesday (November 19), she said: "It's basically a load of us that have left and have done quite well, we were talking about our memories of the Street and how that set our careers up."</p>

      <p>She continued: "So I did this little 10 minute interview, didn't think anything of it. Then the next minute I'm going back to the Street. I was like, 'That's the first I've heard!'"</p>
      <p>However, asked whether she WOULD ever consider a return, she said: "Oh gosh, I'd never say never. I loved it - it was brilliant, it still is brilliant."</p>
      <p>Sally's character Shelley was involved in a number of huge storylines during her time on the cobbles, including a bigamous marriage to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-peter-barlow/">Peter Barlow</a> and her abusive one with builder Charlie - who even cheated on her with her own mother!</p>
      <p>She later dumped Charlie at the altar, but had a one-night stand with him and got pregnant before leaving the cobbles.</p>
      <p>Sally is currently starring in Channel 5 psychological thriller Cold Call, in which she plays a victim of fraud out for revenge.</p>
