      <h1>GM files racketeering lawsuit over FCA's alleged bribery of UAW</h1>
      <h2>GM alleges bargaining process corrupted by FCA practices</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:14:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoblog.com/bloggers/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">General Motors</a> on Wednesday filed a racketeering lawsuit against <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/fiat/">Fiat</a> Chrysler Automobiles NV, alleging that its rival engaged in bribery over many years to corrupt the bargaining process with the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/uaw-unions/">United Auto Workers</a> (<a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/uaw-unions/">UAW</a>) union and gain wage and work practices advantages over <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/category/gm/">GM</a>.</p>
      <p>GM said it will seek “substantial damages” from <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/fca/">FCA</a>, but did not specify an amount. FCA could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit also names as defendants three former FCA executives who have pleaded guilty in an ongoing federal probe into the UAW and FCA.</p>
      <p>FCA officials could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
      <p>The move comes at a delicate time for FCA, which is working on a planned merger with French automaker PSA (PEUP.PA) and is currently negotiating a four-year contract with the UAW.</p>
      <p>GM General Counsel Craig Glidden said the lawsuit has nothing to do with the merger and the automaker does not intend to file suit against the UAW.</p>
      <p>“Our sole focus is FCA,” Glidden told reporters at GM’s headquarters.</p>
      <p>GM said it will seek “substantial damages” in the case.</p>
      <p>GM alleges that under the leadership of the former CEO, the late <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/tag/sergio+marchionne/">Sergio Marchionne</a>, FCA used bribes to UAW officials to corrupt the collective bargaining process from 2009 through 2015.</p>
      <p>“Marchionne was a central figure in the conceiving, executing and sponsoring of the fraudulent activity,” Glidden said.</p>
      <p>GM said these practices left it paying higher wages than FCA, and allowed FCA to use more temporary workers and lower-paid second-tier workers than GM.</p>
