      <h2>His Royal Dryness probably wishes he could resign and "leave the process". But he is paying the same price as us for having a constitutional monarchy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:21:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Fleet Street Fox, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/fleetstreet-fox/</a></address>
      <p>It was a simple task: don't be an idiot.</p>
      <p>But week 417 of Jeffrey Epstein's Apprentice went badly for Prince "whole field of polo ponies" Andrew, for reasons he cannot fathom even with a 5-day front page debrief.</p>
      <p>For the best part of a week, now, every newspaper in the land has explained in detail how the nickname 'Randy Andy' went from being amusing tabloid bantz to an accusation of being complicit in sex crimes.</p>
      <p>Having succeeded in the early Uterine Selection task, excelled at the second stage of Not Being A Girl and survived that dodgy episode of toe-sucking, the audience was keen to see if the former Royal Navy pilot could pass the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-accused-using-20906500">punishing interview round</a> that had already chewed up and spat out several other Royal candidates.</p>
      <p>Rand the Brand thought he'd scored by escaping the attentions of Claude Littner, and believed that getting Emily Maitlis to glance over his holiday plans would be an easy win. He corrected her ignorance about shooting weekends, patronisingly asked her to repeat questions, and laughed about a child sex offender who'd given him some <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-says-friendship-paedo-20898530">great business insights.</a></p>
      <p>Afterwards, the Duke of Dork swaggered out of his mum's second-best ballroom saying <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/odd-behind-scenes-details-prince-20907233">it had all gone really well.</a> He made this mistake, as he did all the others that led to it, because he failed to fulfil the task's one requirement.</p>
      <p>He is, in fact, an idiot.</p>

        <figcaption>It's a Royal Knockout!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A number of former police officers have come forward to say someone this stupid would normally be "in the back of the van" after an interview that bad. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/epstein-accuser-assaulted-female-associate-20911711">The audience has turned against him,</a> his mum's pretty embarrassed, and the team leader has phoned on loudspeaker from New Zealand to tell him he's a prat.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile his business plan, of a Dragon's Den-style entrepreneurial sponsorship scheme called Pitch@Palace, is collapsing around his silken ears, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrews-reputation-tatters-big-20918513">with firms pulling out</a> quicker than a Prime Minister worried about alimony payments.</p>
      <p>And here is Andrew in the boardroom, alongside two other people also at risk of being fired. On one side is Jeremy Corbyn, who at least managed to express sympathy for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and on the other Boris Johnson, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/election-debate-awkward-moment-boris-20917938">who has wisely stopped expressing sympathy for Andrew</a> and is wombling on about "getting business done" instead.</p>
      <p>"Who's to blame for the failure of this task?" asks Lord Sugar. And for once, not one of them will blame the weakest link.</p>

      <p>"Come on, come on," he says. "All we asked of you is to not be an idiot, and it turns out you've been an idiot choosing your friends, choosing your words, and choosing your excuses. I mean, telling people you don't sweat or hug people in public when there's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/glistening-sweat-very-handsy-prince-20905458">pictures of you everywhere sweatily hugging people.</a> You're hardly a candidate for Mastermind, are you?"</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry, I haven't a clue," says Andrew. "Everything's a blankety blank apart from an hour I once spent in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-pizza-express-swamped-20898348">Pizza Express in Woking.</a> We cannot know if the cameras recording my every move were all lying, and I'm not about to ask the police to look back in their notebooks because there's all sorts in there. Perhaps it was a blind date, or the thrill of the chase. Take your pick, but 15 to 1 there was no orgy. Not that I can remember, anyway."</p>
      <p>Lord Sugar rolls his eyes. "This is pointless," he mutters. "You don't get it, do you? It's a question of deportment. To steal your catchphrase, you behaved in a manner unbecoming. And you're out there representing the country, aren't you? A country with people of all races and shades who were quite happy that someone like you could strike it lucky if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-allegations-flight-logs-5016477">you just kept your nose clean."</a></p>
      <p>Andrew senses victory. "You bet, Lord Sugar. But who wants to be a millionaire? I don't want to rely on the family fortunes and just inherit stuff in a generation game. I'd far rather use mystery money from unknown sources to do dodgy property deals and buy a ski chalet with my ex-wife."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In any walk of life, from Prime Minister to kitchen porter, anyone who had behaved as Prince Andrew has would be forced to resign out of sheer embarrassment.</p>
      <p>Holidaying with a wrong 'un, still holidaying with him after he was convicted for soliciting a minor, attending a get-out-of-jail dinner party, claiming he wasn't that much of a friend anyway but still flying 4,000 miles and spending 4 days by his side just to tell him you can't be friends anymore - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-must-investigated-police-20903418">pull the other one, sonny, this one's got bells on.</a></p>
      <p>And if royal life really was a Dragon's Den, Johnson and Corbyn would not have politely avoided criticising the second son of the grandmother they want to have tea with once a week. They'd have said his behaviour was unacceptable, suspicious, and so seriously off that even a half-dead corgi could smell it a mile away. We'd cheer them if, for that reason, they declared <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/royal-family-member-who-racked-17217078">no more money</a> would be ploughed into the project of keeping Andrew in a job.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>But the price we - and Andrew - pay for having a constitutional monarchy is that they can't be sacked. We benefit from the fact they are not politicians, and the cost is not being able to vote them out. They gain from being untouchable, and lose because the public is denied the catharsis of putting them in a taxi. In the absence of a Great British Crown Off, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/crown-star-says-prince-charles-20914646">we find other ways to humiliate them.</a></p>
      <p>Anyone else would be able to end it all by quitting. Andrew is stuck in the loser's cafe for life, and it is his curse to not realise his only way out is to admit he is the idiot we think he is.</p>
      <p>As it is, all he can think of to do is to thank Emily Maitlis for the opportunity, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-considering-second-interview-20920558">and ask for another interview.</a></p>
      <p>Preferably, in a sauna while eating a Domino's.</p>
