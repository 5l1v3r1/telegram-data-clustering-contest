      <h1>Ty Kolle adds offensive punch to the improving Regina Pats</h1>
      <h2>Ty Kolle had two goals, including the shootout winner, for the Regina Pats in Saturday's 4-3 win over the Prince Albert Raiders.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>There’s no ‘I’ in Ty.</p>
      <p>Although veteran Ty Kolle is enjoying the best personal stretch of his WHL career, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-finally-getting-rewarded-for-their-hard-work">he would rather talk about the recent progress of his team, the Regina Pats</a>.</p>
      <p>Heading into Tuesday’s clash with the visiting Swift Current Broncos, Regina had earned six points in the past six games and was arguably playing its best hockey of the season.</p>
      <p>“Our whole team is doing awesome,” Kolle said. “Everybody has been in a good mood and I think that has kind of transitioned over to everybody’s personal games.”</p>
      <p>Kolle is one of them.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old left winger — playing on Regina’s top line with Robbie Holmes and Austin Pratt — has four goals and four assists in his past eight games. He’s also 2-for-2 in the shootout, including a game-winner in <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-score-huge-upset-win-over-prince-albert-raiders">Saturday’s 4-3 decision over the Prince Albert Raiders</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s going pretty well lately,” said Kolle, who also scored Regina’s first goal versus P.A. and had a potential go-ahead marker overturned by video review late in the third period.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been doing my job, I guess. My role is more on the offensive side of things. As much as I’m doing my job, I think everybody else is doing their job as well. I’ve just relied on the teammates to help out. Everybody did their part.”</p>
      <p>Regina’s brass had hoped Kolle would be a productive player when he was acquired last season as part of a <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-deal-with-emotions-after-trading-henry-and-leschyshyn">blockbuster trade with the Lethbridge Hurricanes</a>.</p>
      <p>While agreeing to send their top-two scorers to Lethbridge (Nick Henry and Jake Leschyshyn), the rebuilding Pats wanted to get someone back who could contribute right away. After Kolle finished the season with 16 goals and 28 points in 64 contests, he vowed to come back a better player.</p>
      <p>Although his overall consistency remains a work in progress, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/ty-kolle-looking-to-find-another-gear-with-regina-pats">Kolle has added another notch to his game this season</a>, climbing to second on the team with seven goals and 13 points in 17 games.</p>
      <p>“There is still a little bit more in regards to his work ethic and his commitment to his game away from the puck,” noted head coach Dave Struch. “But Ty is one of our better offensive players so there are things we need to allow him to do.</p>
      <p>“He has it in him to play the right way away from the puck but there are risks we need him to take to create offence. When he does it, there are times that we have to sit back and evaluate what he was really trying to do to create offence. That’s the leeway we give him.”</p>
      <p>The Pats need Kolle to continue rewarding their faith, especially given the team’s lack of offensive punch.</p>
      <p>Regina has been much better as of late, scoring 3.8 goals per game over the past six contests after averaging a league-worst 2.0 in the first 11. It’s no accident that those improvements have coincided with Kolle’s best individual stretch with the club.</p>
      <p>“Guys feed off it because he is a good goal scorer and he is good with the puck,” Struch added. “When he does things the right way without the puck, it’s a confidence builder. It makes it easier for us to put him on the ice in a lot of defensive situations when we do need offence created.”</p>
