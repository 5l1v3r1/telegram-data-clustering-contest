      <p>Fresh from their T20 World Cup preliminary display in Abu Dhabi last month, Jersey head to Oman on Saturday where the road to the next 50-over World Cup begins.</p>
      <p>Challenge League Group B opponents Uganda, Hong Kong, Italy, Kenya and Bermuda all stand between the Caesareans and progression to the second of three qualifying stages, but the captain – who is hoping to be chipping in with as many wickets as he can – believes his side have enough in the tank to get through.</p>
      <p>Only the two group winners will advance to the World Cup play-off, following three Challenge League round-robin outings between now and 2021.</p>
      <p>Perchard said: ‘We’ve had a good couple of weeks off now and it has been back into some indoor training before we go off on Saturday.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve got three warm up games before we begin and everyone is looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>‘The group is very open. We played Hong Kong a few weeks ago and we lost narrowly, and they haven’t got anything too special so we know we have enough in our ranks to beat them and progress.</p>
      <p>‘If we don’t perform then that won’t happen but we have enough and we are looking forward to it.’</p>
      <p>Neil MacRae’s men will go straight into three warm-up games against Oman A following their arrival this weekend, as the hosts’ first team prepare for their own qualifiers in League 2 (for nations ranked 14th-20th in the world). Jersey are ranked 28th.</p>
      <p>After that it is straight into the main event, with the opener against Uganda on 2 December followed by four games coming thick and fast before they wrap things up on 11 December against Bermuda.</p>
