      <h2>Pro-EU party says scrapping Brexit would boost UK economy by 1.9%</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:08:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Hughes</a></address>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats on Wednesday vowed to scrap Brexit and generate a £50bn “Remain bonus” for the public finances, with a party manifesto aimed at winning over pro-EU voters in the upcoming election.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem party leader, said the UK economy would be 1.9 per cent larger by 2024-25 if her party came to power and halted the UK’s departure from the EU under the terms agreed by Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem blueprint for government also sets out policies to tackle climate change, with a pledge to generate a third of the UK’s electricity from renewable energy by 2030, as well as plans to increase free childcare and recruit 20,000 more teachers.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems have doubled down on their pitch as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/20dca3e8-0166-11ea-be59-e49b2a136b8d">Britain’s “party of Remain”</a> in recent months. They have vowed to revoke Article 50 — the EU’s official Brexit process — without recourse to a second referendum. If the Lib Dems lose the election, they are expected to continue to push for a second vote on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson insisted her party were “within a small swing of winning hundreds of seats” in December’s general election. However, recent polling suggests the party is already being squeezed by Labour and is unlikely to increase its parliamentary representation of 19 seats to more than 40.</p>
      <p>The party’s manifesto launch also comes as YouGov polling data found Ms Swinson has become less popular with voters as her visibility on the campaign trail has increased. Since she was elected party leader in July, her favourability rating is up only 3 points to 24 per cent, while her unfavourable rating has risen 19 points to 48 per cent.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the manifesto’s official launch on Wednesday afternoon, Ms Swinson, said it was “a bold plan to build a brighter future for our country, and that starts with stopping Brexit”.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem leader added: “Labour and the Conservatives can’t offer the country a brighter future because they both want Brexit. We know that will be bad for our economy, bad for our NHS and bad for our environment.</p>
      <p>“Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and invest in our mental health services, give free childcare to working parents, put 20,000 more teachers into classrooms and take ambitious action to tackle the climate emergency.”</p>
      <p>A Lib Dem government would provide 35 hours of free childcare for two- to four-year-olds, 48 weeks a year. Working parents with children aged between 9 and 24 months would also be eligible.</p>
      <p>The UK government currently provides up to 30 hours of free childcare to working parents for children aged between three and four.</p>

      <p>The party has vowed to reverse cuts to schools with an “emergency cash injection” of £4.6bn in 2020. The manifesto said the extra funding would rise to £10.6bn by 2024/25, enabling them to recruit 20,000 extra teachers.</p>
      <p>Other plans set out on Wednesday include offering every adult £10,000 to spend on skills training over the course of their lives, as well as a new “commercial landowner levy” that would remove buildings and utilities from calculations, and only tax the land value of a commercial site. </p>
      <p>The current business rates system is based on “ratable values”, which are calculated every five years according to shop rental values, and a multiplier that rises annually with consumer price index inflation. The levy is paid by tenants, rather than landlords.</p>
      <p>The manifesto also details a pledge to invest £15bn over the next parliament to retrofit 26m homes — a move the party said would save the average household £550 a year on energy bills. </p>
      <p>The Lib Dems made significant advances in May’s local elections, making more than 500 gains amid a voter backlash against the two main parties.</p>
