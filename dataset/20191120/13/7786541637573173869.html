      <p><b>MEXICO CITYÂ (AP)</b> - A 5.4-magnitude earthquake has rattled the southern Pacific coast of Mexico before dawn, just hours after a 6.3 quake.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the two quakes occurred at almost the same spot, just offshore from the Mexico-Guatemala border.</p>
      <p>It was unclear if the 5.4 quake at 11:30 a.m. UTC on Wednesday was an aftershock of the 6.3 temblor at 4:27 a.m. UTC.</p>
      <p>The civil defense office of the southern state of Chiapas said no damage was immediately reported.</p>
