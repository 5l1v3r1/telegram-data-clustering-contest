      <p>Kate Beckinsale was keen to show off her hip bones as she celebrated MIRROR’s home gym launch.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old attended the grand opening of the California store, which describes itself as ‘the world’s first nearly invisible, interactive home gym.’</p>
      <p>And while posing for pictures in a mustard coloured suit, the actress was spotted pulling down her trousers and exposing her abs.</p>
      <p>Honestly girl, you should have opted for low waisted jeans at this rate.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the Underworld star celebrated the lavish event by sharing a string of photos from the night where she was joined by 90210 star Sara Foster.</p>

      <p>She wrote to her 3.5million followers: ‘Beautiful,clever,funny girls @sarafoster and @erinfoster are bringing us @getthemirror at this chic little store @westfieldcenturycity. It’s an interactive home gym inside a mirror.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I hoped the future would eventually arrive and allow me to do exercise classes nude and covered in jam, and finally we are here @getthemirror.’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment and while a number of her followers complimented the star on her wardrobe, others couldn’t help but notice how Kate had pulled down her trousers on one side.</p>
      <p>‘Your hips appear to be substantially misaligned! Perhaps you should see a Chiro?!?’ someone wrote while another teased: ‘MC Hammer trousers.’</p>

      <p>Others added: ‘You want to be careful, it looks like the elastic has gone in your kecks.’</p>
      <p>Kate recently dated Pete Davidson after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/14/ariana-grande-splits-from-pete-davidson-months-after-engagement-8037908/">he called off his engagement to the pop star Ariana Grande.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/25/kate-beckinsale-pete-davidson-split-single-ready-mingle-summer-9320985/">However, the pair have since split,</a> with rumours started to swirl that the comedian has moved on with new girl Kaia Gerber.</p>
      <p>The funnyman was allegedly said to have visited the model at her apartment, although the two are ‘just friends’, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/23/pete-davidson-seen-leaving-kaia-gerbers-apartment-building/">according to a source from Page Six.</a></p>
      <p>The 18-year-old did nothing to quash the speculation, as she has recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/cindy-crawfords-daughter-kaia-gerber-sports-p-letter-necklace-amid-pete-davidson-dating-rumours-11066449/">been seen wearing a golden necklace with the letter ‘P’ hanging from it.</a></p>
      <p>It’s not known who ‘P’ is – Kaia does have a brother named Presley, who even has her signature tattooed on his arm.</p>
