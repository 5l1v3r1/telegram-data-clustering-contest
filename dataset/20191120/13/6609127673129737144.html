        <b>A CRUEL yob who swung a dog by the ears before unleashing a volley of kicks on the terrified pet because it wouldn't 'walk properly' has been banned from keeping animals for a year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Allan King, 34, grabbed the mongrel before dropping it on the ground. He then struck its back with his knee and repeatedly kicked it.</p>

      <p>The attack left a shocked eyewitness 'physically sick' after she watched him repeatedly strike the 'cowering and trembling' animal in Bellshill, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>The dog was heard whimpering and was seen shaking with its tail between its legs as King attacked it.</p>
      <p>When he was asked to stop his attack, the thug, he shouted 'F**k off' at the woman.</p>
      <p>Passing police intervened and King was caught after fleeing the scene.</p>

      <p>The thug, who was supposed to be looking after the dog, said he hit the animal because it would not walk properly.</p>
      <p>King, of Bellshill, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court and admitted causing the dog unnecessary suffering and acting in a threatening or abusive manner in June this year.</p>
      <p>He has now been banned from keeping any animals for 12 months and ordered to carry out 210 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Morag McClintock said: "At around 11.15am the witness was on the main street in Bellshill where the accused had the dog off the ground with its ears and was swinging the dog with them.</p>
      <p>"He then dropped the dog on the ground.</p>
      <p>"The witness asked the accused to stop and leave the dog alone but he shouted 'f**k off' and while this was going on police in uniform could hear the shouting.</p>
      <p>"The police saw him walking towards them and kept a watch on him and observed the accused strike the dog three times with considerable force.</p>
      <p>"It was seen cowering from the accused, sinking lower to the ground and trembling.</p>

      <p>"When the accused saw the police he let go of the lead and ran off.</p>
      <p>"He was asked to stop but continued running and a foot chase took place with other officers eventually finding him.</p>
      <p>"The accused said 'look I'm sorry I kicked my dog. I'm sorry but the dog was not walking'.</p>
      <p>"The civilian witness advised she had never seen anything like it and that his actions had made her physically sick."</p>
      <p>The dog was later handed into Bellshill police station.</p>
      <p>Jack Grant, defending, said: “This wasn’t his dog but his partner's who had been away on a long weekend and he had been given the dog to look after and this took place on the last day he had it.</p>
      <p>“His actions on that day were deplorable but he says he was frustrated and embarrassed by the dog and did what he did and for that he is extremely remorseful.</p>
      <p>“He is prepared to accept that a custodial sentence may well be in the court’s mind but I ask that that there is some sort of alternative imposed.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Vincent Smith said: “In all of the circumstances I’m going to deal with this by way of a community payback order with a requirement you carry out unpaid work.”</p>
