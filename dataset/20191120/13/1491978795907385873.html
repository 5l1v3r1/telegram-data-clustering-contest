        <i><i>Babesia</i><i> venatorum</i>, which causes flu symptoms and jaundice in humans, identified in sheep in north-east Scotland</i>
      </p>
      <p>Concerns have been raised after a potentially deadly tick-borne parasite was found in the UK for the first time.</p>
      <p>The organism – named <i>Babesia venatorum</i> – causes babesiosis, an animal disease recognised as an emerging infection in humans.</p>
      <p>It has been recorded extensively in China and also in Europe, with two confirmed human infections in Italy over the past 20 years, but has never previously appeared in the UK.</p>
      <p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said infected people might get symptoms such as flu and jaundice but severe cases could lead to death.</p>
      <p>A study by University of Glasgow scientists reports that the organism has now been identified in sheep in the north-east of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>Willie Weir, senior university clinician, said: “The presence of <i>B venatorum</i> in the UK represents a new risk to humans working, living, or hiking in areas with infected ticks and livestock, particularly sheep.</p>
      <p>“Although we believe the threat to humans to be low, nevertheless local health and veterinary professionals will need to be aware of the disease if the health risk from tick-borne disease in the UK is to be fully understood.</p>
      <p>“Our findings follow the recent report of the detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus in the UK. Taken together, these findings signify a change in the landscape of tick-borne pathogens in the UK and the underlying causes for this need to be investigated.”</p>
      <p>Scientists collected blood from sheep, cattle and deer in the north-east of Scotland in areas where tick-borne diseases had been detected.</p>
      <p>DNA from the parasite was detected in the blood of a large number of sheep, which were not showing any signs of disease, making them carrier animals.</p>
      <p>Researchers believe <i>B venatorum</i> may have been carried to the UK by migratory birds from Scandinavia.</p>
      <p>Identification of this parasite in the UK raises concerns for European public health and farming policy, according to the study’s authors.</p>
      <p>The paper is published in the December edition of Emerging Infectious Disease.</p>
