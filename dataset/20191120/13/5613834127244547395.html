      <p>It’s been along time coming, but <b><i>Detroit: Become Human</i></b> will see its PC debut this December. Quantic Dream’s sci-fi morality tale will arrive on the Epic Games Store on December 12, completing the trio of games Quantic Dream had <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3551949/quantic-dream-bringing-heavy-rain-beyond-two-souls-detroit-become-human-epic-games-store/">announced at the beginning of the year.</a></p>
      <p>For those keeping track, <b><i>Heavy Rain</i></b> arrived in June, followed by <b><i>Beyond: Two Souls</i></b> in July.</p>
      <p>In <i>Detroit: Become Human</i>, the game takes place in a near future where androids speak, move and behave like human beings, but exist only to serve. In something out of <i>Blade Runner</i>, the moral and ethical questions arise, which players will grapple with from the perspective of three different androids, named Kara, Connor, and Markus. The decisions they make will affect not just their own fates, but that of the entire city of Detroit.</p>
      <p><i>Detroit: Become Human</i> is also available on PlayStation 4.</p>
