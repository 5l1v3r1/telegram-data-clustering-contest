        <b>Derry City have signed English striker Walter Figueira.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Chelsea youth player makes the move to the Brandywell after impressing with Waterford in the second half of last season.</p>
      <p>Figueira scored five goals before his spell at the RSC and Derry boss Declan Devine says they've secured a "quality player".</p>
      <p>“Derry fans who saw him play for Waterford against us in the Brandywell will know exactly the type of player we’ve brought here.</p>
      <p>“He wants to play every minute of every match and that’s what we need at this club. He had a host of offers from clubs in Ireland and Scotland so we are delighted to have secured his signature.”</p>

      <p>Devine is confident they can make some more signings soon:</p>
      <p>“Walter obviously won’t be the last player coming in. The hard work continues to strengthen the squad ahead of what is certain to be a fiercely competitive league in 2020.”</p>
