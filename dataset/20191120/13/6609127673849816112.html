        <b>THE boss of a lapdancing club admitted throwing a customer down a flight of stairs – after he refused to buy drinks for two strippers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Victim George Williamson had been out celebrating his wedding anniversary with his wife and hadn’t realised The Mask, in Aberdeen, was a strip club, a court heard.</p>

      <p>He went in alone, after his wife returned to their hotel, and was in a booth with the two women when he was attacked.</p>
      <p>The club’s manager Mohammed Iqbal, 29, brought a tray of drinks to the table – and turned violent when Mr Williamson refused to pay.</p>
      <p>He swung punches at him four times then threw the man to the ground, placed him in a headlock and elbowed him in the face, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard.</p>
      <p>The victim suffered a fractured left cheekbone and permanent scarring to his right eye.</p>
      <p>Iqbal and colleague, Chris Masson then threw the man down a set of stairs and against a bar, before turfing him out onto the road.</p>

      <p>The club had its licence revoked for four months after the attack.</p>
      <p>It describes itself online as “a hotspot among gentlemen's clubs offering up-scale discrete adult entertainment until the very late hours in an intimate, sumptuous interior and surrounding that will certainly enlighten your night out”.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Lucy Simpson told the court two women “doing promo” for The Mask stopped the man on the street and persuaded him to go inside.</p>
      <p>His wife had gone to bed at an hotel, but he stayed out in town.</p>
      <p>Ms Simpson said: “The complainer said he thought it was a bar and only realised it was a strip club when Iqbal demanded payment for all three drinks.</p>
      <p>“There was a disagreement about payment and the complainer got to his feet. Iqbal punched him in the face causing him to fall back on to the wall.”</p>
      <p>CCTV played to the court showed two women leading the man into the club, with a pole dancer gyrating on a stage in the background.</p>
      <p>Footage from the booth shows one of the female staff members removing her top, putting another top on and dancing next to the man before Iqbal walks in and punches him four times.</p>
      <p>Ms Simpson said: “The victim had time off work while he recovered from the attack. He suffers from anxiety as a result of the attack.”</p>
      <p>Iqbal, whose address was given in court as Anderson Drive, Aberdeen, admitted assault to the victim’s severe injury and permanent disfigurement.</p>
      <p>Masson, whose address was given in court as Broomhill Road, Aberdeen, admitted assault.</p>
      <p>He also admitted possession of a friction lock baton on March 6.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Masson had gone to Kittybrewster Police Station on that date to discuss the assault and police found the baton in his rucksack.</p>
      <p>The case was adjourned for reports and the pair are to be sentenced on December 16.</p>
      <p>Mitigation was reserved until then.</p>
