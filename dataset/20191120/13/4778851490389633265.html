        <b>Olivier Ntcham has revealed he turned down an approach from Cameroon to represent the Indomitable Lions.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who was born in France 11 miles from the capital Paris, has represented Les Bleus at Under-21 level but qualifies for Cameroon through his parents.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Celtic View, the former Manchester City youngster said: “The Cameroon manager [Toni Conceição] approached me last year about [representing the team at senior level].</p>
      <p>"We talked, and I told him my targets.</p>
      <p>"We spoke again recently when I was preparing for the Europa League games but I told him international football was not my priority right now.</p>
      <p>"I told him I had to make sure I got back in the Celtic team first. Once I did that, then I can think about football."</p>
      <p>Ntcham, who scored a stunning late winner for the Hoops in Rome against Lazio, has been capped 20 times by France Under-21s and hasn't given up hope of receiving a call-up to the senior squad.</p>
      <p>He continued: "My parents are both from Cameroon but I’ve never been there myself. I think my parents would be happier if I played with France.”</p>
