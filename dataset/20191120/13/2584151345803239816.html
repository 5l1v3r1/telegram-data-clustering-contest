      <p>LONDON — Jo Swinson on Wednesday morning unveiled the <a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/fe34b42da454f21dccfb6b521/files/01b07d90-06d1-424a-8a4b-803c79cd3be6/Lib_Dem_Manifesto_2019.pdf">Liberal Democrat manifesto</a> ahead of the U.K. general election, with a central pledge to cancel Brexit.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dem boss said in a statement her prospectus for the country was a “bold plan to build a brighter future for our country, and that starts with stopping Brexit.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of a launch event in central London on Wednesday night, she added: “Labour and the Conservatives can’t offer the country a brighter future because they both want Brexit. We know that will be bad for our economy, bad for our NHS and bad for our environment.”</p>
      <p>At the heart of the Lib Dem manifesto is a prediction that stopping Brexit will deliver a £50 billion “Remain bonus” to the public finances — assuming the economy grows at a faster rate than it would under the Brexit deal agreed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems said that cash would go towards its spending plans, which include reversing school cuts, extending free childcare for two-year-olds and from nine-months for working parents and giving adults £10,000 over their lifetimes to spend on education and training.</p>
      <p>They also plan to borrow £130 billion to invest in capital infrastructure projects, £80 billion of which would be spent on environmental measures such as rail building and improvement and home insulation.</p>
      <p>The party also wants to increase income tax by 1p in every £1 to invest in health and social care, including expanded mental health provisions. Other income streams would include a reform of air passenger duty, charging businesses and frequent flyers more and regular passengers less, which the Lib Dems think would rake in £4.8 million a year by 2024/25.</p>
      <p>The party also wants to legalize cannabis for sale in licensed premises, which would reap £1.5 million for the Treasury in the final year of the next parliament.</p>
      <p>The chance of the Lib Dems winning the election on December 12 are next to zero, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">according to current polling</a>. It is more likely they could be kingmakers if the Tories or Labour need help to form a majority after polling day — although Swinson has ruled out any kind of coalition deals.</p>
      <p>One Lib Dem former minister said the party wanted to win, but if it failed to do so, it would vote on an issue-by-issue basis, steered by the manifesto commitments.</p>
