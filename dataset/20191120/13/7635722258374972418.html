        <b>Kerry's Sarah Houlihan has called time on her 13-year inter-county career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The three-time All-Star forward joins last year's captain Amanda Brosnan in stepping away from the Kingdom's panel ahead of the new season.</p>
      <p>Houlihan says it's been a "privilege" to wear the green and gold jersey and that she retires with "millions of memories" having made "lifelong friends" through the game.</p>

      <p>“The privilege has been all mine,” Houlihan said when announcing the news on social media.</p>
      <p>“13 years of playing in the green &amp; gold jersey I feel it’s time I started a new chapter.</p>
      <p>“Has brought me to wonderful places, introduced me to lifelong friends &amp; given me millions of memories. Thank you to my family &amp; friends, forever grateful.”</p>
