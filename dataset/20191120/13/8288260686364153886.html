      <p>A cabin crew member has been accused of being more than six times the alcohol limit while working at Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>Lemara Thompson, 27, allegedly had 135 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood in her body at the major transport hub on June 16, 2019.</p>
      <p>The cabin crew member, who was working for US-based Delta Airlines and was on duty at the time of the alleged incident, faces one charge of performing an aviation function with a blood alcohol level over the prescribed limit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The American national was allegedly nearly seven times the 20 milligram legal limit for people performing duties related to an aircraft, according to Civil Aviation Authority rules and the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.</p>
      <p>Thompson did not appear at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court for a hearing on Wednesday but responded to the court via post.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Chair Magistrate Alison White adjourned the case for two weeks to give Thompson notice to travel to court or set up a video link.</p>
      <p>Thompson, of Ocean Avenue, Brooklyn, United States, is expected to appear at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court on December 4.</p>
