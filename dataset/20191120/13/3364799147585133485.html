      <p>Investors in mainland China are buying up equities listed on Hong Kong's stock market, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mainland-chinese-investors-pile-into-hong-kong-despite-unrest-11574252677">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Wednesday, sinking nearly $20 billion into the stocks since the start of June. </p>
      <p>The Chinese buyers are betting on a recovery from cheap prices, as months-long protests drag on multiple facets of the nation's economy. Year-to-date purchases through the Stock Connect trading platform have more than doubled from the year-ago period, WSJ reported, citing Chinese data provider Wind.</p>
      <p>Stock Connect links Hong Kong's market to its peers in Shenzhen and Shanghai. The most-bought Hong Kong stocks include <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tencent-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hsbc-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">HSBC</a>, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/china_construction_bank_1-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">China Construction Bank</a>, WSJ reported, citing Wind data.</p>
      <p>Investors are becoming less sensitive to updates on the city's protests, and many view the events as an opportunity to buy companies at a discount, Alphalex Capital Management managing director Alex Au told WSJ. He added that more than half of the stocks listed in Hong Kong are mainland firms.</p>
      <p>The buying of Hong Kong stocks has risen as protests intensified. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-going-on-in-hong-kong-china-protests-nba-apple?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest#october-22-6">Demonstrations kicked off in June</a> over a proposed extradition law that would allow Hong Kong residents to be tried in mainland China. The legislation was viewed as a threat to Hong Kong's semiautonomous status, and though the bill was pulled in September, protests have continued. Most recently, hundreds of demonstrators <a href="https://www.insider.com/hong-kong-protesters-surrender-to-police-after-university-siege-2019-11">surrendered to Hong Kong police</a> after a days-long siege at the city's Polytechnic University.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/hang_seng?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Hang Seng Index</a> has underperformed the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;p_500?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">S&amp;P 500</a> and China's <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/csi-300?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">CSI 300</a> through 2019, Au noted.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's macroeconomic picture also dragged on domestic stocks. The city entered <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hong-kong-recession-gdp-contraction-first-in-decade-on-protests-2019-10-1028648557?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">its first official recession in a decade</a> after October data showed its economy shrinking 3.2% though the third-quarter. The antigovernment protests flared up in the July-to-September period, roiling the city's restaurant, retail, and tourism industries. Hong Kong's economy contracted 0.5% in the second quarter. An economy enters recession after two consecutive quarters of GDP decline.</p>
