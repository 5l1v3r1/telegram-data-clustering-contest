      <p>The Liberal Democrats have put stopping Brexit at the heart of their General Election platform as they sought to underline their claim to be the party of Remain.</p>
      <p>The party’s manifesto, published on Wednesday, holds out the prospect of a £50 billion “Remain bonus” to be spent on public services and tackling inequalities if they succeed in keeping Britain in the EU.</p>
      <p>It sets out plans to tackle the climate change “emergency” through generating 80% of the country’s electricity through renewables by 2030, provide free childcare from the age of nine months, and recruit 20,000 more teachers.</p>
      <blockquote>Our politics has been dominated by the two, tired old parties for too long<cite>Jo Swinson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said: “This manifesto is a bold plan to build a brighter future for our country, and that starts with stopping Brexit.</p>
      <p>“Labour and the Conservatives can’t offer the country a brighter future because they both want Brexit. We know that will be bad for our economy, bad for our NHS and bad for our environment.</p>
      <p>“Our politics has been dominated by the two, tired old parties for too long. This election provides an opportunity to change the future of our country and build a brighter future with the Liberal Democrats.”</p>
      <p>The manifesto reaffirms the party’s commitment to end the Brexit process by revoking Article 50 if there is a majority Lib Dem government following the election on December 12.</p>
      <p>If not, the manifesto says they would continue to campaign for a “people’s vote” in a fresh referendum with on option to stay in the EU on the ballot paper.</p>
      <p>“The election of a Liberal Democrat majority government on a clear stop Brexit platform will provide a democratic mandate to stop this mess, revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU,” the manifesto says.</p>
      <p>“In other circumstances, we will continue to fight for a people’s vote with the option to stay in the EU, and in that vote we would passionately campaign to keep the UK in the EU.”</p>
      <blockquote><b>£50 billion<br/></b>Estimated 'Remain bonus' for staying in the EU<cite>Lib Dems manifesto</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The Lib Dems argue that staying in the EU would generate a £50 billion “Remain bonus” over five years, through higher levels of growth.</p>
      <p>They estimate the economy will be 1.9% larger in 2024-25 than it would be under Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, giving them extra funding to spend on their priorities in the years ahead.</p>
      <p>They include a target of doubling the amount of power generated through renewables by 2030 while investing £15 billion over five years in retro-fitting 26 million homes with insulation and zero-carbon heating.</p>
      <p>The party says it would increase opportunities through providing 35 hours a week free childcare for all two to four year-olds – with the offer extended to those aged nine to 24 months where the parents are working.</p>
      <p>At the same time the party says it would give all adults £10,000 to spend on skills and training throughout their lives through the creation of a new “skills wallet”.</p>
      <p>The manifesto promises to reverse frontline budget cuts for schools in England since 2015 with an emergency cash injection of £4.6 billion next year.</p>
      <p>It says that by 2024-25, they will be spending £10.6 billion more on schools than is currently being spent – enabling them to increase the number of teachers by 20,000 over five years.</p>
      <p>The party is also promising that mental health services would be treated with the same urgency as physical health with a £11 billion cash injection over the lifetime of the parliament.</p>
      <p>Frequent flyers would be targeted by reforms to air passenger duty, which are estimated to raise £4.86 billion a year by 2024-25.</p>
      <p>The party said it will be connected to the number of times people fly – meaning those who fly once a year for a family holiday would pay a lower amount than the current scheme.</p>
      <p>A consultation would take place before any changes were implemented, the Lib Dems said, which would apply to international return flights rather than domestic flights.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems also believe £1.49 billion a year can be raised by 2024-25 by introducing a cannabis duty, which they hope would “break the grip” of criminal gangs.</p>
      <p>Limits on potency levels would be introduced and cannabis would be sold through licensed outlets to adults over the age of 18, according to the manifesto.</p>
      <p>On Britain’s nuclear deterrent, the manifesto brings an end to continual at sea deterrence – meaning the number of boats would be reduced and the country would not commit to have them at sea every second of every day.</p>
      <p>The party has also said it would want to hold discussions with the BBC about free TV licences for over-75s.</p>
