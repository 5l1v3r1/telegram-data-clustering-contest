      <p>Renee Merrifield, CEO and founder of Kelowna's Troika Management Corp., has been named one of Canada's most powerful women by the Women's Executive Network.</p>
      <p>Merrifield made the top 100 list of Canada’s most powerful women for the third year in a row. </p>
      <p>This is the first time that a leader from the Okanagan has achieved the honour three times.</p>
      <p>Merrifield runs a land and development company with projects in four provinces across Western Canada, based in Kelowna.  </p>
      <p>Merrifield says she feels "humbled."</p>
      <p>"The first time was surreal, winning took me by surprise. Now, I am so proud to bring increased attention to our Okanagan Valley; to know that I am making a difference in our community, province and country; and to believe that I have not only ideas as an entrepreneur, but also strength and tenacity.” </p>
      <p>She added: "This award isn’t about me, it’s as much about the team at Troika that believes in who we are, in what we do every day, and in how we impact our community positively.”</p>
      <p>Past award winners include Canada’s most iconic female trailblazers: best-selling author, Margaret Atwood, astronaut Dr. Roberta Bondar, CEO of Venture Communications Arlene Dickinson, and many more.</p>
