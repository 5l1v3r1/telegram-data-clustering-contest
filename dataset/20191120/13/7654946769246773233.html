      <h1>Telecom giant BT, universities cut ties with scandal-plagued Prince Andrew</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:24:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:24</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Woods</a></address>
      <p>A massive telecommunications firm along with three Australian universities — have severed ties with organizations linked to Prince Andrew <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">following the royal’s ill-fated BBC interview</a>, according to new reports.</p>
      <p>The UK-based, multinational firm BT <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/20/bt-says-it-will-not-work-with-company-linked-to-prince-andrew">confirmed to The Guardian</a> Wednesday that it would not work with the Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA) — which helps participants develop workplace skills — unless Prince Andrew is removed as patron.</p>
      <p>“We have been working with the company since its launch in 2017 and our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York,” a BT spokesperson told the paper. “As a leading provider of online digital skills training, iDEA was a natural partner for our new Skills for Tomorrow program.”</p>
      <p>“However, in light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organization and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage,” the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, accounting powerhouse KPMG <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/prince-andrews-disastrous-epstein-interview-is-costing-his-charities/">yanked its sponsorship</a> of the embattled prince’s Pitch@Palace program — which provides mentorships to budding entrepreneurs — and it wasn’t the last institution to pull its support for the charity.</p>
      <p>Three Australian universities — Bond University, the University of Wollongong and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology — have either ended their relationships with the initiative or decided not to continue it in the future, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/prince-andrew-bt-and-three-universities-abandon-ties-with-duke-after-epstein-tv-interview-11865413">Sky News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Barclays has recently renewed its sponsorship of the program, but is understood to be monitoring the matter, the Guardian reported.</p>
      <p>The English-Swedish biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca’s three-year partnership with the program is set to expire by the end of the year and is being reviewed, according to the report.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University will review Andrew’s role as patron during a meeting next week, the paper reported.</p>
      <p>The student union panel at the University of Huddersfield <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/british-university-panel-calls-for-prince-andrew-to-step-down-as-chancellor/">voted unanimously this week</a> for Prince Andrew to step down as the chancellor — a motion that will be reviewed by the university.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old duke has faced a wave of criticism following his “car crash” of an interview with BBC journalist Emily Maitlis — during which he denied getting sweaty with and hugging Jeffrey Epstein’s then-17-year-old female victim, Virginia Giuffre, before having sex with her in 2001.</p>
