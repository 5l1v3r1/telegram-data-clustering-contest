      <h1>Women’s Hockey Wednesday: Hayley Wickenheiser inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame</h1>

      <p>Hayley Wickenheiser stepped into the Hockey Hall of Fame this weekend, a place that pretty much everyone who ever saw her play knew she would end up. She was the first woman to be inducted as soon as she was eligible, and the only woman in the 2019 class.</p>
      <p>Wickenheiser deserves every minute of celebration from this weekend. She ended her speech by highlighting the strides that have been made since she first wanted to play hockey, talking about her young nieces and how they could, if they wished to, walk into “any hockey rink in the country” and no one would give them a second look.</p>
      <p>Her nieces are five and six years old. For the twenty-five and twenty-six year olds, there’s <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/hockey/womens-hockey-minor-hockey-collapse-cwhl-1.5349714">so much further to go</a>.</p>

Not bad for a girl who used to slink into the arena, hoping to go unnoticed, to play a game that belonged, at the time, to boys and men.</p>
