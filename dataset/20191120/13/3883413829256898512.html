      <p>The Liberal Democrats have launched their 2019 manifesto ahead of the General Election, pledging greater investment in tackling cyber warfare.</p>
      <p>They have promised to spend <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/general-election-2019-what-2-defence-spending-target">2% of GDP on defence</a>, which is the current level of spending, as well as pledging to improve the quality of housing for service personnel.</p>
      <p>The party wants to give military tenants the same legal rights to repair and maintenance as private tenants.</p>
      <p>Other defence points in their manifesto include promoting an international treaty on the principles and limitations on the use of technology in modern warfare and maintaining a minimum nuclear deterrent, although the party says it is pursuing nuclear disarmament.</p>

      <p>The Lib Dems also say they would give science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates up to £10,000 to become Armed Forces engineers.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson's party said economic growth through stopping Brexit would allow for a bigger purse with regards to future defence expenditure.</p>
