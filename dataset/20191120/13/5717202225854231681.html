      <h1>Report shares what Jose Mourinho’s told Spurs about January</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705887/Jose-Mourinho-tells-Tottenham-NOT-need-spend-big-January.html">According to a report from the Daily Mail</a>, Jose Mourinho has told Tottenham Hotspur that he does not need funds for a spending spree in January, with the new Spurs boss largely happy with the squad available to him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many football fans will be watching what goes on at Tottenham in the coming months incredibly closely. It appears to be a fascinating move to replace Mauricio Pochettino with Jose Mourinho.</p>

      <p>Pochettino has established himself as one of the best custodians of clubs looking to work through a long-term project. Mourinho meanwhile, has tended to win trophies in little time before disappearing almost as quickly.</p>
      <p>His arrival is particularly intriguing given that Mourinho has arguably become somewhat synonymous with big-money transfers and significant squad overhauls, while Pochettino’s net spend during his time at Spurs only enhances the notion that he did an incredible job during his time in North London.</p>

      <p>But it appears that Mourinho is the one ready to adapt. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705887/Jose-Mourinho-tells-Tottenham-NOT-need-spend-big-January.html">The Daily Mail reports</a> that he has already told the Tottenham hierarchy that he does not need big funds in January.</p>
      <p>The report notes that Mourinho feels that he already has a squad that he is happy with. It is noted that he could be interested in signing a new defender if the right player becomes available.</p>
      <h3>TBR View – Mourinho surely right to delay foray into transfer market</h3>
      <p>January is notorious for being a difficult time to go significant business. So it is perhaps correct that Mourinho is planning to hold back for the time-being.</p>
      <p>He is unlikely to come under any pressure anytime soon. So he can take plenty of time to assess his squad and see which players are ready to respond to his way of working.</p>
      <p>It unfortunately, makes it seem slightly more likely that Spurs fans may not have too much to cheer this season. But it may benefit Tottenham in the long run to wait until the summer.</p>
      <p>It appears that Mourinho may be about to surprise those expecting a busy January at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
