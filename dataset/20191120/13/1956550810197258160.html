Well, of course it already is in a realistic sense, but it’s also taken on<a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gaming-tech"> 3D technology in beneficial and futuristic</a> ways.<br/><br/>Not only are there autonomous vehicles driving around the city to map out Dubai for a full scale 3D map, but an exhibition also showed off food that is literally printed. The <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gaming-tech">future</a> really is fast approaching.<br/><br/>Along with incredibly fast network 5G speeds at Dubai’s iconic multi-cultural theme park, each week of technology in Dubai only gets more impressive.

HUMAN 2.0 showed us how people would be if they upgraded like iPhones and people could control drones with their brains. More importantly, it gave visitors a taste of 3D printed food.

It’s not that they’re uninterested in all the new additions for its 24th season. Quite the opposite, they’re taking full advantage of being in the world’s first 5G-powered entertainment destination thanks to Dubai-based telecoms company du. Fast rides, faster internet.<br/><br/><b>Driverless Cartography</b><br/>If you happen to be driving in the UAE and see a car on the road with no one in it, no need to panic. It could be part of a self-driving car fleet mapping out the city in 3D. Not only is it working towards Dubai’s plan on making 25 percent of on-road vehicles completely autonomous, the cars will also create the first 3D map of the city.</p>
