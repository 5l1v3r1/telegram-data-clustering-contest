      <h2>The CPI(M) leader says there is no change in his stand on Muslim extremism</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:31:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>A day after creating a furore with his statement linking Islamic fundamentalists with Left wing extremists, CPI(M) Kozhikode district secretary P. Mohanan has clarified that he has trained his guns on the defunct National Development Front (NDF) and its new avatar Popular Front of India (PFI) for providing assistance to the proscribed outfit, CPI(Maoist).</p>
      <p>He told the media here on Wednesday that the approach and policies of these organisations were unsuitable for a secular society. Their activities would only strengthen the Hindutva forces, Mr. Mohanan said, adding that he stood by what he had commented earlier on Muslim extremism.</p>
      <p>He said the comments he had made were not his personal opinion but general impression in society. “I have only criticised Islamic extremism. But the IUML should clarify whether that party had the same views as that of these organisations,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said that Islamic extremists had united with the Maoists to throw the Left government out of power in West Bengal. A similar attempt was being worked out in Kerala as well, he alleged.</p>
      <p>If BJP leaders such as Kummanam Rajasekharan welcomed his statement, the people of this State know how that party treated and kept the entire minority communities on the enemy side, Mr. Mohanan said.</p>
      <p>He alleged that former Naxalites who had taken to armed revolution were now with the PFI and even leading it from the front. This reality was exposed before the citizens of Kozhikode. They were still continuing with Maoist activities, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mohanan said that Maoists were trying to forge an alliance with all forces to create trouble in Kerala. They had tactically put forth the theory of government-sponsored terrorism and had ganged up with Islamic extremists for subversive activities, he said.</p>
      <p>Replying to questions, he said the party would examine the case of workers Alan Suhaib and Taha Fazal booked under UAPA for alleged Maoist links. The party still did not believe that they had any association with the Left wing extremists, Mr. Mohanan said.</p>
