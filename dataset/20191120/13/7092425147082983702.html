        <b>UEFA have revealed that a draw will decide which team plays at home in the Euro 2020 play-off finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The draw takes place in Switzerland on Friday and it will confirm if Ireland will play at the Aviva Stadium, Windsor Park or in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, should they get past Slovakia in the play-off semi-final.</p>
      <p>Wales' 2-0 victory over Hungary last night confirmed Ireland will face Slovakia, with that game set to take place on Thursday, March 26 at 7.45pm.</p>
      <p>Slovakia must declare the home venue within a month, they've played all their recent games in Trnava but the reopened stadium in Bratislava could also play host to the game.</p>
      <p>The venue must be confirmed before December 20.</p>

      <p>If Ireland beat Slovakia, they will face the winner of Bosnia v Northern Ireland on Thursday, March 31, for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>UEFA have also confirmed that the draw for the group stages of Euro 2020 will take place on Saturday, November 30.</p>
      <p>Ireland will be in Group E with Spain if they qualify due to their status as tournament hosts.</p>
      <p>The seeds have been confirmed for the main draw, meaning Ireland would play Spain along with one team from France, Poland, Switzerland or Croatia.</p>
      <p>The other team in the group would be either Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden or the Czech Republic.</p>
