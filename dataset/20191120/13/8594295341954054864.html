      <h1>Ace of Base: Ford Mustang Mach-E Select</h1>

      <p>How much content can we milk out of the new <a href="https://www.macheclub.com/">Mustang Mach-E</a>? Plenty, as it turns out.</p>
      <p>When this EV hits the streets next year, it’ll be offered in several different trims. By definition, there must be a base model, right? Absolutely. And, in this case, it is called the Select (cue raging Lincoln loyalists). This post isn’t to acquit the Mach-E or Ford’s decision to call the thing a Mustang. Rather, it’s to see if the cheapest version has enough equipment to warrant a look when it shows up in a few months.</p>
      <p>The entry-level Select currently has an MSRP of $43,895. We say currently not simply because we cannot pass up an electricity-related joke but also because that price may waffle a bit between now and the car’s introduction. Note well: the more expensive models will appear first, with this Select trim not showing up until early 2021. Why? Because profits, of course.</p>
      <p>It’s not as if the Select is wanting for features. Like its more expensive brothers, it comes with the Tesla-esque 15.5-inch jumbotron touchscreen, giant 10.2-inch digital cluster, and all manner of driving aids in the form of Ford’s CoPilot 360. And in a move certain to enrage Luddites across the nation, the company’s Phone As A Key functionality is standard, as well.</p>

      <p>Its standard-range battery is estimated to provide 230 miles of range, short of the much-touted and Tesla-competitive 300 miles, but still more than enough to handle the commute of most drivers. Power is estimated to be in the 255 horsepower range, allowing the Mach-E Select to scamper to 60 mph from rest in about 6.3 seconds. At this price, all power is funnelled through the rear wheels; all-wheel drive is a $2,700 proposition here.</p>
      <p>Henry Ford would be proud, as any color off the greyscale is an extra charge item. Shadow Black is shown here. Rapid Red and Infinite Blue are $400, while a metallic white adds $600 to the note. There is no panoramic fixed-glass roof on the Select, which is fine by your author. The absence of power folding mirrors and memory functions for the power seats is an oddity.</p>

      <p>Bumping up to other trims brings more power and range, depending on one’s selection. The high-po GT that’s getting all the press (thanks to its estimated sub-four second 0-60 time) is listed at $60,500. The long-range California Route 1 trim delivers the magic 300 mile number but will start at $52,400.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that a perusal of Ford’s other wares reveals a mid-level Explorer Limited bearing a sticker of $48,130 yet devoid of big touchscreens and other features in comparison (a base rear-drive, cloth-trimmed Explorer XLT is $36,675). Someone will surely point out that the gas-powered Explorer’s range is much more than 230 miles.</p>

      <p>Regardless of what one thinks of Ford’s naming conventions, there’s an argument to be made that the entry-level Mach-E might very well be the best steed of the breed. We won’t know until we try one next year.</p>
