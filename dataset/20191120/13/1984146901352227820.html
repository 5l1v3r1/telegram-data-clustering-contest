      <h2>Premier League football returns this weekend after another international break</h2>

      <p>Newcastle United are still 11/4 to be relegated from the Premier League - despite their recent upturn in results.</p>
      <p>Wins over Manchester United, West Ham and Bournemouth have left the Magpies in 13th place heading into the return of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">top-flight football</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>In fact <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Steve Bruce's side</a> are just two points off second place in a congested league table, but the bookies still don't have high hopes for the Magpies.</p>
      <p>They don't, however, think they will go down, with four sides at shorter odds for the drop.</p>
      <p>While there is tonnes more football to play and plenty more twists on the cards, the latest odds from <a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SOCCER/EN_PR/">The Pools</a> have provided an insight into how the battles in the Premier League are expected to finish.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, it is Liverpool who are favourites for the title at 2/5 ahead of Manchester City at 9/4, while the top-four race favours Leicester City at 1/2 and Chelsea at 1/5.</p>
      <p>At the bottom, Norwich City are 1/5 to suffer relegation and Watford are evens, with Southampton at 6/4 the favourites to join them in the second-tier next season.</p>
