        <li>The flag was inspired by former Madrid player Pedja Mijatovic’s recent comments, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbzdAQp15UM">where he told El Larguero</a> he believes Bale’s priorities are in order of “Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid.”</li>

      <p>Gareth Bale posed with a flag that read “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order” after he helped his home country secure its place at UEFA Euro 2020 on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The flag was made by a group of Welsh fans, <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/16/football/1573933417_690571.html">according to AS,</a> and was inspired by former Madrid player Pedja Mijatovic’s recent comments on Bale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbzdAQp15UM">The Montenegrin told El Larguero in October</a> that the Welshman was a “peculiar type of person” whose priorities run in order of “Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid.”</p>
      <p>Mijatovic’s remarks were first turned into a chant by Wales fans during its 2-0 win over Azerbaijan on Saturday, which Bale described as “a good bit of fun,” <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-bh/news/bale-brands-wales-golf-madrid-song-a-bit-of-fun-after/5mqk2i0mim1x1exro5uqo2hfm">according to Goal.</a></p>
      <p>After the 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday, that fun escalated to the next level, as Bale and his teammates posed with a Welsh flag which had adopted the same slogan.</p>

      <p>Bale’s celebration sparked outrage with the Spanish media, as well as Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>MARCA journalist Ruben Jimenez described the 30-year-old’s actions as “ugly,” and <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/opinion/2019/11/20/5dd50e9046163f15448b45fe.html">said that the Welshman would “never be a Real Madrid legend.”</a></p>
      <p>Spanish site <a href="https://twitter.com/MadridSports_/status/1196922366464602113">Madrid Sports called the celebration “unforgivable,”</a> while Real Madrid said it was “a joke in very bad taste,” <a href="https://global.espn.com/football/real-madrid/story/3994362/sources-gareth-bale-flag-celebration-a-bad-joke-real-madrid">according to ESPN.</a></p>
      <p>Bale came close to leaving the Santiago Bernabeu in the summer for Chinese Super League side, Jiangsu Suning, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bales-move-from-real-madrid-to-jiangsu-suning-collapses-2019-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">however the trade collapsed last minute after Madrid cancelled the move.</a></p>

      <p>Aaron Ramsey scored both goals for Wales on the night, securing its place at a major tournament for the first time time since Euro 2016, where it reached the semi-finals.</p>
