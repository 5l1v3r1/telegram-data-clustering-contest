      <p>Cara Delevigne bluntly discussed how she felt like she was ‘rotting’ in an emotional chat on Running Wild with Bear Grylls.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/carnival-row/">Carnival Row</a> star doesn’t hold back as she discusses her personal struggles, which included looking after her mum, her mum’s heroin addiction, and being thrust into the limelight as a model.</p>
      <p>As the pair cooked rats over a campfire, Bear asked her questions about her life, leading to a heart-breaking confession from Cara in which she admits that she felt like she was ‘selling herself’ to fit what other people wanted.</p>
      <p>‘I had no sense of who I was. I had no identity,’ she told him. ‘All I had been was a mental illness, a child, a caretaker, or a supermodel, which just seemed so ridiculous to me.</p>
      <p>‘It was like my integrity, my morals, everything was rotting, like I just had nothing left, because I honestly was just selling myself….because I wanted to belong, and I thought that by people hiring me, that was giving me a sense of who I was.’</p>

      <p>Thankfully the star decided to focus on her own happiness and now seems to be better than ever – and said if she could tell her younger self anything, it was to have more confidence in herself, and not be afraid to communicate her feelings when she was in trouble.</p>
      <p>‘If you can have any confidence, to be confident in your vulnerability is the best thing you can ever ask her,’ before acknowledging that she didn’t realise how strong she was, or how much she had grown up over the years.</p>
      <p>‘You’re a strong, remarkable lady,’ Bear told her.</p>

      <p>The clip is just one of many heartfelt moments with Cara, with the actress and model saying she struggled to feel like she accepted and belonged in either industry.</p>
      <p>She also spoke bluntly about her own depression, and how attending auditions fed in to her thoughts that she wasn’t good enough.</p>
      <p>In the cathartic episode, Cara proves to have some serious guts, hoisting herself over a quarry and getting her hands dirty with skinning and cooking animals.</p>

      <p>Even Bear seemed impressed, revealing he wasn’t expecting her to give the experience as much gusto as she did.</p>
      <p>‘Cara was really honest in that chat, and I knew she’d been through some battles,’ he told the cameras. ‘But what’s amazing is to see her come through that with such light, and it shines out of her face.</p>

      <p>‘Happiness is always rooted in great friendships and love, and loving people and learning to accept yourself, the good and the bad.</p>
      <p>‘Her journey was really inspiring to hear.’</p>
