      <p>Fraudsters posing as the taxman could strike with fake offers of tax refunds as the January 31 self-assessment deadline approaches, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is warning.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, HMRC has received nearly 900,000 reports from people about suspect contact including phone calls, texts or emails.</p>
      <p>More than 100,000 of these were phone scams, while over 620,000 reports from people were about bogus tax rebates.</p>
      <p>Common techniques fraudsters use include phoning taxpayers offering a fake tax refund, or pretending to be HMRC by texting or emailing a link which will take customers to a false page, where their bank details and money will be stolen.</p>
      <p>Fraudsters may threaten victims with arrest or imprisonment if a bogus tax bill is not paid immediately.</p>
      <p>HMRC operates a dedicated customer protection team to identify and close down scams.</p>
      <p>It is also advising customers to recognise the warning signs of scams.</p>
      <p>Genuine organisations such as HMRC and banks will never contact customers asking for their pin, password or bank details.</p>
      <p>It said customers should never give out private information, reply to text messages, download attachments or click on links in texts or emails which they were not expecting.</p>
      <p>Details of suspect calls or emails claiming to be from HMRC can be forwarded to phishing@hmrc.gov.uk and texts to 60599.</p>
      <p>Cases can also be reported to Action Fraud.</p>
      <p>Tax is automatically deducted from most UK taxpayers' wages, pensions or savings.</p>
      <p>But people could need to complete a tax return, for example if they are self-employed or have earned more than £2,500 from renting out property, or if they or their partner received child benefit and either of them had an annual income of more than £50,000.</p>
      <p>They may also need to fill in a form if they have earned more than £2,500 in other untaxed income, for example from tips or commission.</p>
