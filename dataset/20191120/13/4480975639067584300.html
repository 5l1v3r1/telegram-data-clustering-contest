      <p>Inflation, as measured by the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI), in Canada stayed unchanged at 1.9% annually to match September's reading and the market expectation, the data published by Statistics Canada showed on Wednesday. "Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 2.3% following three consecutive monthly increases of 2.4%," Statistics Canada further noted in its press release.</p>
      <p>On a monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.3% after falling 0.4% in September. The Bank of Canada's (BoC) core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 0.4% and 1.9% on a monthly and yearly basis, respectively.</p>
      <p>With the initial market reaction, the USD/CAD pulled away from daily highs above the 1.33 mark and was last seen trading at 1.3290, adding 0.17% on the day.</p>
