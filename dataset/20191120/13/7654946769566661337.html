      <h1>All-women Hasidic EMT group denied bid for ambulance in Brooklyn</h1>

      <p>An <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/hasidic-all-women-emt-group-faces-backlash-from-hatzaloh-members/">all-women Hasidic EMT group </a>was denied an application on Tuesday to operate an ambulance in Brooklyn, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>The group, Ezras Nashim, sought to serve female clientele within a two-square-mile area in the predominately Orthodox Borough Park neighborhood.</p>
      <p>But on Tuesday night, the Regional EMS Council of NYC denied their bid with a 12-7 vote, <a href="https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/1802233/application-denied-ezras-nashim-will-not-be-given-ambulance-license-in-boro-park.html">according to The Yeshiva World.</a> There were five abstentions and two members were absent.</p>
      <p>Ezras Nashim — Hebrew for “helping women” — needed a 14-vote majority in order to get the OK to operate its own ambulance.</p>
      <p>The group, which launched in 2012, wants to serve Orthodox women who feel uncomfortable being cared for by male first responders.</p>
      <p>“It’s the cultural norm of women in the Brooklyn Hasidic community to lead their lives in modesty,” Jim Deering, the group’s attorney, said during a public hearing last month.</p>
      <p>“It is that cultural modesty and the trauma that can result from it not being honored that forms the need for Ezras Nashim’s ambulance application.”</p>
      <p>The public hearing was attended by supporters of Orthodox ambulance corps Hatzolah who believe having multiple EMS services in the neighborhood would cause “confusion” and “potential catastrophe.”</p>
