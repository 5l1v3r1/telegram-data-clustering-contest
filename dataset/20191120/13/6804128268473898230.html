      <h1>The day Arsenal signed Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid to herald a new era at the Emirates</h1>
      <h2>The latest edition of football.london's end of decade series looks back at when Arsenal shocked the world with the signing of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>There have been plenty of ups and downs for Arsenal over the past ten years.</p>
      <p>From the highs of winning the FA Cup in 2014, 2015 and 2017 to the disappointment of missing out on Champions League football in recent seasons and a Europa League final defeat against Chelsea last season, <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> fans have had a mixed time over the past decade.</p>
      <p>But Gunners fans have witnessed some great attacking football over the past few years, with some of the world's best players playing at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>One of those in recent years has undoubtedly been Mesut Ozil, and in the latest piece in our end of decade series on <b>football.london</b>, we take a look back at the day he signed for the Gunners, below.</p>
      <p>“I am very unhappy after the exit of Ozil. For me, he was a friend and a companion. Mesut is a special footballer who generates and plays the beautiful side of the game.</p>
      <p>“If it was up to me then he would never have left. But it was the choice of the club. But I am totally convinced he will be a star at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>“He is the king of the assist. I know Santi Cazorla well and together they will be an enormous spectacle. But I will miss him.”</p>

      <p>Sergio Ramos' disappointment was indicative of what Arsenal pulled off on 2nd September, 2013.</p>
      <p>Still on a high from their north London derby victory over Tottenham a day earlier, the Gunners broke their club transfer record to complete the signing of Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid for £42million.</p>

      <p>The Mirror's John Cross wrote: 'After months of criticism and ridicule over transfer policy, the major players have come up trumps. Wenger, Gazidis, Law and Kroenke were the keys to the deal which has shocked English football, lifted Arsenal and stunned Ozil’s former Real Madrid team mates.'</p>

      <p>It was a move that was almost six years in the making, with Arsene Wenger keenly tracking the midfielder since 2007. Paris Saint-German were also keen, and offered a more lucrative contract to the German that summer, but Ozil chose to join the Gunners.</p>
      <p>“While talking with Arsene Wenger I immediately felt what I had missed at last,” Ozil said. “This is 100 per cent faith in me. I want to help this club to finally win titles again."</p>
      <p>Wenger said: "[Ozil] has a style of play that will integrate with our style of play because his game is based on movement and technical ability.</p>
      <p>"He has all the attributes to be one of our leaders."</p>
      <p>Ozil's arrival was seen as a game changer in every sense, both on and off the pitch. Arsenal appeared to signal the end of their frugal spending in the years that followed the move to the Emirates Stadium, and sent a message to their rivals that they were ready to compete for major trophies again.</p>

      <p>It took Ozil all of 11 minutes in an Arsenal shirt to remind fans of his silky qualities. Kieran Gibbs's long ball down the channel was killed dead with a stunning touch before he teed up Olivier Giroud to score the Gunners' opening goal against Sunderland.</p>
      <p>Before his home debut against Stoke, hundreds of supporters gathered outside the stadium wearing Ozil shirts for a club photograph. His arrival had inspired genuine excitement among the fanbase, which had been sorely lacking for years.</p>

      <p>This week football.london are running a special series of articles looking back at the key moments from the last decade for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Each day, there will be three new articles; one in the morning, one at lunchtime and one in the evening.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the best bits so far...</p>
      <ul>

          <b>Team of the decade: </b>

      <hr/>
      <p>Fast forward to 2019, and Ozil's future at Arsenal looks more uncertain than ever after his struggles under Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>But it cannot be forgotten what his arrival meant at the time. Ozil contributed to ending Arsenal's nine year silverware drought, with the FA Cup win over Hull the first of three trophies at Wembley in four seasons.</p>
      <p>He has played more than 200 times for Arsenal, and at the time of his arrival he brought a real sense of excitement and inspired fans to dream again. Isn't that what football is all about?</p>
