      <p>Pune and its neighbouring areas will experience a slight chill over the next two days but winter will set in only by November-end, officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Meteorologists have attributed the delayed onset of winter to the recent cyclones in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. During the past one month, three cyclones — Kyarr and Maha in the Arabian Sea and Bulbul in the Bay of Bengal, disturbed the natural atmospheric conditions during the post-monsoon season. Of these, Kyarr and Maha had caused widespread rain over Maharashtra in the last week of October.</p>
      <p>“The atmosphere will take some time to settle and recover from the disturbances created by these three cyclonic storms. A significant drop in the minimum temperature over most regions of Maharashtra is unlikely before November 27,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head, weather department of IMD.</p>
      <p>“The night temperature may fall and remain around 15 degrees Celsius on November 20 and November 21 over Pune and its surrounding areas. However, the minimum temperature over northern Konkan, Madhya Maharashtra and parts of Vidarbha will marginally rise towards the end of this week. This is mainly because of the presence of an anticylone over central India and higher levels of moisture in the atmosphere,” added Kashyapi.</p>
      <p>While the minimum temperature in Pune on Tuesday touched 15.3 degrees Celsius, Ahmednagar recorded 12.8 degrees Celsius , Jalgaon 13.6 degrees Celsius, Nashik 13.8 degrees Celsius , Nagpur 14.5 degrees Celsius and Mahabaleshwar 15.1 degrees Celsius.</p>
