      <p>Gareth Bale has mocked Real Madrid in public. After helping Wales reach Euro 2020 with a 2-0 win over Hungary, he posed in a photo which has sent Madridismo into a rage.</p>
      <p>The Welshman stood grinning with his team-mates behind a banner of the Welsh flag with the words "Wales, golf, Madrid, in that order", something that the fans sang through the game too.</p>
      <p>Bale played 88 minutes after not playing in any recent Madrid matches with an injury, and his professionalism and dedication to the club has been called into question.</p>
      <p>Golf has been his favourite past-time and always caused trouble at Madrid, because it seems sometimes he prioritises the sport over football.</p>
