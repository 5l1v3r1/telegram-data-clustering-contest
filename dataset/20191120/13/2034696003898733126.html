        <b>The new figures reveal the UK's music scene is booming</b>
      </p>
      <p>The UK’s live music scene has earned record highs of £1.1billion – an increase of 10 per cent on figures from 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.iq-mag.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Music-by-Numbers-2019.pdf">‘Music By Numbers’</a> report, the UK music industry continued to grow across all sectors last year but mostly in the area of live music.</p>
      <p>As well as this, “music tourism” increased, as fans travelling from overseas or within the UK to get to live events contributed a huge 4.5bn to the UK economy. Those visiting the UK for shows and festivals also surged, increasing to 888,000 in 2018 from 810,000 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/20/value-of-uk-live-music-sector-hits-11bn">The Guardian</a>, </i>Michael Dugher, the chief executive of UK Music, the industry body behind the annual report, said: “Live music is now at a record high and continues to draw millions of fans from both the UK and abroad to our arenas and smaller venues alike.”</p>

      <p>Concert attendance stayed at similar levels but the report also revealed that festival going was on the increase, with 4.9 people attending in 2018 – an increase of 23 per cent.</p>
      <p>The figures come as the writers of the report pointed out that many of the 139,352 musicians employed by the industry last year are still struggling to earn a living.</p>
      <p>“A small proportion of creators in the industry do earn exceptionally well…It is important to understand these figures do not reflect the financial struggles of many music creators.”</p>
      <p>Last year, The CEO of UK Music warned <a href="http://nme.com/tag/brexit">Brexit</a> could <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/uk-music-boss-warns-brexit-live-music-risk-2412930#4dYpEDzPzS9XXFix.99">pose a risk to the country’s live music industry and touring acts.</a></p>
      <p>In a letter to May, Michael Dugher, CEO of UK Music – the umbrella organisation that represents industry groups such as PRS (Performing Right Society), PPL (Phonographic Performance Limited), and the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) – said Brexit could threaten the development of musical talent in Britain.</p>
      <p>“The ending of free movement with no waiver for musicians will put our fast-growing live music sector, that generates around £1 billion a year for the UK economy, at serious risk,” Dugher wrote. “The costly bureaucracy will make touring simply unviable for very many artists who need to earn a living and it delivers a hammer blow to development of future, world-leading British talent.”</p>
