      <p>DERRY CITY HAVE announced the signing of English striker Walter Figueira.</p>
      <p>The Candystripes secured the services of the 24-year-old after he impressed manager Declan Devine while playing for Waterford last season.</p>
      <p>Figueira joined the Blues in July and scored five goals for the RSC outfit, two of which came in their EA Sports Cup semi-final defeat to Derry.</p>
      <p>“Walter is a quality player,” Devine said. “Derry fans who saw him play for Waterford against us in the Brandywell will know exactly the type of player we’ve brought here.</p>
      <p>“He wants to play every minute of every match and that’s what we need at this club. He had a host of offers from clubs in Ireland and Scotland so we are delighted to have secured his signature.”</p>

      <p>Figueira was on the books at Chelsea as a teenager. Since being released by the Premier League club in 2013, he has had spells in Greece and Portugal, as well as playing for several non-league clubs in England.</p>

      <p>He joins a club who will have at least one Europa League tie to look forward to next year, having finished in fourth place in the Premier Division in 2019.</p>
      <p>Devine added: “Walter obviously won’t be the last player coming in. The hard work continues to strengthen the squad ahead of what is certain to be a fiercely competitive league in 2020.” </p>
