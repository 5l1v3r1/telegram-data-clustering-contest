      <h1>Phil Spencer Says Xbox "Should Focus" on RPGs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:27:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer says that RPGs are a genre that Microsoft “should focus” on. Speaking with Xbox On in a video published earlier this week, Spencer said that he’s proud of the work the genre has done for the console in recent years.</p>
      <p>“One of the things that I’m really proud of that I see now is how RPGs are stepping up for us. Back in the day, when I think [of] <i>Mass Effect 1</i>, which I worked on, <i>Jade Empire</i>, <i>Fable</i>, I remember we really staked out RPGs as something that was important.”</p>

      <p>Some of those games are nearly a decade and a half old, but Spencer suggests they’ve created a strong legacy within Microsoft - one that the company is keen to maintain. “Obviously first-person and third-person shooters have been strong, but it’s nice with <i>[The] Outer Worlds</i> coming out, <i>Wasteland [3]</i>. I think RPG is an area that we [purposefully] focused on and wanted to do more.”</p>
      <p>Spencer went on to say that the rise of Game Pass and similar services is allowing older genres and developers to return to prominence, and that “I do think RPG is an area that we should focus.” The recent acquisitions of <i>Wasteland 3</i> developer inXile Studios and <i>The Outer Worlds</i> and <i>Pillars of Eternity</i>’s Obsidian Entertainment is likely to help Spencer fulfil his vision, but while inXile's offering is due next year, it might be a while before we get to see the fruit of Microsoft's other acquisitions.</p>
