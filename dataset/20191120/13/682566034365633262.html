      <p>Cape Town – <b>FIFA </b>has put South African broadcasters on alert following confirmation of the opening of a tender process for TV rights for the <b>Confederation of African Football’s (CAF)</b> qualifiers for the <b>2022 Soccer World Cup </b>in Qatar.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sport/soccer/fifa-puts-caf-broadcast-rights-up-for-tender/">SowetanLIVE</a>, the process for the hotly contended rights opened on Monday and submissions are welcomed until they close on Monday, December 16.</p>
      <p>CAF sold the 2014 and 2018 World Cup qualifiers rights to SportFive before the company integrated into Lagardere Sports in 2015.</p>
      <p>Following the 2018 World Cup, all African nations opted to individually sell their broadcasting rights and subsequently FIFA secured a deal promising double revenue to all 54 countries.</p>
      <p><i>"FIFA has opened an invitation to tender (ITT) for the centralised media rights to all matches in the second round of qualifying, as well as the third-round playoffs, which will determine the final five teams from Africa that will play at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022," </i>FIFA said in a statement released.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Following an agreement with all 54 member associations of CAF in August, the media rights to all African qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 are being managed under a centralised sales model by FIFA.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"The media rights will cover TV, internet, mobile and radio transmissions."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The South African public have not been able to watch any official CAF matches since the association cancelled their $1 billion broadcasting deal with Lagardere earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The <b>South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC)</b> and <b>SuperSport</b> have not acquired viewing rights to official CAF matches outside of South Africa - which includes Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers, CAF Champions League, CAF Confederations Cup and Under-23 AFCON.</p>
      <p>Soccer fans recently missed out on the 2021 AFCON qualifier between Bafana Bafana and Ghana last Thursday, but were able to watch Molefi Ntseki’s charges beat Sudan on SABC 1 last Sunday.</p>
