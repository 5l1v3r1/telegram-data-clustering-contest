      <p>The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is fundamentally overhauling its IT procurement approach, this week announcing a huge £600 million IT tender opportunity as it brings together six streams of multi-supplier work into two “towers” as part of a five-year contract.</p>
      <p>The Met Police IT <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:547495-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML&amp;src=0">contract notice</a>, posted Tuesday, shows the role includes provision of a cyber security operations centre (SOC); data centre hosting; a service desk; third-party service integration, mobile services and more. Applications need to be in by January 13, 2020.</p>
      <p>“The MPS’s procurement model is a two tower model that will comprise of [sic] an infrastructure provider, with embedded service management and integration services, and a separate applications tower,” it said.</p>

      <p>“The authority will be looking to procure a ‘run and maintain’ contract with no pre-planned transformation built into the contract but with the opportunity to use the two towers to deliver change on the back of excellent delivery,” the contract notes.</p>
      <p>The authority has a “strong preference for appointing a different supplier to each of the infrastructure and applications towers, to ensure independence between the 2 roles as the Infrastructure supplier will be managing the applications supplier to some extent” it adds.</p>
      <p>The move comes as contracts with an array of suppliers including Atos, BT, DXC and more come to an end in coming years.</p>
      <p>As the Register <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/20/metropolitan_police_600m_it_contract/">notes</a>, between 2015 and 2017, the MPS awarded its Service Integration &amp; Management to Atos, Network Services to BT, Data Centres Services to Keysource, Hosting Services to DXC, End User Services to DXC and Application Support Services to Accenture.</p>
      <p>The Met has been driving forward a large digitalisation programme, that this year included giving all Met employees full access to Microsoft 365 services under a <a href="https://www.cbronline.com/news/metropolitan-police-microsoft">new contract</a> that will allow them to use not just the usual applications of PowerPoint, Word and Excel, but opens up collaboration applications like Microsoft Teams and OneDrive to Met members.</p>
      <p>It also comes as the Home Office works to harmonise and upgrade its own back-end systems, replacing legacy police databases with a centralised Home Office Biometrics Programme (<a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities/427">HOB</a>), for example, that will potentially enable much wider use of facial recognition.</p>
