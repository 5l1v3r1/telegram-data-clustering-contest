      <p><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/13/apple-music-replay-debut/">Apple Music recently brought out</a> a Replay feature that automatically generates playlists containing your most-played songs for any year, going back to 2015 when the service debuted. Follow along with us as we show you how to use Apple Music Replay to get a playlist with your top songs of the year and gain insights into your top artists and albums.</p>
      <h3>Introducing Apple Music Replay</h3>
      <p>Here’s how Apple is <a href="https://support.apple.com/HT210751">selling the Replay feature</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>With Apple Music Replay, you can relive the music that defined your year. Get insights in to your most played artists and albums. And get a playlist with your top songs of the year — and one for every year that you’re subscribed to Apple Music.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s basically Apple’s version of Spotify’s year-in-review feature.</p>

      <h4>See your top songs of the year</h4>
      <p>With Replay, you get to browse the top songs you’ve listened to this year in an automatically generated playlist. You can explore a Replay playlist for every year that you were subscribed to Apple Music simply by clicking an appropriate playlist cover. Best of all, your Replay Mixes are updated weekly based on <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/18/apple-music-listening-history-tutorial/">your listening history</a>.</p>

Be sure that you don’t have any embarrassing songs in your Replay playlist because friends with whom you share it with can add it to their library with a tap. Friends will also get updates on your top played songs throughout the year as Apple Music updates your Replay Mixes.</p>
