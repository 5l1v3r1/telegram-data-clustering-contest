      <h3>Epic Extend Season 1 of Fortnite's Chapter 2</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Last year, Epic held a "14 days of Fortnite" event, with new limited-time modes, challenges, and free rewards. This year, it seems they're planning even more: new game features, new free rewards, and some sort of live experience. As a result of this upcoming wave of holiday-themed updates, Epic are <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">extending</a> the first season of <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Fortnite/achievements">Fortnite's</a> Chapter 2, into early February of next year.</p>

      <p>Basically, it seems Epic are promising even more content for this year's holiday period. Their attitude of going bigger than before would fit with Fortnite's recent media timeline. The run-up to Chapter 2 was highly anticipated, with players speculating on what Epic were going to do when Season X ended. Then, just when all the Fortnite hype was at its highest, the game vanished. Literally. Epic wiped their social media accounts, the game was unplayable, and all fans could see was a livestream of a black hole. Even trying to load the game would see the menu be sucked in until the screen was blank. This effectively got everyone's attention, and the eyes of the media were firmly fixed on Fortnite when Chapter 2 was announced. Chapter 2 brought a new map and new water mechanics, so that players could swim and sail their way around it. Now, it seems Season 1 of Chapter 2 isn't done yet, and will continue until early February next year – making it an unusually long season for the game's history so far. Whilst this means there won't be any big Season changes, it seems that Epic have got a lot planned for the holiday period.</p>
      <p>Epic also <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/battle-royale-update-whats-new-in-11-20">announced</a> an update for Battle Royale. The update, 11.20, includes a range of general enhancements. It also brings back Daily Challenges, which can once again be completed for XP. There'll be up to three at a time available for players, and if you change your mind, you can exchange one Challenge for another, once a day. 11.20 adds a new filter to the Locker, so that everything in it can now be sorted by the Season in which it was introduced. Slurp Tankers now have increased Effective Health, and the headshot multiplier of the Tactical Shotgun has been matched to that of the Pump Shotgun. The Bandage Bazooka, another introduction in Chapter 2, has been re-enabled after Epic fixed the syncing issues with it. The update has also apparently "addressed reports" which said that buildings sometimes looked a little low in detail when players landed on the map. The hair which comes with the Devastator Outfit is now the colour it was originally intended to be, and the pistol which comes with the John Wick Outfit is now the right size. The Magma Wrap has been partially fixed, so that it appears correctly on most weapons. Epic say it's still not right on the Bandage Bazooka and Pistol, but that this will be fixed in a future release.</p>
      <p>We'll keep an eye out for what Epic might have planned for the holiday-themed content coming this winter.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
