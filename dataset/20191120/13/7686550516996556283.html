      <p>Every weekend in December, Father Christmas will be making a special appearance at St Fagans National Museum of History and will be bringing some of his good friends along too. There’ll be an opportunity to meet him in Cilewent Farmhouse where he’ll tell you a tale or two in front of the fire and meet each child individually where they’ll receive a gift.</p>
      <p>Visit Mother Christmas in her kitchen at Llwyn-yr-eos where children will help her make some sweet treats to take home.</p>
      <p>The elves are working on the big list of who’s been especially good this year in Maestir School and each child will meet the elves who will help them write their special letter. After penning their letter, children can pop round to Wales’ smallest Post Office to send it off to the North Pole.</p>
      <p>This year it’s been chaos in the workshop and the naughty elves need your help in order to make some Christmas decorations. Each helper will get to take home their own special decoration to take home and hang on the tree.</p>

      <p>Witness the Welsh Christmas traditions of Y Fari Lwyd and Hunting the Wren on December 14 and 15. There’ll be a brass band performance by Taff Vale Brass Band on December 21 and 22 to help get you in the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>Pick up something you wouldn’t find on the high street at the Makers’ Market on November 30, December 1 and December 7-8. There’ll be a chance to meet the makers and find out more about their crafts at workshops and demonstrations throughout the weekend.</p>
      <p>There’s nothing like a bit of carol singing to get you in the mood for the festive season. Sing carols in the Museum’s 18th century Pen-rhiw Chapel on December 14-15 and 21-22. There'll be lots of traditional tunes and a few more contemporary Christmas classics.</p>
      <p>Christmas Weekends take place every weekend from November 30 - December 22. Tickets must be purchased in advance for most activities.</p>
