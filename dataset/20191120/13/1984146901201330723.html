      <p>We are now just a few weeks away from the January transfer window opening for business, with clubs in the Premier League likely to splash the cash on improving their squads.</p>
      <p>Fierce battles have emerged across the division already this season and signing players in January could be decisive in clubs achieving their goals towards the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>As such, plenty of rumours are already floating around as the clubs plot their activity for the January window and we have gathered some of the latest snippets below.</p>
      <h3>Celtic rival Aston Villa for defensive target</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa face competition in the transfer market from Scottish champions Celtic for the services of Carlisle United defender Jarrad Branthwaite, <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-celtic-in-hunt-to-sign-6ft-4in-colossus-at-english-club-in-january/">Football Insider</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Villa’s interest in the towering League Two defender was first mentioned earlier this week, with the Premier League side considering the 17-year-old to be a star in the making.</p>
      <p>However, they are not alone in their interest in the teenager as Celtic are compiling a dossier on Branthwaite as they consider making a swoop in January.</p>

      <h3>Juventus identify plan to snatch Manchester United midfielder</h3>
      <p>Italian champions Juventus are plotting a swoop to snatch Tahith Chong from Manchester United and <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/man-united-winger-included-deal-goalscorer-club-also-wait-free-transfer-summer/">Corriere Dello Sport,</a> via Sport Witness, have highlighted two ways they can capture the Dutch youngster without paying a penny.</p>
      <p>Chong sees his current deal at Old Trafford expire at the end of the season and Juventus have been encouraged by the lack of progress on a renewal - and there are two ways they could capture the teenager.</p>
      <p>The first is a more patient approach and involves waiting until the end of the season for his arrival, with the Turin outfit able to discuss a pre-contractual agreement in January, while the other is an immediate deal by offering Mario Mandzukic in exchange.</p>

      <h3>Celtic to discuss deal with Manchester City</h3>
      <p>Scottish giants Celtic are looking to discuss extending Daniel Arzani’s loan deal north of the border, according to <a href="https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/vote-of-confidence-for-arzani-as-celtic-bid-to-extend-loan-deal">The World Game.</a></p>
      <p>The Australia international arrived at the club on loan from Manchester City 15 months ago but has struggled with injury issues during his time at Parkhead, although he is targeting a return for the Boxing Day clash with St Mirren.</p>
      <p>Despite his lack of opportunities, Celtic have clearly seen enough in Arzani as it’s stated the Bhoys are keen to extend his loan deal for the duration of the 2020/21 campaign.</p>
      <h3>Real Madrid and Spurs discussing striker swap</h3>
      <p>Tottenham are discussing a striker swap with Real Madrid that would see Harry Kane move to the Spanish capital and Karim Benzema arrive in North London, reports from <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/176281-benzema-y-120-millones-y-el-real-madrid-patas-arriba-florentino-perez-tiene-la-bomba-ed">El Desmarque</a> claim.</p>
      <p>However, Los Blancos are not pleased with Spurs’ demands for Kane’s services, as it’s stated that the Premier League side are seeking Benzema’s signature as well as a fee of £103m.</p>
      <p>Overall, Kane’s valuation at Spurs is said to be around £171m but Real chief Florentino Perez sees his price-tag at far less at the £120m mark.</p>
