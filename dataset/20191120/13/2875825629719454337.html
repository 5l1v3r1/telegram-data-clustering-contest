      <p>The radio host, 38, appeared on the ITV daytime show today and opened up about a medical procedure he'd undergone to heal a leg injury, which is putting his usual fitness routine on hold.</p>

      <p>However both the presenters and viewers were left stunned when he stood up to unbuckle his trousers.</p>

      <p>Phil joked: "What set of pants do you have on? Do you have teeny pants?"</p>
      <p>The car enthusiast insisted that he didn't but told Phil to "fess up" to owning his own pair of "teeny pants".</p>
      <p>Chris quipped: "Now we know what to get each other for Christmas!"</p>

      <p>He then sat back down on the sofa in his boxers and showed off his bruised leg, saying that he had his "varicose veins microwaved".</p>
      <p>However Chris, Holly and Phil laughed about how bizarre he must look with his trousers down during the interview.</p>
      <p>Phil laughed and clarified the situation to those "tuning in now".</p>
