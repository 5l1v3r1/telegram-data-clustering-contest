      <h1>Revolution Saints Announce Third Album ‘Rise’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:45:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:45</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/revolution-saints/">Revolution Saints</a>, the supergroup featuring <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/deen-castronovo/">Deen Castronovo</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/doug-aldrich/">Doug Aldrich</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/jack-blades/">Jack Blades</a>, announced that their third album, titled <i>Rise</i>, will be released on Jan. 24.</p>
      <p>You can see the track listing below.</p>
      <p>The announcement follows the release of the song <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/revolution-saints-when-the-heartache-has-gone/">“When the Heartache Has Gone,” </a>which arrived earlier this month. The LP includes contributions by producer, keyboardist and singer Alessandro Del Vecchio and singer Lunakaire. The closing track, “Eyes of a Child,” was co-written by <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/styx/">Styx</a>’s <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/tommy-shaw/">Tommy Shaw</a>.</p>
      <p>“As with the first two well-received albums, Revolution Saints are bringing back the classic melodic rock style that thrilled and delighted legions of fans in the '80s and '90s and still does today,” Frontiers Music said in a statement. “Inspiring, uplifting vocals, soaring melodies and musicianship to die for is what you get in spades here. … The project is the vision of Frontiers' president Serafino Perugino, who for years had hoped to work on a project where Deen would be the lead vocalist. Having previously worked with all three artists on different projects on Frontiers, having Deen, Jack and Doug on board together was a dream come true for Perugino.”</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/whitesnake/">Whitesnake</a> guitarist Aldrich <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/revolution-saints-when-the-heartache-has-gone/">admitted</a> earlier this year that it “sticks in my side a little bit” that Revolution Saints are unlikely to ever tour.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Guys, I’m not doing a second record, because we never toured on the first one,'" he explained. "The record company said, ‘Well, we really would like you to do it because people really like the music.' … I was like, ‘Okay, that’s fair enough.’ So we made the second record, and I thought, ‘Well, that’s it,’ and then they said, ‘We want to make a third record.’ So we’re probably going to do that with the understanding that we aren’t going to tour.”</p>

      <h3>Rock's Most Unexpected Supergroups</h3>

      <h4>16 of the Most Unexpected Supergroups Ever</h4>
      <p>In this gallery, we take a look at 16 of the most unexpected supergroups ever.</p>

      <h4>16. Street Sweeper Social Club</h4>
      <p>In 2003, former Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello was two years into Audioslave (a supergroup that wasn't all that surprising) and performing as his folk alter ego, the Nightwatchman, when he met Boots Riley — frontman of hip-hop outfit the Coup. The pair became frequent onstage collaborators before releasing their self-titled (and only) full-length in 2009.</p>

      <h4>15. The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen</h4>
      <p>Technically, this band doesn't have a name. <i>The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen</i> is only supposed to be the title of the first collaboration by Damon Albarn of Blur, Paul Simonon of the Clash, Simon Tong of the Verve, Nigerian drummer Tony Allen and producer Danger Mouse. Albarn (who also fronts the animated pseudo-supergroup Gorillaz) said the album is "a song cycle that's also a mystery play about London."</p>

      <h4>14. Zwan</h4>
      <p>The most surprising thing about Zwan was that Billy Corgan really thought he moved on from the self-destruction of Smashing Pumpkins in 2000 (which came about in large part due to his control issues) by forming a supergroup he'd have even <i>less</i> control over. The original lineup included Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney and Slint's David Pajo on bass (Paz Lenchantin of A Perfect Circle joined later), but the band (shocker) imploded within three years.</p>

      <h4>13. The Postal Service</h4>
      <p>Although the Postal Service are now legends in the world of indie-electronica, the duo seemingly materialized out of binary code when they released their 2003 debut, <i>Give Up</i>. Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and Jimmy Tamborello of Dntel collaborated by sending demos to each other through the mail (thus the band's name), which was pretty revolutionary at the time. You can also count Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley as a part-time member.</p>

      <h4>12. Them Crooked Vultures</h4>
      <p>Although everyone had been on the lookout for years for an album by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters (on drums), Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age and bassist John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, the lineup was a huge surprise when Grohl first mentioned it in 2005. True, Grohl has long been an unofficial member of QOTSA, but teaming up with Jones (the third wheel to Robert Plant and Jimmy Page) was a legit revelation.</p>

      <h4>11. The Singles</h4>
      <p>Yes, that's Scarlett Johansson and, no, she's not new to music. She released an album of mostly Tom Waits covers in 2008 and a full-length collaboration with singer-songwriter Pete Yorn in 2009. But Johansson's newest project (which might soon have a new name thanks to a cease and desist letter by another band called the Singles) is certainly her most surprising: She's teamed up with Haim's Este Haim, Holly Miranda, Kendra Morris, and Julia Haltigan for a self-described "super pop group" who has already shared the single, "Candy," produced by Johansson's longtime collaborator, Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio.</p>

      <h4>10. FFS</h4>
      <p>The members of Scottish indie outfit Franz Ferdinand are apparently huge fans of '70s art-pop band, Sparks. But instead of just continuing to cite them as influences, Franz Ferdinand recently joined up with Sparks' founding members, brothers Ron and Russell Mael, to form the aptly titled FFS. Now they're working on an album and are planning summer 2015 tour dates.</p>

      <h4>9. Broken Bells</h4>
      <p>The Shins frontman James Mercer and Brian Burton (a.k.a. Danger Mouse) met at Denmark's Roskilde Festival in 2004 and quickly realized they were members of the mutual admiration society. The pair revealed their "melodic but experimental" project in 2009 and have since released two albums including last year's <i>After the Disco</i>.</p>

      <h4>8. The Hollywood Vampires</h4>
      <p>Founded last year by Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp, the Hollywood Vampires also include Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry and feature at least one contribution from Paul McCartney. Perry said the band (named after a group of drinking buddies from the '70s that included John Lennon, the Who's Keith Moon and others) is "dedicated to all the friends we’ve lost to drugs and alcohol over the years."</p>

      <h4>7. You + Me</h4>
      <p>Singer-songwriter Dallas Green (City and Colour) crossed paths with motocross legend Carey Hart when Green's band, Alexisonfire, played Warped Tour a few years back and -- since Hart is married to Alecia Moore (otherwise known as Pink) -- the duo eventually met and realized they create incredibly delicate vocal harmonies. Green and Pink released their debut, <i>Rose Ave.</i>, in 2014.</p>

      <h4>6. SuperHeavy</h4>
      <p>Sometime prior to 2009, the Eurythmics' Dave Stewart urged Mick Jagger to begin incorporating more Indian orchestrations into the Rolling Stones' work, but the pair instead created an entirely new band around the idea. Enlisting British soul singer Joss Stone, Indian composer A.R. Rahman and reggae artist Damian Marley, the collective released their self-titled debut in 2011.</p>

      <h4>5. Jason Feathers</h4>
      <p>When you think of Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, you typically don't think of hip-hop. But the indie icon took a hard left turn in 2014 when he teamed up with Minneapolis rapper Astronautalis and GAYNGS producer Ryan Olson to release their first album under the Jason Feathers name. The full-length came out of a weekend recording session in 2012 but took two years to fine tune, and the entire thing is based around a fictional narrative tied to the backwaters of Florida.</p>

      <h4>4. Teenage Time Killer</h4>
      <p>Although My Ruin guitarist Mick Murphy and Corrosion of Conformity drummer Reed Mullin created Teenage Time Killer, it's the massive list of big-name contributors who make it a full-on supergroup. Dave Grohl, Corey Taylor of Slipknot, Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys, Nick Oliveri (formerly) of Queens of the Stone Age, Matt Skiba of Alkaline Trio and Randy Blythe of Lamb of God are just some of the artists who will appear on Teenage Time Killer's upcoming debut.</p>

      <h4>3. Oysterhead</h4>
      <p>When Primus singer/bassist Les Claypool was asked to assemble a band to perform at the New Orleans Jazz Festival in 2000, he decided to aim high: he enlisted Phish frontman Trey Anastasio and legendary Police drummer Stewart Copeland. Although the original intent was just to play a one-off show, Oysterhead released an album, <i>The Grand Pecking Order</i>, in 2001. They also reunited in 2006 to play Bonnaroo.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2. Atoms for Peace</h4>
      <p>If you could imagine Radiohead's Thom Yorke playing in a band with anyone aside from his Oxfordshire mates, it's pretty unlikely you would ever imagine Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But the improbable duo reportedly bonded in 2009 over a shared love of Afrobeat and became the core of a supergroup featuring Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Brazilian instrumentalist Mauro Refosco and Beck drummer Joey Waronker. They released their first album, <i>Amok</i>, in 2013.</p>

      <h4>1. Tinted Windows</h4>
      <p>It looked crazy on paper, but the eclectic lineup of Tinted Windows looked even crazier in person. Featuring Taylor Hanson (yep, <i>the</i> Taylor Hanson) on vocals, James Iha (formerly of Smashing Pumpkins) on guitar, Adam Schlesinger (of Fountains of Wayne) on bass and Bun E. Carlos (of Cheap Trick) on drums, Tinted Windows assembled in 2009 through loose industry acquaintances and released a self-titled album later that year. Although they didn't set the world on fire (the album debuted at No. 59 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200), they did create a batch of straightforward power-pop ditties that aren't <i>quite</i> as awkward as you'd think.</p>
