        <b>SONIA GANDHI GIVES NOD TO ALLIANCE WITH SHIV SENA</b>
      </p>
      <p>Interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday gave in-principle approval to an alliance with the Shiv Sena to form a government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>The decision, sources in the NCP told India Today, was taken during her meeting with Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Monday.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar, whose meeting with Sonia Gandhi was being billed as a major step towards a tie-up with the Shiv Sena for government formation in the state, had said that there was no discussion on a common minimum programme (CMP) during the talks.</p>
      <p>Keeping his cards close to his chest, Sharad Pawar had said that he had only discussed the political situation in Maharashtra with Sonia Gandhi and the two parties will hold talks with their other allies before making a decision on government formation in the state.</p>
      <p>Now, the sources have confirmed that the decision was taken by Sonia Gandhi on Monday itself.</p>
