        <b>Scotland will play two matches against reigning world champions South Africa on a three-match Summer Tour next year, Scottish Rugby has confirmed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gregor Townsend's side will face the Springboks on July 4 and again on July 11, before travelling to New Zealand toface the All Blacks at Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium (kick-off 8.35am BST).</p>
      <p>Start times and venues for both Tests against the World Cup winners are still to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Scotland haven't faced the Boks on South African soil since a crushing 55-6 defeat in Port Elizabeth in June 2014.</p>
      <p>The Scots have won five out of 27 meetings with South Africa - all on home soil.</p>
      <p>The most recent victory was the 21-17 win in November 2010 as part of the 2010 Grand Slam Tour and, prior to that, a 21-6 success in November 2002 as part of South Africa's tour of Europe.</p>
      <p>Before that, there were consecutive wins in the 1860s - 8-5 and 6-3 at Murrayfield in April 1965 and December 1969 - and a 6-0 win in the first meeting between the two nations in November 1906 at Hampden.</p>
      <p>Scotland, who host New Zealand at BT Murrayfield in the 2020 Autumn Test series along with Argentina and Japan, have never beaten the All Blacks in 31 attempts - two draws at Murrayfield in 1964 and 1983 the Scots' best results.</p>
      <p>Their last matches against the All Blacks on home soil came in the summer of 2000, when the hosts ran out 69-20 winners at Carisbrook in Dunedin and recorded a 48-14 win a week later at Auckland's Eden Park.</p>
