      <p>Jose Mourinho should try and bring Gareth Bale back to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> if he wants to win the fans over.</p>
      <p>The Special One was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's successor 12 hours after the Argentine was axed.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's arrival has divided fans but Harry Redknapp, who led Tottenham for four years, reckons the signing of Bale would be a major coup.</p>
      <p>The Welshman was close to leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in the summer and his relationship with the club's fans has broken down meaning his exit is likely.</p>
      <p>"It could be couldn't it, yeah," Redknapp told Ally McCoist on <a href="https://talksport.com/">talkSPORT</a> on Wednesday morning.</p>

      <p>"What a signing he'd be for the club. What a signing. That would get him on side straight away, the fans would love that. That would be an amazing move for him."</p>
      <p>Bale left north London in 2013 for a then world-record fee of Â£86m to join Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>Despite helping them deliver four Champions League titles and scoring over 100 goals Bale has never truly settled in Spain.</p>

      <p>Zinedine Zidane's return in March looked to spell the end for Bale, but after a summer of huge interest he eventually remained at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>He has faced plenty of criticism for his hobbies away from football and a lack of connection to the current squad.</p>
      <p>Bale's love for golf has regularly been a stick to beat him with and Madrid keeper Thibaut Courtois called him "the golfer" earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old though did little to endear himself to the Los Blancos supporters after he was pictured with a Welsh flag that said "Wales. golf. Madrid. In that order".</p>
      <p>His native fans remixed the usual "Viva Gareth Bale" song to mock his love of the fairways and commitment to the national team, but it has not gone down well in Madrid.</p>
