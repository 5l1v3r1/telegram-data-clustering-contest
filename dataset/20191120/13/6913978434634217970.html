      <p><b>JERUSALEM -</b> The Israeli army carried out a "wide-scale" attack against Iranian forces and Syrian army targets in Syria Wednesday, killing at least 11 fighters, the Israeli army and a monitoring group said.<br/><br/>In a rare confirmation of their operations in Syria, the Israeli army said they carried out dozens on strikes against the Iranian elite Quds Force and the Syrian military, in response to four rockets fired at Israel a day before.<br/><br/>At least eleven "fighters" were killed in the strikes, said Britain-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR).<br/><br/>Seven were foreigners, its head Rami Abdel Rahman said, though he could not confirm whether they were all Iranian. Four civilians were also wounded, he added.<br/><br/>Iran has fought alongside Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's forces in the country's eight-year civil war, heightening Israeli concern over the presence of its arch foe along its border.<br/><br/>The Israeli army said they had targeted around a dozen military sites, including warehouses and military command centers.<br/><br/>"It was very intense," spokesman Jonathan Conricus told AFP said.<br/><br/>The most important target, he said, was a control facility at the main international airport in Damascus.<br/><br/>"It is the main building that serves the (Iranian) Revolutionary Guards... for coordinating the logistic facilities of transport of military hardware from Iran to Syria and from Syria onwards," he said.<br/><br/>Israel has carried out frequent air and missile strikes against Iranian targets inside Syria since the country descended into civil war in 2011, but rarely comments on them.<br/><br/>On Tuesday four rockets were fired at Israel from Syria, with the army blaming an "Iranian force".<br/><br/>Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted the rockets. -AFP</p>
