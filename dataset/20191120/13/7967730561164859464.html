      </p>
      <p>It’s time to let go of goals and people that no longer fit into the larger scheme. Bidding adieu to certain things isn’t quitting, but rebooting your aspirations. People will be more than willing to mentor, offer tips and advice or introduce you to the right people on your new journey so feel free to ask for help.</p>

        <b>Taurus</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>April 20-May 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>Communication has been extremely hit and miss, especially in the love department. Today though, Mercury, which has been out-of-sync goes direct. This means you’ll regain a fundamental understanding of each other and will able to talk openly without mixed messages. Be honest, open and speak your mind – you’ve a lot of catching up to do!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gemini</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>May 21-June 21</i>
      </p>
      <p>Planetary action in your relationship sector has made you more cooperative and concerned with the needs of others. Today though, it’s all about you! Thankfully all of the peace, love and diplomacy the stars have fostered will enable you to find a balance between meeting your partner’s and loved one’s needs without eclipsing your own.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>June 22-July 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve been working towards positive changes at work whether rearranging hours, employing a PA or launching a group initiative today it’ll happen. The stars in your sector of industry will reward any efforts. As this area also governs health it’s likely that you’ll reach a point where you’re forced to make positive changes to your wellbeing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>July 23-August 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>The clock is ticking! Don’t waste time agonising over pros and cons - you can successfully move towards a decision, even if the answer isn’t yet clear, through process of elimination. Knowing what <i>not</i> to do is probably more important than knowing what <i>to</i> do. Get rid of the extraneous flotsam and a clear path will eventually emerge.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virgo</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>August 23-September 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>You are resourceful and self-sufficient so friends tend not to worry about you. However, just know that support is always there if you need it. Scorpio females in particular will be a rock. Meanwhile, don’t let ‘loyalty’ prevent you from getting ahead. Making your mark doesn’t necessarily mean biting the hand that feeds you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Libra</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>September 23-October 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>What are you willing to share, merge, relinquish or divide? Today’s stars in your sector of joint finances urges you crystalise the terms of partnerships both intimate and professional, as you both strive towards a common. Thankfully Mercury in your finance zone you’ll have a good head for business and your negotiating skills will be top notch!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scorpio</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>October 23 – November 22</i>
      </p>
      <p>You may feel as though you’ve been speaking another language for the past month or so. Now though, the Universe, or more specifically, Mercury, has untangled the lines of communication so all will become clear. Take your time and feel free to change your mind if and when new information comes to light.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sagittarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>November 23-December 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>All is not as it seems! With the stars heightening your intuition this isn’t the time to take things at face value, and it’ll be easier to see behind facades and instead of skirting around them. You should also expect a few epiphanies of sorts in the form or dreams, ‘funny feelings’ or flashes of genius.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Capricorn</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>December 21-January 19</i>
      </p>
      <p>You’re in the perfect position to get noticed. Patience and just the right of amount of serendipity will expose you to opportunities and the right people. Concerning love, a romantic gesture will make you weak at the knees! Singles, look out for Geminis. Meanwhile, the stars bring big news or a solution you’ve been waiting for.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aquarius</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>January 20-February 18</i>
      </p>
      <p>The world needs more morale boosters! However, timing and the delivery are vital factors in spreading sunshine. If you feel the need to broach a touchy subject, make sure you use the right approach. Your sector of hopes and dreams is also being energised suggesting a project you putting in motion ago will yield positive results!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pisces</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>February 19-March 20</i>
      </p>
      <p>If you’ve been bucking for a position, waiting for the right moment to launch your business or run some brilliant ideas passed the right people now is the time to strike! Don’t expect opportunities to land in your lap and take the initiative. If you need advice or help family is the best place to ask.</p>
