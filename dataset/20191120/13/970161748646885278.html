      <p>Scammers are finding new ways to deprive you of your hard earned money throughout the year.</p>
      <p>But shoppers impatiently searching for bargains on Black Friday next week will have con artists rubbing their hands with glee.</p>
      <p>Nearly a quarter of people aged 18 to 34 in the UK have fallen for scams relating to the annual celebration of consumerism, losing an average of £661 each, according to a survey by Barclays.</p>
      <p>The bank says 12 per cent of shopping scams end up in people losing more than £2,000, so it pays to know what warning signs to look out for.</p>
      <p>It may be a hackneyed old phrase, but Tim Mitchell, content director for charity Get Safe Online stresses that if something looks too good to be true it probably is.</p>

      <p>He told Metro.co.uk: ‘Black Friday is all about unmissable offers and the fact that you need to do it today or else you miss out, and of course fraudsters take advantage of that.’</p>

      <p>Common tricks include dodgy posts on social media advertising big ‘Black Friday Deals’ which are completely fraudulent.</p>
      <p>Once punters have entered their bank details and send their money to the ‘seller’ they get absolutely nothing in return.</p>
      <p>Depending on how quick the shopper is to change or cancel their cards, it also leaves a big open goal for scammers to buy things using their account.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye out for unusual web domain names, such as .ga – because it’s unlikely you’ll be getting a North Face jacket shipped from the west African country of Gabon.</p>

        <figcaption>If it looks too good to be true, there’s a good chance it is, says Get Safe Online’s Tim Mitchell</figcaption>

      <p>Tim says people need to start questioning if stores like Next and Marks &amp; Spencer are really going to give away £50 coupons for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Shops can’t afford to give money away more than we can.’</p>
      <p>People are often sent fraudulent emails which on the surface appear to show legitimate promotional offers from trusted high street brands.</p>
      <p>But before you reach for your wallets, Tim says it’s worth taking a step back and double checking the address it came from.</p>
      <p>Very often there are tiny alterations such as ‘Tescos.co.uk’ instead of Tesco.com which an overly eager shopper might overlook.</p>
      <p>Clicking on a link could take you to a similar looking website to the real deal where you’ll end up unwittingly handing over your money.</p>

      <p>Tim said: ‘There’s no harm in actually going onto the store website by typing in the address you know to be correct and actually checking out the offers, or ringing the store.</p>

      <p>‘The trouble with online shopping is it’s practical and convenient and you don’t want to contact the seller but it’s a fact of life that it’s the safest thing to do.’</p>
      <p>Alarm bells should be raised if you’re being asked to make a payment outside a website’s normal procedure.</p>
      <p>Keep an eye out for a padlock symbol and an ‘s’ at the end of ‘http’ in the address bar, which both indicate the website is secure.</p>
      <p>Consumers should buy things online using public wifi at their peril, as hackers can easily tap into the networks to steal your details.</p>

      <p>It’s also easy enough for scammers to set up their own hotspot and give it a name that makes it look like it belongs to a legitimate business.</p>
      <p>Using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) while you browse is a good way to give yourself an added layer of protection if you’re shopping on the go.</p>
      <p>Tim also warns of a number of potentially dangerous counterfeit goods which are sold over online marketplaces like eBay.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It’s actually depriving the people who work for the real Panasonic or Gucci of their incomes, it’s putting people out of work all over the world.’</p>

      <p>Shoppers should keep an eye out for negative feedback if they want to suss out if if someone is selling fakes.</p>
      <p>Head of digital safety at Barclays Ross Martin said: ‘As thousands of items go on sale this Black Friday, it’s crucial that we are all aware of the risks and do not let our guards down, or rush into purchases.</p>
      <p>‘Using sophisticated techniques, criminals will be preparing to exploit our desperation for this year’s best bargains. Make sure that you do your research and carry out the proper safety checks to stay ahead of the scammers.’</p>
