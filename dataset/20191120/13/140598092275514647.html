      <p>This festive roast duck recipe is so easy to prepare and will be ready to serve in under an hour and a half. We eat this with cooked turnips and their tops, and mustard fruits.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>55 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 whole, oven-ready duck (Gressingham, or any other good-quality bird)</li>
        <li>1 orange, sliced</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>½ cinnamon stick</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li>Pat dry the skin of the duck with kitchen paper and prick it all over with a fork. Push the orange slices, star anise and cinnamon stick into the cavity.</li>
        <li>Place the duck on a rack set over a roasting tray to allow fat to drip on to the tray. Roast for 10 minutes, until the skin starts to turn crisp and crinkly, then turn down the oven temperature to 160C/140C fan/Gas 3 and roast for 45 minutes (for pink duck – if you prefer it well done, cook for a further 15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Allow to rest for at least 15 minutes before carving. Reserve any duck fat from the tray for roasting potatoes.</li>
      </ol>
