      <h1>Germany's Continental to slash 5,500 jobs by 2028 in savings drive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:55:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>Continental on Wednesday confirmed it would slash some 5,500 jobs worldwide by 2028 as the German car parts giant seeks savings of 500 million euros ($552.77 million) annually to confront a stuttering global car market and weaker demand for combustion engines.</p>
      <p>The jobs cull would support Continental's "urgently needed technological transition and thus the strengthening of our competitiveness and future viability," CEO Elmar Degenhart said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Continental said around 520 jobs will be lost when a site in Roding, Germany – which makes hydraulic components for petrol and diesel engines – is closed down in 2024.</p>
      <p>Another 850 jobs are under threat in Limbach-Oberfrohna, Germany once manufacturing of diesel injection components ends in 2028, and a further 2,200 jobs are at risk in Babenhausen, Germany, Continental said.</p>
      <p>Another 720 jobs will be lost in Newport News, United States, where hydraulic components for gasoline engines will cease to be manufactured in 2024.</p>
      <p>In Pisa, Italy, 750 jobs are under threat because production of petrol engine components will end by 2028, Continental said.<br/><br/>Continental, with a global workforce of 240,000 people, stressed in its statement that some employees would be offered a chance to retrain "for other tasks" to find alternative roles in the group.<br/><br/>Last month, the group reported a net loss of 1.99 billion euros for the third quarter of 2019, and forecast a full-year loss as well.</p>
