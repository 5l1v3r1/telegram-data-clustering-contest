      <h3>What time is kick-off?</h3>
      <p>12.30pm GMT.</p>

      <h3>What are the odds?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>West Ham - 13/5</li>
        <li>Draw - 3/1</li>
        <li>Tottenham - Evens</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's our prediction?</h3>
      <p>Both teams have made poor starts to the season, both without a win in their last five games, and are separated by just a point in the table. With Spurs naming Jose Mourinho as their new manager, will we see that fabled 'new-manager bounce'?<br/><b>Predicted score:</b> West Ham 2 Tottenham 2.</p>
