      <h1>Plymouth's Gold Maserati rich kid is now giving money away to people on Instagram for fun</h1>
      <h2>Gurvin Singh has just earned £110k in a month so he will be making five people £1k richer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:05:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">William Telford</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth’s money-bags student-turned-businessman Gurvin Singh is so chuffed with his success he’s literally giving some of his wealth away – to five lucky people.</p>
      <p>The University of Plymouth student, who has made a mint trading in foreign currencies, will give five people £1,000 each for doing nothing more than boosting his Instagram profile.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh, who <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/minted-plymouth-lad-20-drives-3555421">raked in £110,000 in October alone</a> through his business interests, said he regularly gifts cash to random strangers in a bid to give back to the community, and has donated at least £20,000 in a year.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old entrepreneur, from a working class London background, was so pleased about <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/">Plymouth Live’s</a> recent report on his new rose-gold wrapped Maserati saloon, that he decided to make five people’s day.</p>

      <p>And it will mark the publication of his e-book on how to make money from dropshipping, which is being released on Sunday, November 24, 2019.</p>
      <p>The first winner will receive £1,000 the following day (Monday, November 25, 2019), and four others will be handed the same sum at roughly three-weekly intervals.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh said all they have to do is repost an image of the story about him onto their Instagram and tag him, and then repost into their own Instagram story for one entry, or feed for five entries. Then they have to tag a friend to do the same thing.</p>
      <p>He will chose the winners himself and, if they live locally, meet them to give them the prize.</p>
      <p>“I feel the need to give back and help people,” he said. “I do this all the time, sometime a few hundreds of pounds at a time, it grows my Instagram and it’s the best way to engage followers.</p>
      <p>“I’ve probably given away £20,000, minimum, in the past year. I’ve done £10,000 in one go before, but that was for three people, about £3,000 each.”</p>
      <p>Mr Singh has made so much money in the past year he has splashed out on a £50,000 Italian-made Maserati Ghibli saloon, with a rose gold metallic wrap, personalised number plate – and its own Instagram account.</p>

      <p>The go-getter made his fortune trading on the Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market, and from a number of training courses he’s established, and some other ventures too.</p>
      <p>The third-year student, not 21 until January, still plans to become a doctor but will continue his capitalistic endeavours alongside his bio-sciences studies.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh was just 19 when he began trading Forex as a way to fund his studies. He started with just £100 but soon had enough cash to splash out on expensive clothes and trainers.</p>
      <p>He did this by “swapping” foreign currencies. Working through a broker he invested in the US$5trillion global currency market and was soon reaping lucrative returns.</p>
      <p>Mr Singh, under the handle @gs_3 now has 125,000 Instagram followers and has set up his own company, gs3 Marketing, and website which trains people how to make a killing from the Forex market.</p>
      <p>He charges for tutorials but says his students are then free and empowered to set up their own Forex trading platforms and start making cash.</p>
