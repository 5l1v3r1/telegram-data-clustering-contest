      <h1>Harry Redknapp backs Mauricio Pochettino for Arsenal in baffling Saddam Hussein analogy</h1>
      <h2>Harry Redknapp reckons axed Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino could take the Arsenal job - because Gunners fans would even cheer Saddam Hussein if they are winning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:51:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Harry Redknapp has backed Mauricio Pochettino for the Arsenal job - before bizarrely comparing the axed Spurs manager to infamous Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by the Gunners' north London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Tuesday evening with Jose Mourinho replacing him in the White Hart Lane hotseat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss Unai Emery has been under pressure after a poor start to the season with his side sitting just three points clear of Spurs and eight adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>And Redknapp believes Arsenal would be right to consider Pochettino, adding that the fans would accept anybody as long as the club were winning games.</p>

      <p>“With Pochettino going from Tottenham, there will be one or two Premier League managers waking up this morning thinking, ‘oh my God, this ain’t too clever’,” he told <a href="https://talksport.com/football/632094/mauricio-pochettino-unai-emery-arsenal-harry-redknapp-tottenham-can-happen/"><i>talkSPORT.</i></a></p>
      <p>“And there will be one or two chairmen very excited this morning thinking if there’s any way they could get him in. What a signing he’d be.</p>

      <p>“There are clubs in London who are having a terrible time. Why shouldn’t he go to Arsenal if he wants to? You think the Arsenal fans wouldn’t love him there?</p>
      <p>“If you go in there and start winning football matches, they would have taken Saddam Hussein in there when he was about, the fans don’t give a monkey's! If you start winning every week, they’re singing ‘there’s only one Saddam’.</p>
      <p>“It happens in football – Sol Campbell went from Tottenham to Arsenal, George Graham did it, Terry Neill did it, Pat Jennings, one of our greatest goalkeepers in history, even he made the change.</p>
      <p>“It can happen, as long as you can do the job. I would have thought Arsenal will be looking at Pochettino now thinking, ‘could we? Can we?’”</p>
