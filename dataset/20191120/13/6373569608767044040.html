      <p>A hit and run BMW driver has been banned from the road after a crash with a car containing young children at a busy Plymouth junction.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Southern, aged 37, was branded an idiot by police for undertaking, overtaking, tailgating and making obscene gestures.</p>
      <p>He drove away after the accident with a Vauxhall Zafira at the <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/man-arrested-after-alleged-hit-3424166">junction of Outland Road and Western Park Road.</a></p>
      <p>Another officer said that it looked like the BMW jumped a red light just after 4pm last month.</p>
      <p>The Force Incident Manager added that two women and two children were “shaken” after the accident. He added the youngest child was just two or three years old.</p>
