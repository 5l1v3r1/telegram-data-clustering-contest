      <p>Have you bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10? Are you waiting for the stable Android 10 update? Today we have bad news for you because according to the moderators of the <a href="http://sammobile.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fr1.community.samsung.com%2Ft5%2F%25EA%25B0%25A4%25EB%259F%25AD%25EC%258B%259C-%25EB%2585%25B8%25ED%258A%25B8%2F%25EB%2585%25B8%25ED%258A%25B810-10-3%25EC%25B0%25A8-%25EB%25B2%25A0%25ED%2583%2580%25EB%258A%2594-2%25EC%25A3%25BC-%25ED%259B%2584-%25EC%2598%2588%25EC%25A0%2595%25EC%259E%2585%25EB%258B%2588%25EB%258B%25A4%2Ftd-p%2F2776379&amp;ppref=https%3A%2F%2Ffeedly.com%2Fi%2Fentry%2FDcqnhWXEG3YExGLSco1cGEL0TW88%2BDtXAkLulmRuADo%3D_16e8817479c%3A4f5fc7c%3A97b0c8f7&amp;currurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sammobile.com%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-galaxy-note-10-stable-android-10-release-may-be-a-few-weeks-away%2F">Samsung community</a>, the beta updates could still take a while to finish. While the Galaxy S10 has already seen 5 beta updates, the Galaxy Note 10 has only received two. Now the next beta version could take about two weeks to reach the Note 10. It is not too long, but knowing that we are at the end of the year, the plans to update before the end of 2019 may not be done.</p>
      <p>At the moment there is nothing official, but if <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> intends to update all its flagships this year, it must be very hurried. Currently, the situation gives a clear advantage to the users of the Galaxy S10, because the beta is much more advanced and polished. At any time Samsung could announce the stable version of the system. Of course, it seems that ie will not do it until December.</p>
      <h3>Galaxy Note 10 update to Android 10 could arrive in early 2020</h3>

      <p>At the moment two beta versions of Android 10 have passed through the Galaxy Note 10. The third update is ready and according to Samsung, it will take at least two weeks. If we start counting, in two weeks we will be on December 5 or 6 and the company will only have 25 days left to update the device to the stable version. Is it enough time? Yes, but expecting the third beta to be the last. If Samsung plans to launch more, things get complicated.</p>
      <p>At the moment it seems that the most viable option for Samsung is to focus on the stable version of the Galaxy S10 and then update the Note 10. Almost certainly, and if the deadlines do not start to change. The latest high-end will begin to update in January 2020.</p>
