      <h1>Lung Cancer Detected in Brazilian Woman Due to Her "Velvety Palms"</h1>
      <h2>The condition known as Tripe Palms changes the surface and texture of cancer patients' hands, turning them velvety.</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-womans-velvety-palms-revealed-her-lung-cancer-1839897686">Brazilian 73-year-old woman</a> was not expecting her dermatology check-up to turn into a conversation about lung cancer. Yet, unfortunately, that's exactly what happened.</p>
      <p>A study published in the <i><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1902529?query=TOC">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, </i>explained how the woman went to seek a doctor's help after both of her palms changed texture. She has what is known as velvety <a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/tripe-palms/">"tripe palms</a>."</p>
      <p>Tripe palms can be a side effect of lung cancer.</p>

      <h3>The woman's velvety hands</h3>
      <p>The Brazilian woman from the study went to seek medical help after her palms became <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-womans-velvety-palms-revealed-her-lung-cancer-1839897686">itchy and had painful lesions</a>. Her symptoms had persisted over the course of <b>nine months</b>, and when doctors took a closer look at her hands they discovered particularly sharp lines in the fold of her palms.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, her palms had additional ridged lines and displayed a 'velvety' appearance.</p>
      <p>This rare condition has a number of names: <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/60/11/976">palmoplantar keratoderma</a>, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202088/#:~:targetText=Tripe%20palm%20or%20acanthosis%20nigricans,cutaneous%20marker%20of%20internal%20malignancy.&amp;targetText=It%20usually%20occurs%20in%20association,has%20been%20reported%20without%20malignancy.">acanthosis nigricans of the palm</a>. The term took a more memorable name in the 1970s when a doctor called it '<a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/tripe-palms/">tripe palm</a>'. </p>
      <p>It was named as such because a doctor realized their patients' hands looked similar to cooked cow and sheep stomachs. </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the term is almost always associated with a type of lung or gastric cancer. </p>
      <p>In the case of the Brazilian woman, she had been smoking a packet of cigarettes a day for <b><a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20191119/Womane28099s-velvety-tripe-palms-turn-out-to-be-a-sign-of-lung-cancer.aspx">three decades</a></b>, had been dealing with a persistent cough, and had continually been losing weight. All signs that can lead to lung cancer, including her tripe palms. </p>

      <p>Not everyone who has lung or gastric cancer has tripe palms as a side effect. It's still largely unknown why it happens, although <a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-womans-velvety-palms-revealed-her-lung-cancer-1839897686">some scientific researchers</a> believe cancer can overstimulate the production of skin cells on the palm. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/TOC">authors of the study</a> said that the woman is still undergoing treatment, as her cancer had persisted past her chemotherapy and radiation treatments. </p>
