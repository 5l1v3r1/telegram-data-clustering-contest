        <b>Inter Milan are ready to begin their efforts to sign Tottenham duo Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen in the summer, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both players are out of contract at the end of the season, with Danish international <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/christian-eriksen"><b>Eriksen</b></a> heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid in recent months and speculation also surrounding Vertonghen’s future in North London.</p>
      <p>According to Italian news outlet <i>Tuttosport</i>, Inter have been monitoring Vertonghen since they began drafting reports on the Belgian in 2016 and the Serie A giants are ready to resume their interest in him.</p>
      <p>It is also claimed that Inter want to ‘raise the pressure’ to try and sign Eriksen on a free transfer next summer, although the pursuit for him is more complicated than the one involving Vertonghen.</p>
      <p>Despite Eriksen wanting to leave North London,<i> </i><i>Tuttosport</i> claim that the Italians are aware that Manchester United or Real Madrid could remove the option of him becoming a free agent by submitting a sizeable January bid.</p>
      <p>Should Eriksen stay at <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tottenham-hotspur"><b>Tottenham</b></a> until the summer, Juventus are said to be Inter’s biggest competitors to sign him, although Antonio Conte’s side could have an advantage in that commissions and wages could make the deal too expensive for the Serie A champions.</p>
