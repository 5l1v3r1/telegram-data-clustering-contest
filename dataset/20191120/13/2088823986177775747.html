      <p>I often start my columns loaded with TV notes with the expression “This is what I’m thinking.”</p>
      <p>I took those words from Paul Reiser’s character on the NBC romantic comedy “Mad About You” that ran from 1992 through 1999 in episodes that have been running on Spectrum cable.</p>
      <p>A picture of “Mad” co-star Helen Hunt, who played Jamie Buchman, was taped to the side of my old desk at The Buffalo News. I’ve always been a fan.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, I was a prime candidate for the reboot of the series that will begin playing the first six episodes for Spectrum subscribers Wednesday. Six more episodes arrive in December.</p>
      <p>I was disappointed filmmaker Paul Buchman (Reiser’s character) never says “this is what I’m thinking” in those six episodes made available for review. The closest he came was in episode six when he responds to Jamie by saying, “if that is what you’re thinking Dr. Freud.”</p>
      <p>More importantly, I didn’t laugh too often during the episodes that are built around issues that are recognizable to empty nesters in their 50s and 60s: Menopause, prostate issues, hearing problems, password issues, dealing with aging parents and having their calls ignored by entitled college-age children.</p>

      <p>The first episode starts promisingly, with Jamie lamenting she and Paul saw a couple for the first time in 20 years before asking her husband the loaded question of what he would think if he saw her walk into a restaurant now instead of in 1999 (when the show ended).</p>
      <p>Paul is a no-win situation and comes up with the wrong answer while trying to be funny. Hunt looks great by the way.</p>
      <p>Reiser looks pretty good, too, especially compared to the way he looks in the second season of Netflix’s “The Kominsky Method” as a bald and heavy senior citizen in a romance with the younger daughter of acting coach Sandy Kominsky (Michael Douglas).</p>
      <p>Reiser gets his hair back (and maybe with a little added) in “Mad.” He also looks less heavy than he is in “Kominsky,” though Paul’s doctor friend Mark (Richard Kind) tells him he is “fat” in a later episode.</p>
      <p>The opening episode reveals Paul and Jamie’s world is thrown upside down because their teenage daughter Mabel (Abby Quinn) is moving five blocks down the street to attend classes at New York University.</p>
      <p>Jamie’s inability to let go is extreme by any standard, which makes it more silly than funny. That is especially true since she has gone back to work – as a therapist.</p>
      <p>Jamie is experiencing hot flashes so severe that she and her husband have disputes over the temperature at home.</p>
      <p>Paul has prostate issues commensurate with his age.</p>
      <p>The couple’s sex life is practically non-existent, though they would like to change that.</p>
      <p>And they can’t hear each other talk unless they are facing each other rather than talking from different rooms.</p>
      <p>The most discouraging part of the reboot is romance pretty much is removed from the romantic comedy, except for a sub-plot involving the Buchman’s relative Ira (John Pankow) and his Italian girlfriend.</p>
      <p>The low point comes when Jamie pointedly tells Paul their daughter is “the love of her life.” In other words, he isn’t.</p>
      <p>So absent romance, viewers will have to be content with watching older characters they used to love adjusting to life after the thrill of romance is gone and they’ve accepted – or at least learned to live – with each other’s irritating behavior.</p>
      <p>This version of “Mad About You” is more about friendships than romance.</p>
      <p>This is what I’m thinking: I wasn’t thrilled, but this reboot is a cute, pleasant reboot that would be a lot more enjoyable if it were funnier.</p>
