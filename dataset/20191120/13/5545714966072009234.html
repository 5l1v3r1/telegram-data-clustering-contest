      <p>Publisher Blitworks has announced that Seba Game Dev's outstanding brawler <i>Fight'N Rage</i> will be carving a path of destruction onto PS4 on December 3, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../fight-n-rage-one-of-the-best-brawlers-ever-made-is-headed-to-xbox-one-and-switch-next-week-567360.phtml">following its recent ports on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</a><br/><br/>Originally released for PC back in 2017, <i>Fight'N Rage</i> is an authentically retro scrolling brawler that perfectly understands - then enhances - the magic of what made the genre such a mega hit in the arcade scene of the early '90s. Players pick from one of three heroes before blasting their way through a colourful-yet-apocalyptic fantasy world, trading fists and feet with an army of mutants and militants.</p>

      <p>Where <i>Fight'N Rage</i> really comes into its own is with its incredibly deep fighting mechanics - which includes combos, specials, parries, and juggles - its multiple route stages, surprisingly grim story, and amazing pixel art and animation, all backed by a fantastic guitar-shredding soundtrack. If that wasn't enough, <i>Fight'N Rage</i> is packed to the rafters with content, including unlockable characters, skins, combo trials, multiple endings and a dedicated training mode.<br/><br/>If you have even a glancing interest in the genre, or if you just like great fucking video games, then <i>Fight'N Rage</i> is worth keeping an eye out for when it launches on PS4 December 3.</p>
