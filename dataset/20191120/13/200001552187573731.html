      <h1>West Ham summer signing being targeted ahead of January transfer window</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:33:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.star.com.tr/spor/ajetiyi-avlayacak-haber-1494919/">Turkish newspaper Star,</a> Besiktas are interested in signing West Ham United forward Albian Ajeti ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 22 year old striker joined Manuel Pellegrini’s side from Basel in the summer, but he could leave the Hammers in the new year after playing just 90 minutes of Premier League football.</p>
      <p>Besiktas are likely to enter the market for a striker to partner Burak Yilmaz and this week the Super Lig club’s manager Abdullah Avci confirmed his intention to bolster his attacking options.</p>
      <p>One of the main candidates, according to Star, is Ajeti and the Turkish side are assessing the situation with the West Ham player. Everton’s Cenk Tosun has also been linked with a move to the Istanbul side in recent months.</p>
      <p>Star claim the attacker is open to playing for Besiktas in order to get more first team experience. In total he’s played in four Premier League games in this campaign for the east London club.</p>
      <p>Ajeti is under contract with West Ham until June 2023.</p>
