      <h1>Israel attacks targets in Syria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:36:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Israel has attacked Iranian and Syrian military targets in Syria in what it says is retaliation for rockets fired toward Israel the day before, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Avichay Adraee says.</p>
      <p>Syria’s air defences were able to destroy most of the missiles fired by Israeli jets over the capital Damascus before they reached their targets, Syria’s state news agency SANA said, quoting a military source.</p>
      <p>Israel’s military said its missile defence system shot down four rockets fired from Syria toward Israel on Tuesday (local time).</p>
      <p>“Warplanes raided dozens of military targets belonging to the Iranian Quds Force and the Syrian Army inside Syrian territory, including surface-to-air missiles, headquarters, weapons depots and military bases, in response to yesterday’s rocket fire from Syria towards Israel,” Lt-Col Adraee said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The elite Quds Force is the overseas arm of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC).</p>
      <p>SANA said three were injured as a result of the Israeli counter-attack.</p>
      <p>Israel says it has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria against Iranian targets trying to establish a permanent military presence there and against advanced weapon shipments to Tehran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday’s Iranian attack on Israeli territory by firing missiles … is the best proof of Iran’s real cause in Syria. The Iranian position poses a threat to Israel’s security, stability in the region, and the Syrian regime,” Adraee said.</p>
