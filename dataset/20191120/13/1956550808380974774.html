      <p>Blink and you might miss this beast of a <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gaming-tech">machine</a> whizzing by you.</p>
      <p>Claiming to be the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gaming-tech/422304-global-village-to-be-worlds-first-5g-powered-entertainment-destination%20fully-electric">fastest</a> hypercar around, the Aspark Owl was officially revealed in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">Dubai</a>, and it boasts to hit 96.5kph in just 1.69 seconds. Yes, that claim is true then.</p>
      <p>Manufactured by Japanese automotive firm Aspark, the Owl has a top speed of 400kph and can come to a full stop from 300kph in 10.6 seconds. Talk about a need for speed.</p>
      <p>Under its hood, it uses four electric motors to give it a whopping 1,985 horsepower (that’s 1,480 kilowatts) and 2,000 Newton metres of torque.</p>
      <p>This is an electric hypercar, and thanks to its 64-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, it’s proven to have a range of 450km in a New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) test. Aspark even said that it will have an even bigger battery available sometime in the future to give it that much more distance.</p>
      <p>It isn’t all about numbers though, as it also looks the part, too. The body features streamlined and smooth curves, with panels made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic along with a stainless steel frame in its roof.</p>
      <p>If you have a few million dirhams lying around, the Aspark Owl will be priced at Dhs11.7 million (€2.9 million) when it officially releases onto the market at the start of the second quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>There will only be 50 of these lightning-fast electric vehicles made, so don’t expect to see too many of these vehicles driving around.<br/>For more on the latest tech updates in Dubai and beyond, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/gaming-tech">click here.</a></p>
