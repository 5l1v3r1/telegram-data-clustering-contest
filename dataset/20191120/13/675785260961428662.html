      <h2>The developer's upcoming League of Legends card game spin-off Legends of Runeterra is getting a closed beta</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:54:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:54</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Osborn, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-osborn/</a></address>
      <p>Riot Games recently had their 10th-anniversary event announcing a whole list of games like Legends of Runeterra, Team Fight Tactics Mobile, Project A, Project F and Project L that are all still in development. Legends of Runeterra is currently available for pre-registration, but what exactly is it?</p>
      <p>Legends of Runeterra is a strategy card video game that takes place in the League of Legends universe. The game draws inspiration from the battle arena title's extensive list of characters and items, providing the players with a whole host of cards to collect and play within the game.</p>

      <p>If you have played Hearthstone you will know what Runeterra is all about, but for those who don't this is a great introduction into the daunting world of League of Legends. Runeterra has a lot of universe lore around the champions, regions and themes.  The game includes a whole host of Legends including Yasou, Jinx, Lux Darius Braum and Thresh. These are your featured champions with the likes of Draven, Garen, Fiora, and Teemo also being included.</p>
      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>The standard match is in rounds and you are paired up against an opponent - either AI or human, depending on your choice. You will each take alternating rounds to attack and defend. This turn-based combat allows you to adapt to your opponent's moves and try to counter when defending, setting yourself up for a strong attacking round.</p>

      <p>The game allows both players to place cards at the same time, which makes it easier for new players looking to learn the game and get into League of Legends. This will let you plan out your rounds more easily, allowing you to work out what will happen without committing to your moves.</p>
      <h3>Expeditions</h3>
      <p>New game mode Expeditions is Legends of Runeterra's new draft-based take on a collectable card game. The mode does not use the cards you have collected personally: instead you build your deck as you go via a series of picks and trades.</p>

      <p>In this mode, you will overcome as many opponents as you can with your evolving deck. There is also due to be a ranked mode and with Expedition's preview period now ver, the game is looking to boast regular updates in the future.</p>
      <h3>Pre-registration and Release</h3>
