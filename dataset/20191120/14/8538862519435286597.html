      <p>While it <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">wasn't quite the grandest return</a> for the racing franchise, we liked <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">Need for Speed Heat</a>. It's a pretty good racer that doesn't have as much quality company in the driving space as you might think, which makes this release a bit of a standout. It seems like that factor translated into sales too as developer Ghost Games reports that the game set a new record in its first week on the market.</p>
      <p>Celebrating across <a href="https://twitter.com/NeedforSpeed/status/1196442942350798855">several Twitter accounts</a>, the Swedish team said that Need for Speed Heat "set a new record during the first week with more of you playing this game than any other NFS title this generation."</p>

      <p>That includes the likes of PlayStation 4 launch title <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/need_for_speed_rivals">Need for Speed: Rivals</a>, the 2015 reboot simply titled <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed">Need for Speed</a>, and the microtransaction-filled entry we'd all rather forget about dubbed <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_payback">Need for Speed Payback</a>. The title debuted in <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/uk_sales_charts_days_gone_is_the_only_new_ip_bigger_than_death_stranding_in_2019">fifth place in its first week</a> in the UK sales chart before falling out of the top 10 completely seven days later.</p>
