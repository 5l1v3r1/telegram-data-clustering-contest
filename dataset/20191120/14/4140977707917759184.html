                      <p>But the winter transfer windows doesn’t involve itself in intense business as compared to the summer transfer windows, probably because no team wants to unbalance itself in the midst of a season.</p>
                      <p>So, with the limited options and short time, we list out three candidates, which Mourinho might be interested in landing with the winter transfer season approaching soon.</p>

                            <p>In the winter transfer season, there are very few sensational signings with hefty money involved. Most of the clubs sell off their unrequired players and that is the case with Gareth Bale.</p>
                            <p>Bale has been on the outgoing transfer list of Real Madrid since summer but the Welsh captain avoided the axing in August. But with his last night stint after his match for Wales, where he unfurled Wales flag which had written. Wales, Gold, Madrid: It displayed the sequence of priorities Bale has in his professional life.</p>

                            </figure>
                            <p>Certainly, this stint did not go well with Real Madrid fans, nor it would go well with the bosses at Los Blancos. On the other hand, Bale is still a loved figure at Tottenham over where he found his fame. Thus, Mourinho can win the hearts of Spurs fans if he lands Bale.</p>
