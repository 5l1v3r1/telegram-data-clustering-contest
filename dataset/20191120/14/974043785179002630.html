      <h1>Agri media has ‘greatest influence on farmer tech decisions’ – IFA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:02:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">Sylvester Phelan</a></address>
      <p>Agricultural related media has a strong influence on farmers when it comes to the adoption of farming technologies, according to a research project conducted by the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA).</p>
      <p>The research project focused on the adoption and attitudes towards digital technology in Irish agriculture; <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/technology-advances-in-agri-sector-revolutionary-ifa/">findings from it were launched</a> by Farm Business Skillnet, in conjunction with the IFA.</p>
      <p>The report ‘Digital Agriculture: Adoption and Attitudes’ was completed from the project, which featured consultation with 750 farmers, focus groups and industry stakeholders.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In the report it was found that agri media “had the greatest influence on farmers’ decisions to use farming technologies, being referred to by 42% when participants were asked about key influences”.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>This rose to 52% for the under-35 age group, the study found.</p>
      <p>Face-to-face environments had been particularly influential on many: farm advisor or agent, other farmers  or farm discussion groups.</p>

      <p>Following agri media’s 42% finding; 34% of farmers overall said farm advisors or agents influenced their decision, with an equivalent percentage saying another farmer influenced them.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>31% of respondents highlighted farm discussion groups, while 24% namechecked trade shows as an influence. 19% referenced classroom education as an influence.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Suppliers, no one and family/friends were also mentioned, highlighted by 12%, 6% and 3% respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 60% of Irish farmers say they are likely to invest in digital technology on their farm in the future, the study details.</p>
      <h3>Discussion groups</h3>
      <p>Farm discussion groups were also highlighted as being a strong potential route for future skills development under a separate part of the study, which focused on education and training.</p>
      <p>While classroom classroom based is the most common training environment, and full day courses and evening courses are most common time-frames for those who have undertaken training and development, 41% had participated in on-farm discussion groups, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Those using technology on their farm are more likely to have completed on-farm discussion groups and evening classes than those not using technology, emphasising the importance of learning and of peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In an ideal situation, farmers feel on-farm discussion groups are a better learning environment, with evening classes the most suitable time, the study found.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Those who are likely to invest in technology are more likely to feel that on-farm discussion groups are an ideal learning environment when compared with those who are unlikely to invest, the research project concluded.</p>
