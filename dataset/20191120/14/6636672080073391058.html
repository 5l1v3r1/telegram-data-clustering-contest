        <b>Climate change will be the biggest challenge facing the engineers of tomorrow, according to recipients of the Arkwright Engineering Scholarship surveyed at a recent ceremony.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nearly half of the teenagers, who are taking their first steps in an engineering career, think climate change is the biggest challenge facing UK scientists and engineers over the next five years.</p>
      <p>The poll was carried out in the run-up to a ceremony at the Institution of Engineering and Technology in London, to celebrate the latest cohort of Arkwright Engineering Scholars.</p>

      <p>The young people have all been awarded scholarships to help them study engineering after passing a selection process involving project work and an interview.</p>
      <p>The survey found that 44% believed the biggest challenge was climate change, while 37% opted for managing existing fuel sources.</p>
      <p>The third most significant challenge identified by the cohort also related to the environment. 12% thought it was most important to move away from the use of harmful materials, while improving UK infrastructure was the fourth choice at 6%.</p>
      <p>Asked about their most anticipated emerging technologies, the majority of the students referenced smart technology. 44% again were excited about autonomous vehicles – with AI and robotics coming second and third with 29% and 26% respectively.</p>
      <p>The Arkwright Engineering Scholarships programme is administered by the STEM education charity, The Smallpeice Trust, which has been providing scholarships to students since 1991.</p>
      <p>Dr Kevin P Stenson, CEO of The Smallpeice Trust, said: “We are very proud to be able to help these inspiring young people on their journey into a career in engineering. It’s reassuring to know that the future of the planet is in such safe hands.</p>
      <p>A total of 415 scholars will receive financial and mentoring support through their A-Levels and Scottish Advanced Higher qualifications, as part of a drive to inspire future leaders in engineering.</p>
      <p>Over 5,700 young people have passed through the scholarship programme in total, including BBC presenter (and 2019’s EW BrightSparks host) Steph McGovern, who forged a career at Black &amp; Decker before moving into business journalism.</p>
