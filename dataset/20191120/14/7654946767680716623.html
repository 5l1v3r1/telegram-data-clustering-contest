      <p>A suspicious vibrato sparked a bomb scare during a performance by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra — before a buzzing sex toy was discovered in a concertgoer’s checked bag.</p>
      <p>The concealed device in the cloakroom began vibrating to the famed orchestra’s rendition of Richard Wagner’s works “Siegfried Idyll” and “The Valkyrie,” <a href="https://www.thelocal.at/20191107/suspected-bomb-in-vienna-was-in-fact-a-sex-toy">according to The Local</a>.</p>
      <p>Fearing a terror incident, police rushed to the Vienna Konzerthaus, where an explosives expert examined the suspicious bag, found the adult toy and turned it off before it caused a classicus interruptus in the concert hall.</p>
      <p>“After the performance had finished, the suitcase was handed over to its owner and his lady friend,” police said in a statement, according to the daily Kurier.</p>
      <p>“They were informed of the incident and the officers wished them a nice evening,” police added, wink wink.</p>
