      <p>The Green Party candidate standing against Boris Johnson in the General Election has denied obstruction of a highway during a protest against HS2.</p>
      <p>Mark Keir appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday after being arrested during a protest at the high-speed rail construction site in Harvil Road, Uxbridge, west London, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old is accused of stopping multiple lorries from accessing the site by lying down in the road by an entrance to the construction site with Scott Breen, 45.</p>
      <p>The pair are said to have locked their arms together in a concrete tube before filling the ends of the tube with cement to prevent them being moved.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Chiran Mondal said this action hindered work on a lawful construction site and caused a loss of earnings.</p>
      <p>In addition to one count of wilful obstruction of a highway each, both men were charged with hindering people in their work.</p>
      <p>A third charge of causing a public nuisance was dropped.</p>
      <p>Iain Oliver, 39, of Harvil Road, Uxbridge, was also arrested on one charge of obstructing an officer.</p>
      <p>The three men deny all charges.</p>
      <p>Keir, of Winnock Road, West Drayton, is standing as the Green Party candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, previously held by the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>The Uxbridge HS2 site has attracted protests regarding the construction work due to fears that it would negatively affect or pollute the water supply and biodiversity in the area.</p>
      <p>Olivia Haggar, representing Keir and Breen, of Vineries Close, Sipson, said the protest was lawful and the vehicles were not hindered in their work.</p>
      <p>Keir, Breen and Oliver will appear again at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court for a trial on February 10 2020.</p>
