      <p>Chris Evans gave everyone a right shock as he stripped down to his underwear live on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> and to say Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby had no idea where to look would be an understatement.</p>
      <p>The radio DJ was on the sofa to discuss his latest charity work and car festival, but it didn’t take long for things to take a surreal turn.</p>
      <p>Showing off the bruises and injuries from having the varicose veins in his legs stripped, the former Top Gear presenter gave everyone’s favourite duo a shock.</p>

      <p>‘Are you actually going to take your trousers down?’ Phillip cautiously asked, before the all-important question: ‘What pants have you got on?’</p>
      <p>‘I don’t have any teeny pants,’ the Evans jokes. ‘Do you have any teeny pants?’</p>

      <p>And poor Holly got a right eyeful.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve had my varicose veins microwaved,’ the 53-year-old revealed. ‘Emma Thompson said it’s up there with childbirth, having your veins stripped out.’</p>
      <p>Unfortunate viewers watching at home managed to see the very bruised legs of the Big Breakfast presenter, which we’re sure is a sight none of us want to see again anytime soon.</p>

      <p>As the interview concluded, Evans admitted: ‘I don’t know how to get my trousers back on.’</p>
      <p>Former Gladiator Ace also appeared on the This Morning sofa, opening up about his failed engagement to Katie Price in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>The bodybuilder admitted that the pair came from ‘similar backgrounds’, and bonded over their newfound fame.</p>
