        <b>The Government has heightened discussions with private-sector interests to develop a limestone production facility to boost export and to provide services to refineries.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Minister of Transport and Mining, Robert Montague, who made the disclosure at a JAMPRO-organised Limestone Opportunities Network Forum, held Tuesday at The Jamaica Pegasus hotel in New Kingston, said the development is to “ensure the viability” of the sector.</p>
      <p>“Lime is one of the critical components in the refining process; a little is produced locally, and most of that is exported,” Montague told the forum.</p>
      <p> He pointed out that Jamaica has “an abundance” of limestone, and the deliberations with the private sector should result in a fortified minerals industry.</p>
      <p>Montague noted that Jamaica is a “world leader” in the industry with the country producing material valued over $5.6 billion in 2018 and export earnings of US$5 million.</p>
      <p>“Jamaica’s minerals industry has several strengths, which afford it the ability to attract investments, provide employment and create wealth. In addition, the sector represents a critical component in the country’s development, and Jamaica is an island that is gifted with excellent mineral resources,” he said.</p>
      <p>He told the gathering that the mining and quarrying sector is a major contributor to the economic growth and development of Jamaica, particularly in the area of foreign exchange earnings.</p>
