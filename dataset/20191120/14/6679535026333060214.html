      <p>TIRUNELVELI</p>
      <p>Police have nabbed a youth, who allegedly fatally knocked down a teen with a stolen car at Aralvaimozhi on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The police said Julian, 35, of Keezha Alangarathattu near Thoothukudi hired a cab from a Tenkasi-based private operator. Car driver Ganesamurthy, 28, of Aayikudi took him to various places. Finally, he parked the vehicle inside the compound of a cottage where Julian was staying. When he returned to the cottage around 10 a.m. after having breakfast, Mr. Ganesamurthy found that the car was missing. Julian was also not there.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ganesamurthy immediately lodged a complaint with Courtallam police, who alerted all check-posts in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Virudhunagar and Kanniyakumari districts.</p>
      <p>When the missing car crossed Kavalkinaru check-post and proceeded towards Nagercoil, the police personnel on duty there alerted those manning Aralvaimozhi check-post. The speeding car, while crossing Aralvaimozhi check-post, hit an ITI student, Surya, 17, of Puthiyakinaru near Aralvaizmozhi, and sped away. However, the police and the public gave a hot chase and intercepted the car, which was driven by Julian. He was reportedly under the influence of alcohol.</p>
      <p>The police rushed Surya to the Government Medical College Hospital at Asaripallam in Nagercoil, where he succumbed to injuries on Wednesday morning.</p>
