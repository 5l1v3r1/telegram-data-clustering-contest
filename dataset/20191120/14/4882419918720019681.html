      <p>Jose Mourinho has been handed a contract made of gold, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>Mou signs on until 2023 after a whirlwind arrival, and will earn Â£15m a season (17.5m euros), nearly double what his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino pocketed.</p>
      <p>Mourinho says he's excited about the challenge at Spurs. The Sun say Paulo Dybala (Juventus), Bruno Fernandes (Sporting de Lisboa), Koulibaly (Napoli), Declan Rice (West Ham) and Youcef Atal (Nice) are on his wish list.</p>
      <p>His first challenge is to drag Spurs up the table from 14th, where they have 14 points only - 20 behind leaders Liverpool</p>
