      <p>Ahead of the massive May bank holiday weekender, Colorado have announced the festival’s official opening party for Friday, May 22, 2020.</p>
      <p>Colorado electro duo <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/3oh-3/">3OH!3</a> are set to kick off the party at the O2 Academy Leeds the night before Slam Dunk North takes place, before drummer extraordinaire Frank Zummo (who you can normally find behind the kit of next year’s co-headliners <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/sum-41/">Sum 41</a>) will be performing a drum set.</p>
      <p>On top of that, resident Slam Dunk DJs, plus Jacky P, will be appearing throughout the night to play all sorts of rock and metal anthems. Tickets for the Slam Dunk opening party go on sale this Friday, November 22, at 10am, with the option available to also buy both part and festival tickets. See more on that at <a href="https://www.slamdunkfestival.com/">Slamdunkfestival.com</a>.</p>

      <p>Of Sum 41’s forthcoming Slam Dunk performance, frontman Deryck Whibley tells Kerrang!: “Slam Dunk is a festival we’ve been wanting to do for a long time, and until now we’ve never been able to pull it off. Scheduling and all that stuff has meant we’ve not been able to play in previous years, which has been frustrating. To finally be appearing at Slam Dunk is a great feeling – it’s been a long time coming. It’s something we’ve always wanted to do, and it’s a festival I’ve continually heard great things about. Sum 41 playing Slam Dunk just makes sense to me.”</p>
      <p>When asked about the rest of the Slam Dunk line-up so far, the vocalist/guitarist adds: “There’s a lot of great bands playing, in my opinion. It’s an awesome feeling to be heading up a bill that’s got the likes of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/state-champs/">State Champs</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/mayday-parade/">Mayday Parade</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/the-wonder-years/">The Wonder Years</a> on it. Being at the top of that list is something we won’t take for granted, because the quality of our contemporaries is high.”</p>
