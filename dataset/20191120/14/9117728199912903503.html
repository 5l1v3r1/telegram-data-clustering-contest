      <p>Team principal Ian James said: <i>"Finally, the day has come that everyone in the team has been working towards.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"The season opener is not the end of this journey but rather the beginning. We are conscious of our status as beginners. We therefore have to learn quickly from errors as they occur and to continue developing as a team.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Finishing the two races somewhere in the points would obviously be fantastic. But no matter how this first race turns out for us, I would like to express my gratitude here and now to the entire team for their tireless efforts.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"What I've experienced over the past few months has been the epitome of commitment in terms of teamwork."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The first race from Saudi Arabia is on Friday at 4pm UK time. You can watch on Eurosport or on the BBC website.</p>
