      <p>Police say his condition is currently stable.</p>
      <p>And now cops have launched an appeal for witnesses as they make a bid to hunt down the attacker.</p>
      <p>They are keen to speak to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious at the time of the stabbing.</p>
      <p>The male suspect is described as white, with a local accent.</p>
      <p>He was wearing dark clothing with a baseball cap.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland via 101, quoting reference number 3254 of November 19.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>We told on Monday how the victim of a terrifying attack <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4967883/attack-hammer-knife-peterhead/">says she feared for her life</a> after a close pal turned on her and hammered her hands.</p>
      <p>Charlene Whyte, known as Shelly, spoke out after Thomas Chesterton, was convicted by a jury of the horrific attack.</p>
      <p>She said she’d “trusted him like he was my brother”.</p>
      <p>And we revealed today that a twisted killer <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4975221/falkirk-murder-stabbing-jailed-life-grandmother-shot-head/">who murdered a grandmother by stabbing her 47 times</a> said he should be "shot in the head" for his crimes.</p>
      <p>William Finlay, 57, from Camelon, Falkirk, was jailed for life for slaughtering 44-year-old neighbour Fiona McDonald, also known as Fiona Canning, over a pension row.</p>
