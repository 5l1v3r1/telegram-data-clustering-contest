      <p>A prominent South African prosecutor was killed in court this week by a loaded gun that discharged when it somehow fell, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Addelaid Ann Ferreira, 51, was in Ixopo regional court when the weapon was introduced as an exhibit in a robbery case, fell and accidentally fired, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-11-19-kwazulu-natal-prosecutor-dies-in-freak-accident-when-gun-goes-off-in-court/">the Sunday Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The lawyer was shot in the left side of the hip and brought to the hospital, where she died from her injuries, police said.</p>
      <p>Umzimkhulu police said they’re investigating the fatal incident as a culpable homicide.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, we cannot divulge further information as the investigations are at a sensitive stage,” police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/breaking-prominent-npa-advocate-dies-after-court-shooting-accident-20191119">told News24</a>.</p>
      <p>Ferreira’s employer confirmed her death in a letter to colleagues.</p>
      <p>“Her untimely passing is mourned by all. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family during this difficult time. The family has requested that their privacy be respected,” KwaZulu-Natal director of public prosecutions Elaine Zungu wrote, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Ferreira’s loved ones remembered the lawyer Tuesday for having a “compassionate heart.”</p>
      <p>“You have outstanding charisma, cool logic and a compassionate heart,” Ric Holt <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ric.holt.3/posts/1746668025465890">wrote</a> in a Facebook tribute.</p>
