      <p>Imagine <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Will-Smith">Will Smith</a> as a super spy and Tom Holland as a genius scientist. Do I have your attention? Good. In the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/Family-Movies-Coming-Out-2019-45448752">upcoming animated film <b>Spies in Disguise</b></a>, Smith and Holland lend their voices to an unlikely pair of characters who embark on the ultimate world-saving mission.</p>
      <p>Smith plays the suave Lance Sterling, a debonair agent with an impressive reputation, while Holland's character Walter Beckett is less . . . smooth. Lance comes to Walter in need of a disguise after an unexpected turn of events, and things get pretty messy. Watch the full trailer above to see the hilarity ensue, and catch <b>Spies in Disguise</b> in theaters this Christmas.</p>
