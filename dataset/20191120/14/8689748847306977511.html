      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:03:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Over the years, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/i-gave-you-my-heart-and-put-my-career-on-hold-but-you-cheated-on-me-princess-shyngle-claps-back-at-her-senegalese-ex-boyfriend/">Princess Shyngle</a> has manoeuvred her ways for netizens to believe that she has arguably the tiniest waist ever and as a result, most of her ignorant female fans are yearning to get same shape.</p>
      <p>But analysing a viral footage available to <a href="http://ghbase.com/">ghbase.com</a>, the image portrayed by the Ghana-based Gambian actress for the past years on social media is entirely different from the reality.</p>
      <p>This is because Princess Shyngle appears to have an unattractive busty waist comparably to her slim figure most people are familiar with.</p>
