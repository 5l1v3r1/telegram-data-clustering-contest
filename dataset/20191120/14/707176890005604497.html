      <p>Investment banking chews them up and spits them out. Samir Assaf, who is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8591e5a0-0b66-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">stepping down</a> from leading HSBC’s efforts in the field, had a longer run than most. His courtly manner and gentlemanly demeanour may have been at odds with the cut-and-thrust of investment banking but it was perfectly in tune with HSBC. That was the problem.</p>
      <p>The writing was on the wall for Mr Assaf when an excoriating “whistleblowing on incompetence” landed last year. Leadership, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/17f129b4-bcd1-11e8-8274-55b72926558f">memo</a> said, had “utterly failed to create a successful strategy”. Regime change was required, with the appointment of Noel Quinn as interim chief executive, for HSBC to shunt Mr Assaf aside. Even then, he will stay on in a non-executive role.</p>
      <p>HSBC has long grappled with investment banking. It failed to parlay its Asian franchise — complete with Rolodex of Hong Kong tycoons and deep roots in mainland China — into mandates when Beijing began privatising state enterprises. Instead it watched as johnny-come-latelies swooped in from the US and Europe and swept up the spoils.</p>
      <p>When it sought to play the American way, hiring Matthew Westerman from Goldman Sachs, things swiftly unravelled. His hires, many of them also from Wall Street banks, struggled with a bureaucracy alien to their species. HSBC was the only bank in the world where you scheduled a meeting to book a meeting room, they quipped. The old guard meantime griped about Mr Westerman’s abrasive style, regular firings and break-of-dawn dressing downs. He <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b7d205cc-d03f-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6">lasted</a> just 18 months.</p>
      <p>Now, with another <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b43e7b3e-e6c7-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59">restructuring</a> under way, investors can only hope it helps even up the numbers. These are horribly skewed. Global banking and markets accounts for $276.8bn of risk weighted assets, roughly a third of the total, but just $1.23bn, or one-quarter, of group pre-tax profit. Investment banking is a costly business: for every $1 it takes in, 95 cents go out in costs. That ratio is sharply above <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/investor-relations/events/presentations.html">UBS</a>’s 84 per cent over the same 9 month period in investment banking.</p>
      <p>Throwing capital and bodies at the division is just grist to the mill. In a market where IPOs are falling like lead balloons and the US is merrily quashing (and even <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/30408b0e-50e2-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294">unstitching</a>) Chinese M&amp;A deals, it takes sterner stuff to play on this turf. If HSBC wants to stay and play it needs to align costs with profits better and exploit its franchise fully. And no more Mr Nice guys.</p>
