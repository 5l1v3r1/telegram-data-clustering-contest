      <p>Tiger Shroff is the new action star of Bollywood and there is no denial to the fact that there is a separate fan base to the actor’s super physique. While we have witnessed enough of his action skills in movies like <i>Baaghi</i> and <i>War</i>, the actor never misses a chance to take a chill pill with his fans on social media.</p>
      <p>Just a few hours ago, Tiger shared a throwback picture during his one of the shoots, on Instagram. While his picture was flooded by comments of his fans, the caption was something which took away all the limelight.</p>

      <p>Even Tiger’s mother Ayesha Shroff, <i>Baaghi 3</i> director Ahmed Khan and WAR director Siddharth Anand replied in the comment section.</p>
      <p>His <i>Baaghi 3</i> co-actor Vijay Varma too replied on the picture and it was really funny.</p>
      <p>He wrote, ” Apni toh abhi bhi nahi hai.. daadhi”.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, actor Vijay Varma, who is currently shooting for ‘<i>Baaghi 3</i>‘ along with Tiger Shroff in Serbia, says he is having a gala time with the latter on the sets.</p>
      <p>“I am really having a great time during the shoot of ‘Baaghi 3’ in Serbia, the shoot is coming out really well. Tiger and I share a great bond and I’m sure that it will be reflected on the big screen,” he said.</p>
      <p>Vijay also shared his admiration for Tiger’s father and veteran actor Jackie Shroff, who is fondly known as Jaggu dada.</p>
