      <h1>Hey Windows users, Apple still loves you (according to this job listing)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:55:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/stan-schroeder/" target="_blank">Stan Schroeder</a></address>
      <p>Remember when Apple said iTunes is toast and that it will be <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-explains-itunes-macos-catalina/">replaced</a> by several, separate media apps? Well, it only happened on macOS Catalina where iTunes has been split into Music, Podcasts and TV applications; on Windows, iTunes and the web browser are still the default way to handle Apple's many media services. </p>
      <p>According to a new <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200013614/senior-software-engineer-windows-media-apps">job listing</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/apple-may-be-working-on-a-successor-to-itunes-on-windows-10">Neowin</a>, Apple is working on it. </p>
      <p>The company is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to "build the next generation of media apps for Windows." </p>
      <p>The ad doesn't outright say what the company's Media Apps team is working on, but it's fair to assume that it might be Windows-based versions of apps like Music and Podcasts. </p>
      <p>"If you love music and you are passionate about writing code, and want to work with world-class engineering teams that ship to millions of users, the Media Apps team is the place for you," sayeth the listing.</p>
      <p>Neowin notes that the listing also mentions UWP or Universal Windows Platform, which might mean Apple is looking to create apps which work on both Windows 10 and Xbox One. </p>
      <p>A single job listing doesn't tell us much about when the company might launch these Windows apps, but at least we know they're in the works. </p>
