      <p>The Ladies Gaelic Football Association [LGFA] today confirmed that the top two finishers in each division will progress directly to the final.</p>
      <p>Reigning Division 1 champions Cork will open their title defence against Westmeath on home soil on Sunday, 26 January, as the opening round of fixtures gets underway.</p>
      <p>Three-in-a-row All-Ireland senior champions Dublin welcome intermediate winners Tipperary to the capital in an intriguing opening day clash, while Donegal and Mayo go head-to-head out west.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, 2018 league and championship finalists Galway welcome newly-promoted Division 2 champions Waterford on day one.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Mick Bohan’s Dubs have three mouth-watering fixtures to look forward to in rounds two, three and four, when they face Mayo away, before hosting arch-rivals Cork and Galway on successive weekends.</p>

      <p>The Rebels will also highlight the visit of Tipperary in round two, after Shane Ronayne’s Premier county beat them on home soil in the 2019 edition.</p>
      <p>Another showdown of note is the Connacht derby clash of Mayo and Galway on 29 March.</p>
      <p>The Division 2, 3, and 4 fixtures have also been announced with tasty encounters down for decision in the opening round (see below).</p>
      <p>Prior to this, the top four teams in each division have contested semi-finals (1st v 4th, 2nd v 3rd) to decide who will advance to the showpiece, but now the top two in each grade will progress straight to finals. </p>
      <p>The 2020 Lidl Ladies National Football League Finals will be played on the weekend of 18/19 April, with the Division 1 and 2 deciders usually staged at Parnell Park.</p>
