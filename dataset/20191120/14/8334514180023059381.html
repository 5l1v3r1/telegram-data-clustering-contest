      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Formula E starts its sixth season in Saudi Arabia on Friday with debutants Porsche and Mercedes hoping to carry their respective success in sports cars and Formula One to a new all-electric battleground.</p>
      <p>French driver Jean-Eric Vergne, the first double champion, is aiming to complete his title hat-trick with the Chinese-owned DS Techeetah team in a series humming with renewed energy.</p>
      <p>The presence of four German giants, with BMW and Audi regulars already, adds luster to a city-based championship that has grown steadily since a financially precarious first season in 2014.</p>
      <p>Formula E recently reported record revenues and a first ever profit and, burnishing environmentally-conscious credentials with an emphasis on sustainability, feels increasingly in tune with the spirit of the times.</p>
      <p>Nissan, Jaguar, Citroen, China’s Nio and India’s Mahindra are also involved.</p>
      <p>The learning curve will be steep for the newcomers, in a championship that saw nine different winners in 13 races last season and where success costs a fraction of Formula One’s bloated budgets.</p>
      <p>“They will have done their homework. They are not starting from scratch, they have a lot of resource and clever people behind them,” says Envision Virgin Racing managing director Sylvain Filippi.</p>
      <p>“I hope they do really well, because it makes the competition even more exciting, but it’s not going to be easy.”</p>
      <p>For Mercedes, the dominant force in Formula One for the past six years and the only carmaker involved in both, Formula E opens a new chapter in their 125-year racing history.</p>
      <p>Their drivers are Belgian ex-McLaren F1 racer Stoffel Vandoorne and 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Porsche, part of the Volkswagen Group that includes Audi, have German Andre Lotterer and Swiss racer Neel Jani as their lineup.</p>
      <p>The series reported revenues of more than 200 million euros ($221.12 million) last September and has grown to 14 races, with a first in the Indonesian capital Jakarta next June before a London finale.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United commercial director Jamie Reigle has joined from the NFL’s Los Angeles Rams franchise, taking on the chief executive role vacated by founder Alejandro Agag.</p>
      <p>“I genuinely believe that we have the zeitgeist in terms of one of the most compelling global sports properties with potential for income growth,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>“I was at Heathrow (airport) the other day and there were two Formula E ads. We’ve done a really good job in terms of the business to business side, brands recognizing that this is the future,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I think the task and the challenge now is ‘can we get that audience to grow and be really engaged?’.”</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia will host two races on the 22nd and 23rd in Ad Diriyah, on the outskirts of Riyadh.</p>
      <p>The series has Liberty Global and Discovery Communications as major shareholders.</p>
