      <p>A Torquay estate agent took his own life after telling his partner he had had a bad day and his branch was going to "end".</p>
      <p>An inquest at Plymouth Coroner's court into the death of Adam Reed heard how he worked for Smart Estate Agents at their branch in Torbay.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner Ian Arrow noted that Mr Reed's partner Jason Boddy had received a call from him at around 3.40pm on the afternoon of May 29 this year, saying that he had had a "bad day at work" and that "it wasn't the end of the world but the end of Smart".</p>
      <p>Just under an hour later he received another message from Mr Reed asking him to let him know when he was on his way to a pre-arranged get together at his mother's. Mr Boddy told his partner he had some more work to do but at 5.01pm he texted saying he was about to get into his car and head to Mr Reed's mother's house.</p>

      <p>By 6.08pm Mr Boddy was still waiting and texted Mr Reed asking where he was, before saying he was going home to their house in Heron Way, Torquay.</p>
      <p>The inquest heard the statement from Mr Boddy which said he drove home, went to the front door and found it locked. When he finally entered he called out but then noticed a candle was lit and in the window there was a silver envelope with Mr Reed's date of birth written on it and some notes.</p>
      <p>Mr Boddy's statement revealed that he knew the date of birth was the password to his partner's mobile phone and he immediately "thought the worst".</p>
      <p>He raced upstairs where he found the body of Mr Reed in the loft hatch. He called 999 but despite attempts by paramedics to revive him he was confirmed deceased at the scene.</p>
      <p>A post mortem concluded that Mr Reed's cause of death was suspension by ligature. A toxicology reported noted he had a very small amount of cannabis in his system.</p>

      <p>A statement from his GP, Dr Hiley, noted that Mr Reed had suffered a viral infection earlier this year. His doctor also confirmed that in September 2010 he had made an attempt on his own life by taking an overdose of drugs.</p>
      <p>Det Con Matthew Brett of Torquay CID said Mr Reed's phone revealed a number of notes addressed to family members which were clearly intended to be read after his death.</p>

      <p>A packet of cigarettes was found near an ashtray which held cannabis ash which led him to believe that Mr Reed had written his messages, smoked a single joint and going into the loft space to take his own life.</p>
      <p>Mr Arrow noted that the estate agents in Torbay was closed which Det Con Brett confirmed.</p>

      <p>Taking into account the evidence provided, Mr Arrow said he concluded that Mr Reed took his own life. He offered his condolences to Mr Reed's partner and family, adding that his death "must've come as a very great shock to them all".</p>
      <p>On the Smart Estate Agent website for Torbay a message on the homepage still: "It is with saddest regret that we announce the Smart Estate Agent franchise in Torquay, Smart Estate Agent Torbay LTD, will be closed until further notice following recent events."</p>
      <p>Devon Live sought a comment from Smart Estate Agent's base in Exeter but they declined to comment.</p>
