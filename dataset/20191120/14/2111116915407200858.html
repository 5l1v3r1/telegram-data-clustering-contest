      <p>Sometimes <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> deals cut the price of middling phones that didn't sell as well as expected upon launch; this isn't one of those times, as this great <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/huawei-p30-review">Huawei P30</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/huawei-p30-pro">P30 Pro</a> deal as part of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon Black Friday</a> selection slashes the price of two of the most noteworthy phones of the year.</p>
      <p>The Huawei P30 Pro tops our list of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-cameraphone">best camera phones</a> at the time of writing, thanks to its array of lenses as well as the RYYB sensor (which takes incredible low-light pictures) and fantastic scene optimization. The P30 has most of these features as well, and just lacks one rear camera from its bigger sibling.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Black Friday, the cheaper phone is available now for a whopping £250 off for the 128GB model, dropping the price from £700 to £450. The phone toed the line between premium and mid-range upon launch, but it's a bargain now, and this could be one of the biggest Black Friday discounts we see.</p>

      <p>The Huawei P30 Pro, which is a better phone (because bigger equals better, but it has a few extra features too), is also discounted, but not by as much. If you want its extra camera, a large curved screen, and some extra photography features, this is the device to go for.</p>
