      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/healthy-living/childrens-health">5-year-old girl</a> in Utah is recovering after she fell with a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/dental-health">toothbrush</a> in her mouth, which left a gaping hole in the back of her throat. The girl’s father, Mitchell Gravenmier, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10375294/girl-punctures-hole-throat-cleaning-teeth/">told news outlets</a> that he was talking to his wife when he heard his daughter’s screams.</p>

      <p>“Celeste was sitting on her bed bouncing up and down and I kept telling her to stop,” Gravenmier said, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10375294/girl-punctures-hole-throat-cleaning-teeth/">according to Kennedy News &amp; Media. </a>“The kids brush their teeth sitting there as it keeps them from running around. I turned around for a second to talk to my wife and when I turned back around, Celest was falling forward. She stood up screaming and I looked in her mouth and could see there was a bit of blood around it.”</p>

      <p>Gravenmier said that at first, he thought she might have bitten her lip, but when he looked into her mouth with a flashlight, he saw the inch-wide hole in the back of her throat. According to the news outlet, he rushed her to the hospital where she underwent emergency surgery to close the wound.</p>
      <p>“She may have permanent speech problems and may need more surgeries in the future to help improve it,” Gravenmier said, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3174047682637534&amp;set=a.377662042276126&amp;type=3&amp;theater">in a Facebook post on his personal page.</a></p>
      <p>Gravenmier said that while Celeste has returned to her “normal, happy self,” she still can’t use sippy cups or straws yet until the wound heals.</p>

      <p>“We’re just glad it didn’t go down her throat,” he told Kennedy News &amp; Media. “They said if it was any further to the sides, it could have severed a blood vessel and caused more significant bleeding.”</p>

      <p>“So always enforce not running or jumping around for your kiddlets [sic] when brushing or anything like that,” Gravenmier wrote, in his post.</p>
