      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Tennis star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Venus_Williams/?tps=1">Venus Williams</a> and former <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a> tight end <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Rob_Gronkowski/?tps=1">Rob Gronkowski</a> joined the Laker Girls for a dance at halftime during a <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Los-Angeles-Lakers/?tps=1">Los Angeles Lakers</a> win against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oklahoma-City-Thunder/?tps=1">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Gronkowski and Williams also performed with comedian <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/James-Corden/?tps=1">James Corden</a> Tuesday at Staples Center. The trio joined the professional dances for Zedd and Alessia Cara's song <i>Stay</i> during the choreographed routine.</p>
      <p>Gronkowski announced his retirement after winning Super Bowl LIII in February. He also announced he is planning to host a music festival during Super Bowl LIV weekend in February 2020 in Miami, teasing fans who thought he was coming out of retirement and rejoining the Patriots.</p>
      <p>Gronkowski still teased that he could return to the field in 2020. Williams posted a video on Instagram Tuesday before her performance on the court, taking selfie footage while getting her makeup done.</p>
      <p>"Glamour, glamour," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/venuswilliams/?hl=en">Williams said in an Instagram</a> story. "Not tennis, glamour."</p>
