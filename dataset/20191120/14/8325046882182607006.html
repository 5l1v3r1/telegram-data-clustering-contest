          <b>The ability to move columns in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/excel">Excel</a> is a great benefit when dealing with long strands of data in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/excel">Excel</a>.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>You can easily move a column into another column, regardless of whether or not the other column has data. You can also move a column so it inserts into another location in the sheet alongside other columns.</b>

      <p>With <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/excel">Excel</a>, you can quickly and easily move, organize, and manipulate data in individual cells and columns. If you wish to reorder the representation of data by moving a column, there are two main ways to do it.</p>
      <p>The first is to move the column to replace another column, which is ideal for moving a string of data into an empty area and expanding your sheet. The other main way to move a column is to actually just slide it over in between two existing data columns.</p>
      <p>Note that for all of these, you can move more than one column at a time by holding down the shift key on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a> or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/pc">PC</a> while clicking multiple columns.</p>

      <h3>How to move columns in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/excel">Excel</a> to replace another column</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> Select a whole column by clicking on the heading of the column so it shows an arrow pointing down into the data cells.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Move your cursor to the line between the heading and the data so that it turns into the move cursor, which is a four-pointed arrow.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> When you see the move cursor, click to grab the column and drag it to move it elsewhere.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> If there is already data in the destination column, a pop-up will ask if you want to replace the data.</p>

      <p><b>5.</b> If you move the column to an empty space, it will move its formatting as well, leaving its former column empty and reset to default settings.</p>

      <h3>How to move a column in Excel to slide between existing columns</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> Highlight a column by clicking on the heading of the column so that it shows an arrow pointing down.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Move your cursor to the line between the heading and the data so it becomes the move cursor, which is a four-pointed arrow.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Hold down the shift key on your keyboard. While holding shift, click on the column you want to move.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> Drag the column to where you want.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> If you’re doing this correctly, you should see two copies of the name of the column you’re trying to insert separated by a colon. For example, if successfully trying to move and insert the new column next to column D, you will see “D:D”.</p>
