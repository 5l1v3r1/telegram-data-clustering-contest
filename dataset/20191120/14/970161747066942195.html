      <p>The Tories solid lead over Labour took a hit in the latest general election poll conducted just before the live TV leaders debate.</p>
      <p>The latest YouGov poll for <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/general-election-11865006">Sky News</a> puts the Conservatives on 42%, down three points compared to a poll which closed last Friday.</p>
      <p>It means the party has a smaller advantage over the opposition party as the election campaign enters a critical stage of debates and manifestos.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a YouGov poll put the Tories at a 17 point advantage over Labour at 45%.</p>
      <p>But just ahead of Boris Johnson’s head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn, the party had slipped while Labour narrowed the gap by two points at 30%.</p>
      <p>The YouGov voting intention poll saw the Lib Dems unchanged on 15% and the Brexit Party staying on 4%.</p>

      <p>The latest Britain Elects figures, up until 18 November, put the Tories at 11 points ahead of Labour with the smaller parties trailing behind.</p>
      <p>Following last night’s TV debate between the prime minister and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, YouGov’s snap survey suggested it was a close call on who won voters over.</p>
      <p>It revealed 51% of Britons believed Mr Johnson won the first leaders’ debate of the General Election compared with 49% for Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <p>Those who answered ‘don’t know’ were removed from the result.</p>

      <p>Further questioning showed 45% regarded Labour’s Mr Corbyn was more trustworthy compared with 40% for the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>On who came across as more likeable, 54% said Mr Johnson and 37% Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <p>But when asked who came across as more in touch with ordinary people, 25% said Mr Johnson and 59% answered Mr Corbyn.</p>
