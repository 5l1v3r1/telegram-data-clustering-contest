      <h1>The Mandalorian concept art for Baby Yoda should come with health warning</h1>

      <p>The Mandalorian director Jon Favreau has just unveiled the concept art for ‘Baby Yoda’ and, honestly, we’ve never wanted to throw money at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> more.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a> Plus floored subscribers when they wrapped up <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/mandalorian-introduces-baby-yoda-star-wars-fans-obviously-internet-cannot-handle-11089019/">episode one of their sci-fi epic with the first look at a tiny green creature</a> resembling Luke Skywalker’s ancient mentor.</p>
      <p>Turns out, the baby – who is actually 50-years-old – will be an integral part of The Mandalorian, even if we’re not yet quite sure what’s in store for the bubba.</p>
      <p>Regardless, as long as absolutely no harm comes its way we can sleep easy because just look at the first designs of ‘Baby Yoda’ and weep.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The character has been affectionately coined ‘Baby Yoda’ by Star Wars fans, but The Mandalorian is actually set after the events of Return of The Jedi and, thus, cannot be the wee oracle.</p>
      <p>Whatever, we are just one of the millions of fans who would happily give up everything they own for the little one.</p>

      <p>Next to nothing is known about Yoda’s species – we only ever saw another creature like him in the prequel trilogy with a character named Yaddle.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait until Disney+ launches in the UK in March 2020 before we can watch The Mandalorian.</p>
