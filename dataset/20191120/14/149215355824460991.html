      <p>Well, that wasn't the start to the day the White House was hoping for.</p>
      <p>Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/17/trump-great-womem-typo/4222255002/">was temporarily brought onto</a> the White House team to deliver "proactive impeachment messaging and other special projects as they arise," <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/06/trump-impeachment-pam-bondi-tony-sayegh-066919">per an administration official</a>, stumbled when it came to that very messaging during a CBS interview Wednesday before a major public impeachment hearing.</p>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879611/watch-gordon-sondland-testify-trump-impeachment-hearings">is testifying</a> before Congress, but when Bondi was asked about him she flubbed his title, referring to him as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.</p>

      <p>It's understandable to a point — there sure are a lot of different titles floating around in the impeachment inquiry, and most of them are related to Ukraine in some way. But, as the kids like to say, Bondi had one job. As <i>Politico</i>'s Eugene Daniels <a href="https://twitter.com/EugeneDaniels2/status/1197158137494679552">noted</a>, the distinction between the two positions "is why people are wondering why he was so involved in dealings with Ukraine." Watch the full clip below. Tim O'Donnell</p>
