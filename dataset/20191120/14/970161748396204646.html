      <p>There are huge things happening in Neighbours this week meaning there is a lot of distraction and a high chance no one will realise just how much danger Harlow Robinson (Jemma Donovan) is in. And she could be about to leave Ramsay Street for good.</p>
      <p>When her mum Prue (Denise Van Outen) showed up in town it was obvious Prue had some kind of ulterior motive for being there, she’d previously said she wasn’t bothered about being in her daughter’s life, so why suddenly rock up in Ramsay Street?</p>
      <p>It’s a question no one has really pushed deep enough, and it might mean Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) could lose Harlow forever.</p>
      <p>Prue tells Harlow she wants to take her back to London and with Ned (Ben Hall) still suffering, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) secretly drinking and Paul facing the class action, Harlow has no one to talk to. Paul and Terese find out about it and are horrified, promising to do better. But when Terese slips up she plays right into Prue’s hands.</p>

      <p>Terese is struggling to cope and late that night sneaks downstairs for a drink. But she gets caught – Prue sees everything. It’s the leverage she needs, and she pressures Terese to let Harlow leave with her or she’ll spill to Paul that Terese has fallen off the wagon.</p>
      <p>With her hand forced, Terese betrays Paul by suggesting Harlow makes the decision, and that it might not be a bad thing if Prue takes Harlow so that the teenager can finally have a life with her mum. Harlow agrees to go, much to Terese and Paul’s devastation.</p>

      <p>But no one realises what Prue’s true intentions are – to take Harlow to The Order and force her into a life with the cult.</p>
      <p>The street is shocked by Harlow’s announcement of her departure and they come out in force to bid their farewells. Gary and Amy begin to talk as Harlow and Prue leave for the airport. As they compare their notes the penny begins to drop and they realise exactly what Prue has in store.</p>
      <p>Now it’s a race against time to save the teen from what her mum’s evil plan. Can they reach the airport before the pair get on the plane?</p>
