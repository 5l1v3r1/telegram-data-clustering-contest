      <p>Manchester United are considering a January move for AS Roma striker <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/102337/Edin-Dzeko">Edin Dzeko</a> after identifying the need for experienced reinforcements to the squad's attacking options, sources have told ESPN FC.</p>
      <p>United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said earlier this month that the club will only make signings in January if they can offer long-term solutions at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>But sources have told ESPN FC that, despite the recent form of <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/230945/Marcus-Rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/181140/Anthony-Martial">Anthony Martial</a> and the emergence of 18-year-old <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/276221/Mason-Greenwood">Mason Greenwood</a> this season, Solskjaer is determined to add a proven goalscorer during the transfer window -- and former Manchester City striker Dzeko has moved ahead of Juventus' <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/105582/Mario-Mandzukic">Mario Mandzukic</a> on United's list of targets.</p>
      <p>The club were close to completing a Â£14 million move for Mandzukic, 33, in August before shelving the deal. United have retained a tentative interest in the Croatia international, who is yet to kick a ball for Juventus this season.</p>
      <p>Mandzukic's inactivity has prompted United to shift their focus elsewhere, however, and Dzeko, also 33, has emerged as a leading target due to his Premier League experience with City -- the Bosnia international scored 50 goals in 130 league games for the club -- and recent form with Roma, where he has netted six goals in 15 appearances so far this season.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman, has moved the club away from signing players in their late 20s and early 30s following disappointing investments in <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/27014/Bastian-Schweinsteiger">Bastian Schweinsteiger</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/135743/Nemanja-Matic">Nemanja Matic</a> in recent seasons.</p>
      <p>But with Solskjaer's forwards all in their early 20s, sources have told ESPN FC that Woodward is prepared to sanction the signing of a seasoned forward, such as Dzeko or Mandzukic, due to the potential short-term benefits of such a move.</p>
