      <p>Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, the senator who sponsored the controversial anti-hate speech, has warned that if nothing was done to stop attacks on Nigerians through social media, the consequences could be unbearable.</p>
      <p>Abdullahi, deputy chief whip, who spoke on Wednesday, November 20, warned that Nigeria may experience severe crisis except the hate speech bill is passed to end the challenge the citizens are facing.</p>
      <p>He argued that those engaging in hate speech remained determined to frustrate the bill by claiming to be advocates of ‘free speech'.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“What Nigerians do not know at the moment is that we are confronted by a big threat to our unity and existence as a people.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The issue of hate in our society is fast becoming a norm that has left a lot of people as victims,"</i> the senator said.</p>
      <p>He said the purveyors of hate speech, knowing that the game is up for them with the introduction of the bill, have taken to blackmailing lawmakers.</p>
      <p>He noted that currently, nothing makes any Nigerian immune to the consequences of the hate speech as he added that <i>"even your belonging to any political party can insulate you and your family from hate speech, because in one way or the other, everyone falls into a category that is open to segregation at some point.</i></p>
