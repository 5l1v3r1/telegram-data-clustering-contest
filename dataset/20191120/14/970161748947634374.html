      <p>Puppies in Santa hats and Christmas outfits are brightening the days of air travellers in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The festive pooches are on a training session in Dublin Airport today – and holiday makers are being encouraged to ‘come over for a quick pet’.</p>
      <p>One, Luna, was filmed looking a little sheepish in a Christmas outfit, while sitting down and looking around.</p>
      <p>Passengers appeared to be big fans of the adorable visitors, with the group being labelled ‘gorgeous’, ‘so cute’ and ‘absolutely precious’ on Twitter.</p>
