        <b>Here’s a yarn of the man bites dog variety: China is giving an American takeover deal a regulatory going over.</b>
      </p>
      <p>CFIUS, the Committee for Foreign Investment in the US, has turned down many an attempt by Chinese companies to buy US companies.</p>
      <p>Now the boot is on the other foot.</p>
      <p>Diodes Inc of Texas, which bought Zetex, Ferranti Semiconductors’ discretes business in 2008- and, earlier this year – bought the old Natsemi/TI fab at Greenock,  made a $428 million offer, in August,  to buy Lite-On Semiconductor of Taiwan.</p>
      <p>Lite-On has a Shanghai affiliate company called On-Bright Electronics with a market value of  $324 million.</p>
      <p>Diodes’ take-over of Lite-On would mean control of On-Bright would pass to Diodes.</p>
      <p>Lite-On is a power discretes company and On-Bright is an analogue and mixed signal IC company with CMOS, BiCMOS and BCD processes.</p>
      <p>It is now being rumoured that the Chinese regulator will only allow the takeover to go ahead if OnBright is cut out of the deal.</p>
      <p>The newly aggressive regulatory stance by China has come as a surprise to many.</p>
      <p>We keep being told that a US-China trade peace deal is around the corner but this looks like escalated tit-for-tat. </p>
