      <p>It is almost three weeks since a teenager was raped while waiting at a bus stop on Halloween night.</p>
      <p>And police have said the driver of a small hatchback – seen on footage from Gorey Pier at 11.59pm on Thursday 31 October – may have key information.</p>
      <p>More than 300 house-to-house inquiries have been carried out, with 15 officers currently working on the case – including two from Guernsey and one from Devon and Cornwall police. A total of 54 persons of interest have been identified.</p>
      <p>Detective Superintendent Stewart Gull said: 'As we approach the three-week anniversary of this reported attack, detectives continue to work hard pursuing a range of inquiries.</p>
      <p>'In the absence of any clear suspect, this is by its nature time-consuming work – following every lead in minute detail and visiting and assessing a range of identified persons of interest.</p>
      <p>'The response from the public has been significant and very helpful – we’re extremely thankful for the community support we’ve received. This will take time but please rest assured that we continue to do everything that we can to solve this case.'</p>
      <p>The attack is believed to have happened between midnight and 12.13am at the Gorey Common bus stop on Friday 1 November.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is being asked to phone the States police on 612214 or 612612 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.</p>
