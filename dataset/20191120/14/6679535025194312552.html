      <p>Vickramasingapuram police have arrested a casual labourer for allegedly selling his 17-day-old daughter. The police also arrested the buyer and three brokers who mediated the deal.</p>
      <p>The police said J. Pushpalatha, 35, second wife of casual labourer Jesu Irudhayaraj, 40, of Arumugampatti near Vickramasingapuram in the district and mother of three children, gave birth to twins – a boy and a girl – at Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital 17 days ago. When Jesu came to his house for lunch on Tuesday afternoon, he took the baby girl and left the home.</p>
      <p>Ms. Pushpalata grew suspicious and came out of the house after a few minutes, but Jesu was not there. Though she, along with the neighbours, searched for her husband and the baby, the effort that lasted till the night went in vain. She filed a complaint with Vickramasingapuram police on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During investigation, police found that Jesu had sold the baby to a one Thangadurai, 40, of Anna Nagar in Alangulam with the help of brokers Selvam, 50, Nellaiyappan, 40, and Kannan, 35, all from the same area.</p>
      <p>The police rescued the baby from Thangadurai.</p>
