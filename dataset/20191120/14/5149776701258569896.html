      <h1>A Narnia wardrobe and rooftop views - first look at revamped Bromley House library</h1>
      <h2>"It feels amazing to be part of securing the library's future"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:01:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:01</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A restoration project at a Grade II listed city centre library is now just weeks away from completion.</p>
      <p>Bromley House Library in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">Angel Row</a> has undergone dramatic changes to its roof and attic space after it was deemed 'at risk' by Historic England.</p>
      <p>As well as repairing the roof, the four attic rooms have been carefully transformed and include a children's library complete with Narnia wardrobe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/historic-library-close-work-starts-2818693">Looking back over the past eight months since work began</a>, library director Melanie Duffill-Jeffs said it was "a real honour" to be part of the experience.</p>
      <p>"I've really enjoyed working alongside the team. It feels amazing to be part of securing the library's future," Melanie said.</p>
      <p>"Although it will be nice to get back to being a normal library again."</p>
      <p>Work started in May this year as scaffolding covered the building to access the roof, described by Melanie as "our cocoon".</p>
      <p>She said: "It has been a long process and difficult at times, mainly because of the dust. But the contractors have been very respectful.</p>
      <p>"It has been a sensitive refurbishment. We did not want to lose the character or the history of the place.</p>
      <p>"The main aim was to be watertight and safeguard the future of the building but to have a stunning new attic space is so exciting."</p>

      <p>The members-only library was established in 1816.</p>
      <p>The building itself, a former Georgian townhouse, dates back to 1752, but recently there has been issues with leaks and other structural concerns.</p>
      <p>Historic England provided a grant of more than £385,000 to replace the roof with the library securing further investment from local trusts, legacies and donations.</p>
      <p>Around £700,000 in total has now been spent to ensure the future protection of the library and bring life back to the rooms in the attic space.</p>

      <p>The attic rooms include 'The Studio' filled with light from new roof windows and offering a view of the garden nestled behind the Malt Cross pub.</p>
      <p>There is also 'The Children's Library' complete with fireplace and a large engraved wardrobe to resemble the magical door to Narnia.</p>
      <p>"We plan to add fur coats at a later date," Melanie added, referring to the children's classic novel by C.S. Lewis.</p>
      <p>Within the 'The Darkroom', home of the Pauline Heathcote Archive, is the site of the first photographic studio in the midlands and has retained most of its original features.</p>
      <p>The Victor Semmens Reading Room', has now been named after a Bromley House director who Melanie described as pivotal in the project's progress.</p>
      <p>Within this room, the ceiling has been lifted to create more light and show off the exposed beams.</p>

      <p>"The work that has been done is enough to see the library through into the future, now it has a sensible drainage system to prevent anymore leaks," she added.</p>
      <p>"It's taken a long time due to the high level of craftsmanship, and using many original methods including straw under the floor and reeds in the ceiling where we have had to replace the plaster in some parts.</p>
      <p>"The whole project will mean we can make better use of the space and invite more people to enjoy the library."</p>

      <p>Bromley House has only had to close for four weeks throughout the project but has otherwise been running as normal, even welcoming new subscriptions.</p>
      <p>Melanie praised the library's dedicated members who have "kept our spirits up" by offering support and continued to visit.</p>
      <p>"Many have likened it to having builders in their home and have asked how they can help," she added.</p>
      <p>Now with the end in sight a delivery of more than 10,000 books placed in storage while the work was carried out will arrive back at the library on December 2.</p>
      <p>It is hoped the project will be fully completed before Christmas.</p>
