      <p>"As per <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/GfK">GfK</a> data, we have a 3-5 per cent share in the offline market already. Our aspiration is to get to an overall (online and offline) market share of 30-35 per cent and for that, offline retail will play a very important role," realme India CEO Madhav Sheth told .</p>
      <p>He added that the company is working on introducing an "offline retail-centric smartphone series" in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Realme occupied the fourth spot in the Indian smartphone market with 14.3 per cent share, after <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> (27.1 per cent), Samsung (18.9 per cent) and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/vivo-bio-tech-ltd/stocks/companyid-8813.cms">Vivo</a> (15.2 per cent). Oppo ranked fifth with 11.8 per cent share in the July-September 2019 quarter, as per IDC data.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Realme is part of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/BBK-Group">BBK Group</a>, which also owns brands like OPPO, vivo and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/OnePlus">OnePlus</a>.</p>
      <p>As per a report by research firm CMR, BBK Group companies had achieved a record-high 42 per cent share in India's smartphone market for the quarter ended September.</p>
      <p>Talking about Realme's offline presence, Sheth said its products are available across 7,000 retail points, which will be ramped up to about 20,000 by March, and 35,000 by December 2020.</p>
      <p>"While 60 per cent of these retail stores are currently in tier I cities, we believe growth will be driven in the market by tier III and IV markets, and we are focussing our expansion with these markets in mind," he explained.</p>
      <p>Sheth said online retail accounts for 70 per cent of its sales.</p>
      <p>Asked about complaints from offline retailers about differential treatment vis-a-vis online platforms, Sheth said, "realme offers the lowest margins in trade (offline retail) but strong sales volumes has compensated for that."</p>
      <p>"For us, its not about numbers. Whether it is the dealer or the end-customer, we want to build a long-term relationship," he added.</p>
      <p>Realme on Wednesday launched its flagship smartphone -- <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Realme-X2-Pro">Realme X2 Pro</a> -- priced at Rs 29,999 onwards. The premium device features 50W Super VOOC Flash Charge (which allows 100 per cent charging in 35 mins) and Snapdragon 855+ processor.
