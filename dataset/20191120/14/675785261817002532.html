      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino and Bayern Munich chief held talks before Champions League heroics</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino is on the market after being sacked by Tottenham, but he had already been in contact with one of Bayern Munich's chiefs</h2>

      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is a man without a job, but he won't be short of offers having been sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>The north Londoners took the plunge and axed the Argentine replacing him with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Pochettino had led Tottenham to their first ever Champions League final less than six months ago, but it still wasn't enough to keep his job.</p>
      <p>But before he masterminded wins against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and Ajax he had already held discussions with Bayern Munich chief Hasan Salihamidzic, reports <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/fussball/premier-league/premierleague/tottenham-hotspur-trainer-entlassung-mauricio-pochettino-66144036.sport.html?wtmc=twttr.shr">Bild</a> .</p>
      <p>The Bayern sporting director is a big fan of the Argentine and he is on a list of candidates to succeed Niko Kovac.</p>

      <p>But before the Croat was appointed in 2018 Salihamidzic and Pochettino has already been in contact.</p>
      <p>Bayern may still move for the readily available coach, but there is apprehension with the Allianz Arena given the size of Pochettino's backroom staff.</p>
      <p>The Bavarians are reluctant to hire an entire coaching staff given the culture it creates and they are keen to have a German speaker on the training pitch.</p>

      <p>Hansi Flick has been placed in temporary charge and will call the shots at least until Christmas.</p>
      <p>A Bayern source recently told the Athletic: "Bayern will do anything to get him. On the other hand, that’s what everyone would do, even <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and probably <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , who have been aiming at him for a year and a half now.</p>
      <p>"It’s a very difficult option, but that would be Bayern’s priority.”</p>
      <p>The German champions have also been linked with Pep Guardiola who previously led them to three Bundesliga titles.</p>
      <p>Salihamidzic and another of Bayern's top dogs were in England last week but refused to be drawn on speculation linking them with the Catalan.</p>
      <p>They are also still keen on signing Leroy Sane who they chased for much of the summer before injury ended his season before the opening game.</p>
