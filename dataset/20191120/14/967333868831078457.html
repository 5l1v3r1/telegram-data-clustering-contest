        <b>The frilled-necked lizard (Chlamydosaurus kingii)) is the most striking and mysterious representative of the Agamidae family. When the reptile becomes agitated or fleeing from danger, the lacquered lizard inflates the part of the body, from which it owes its name. A bizarre-shaped cloak or collar resembling an open parachute suddenly appears.</b>
