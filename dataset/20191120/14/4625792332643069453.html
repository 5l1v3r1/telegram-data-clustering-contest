      <h1>Hitler house will be converted into police station to prevent it from becoming neo-Nazi shrine</h1>

      <p>The Austrian house where Adolf Hitler was born is set to be converted into a police station in an effort to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi pilgrimage site.</p>
      <p>The yellow house is located in Braunau, Austria, a town of about 16,000 people near the border of Germany, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/austria-to-turn-adolf-hitlers-birthplace-into-police-station">according</a> to the <i>Guardian</i>. The dictator was born in the residence on April 20, 1889, but only lived there for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>The fate of the building was part of a protracted legal battle between the owner, Gerlinde Pommer, and the Austrian government. Pommer had previously rented it to the government to use for housing for disabled people, but the arrangement fell apart in 2011 because Pommer was not maintaining upkeep up the residence. Since then, the building has been empty.</p>
      <p>This year, a court ruled that Pommer would be paid $900,000 for the property, which was less than she was asking for but more than the government’s initial offer to purchase it.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn said that there will be renovations on the building to convert it into a police station and that a contest across the European Union will be held to find the best design for the new office.</p>
      <p>“The house’s future usage by the police should set a clear signal that this building will never be a place to commemorate Nazism,” Peschorn said.</p>
      <p>Despite being in disarray for years, the house still sporadically attracts Nazi pilgrims. The residence is also the location of a yearly anti-fascist rally on Hitler’s birthday.</p>
