      <h1>Why We Should Only Use Organic Skincare Products</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:59:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/Cheerfulpraise</a></address>
      <p>It is undeniable that there has been a serious shift in our lifestyle-related thought process over the last few decades. Now, most of us are continuously looking for ways to live a lifestyle that is healthier. Some of the most important aspects of a <a href="https://personalexcellence.co/blog/healthy-living/">healthier lifestyle</a> in today’s context are eating more greens, buying organic, and adding in more exercising intervals.</p>
      <p>When it comes to skincare, the way forward is definitely using products derived directly from nature and its endless resources. Also, while choosing a natural skin care product, it is important to remember that all these products are not created equally.</p>
      <p>In today’s skincare market we frequently come across products with labels such as “natural,” “organic” and even “chemical-free”. Lets us first understand the meaning of these terms.</p>
      <p><b>Natural Skincare: </b>A natural skin care product may be defined as one made of ingredients that are by-products of a plant, mineral or animal. However, this term is often used by companies for marketing purposes because no governing authority is responsible for regulating these products. Therefore, a product containing some natural ingredients may claim to be natural, even if certain synthetic ingredients are also present in the product.</p>
      <p><b>Organic Skincare: </b>This term refers to how an ingredient or ingredients used in a product were farmed. The ingredients in the <a href="https://www.primallifeorganics.com/">best organic skincare products</a> must be grown without using any chemical fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics, or growth hormones. Organic skincare products are manufactured using plant-derived ingredients along with some other organic materials. They are not made of genetically modified ingredients and are not tested on animals. Also, these products are minimally processed and do not contains additives or petrochemicals.</p>
      <p>Mentioned below are some of the most important reasons why we should only use organic products.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The products are manufactured from plants and other natural ingredients grown without any synthetic fertilizers, GMOs, pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals or additives. Therefore, all the materials absorbed by the body are real, and not harmful.</li>
        <li>By opting for organic products, we can choose ingredients that are capable of working in tandem with the skin’s sophisticated natural systems to provide the extra attention and care it deserves.</li>
        <li>It has been observed the quality organic products are much more effective compared to others. Therefore, this is a priority for anyone in pursuit of a healthy lifestyle. Ideally, a good skincare product should be gentle, yet effective, and free of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dangerous-chemicals-in-beauty-products-makeup-list-2019-6">harsh chemicals</a> and sulfates.</li>
        <li>Most of the ingredients found in non-organic products may produce quick results, but they also cause adverse effects that may show up later. Naturally, whatever material is absorbed by the skin makes its way into the bloodstream and gets carried through the body. Prolonged exposure to these materials may weaken or damage the skin beyond repair.</li>
        <li>Using natural and organic skincare products allows us to enjoy the nutritional benefits of ingredients such as honey, coconut oil, aloe vera, shea butter, and many more. Though these products may take time to work, they are gentle on the skin and cause no harm to our body.</li>
        <li>Most of the organic skincare products available these days contain powerful antioxidants with significant capabilities to slow down the process or aging and making the skin look younger. Compared to 5-10% in synthetic products, about 95% of an organic product may contain active ingredients.</li>
        <li>With organic skincare products, there is almost no likelihood of irritation, inflammations, or allergic reactions because they do not contain harsh chemicals.</li>
        <li>By using organic products, you can also raise your voice against the use of innocent animals for product testing. These tests are not required for organic products because they don’t contain any <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dangerous-beauty-products_b_4168587">harmful chemicals</a>.      </li>
      </ul>
