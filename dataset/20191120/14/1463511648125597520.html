      <h1>Sex position, duration don’t determine child’s gender – Expert</h1>

      <p>Dr Olatoye Ogundipe, a gynecologist, on Wednesday, says the gender of a child is not determined by the sex position or duration contrary to beliefs by some people.</p>
      <p>Ogundipe, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria in Ilorin, said that most couples had been misled in believing that there were certain sex positions to adopt to have a baby boy or girl.</p>
      <p>“This is erroneous and misleading, the formation of a child is more than just sex by the couple, a lot goes on in the body.</p>
      <p>“I hear some traditional healers say a lot of things about conception, some say; do not have sex when the sun is high.</p>
      <p>“Others say there is a particular time of the menstrual cycle to conceive in order  to have a boy or girl; these claims are not medically proven.</p>
      <p>“What medicine says is that sperm carries the X or Y chromosomes while the female egg is X. If the sperm carrying Y meets the egg first, it results to XY which is a boy and if it is X, it becomes XX which is a girl.”</p>
      <p>According to him, some men are still not knowledgeable of the fact that the gender of a child is determined by them and therefore, the woman is not to blame.</p>
      <p>“It is time we humans understand that the cycle of life is dependent on both the man and the woman; we cannot continue to wish for baby boys alone, then, who will carry future pregnancies.</p>
      <p>“We need women too. They are important too. The birth of a baby girl is a blessing to the human race, so is a boy.</p>
      <p>“However, the sex position, duration or timing cannot determine a child’s gender, otherwise, until such a claim is proven medically,” he said.</p>
