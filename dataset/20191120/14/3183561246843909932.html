      <p>Huawei's foldable phone, Huawei Mate X, made its debut last week, and there's another batch on the way.</p>
      <p>November 15 saw the Mate X released into the wild at last, with a price tag of 16,999 yuan (about $3500) and it sold out in a matter of minutes â€“ mirroring the Samsung Galaxy Fold's launch in Korea, which saw the handset sell out just as fast, followed by an influx of resellers flogging the phone at increased prices.</p>
      <p>Eager beaver buyers don't have to wait too long before the next wave drops, as Huawei will be rolling out a second load of them this week on November 22. Perhaps anticipating potential issues with its wraparound display, the manufacturer is offering 50 per cent off screen-related repairs and replacements. The Galaxy Fold has had a slew of screen issues - <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/09/samsung-galaxy-fold-pixel-problem/">even as recently as September</a> - and with the Mate X's screen on the outside, it seems that it's just asking to be damaged.</p>
      <p>A UK release date hasn't been confirmed for the Mate X just yet, but if you're itching to fritter away two grand on a new concept phone, you can see how it holds up <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/not-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-australia">against the Galaxy Fold</a>, or check out what the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/motorola-razr-australia-release-date/">slightly cheaper Motorola Razr</a> has in store.</p>
