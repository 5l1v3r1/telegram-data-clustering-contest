      <h1>These are the best Windows 10 laptop and MacBook deals coming on Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Upgrade your current laptop for less</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/cameron-faulkner" target="_blank">Cameron Faulkner</a></address>
      <p>Most of the year, it’s tough to find a worthwhile deal on a laptop. If you’re in the market for an upgrade, or are buying your first laptop, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is when all of the retailers and manufacturers mark down most, if not all, of their inventory to the best prices of the year. Regardless of whether you have your eye on a Windows 10 laptop or a MacBook, there will be plenty of both sorts on sale soon (and in some cases, right now).</p>
      <p>We’ve collected the best deals from the biggest OEMs and retailers, and listed all of them below. Most of the biggest sales start on Black Friday, November 29th, but should a deal you might want to know about start earlier, we’ll be sure to note it.</p>

If you want this laptop, but for less, Best Buy will also be discounting the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-spectre-x360-2-in-1-15-6-4k-ultra-hd-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-512gb-ssd-32gb-optane-dark-ash-silver-sandblasted-anodized-finish%2F6364582.p%3FskuId%3D6364582&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574183830076eeb">HP Spectre x360 2-in-1 laptop (15.6-inch 4K display, Intel Core i7-10510U with a base clock speed of 1.8GHz, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD), which will be $1,099</a> (usually $1,599).</li>

It has a 10th Gen Intel Core i7-1065G7 with a base clock speed of 1.3GHz, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD. Beyond these acceptable specs, it’s a decent-looking machine for the price.</li>

      <h3>Microsoft Surface</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At the Microsoft Store, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergebf19%7Cxid:fr1574181598213iec&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-7%2F8N17J0M5ZZQS%3Fcrosssellid%3Ddrawer1%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D">the brand-new Surface Pro 7 (Intel Core i5-1035G4 with a base clock speed of 1.1GHz, 8GB RAM, 128GB storage) will be bundled with a black Type Cover (usually sold separately) and sold for $799</a> starting on Friday, November 22nd. This model is currently priced at $899 for the tablet alone, and since the Type Cover is all but necessary, it’s a great deal given how recently this product was released. <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-7-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-with-black-type-cover-latest-model-platinum%2F6374987.p%3FskuId%3D6374987&amp;subId1=xid:fr1574183830076dcb">You should know that Best Buy will also offer this deal, but on Black Friday</a>.</li>

        <li>The Microsoft Surface Go, the smallest Surface available, will be marked down by as much as $150 on November 28th at the Microsoft Store. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergebf19%7Cxid:fr1574181598213bid&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-go%2F8v9dp4lnknsz%3Ficid%3Dstore_bfreveal20_reveal_SurfaceGo_110119%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab">The cheapest configuration (Intel 4415Y processor with a 1.6GHz base clock speed, 4GB RAM, 64GB storage) will be $299</a>. This configuration won’t include a Type Cover, but if that’s a must for you, Microsoft has another Surface Go discount that does include one with purchase. On Black Friday, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergebf19&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fsurface-go%2F8v9dp4lnknsz%3Ficid%3Dstore_bfreveal20_reveal_SurfaceGo_110119%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab">Microsoft Store will offer a $180 discount on the Surface Go with double the RAM and storage, plus a Type Cover for $499</a>.</li>

That’s down from a sticker price of $1,149.</li>

At Costco, <a href="https://www.costco.com/dell-xps-13-touchscreen---10th-gen-intel-core-i7-10710u---4k-ultra-hd.product.100518572.html">Dell’s latest XPS 13 laptop (4K display, 10th Gen Intel Core i7-10710U with a 1.1GHz base clock speed, 16GB of RAM, 1TB SSD storage) will be $1,399</a> starting on Thanksgiving Day. The webcam is located at the top of the display on both of these laptops, and they each feature two Thunderbolt 3 ports. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/15961740/best-laptop-microsoft-windows-apple-macbook-hp-dell-lenovo">The XPS 13 is currently our top pick for best laptop</a>, so you should check either of these models out if you’re in the market for a compact, very capable machine.</li>

It also has Intel’s new 10th Gen Core i7-1065G7 with a base clock speed of 1.3GHz, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The updated specs, plus the ability to twist the screen around will cost you a premium, but might be worth it for your needs. My colleague Dan Seifert said that this model is “even better than the standard XPS 13” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958296/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-laptop-convertible-intel-ice-lake-review-test-price-specs-features">in his review</a>.</li>
