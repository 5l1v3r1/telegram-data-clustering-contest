      <p>Oppo wastes no time. The Oppo Reno series was presented for the first time in April followed by the Reno 2 series after a few months in August. Well, the Chinese manufacturer is already ready to launch the third generation. On the occasion of the debut of the new version of the user interface, ColorOS 7, the company announced that Oppo Reno 3 will debut in December. It will be the brandâ€™s first smartphone to support SA/NSA 5G dual-mode and arrive with the new UI.</p>
      <p>No other technical information has been revealed and we do not even know how many devices the future series will consist of. According to rumors leaked on the net, Reno 3 will have onboard the Qualcomm Snapdragon 735 which should feature a 7 nm production process and a 5G modem. An interesting feature that would help make the new network standard available even in the mid-market segment.</p>

      <h3>Oppo Reno 3 5G specifications</h3>
      <p>The SoC should be paired with 8 Gigabytes of RAM and 128 or 256GB of internal memory. The rumors speak of a 6.5-inch AMOLED display with Full-HD+ resolution and an integrated fingerprint sensor under the display. The photographic sector, on the other hand, should accommodate four sensors on the rear. The main sensor could be 60MP, coupled with a second 8MP one. The third one will be a 13MP sensor and the last one will have a 2MP. On the other hand, a 32MP camera is provided.</p>
      <p>In this regard, there is no reference to the shark fin mechanism. Which has become a distinctive feature of the Oppo Reno family. The phone will have a 4,500 mAh battery.</p>
      <p>Oppo Reno 3 will offer 5G support at a price that should not exceed $500. This is an aspect that could make the difference from a commercial perspective. For the moment, there is no information on arrival date on global markets, but <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Oppo">Oppo</a> could use the Mobile World Congress 2020 in Barcelona next February to announce the commercialization of Reno 3 in the Old Continent.</p>
