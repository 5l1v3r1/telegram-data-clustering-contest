      <h1>Glastonbury 2020: Organisers announce new glamping option for festival</h1>
      <h2>Sticklinch is home to yurts, bell tents and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:33:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> has announced a new glamping option which is perfect for those who aren't the keenest campers.</p>
      <p>Sticklinch will be located on the former site of the West Campervan Fields at the 2020 festival, which is the event's 50th anniversary.</p>
      <p>It will house pre-erected festival accommodation a short walk from the festival site including a range of podpads, yurts and bell tents, as well as a limited number of the festival's 'signature scout-style tents', and offers a more gentle walk to the festival than the existing Worthy View glamping site.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury organisers described the new campsite as 'unpretentious accommodation', adding it's perfect for those who would 'like to have a tent ready and waiting for them on arrival at the festival, and nothing to carry home but their bags'.</p>

      <p>The car park for Sticklinch is located in the adjacent field, a short walk away, but organisers encourage guests to travel by public transport where possible.</p>
      <p>Prices range from £325 for a two-person scout tent up to £1,150 for the six-person octopad, while a four-person yurt will set you back £850.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said Sticklinch is part of the festival's continued commitment to reducing waste.</p>
      <h3>How to book</h3>
