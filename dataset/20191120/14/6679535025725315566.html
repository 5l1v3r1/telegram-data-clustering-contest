      <h1>Seer yet to withdraw nomination papers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:27:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Lingayat seer, whose candidature as Janata Dal (Secular) nominee has been opposed by various religious heads and who is said to have decided to refrain from the contest under duress, is yet to withdraw his nomination papers.</p>
      <p>Sri Shivalinga Shivacharya Swami of Kabbinakanti Mutt went incommunicado after filing his nomination papers from the Hirekerur Assembly constituency, and as he was under pressure from religious heads, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy too had appealed to the seer to withdraw his resignation.</p>
      <p>Although the seer has communicated to his aides that he would withdraw from the contest, he has not come to the Election Officer to complete the process of withdrawal yet. But sources said that he would withdraw his nomination papers on Thursday, the last day for the withdrawal of nomination papers.</p>
      <h3>No withdrawals</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, according to an official press release issued by the Election Office, on Wednesday no candidate had withdrawn nomination papers from both Hirekerur and Ranebennur constituencies in Haveri district where the bypolls are scheduled.</p>
      <p>After scrutiny of nomination papers on Tuesday, 13 candidates remained in the fray in Ranebennur constituency. There were 14 candidates in Hirekerur Assembly constituency.</p>
      <p>During scrutiny, the nomination papers of Ashok Kumar Maruti Nayak, who had filed nomination papers as Congress candidate in Ranebennur constituency, were rejected as they were not accompanied by the B form from the party.</p>
      <p>The former Speaker K.B. Koliwad is the official Congress candidate in the constituency. And, in Hirekerur, the nomination papers of all the 14 candidates were accepted on Tuesday.</p>
