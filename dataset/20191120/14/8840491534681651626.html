      <p>THE Minister for Rural &amp; Community Development, Michael Ring, has confirmed approval of €405,123 to two regional sports projects in County Mayo under the 2019 Sports Capital Programme.</p>
      <p>Mayo GMIT Campus is getting €225,000 for an all-weather rugby playing facilities in Castlebar while €180,120 is going to Lake District Athletic Club, Ballinrobe, for an athletics track and facilities.</p>
      <p>Said Minister Ring: “The Sports Capital Programme is the most important way in which the government assists in the development and refurbishment of sporting facilities and in the purchase of non-personal sports equipment.”</p>
      <p>“The regional projects in Mayo being funded will provide better equipment and facilities for athletes to train and compete to the best of their ability.</p>
      <p>"The funding announced today follows on from the €1,143,493 approved to 36 local sports projects in Mayo last week.”</p>
