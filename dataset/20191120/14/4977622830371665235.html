      <p>In an embarrassing episode for the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, an advertisement carried by a well-known Hindi newspaper in the name of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee on the birthday of Chief Minister Kamal Nath included a number of points which showed the veteran Congress leader and his political history in a poor light, reports <i>The New Indian Express.</i></p>
      <p>“Even in 1993, there was talk of Kamal Nath becoming the Chief Minister. It is said Arjun Singh forwarded the name of Digvijaya Singh and Kamal Nath missed the post. Now after 25 years, he has got the chance to become the Chief Minister with support from Digvijaya Singh,” says one paragraph of the advertisement.</p>
      <p>Another paragraph indicates that Kamal Nath was able to start his political career in the party due to his sycophancy towards Sanjay Gandhi.</p>
      <p>While the Congress party has denied that it had published the said advertisement, the BJP has pointed towards factionalism in the former’s ranks as explaining the content of the advertisement.</p>
      <p>“The Congress should come clean and reveal which faction released it,” said BJP leader Narottam Mishra.</p>
