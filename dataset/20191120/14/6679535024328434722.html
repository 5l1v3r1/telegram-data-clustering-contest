      <p>Highly educated youth are joining the police force as constables and they should not harbour feelings of inferiority, Director-General of Police (CID) Praveen Sood said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He asked them to utilise the skills that they picked up in college and universities to improve their efficiency in policing and serve society better.</p>
      <p>“Your education will not only make you better policemen, but also will help you rise fast in the department,” he said at the passing out parade of Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP)trainees at the KSRP Training School in Kangrali village.</p>
      <p>“The government is giving focused training to recruits. But you should not forget that real training starts after you join service. Each day on the job is a learning opportunity,” he said.</p>
      <p>He asked the department to give enough leave to police personnel. The Additional Director-General of Police should initiate steps to ensure that personnel of the State Reserve Police force get enough leave. “I think they should get at least 12 days of casual leave a year,” he said. “Casual leave is an employee’s right. The department should ensure that the personnel’s rights are fulfilled,” he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, there were some differences in salary and service benefits and promotional avenues between KSRP and the Civil Police. But now, things have changed. There are no differences in service benefits, he said.</p>
      <p>As many as 165 trainees, including men and women constables, passed out of the school. The trainees presented a guard of honour. The guests presented trophies and certificates to winners of various competitions.</p>
      <p>KSRP Additional Director-General of Police Alok Kumar, Inspector-General of Police Raghavendra Suhas, Police Commissioner B.S. Lokesh Kumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police Seema Latkar, KSRP Training School principal Ramesh Borgave and Commandant Humza Hussain and others were present.</p>
