      <p>Youth centres are known for being important hubs in communities up and down the UK.</p>
      <p>They are a place where young people can meet and participate in a number of activities which often helps them keep off the streets.</p>
      <p>However, yesterday evening (November 19) <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-fire-and-rescue">Avon Fire and Rescue</a> were called to Lawrence Weston Youth Centre following reports of a fire at the youth centre.</p>
      <p>The fire service issued this statement: "At 19:47, crews from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avonmouth">Avonmouth</a> and Patchway were mobilised to reports of a fire on Long Cross in Lawrence Weston.</p>
      <p>"On arrival, crews found a wheelie bin and rubbish fire affecting the property.</p>
      <p>"Firefighters used one high pressure hose reel to extinguish the fire and a thermal imaging camera to check for hotspots.</p>
      <p>"They also used a positive pressure ventilation fan to check for hotspots. Police were also in attendance and the cause is thought to be deliberate."</p>
      <h3>A view from the community</h3>
      <p>David Matthews got in contact with us to tell us about the fire at the youth centre.</p>
      <p>In a message last night, he said: "Youths or bandits have attacked the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-weston">Lawrence Weston</a> Youth Centre. Fire and Rescue are currently on the scene battling flames at the rear. 4 police and 5 ambulances."</p>
      <p>We approached Mr Matthews for more information on the attack and he highlighted the wider social issues afflicting the Lawrence Weston area of Bristol.</p>

      <p>Mr Matthews works for Network Rail in Bristol and knows Mark Pepper, the owner of the Lawrence Weston Youth Centre.</p>
      <p>Mr Matthews told Bristol Live: "I saw Mark yesterday talking to police outside the club so went to check he was okay and honestly he looked fed up with all the antisocial problems our area has been having lately with youths.. he did look upset.</p>
      <p>"I haven't spoken to him today but I'm waiting to see if Ambition Lawrence Weston give an update on their Facebook page on the damage and whether the club will reopen or if repairs are needed."</p>
      <p>Mr Matthews went on to talk about the fire and police operation which took place at the youth centre last night.</p>
      <p>"At the time last night 20:10 when I was there no one knew the full extent of the damage, we all knew it was to the rear of the youth club.</p>
      <p>"We knew it was to the rear of the youth club, crews were seen inside the club with BA Sets on the roof checking it by the looks of it and I saw a positive pressure fan being used to ventilate the smoke.</p>
      <p>"Further that night the bus stop next to the club had been vandalised again (glass panels smashed)."</p>
      <h3>A community let down</h3>
      <p>Mr Matthews believes the community of Lawrence Weston has been let down by the authorities whose responsibility it is to look after the area.</p>
      <p>"These kids have no respect for the area, this isn't the first time it's happened either! It's ridiculous.</p>
      <p>"What's more annoying for us as a community is the question on all our minds...where is the police who are meant to keep Lawrence Weston safe?</p>
      <p>"I've lived here and Henbury for nearly 10 years and I've never seen antisocial behaviour this bad!</p>
      <p>"I was at the scene for the old long cross people's home house fire and that was kids who were 'bored' it's ridiculous, but at the same time parents of these kids need to discipline them!"</p>
      <h3>The police response</h3>
      <p>A police spokesperson issued this statement to <i>Bristol Live</i>: "We were called to reports of a fire at a youth centre in Lawrence Weston Road shortly before 8pm.</p>
      <p>"There was damage at the rear of the building and fire service have indicated the incident was deliberate.</p>
      <p>"Police enquiries into the incident are continuing. Anyone with information is asked to contact us quoting 5219268111."</p>
