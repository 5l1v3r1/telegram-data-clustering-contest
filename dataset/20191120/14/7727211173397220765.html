      <p>A controversial housing development has come under criticism again - after a crash involving a Redrow road sweeper and a car yesterday.</p>
      <p>Redrow is currently building almost 100 houses on land near Andrews Lane in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/formby">Formby</a> - and neighbours say they warned them it was 'an accident waiting to happen'.</p>
      <p>Prior to plans being given the go-ahead back in April 2018, those living in the area raised a number of concerns.</p>

      <p>There were fears the development on land near to Andrews Lane would mean the surrounding area would become more prone to flooding.</p>
      <p>And just days after builders moved on to the site <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/roads-residents-said-would-flood-14935001">the roads flooded</a> .</p>
      <p>At the time, Redrow said this was caused by a burst water main which had nothing to do with them.</p>
      <p>A week later, residents <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/fears-asbestos-being-dug-up-14952327">claimed asbestos was being dug</a> up at the site - something they also predicted would happen.</p>

      <p>Less than two months later, in September 2018, people living nearby said the proposed access road <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/road-new-housing-development-simply-15172178">"simply doesn't fit"</a> .</p>
      <p>And earlier this year, there were reports of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/residents-near-controversial-development-say-15825517">homes nearby trembling</a> because of ongoing construction works.</p>
      <p>One woman who lives on nearby Barton Heys Road told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> : "We said before plans were passed this was an accident waiting to happen.</p>
      <p>"The crash happened yesterday afternoon (Tuesday) at the junction of Andrews Lane and Elson Road.</p>
      <p>"As this happened at school letting out time, and scores of kids use this route to come home from the two nearby schools, this could have easily been a child. I'm just surprised it didn't happen sooner.</p>
      <p>"Not to mention that it's impossible to see out of the Andrews Lane/Barton Heys junction - and this Elson Road junction was supposed to be modified, according to the plans passed."</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> and Merseyside Fire Service confirmed they were called to the scene at around 3.10pm, and that nobody was injured.</p>
      <p>Craig Ward, technical director for Redrow Homes, said: “We are aware of a road traffic incident that took place yesterday on a public highway near to our development on Andrews Lane, but cannot comment on the circumstances pending any formal investigations.</p>
      <p>“Quite separately from this incident, we have already been in talks with the council regarding highway works at the junction of Andrews Lane and Elson Road, and will be finalising plans for the works in due course."</p>
