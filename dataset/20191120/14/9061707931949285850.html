      <h2>The elusive chocolate has been hard to find</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:07:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Noah Martin</a></address>
      <p>Chocolate Orange Twirls are still available to buy from a shop in Derby but the stock is running out.</p>
      <p>The limited edition treat has been spotted at the newsagent inside the King's Treatment Centre.</p>
      <p>Situated at the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/royal-derby-hospital">Royal Derby Hospital</a>, the shop had two half-full boxes left this morning (November 20).</p>
      <p>Staff at the shop, which is next to the Delimarché café, said the Twirls had been there "for a while".</p>
      <p>But, there were only around 15 bars remaining and those were the last of the stock.</p>
      <p>Other newsagent and convenience stores are still struggling to get a new delivery, so these may be the last Chocolate Orange Twirls in Derby.</p>
