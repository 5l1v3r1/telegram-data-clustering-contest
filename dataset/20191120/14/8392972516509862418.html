      <p>She wrote on Instagram: "Our beautiful mum passed away, a few weeks ago, peacefully in her sleep.</p>

      <p>The ex-Corrie actress - who played Sunita Alahan on the cobbles for five years until 2006, before returning again from 2009 to 2013 - admitted she has been left "completely heartbroken" by her mother's death, and said her mum "taught me such a lot".</p>
      <p>She added: "She did her very best and in the last 25 years I grew to know her as a person and the amazing woman that was our mum and for that circumstance and time I am truly grateful.</p>
      <p>"She taught me such a lot... but not how to live without her. Completely heartbroken (sic)"</p>

      <p>Shobna recently opened up about her mother's battle with vascular dementia, and admitted she wants to end the stigma around dementia.</p>
      <aside>Our beautiful mum passed away, a few weeks ago, peacefully in her sleep.</aside>
      <p>In a piece for <a href="https://www.dementiablog.org/every-day-every-hour-and-every-second-with-mum-is-different-shobna-gulati/">Alzheimer's Research UK's Dementia Blog</a>, she wrote: "Vascular dementia has definitely made Mum more socially isolated, and more and more of today's older generation is facing this future.</p>
      <p>"It's also isolating for carers, like me and my siblings.</p>
      <p>"In our community it's normal for everyone to know everyone else's business, it's a very social affair.</p>
      <p>"But when you're struggling to cover cracks in normal life, it can also create a real social pressure.</p>
      <p>"Talking about dementia, and the value of research, is vital. It's such an important way to break down these stigmas."</p>
