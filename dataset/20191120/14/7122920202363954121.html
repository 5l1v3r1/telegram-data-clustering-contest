      <h1>Create your own maps and stories in Google Earth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gopal Shah</a></address>
      <p>As humans, we've always bonded by sharing stories about the places that matter to us. It likely started around a campfire—elders recounting tales of sites sacred to their people. Today, we use technology to celebrate our ancestry, raise awareness about places we care about, and rekindle memories of home.</p>
      <p>For nearly 15 years, people have turned to Google Earth for a comprehensive view of our planet. But our mission has never been to just show you a static picture of the planet; we want to bring the world to life. With new creation tools now in Google Earth, you can turn our digital globe into your own storytelling canvas, and create a map or story about the places that matter to you.</p>

      <p>With creation tools in Google Earth, you can draw your own placemarks, lines and shapes, then attach your own custom text, images, and videos to these locations. You can organize your story into a narrative and collaborate with others. And when you’ve finished your story, you can share it with others. By clicking the new “Present” button, your audience will be able to fly from place to place in your custom-made Google Earth narrative.</p>

      <p>Two years ago when we <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/earth/welcome-home-new-google-earth/">rewrote</a> Google Earth for modern browsers and devices, we launched the <a href="http://g.co/earth/voyager">Voyager</a> program to start to infuse the globe with stories from the world's best storytellers. Today, we’re taking the next and most significant step forward: turning the power of mapmaking and storytelling over to you. </p>
      <p>Creation tools are now available in <a href="http://earth.google.com/web">Google Earth on web</a>. You can view your projects on mobile and tablet devices using the latest version of our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.earth&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> app. Thanks to an integration with Google Drive, you can share your stories with your audience and they can view it anywhere—their phone, tablet or laptop. Best of all, you can invite others to collaborate and co-author projects with you. </p>
      <p>Check out what you can do with the new creation tools:</p>
