      <p>ALBA Berlin will miss one more player as it was announced today by the club. Johannes Thiemann is out with a concussion and there’s no timetable yet for his return.</p>
      <p>According to the EuroLeague:<i> Despite a two-game winning streak, ALBA Berlin’s injury woes continue mounting with the announcement on Wednesday that center Johannes Thiemann will be out indefinitely with a concussion. Thiemann collided with Michael Ojo of <a href="https://www.eurohoops.net/basket/crvena-zvezda/?lang=en">Crvena Zvezda</a> mts Belgrade late in the third quarter of ALBA’s 93-80 home win on Tuesday. He suffered a broken tooth, as well. Thiemann also missed the season’s first three games due to injury, one of the many ALBA is going through at the moment. Among others, point guard Stefan Peno has yet to play this season; forward Tyler Cavanaugh is slated to miss about three months with an ankle injury, and guard Peyton Siva is out for two weeks with a left thigh injury.</i></p>
