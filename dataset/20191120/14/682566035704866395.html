      <p>Cape Town - There will be<b> five </b>South African golfers in the 50-man field at the European Tour's final event of the season, the <b>DP World Tour Championship</b> in Dubai.</p>
      <p><b>Louis Oosthuizen</b> is the top-ranked South African in the Race of Dubai standings at 9th after securing five Top 10 finishes on the European Tour including a T6 in Sun City this past weekend.</p>
      <p><b>Erik van Rooyen</b>, who is 10th on the Race to Dubai rankings, won his maiden title this season at the Scandinavian Invitation in August.</p>
      <p><b>Christiaan Bezuidenhout </b>(17th) also took home his maiden European Tour title in June's Andalucia Masters in Spain.</p>
      <p>Another South African to have won this season was 33-year-old <b>Justin Harding</b> (23rd) as he claimed the Qatar Masters title in March.</p>
      <p><b>Richard Sterne</b> (38th) has also played his way into the final event of the season after a decent season, which has seen the South African only miss four cuts in 19 events.</p>
      <p>None of the South Africans have any chance of topping the final Race to Dubai rankings.</p>
