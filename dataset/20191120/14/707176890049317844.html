      <h1>Merkel faces party revolt over Huawei’s role in German 5G rollout</h1>
      <h2>MPs dismayed that chancellor will not formally exclude Chinese group</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:37:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:37</time> by <a rel="author">Guy Chazan</a></address>
      <p>Angela Merkel is facing a rebellion in her party over the German government’s decision not to formally exclude <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f97731da-fa6f-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">Huawei</a> from the buildout of its next generation 5G telecoms network, amid rising concern in Berlin at potential security risks.</p>
      <p>MPs from Ms Merkel’s ruling Christian Democratic Union have put forward a motion for the party’s annual conference this week in Leipzig that would in effect ban the Chinese supplier from the 5G project.</p>
      <p>There is also pressure from inside Ms Merkel’s own cabinet to pursue a tougher line on Huawei. Foreign minister Heiko Maas said on Wednesday that when it came to the safety of critical infrastructure, Germany “cannot afford to ignore the political and legal realities that a supplier is subjected to”.</p>
      <p>Ms Merkel has refused to prohibit Huawei outright, insisting instead that all telecom equipment providers be <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7f5eba4-5d02-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a">allowed to take part</a> in the 5G rollout providing they meet certain tightened security standards.</p>
      <p>The chancellor has stuck to the approach despite<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/12e42a00-499b-11e9-8b7f-d49067e0f50d"> fierce pressure from the US</a> to shut out the Chinese group, which Washington says could be used by Beijing to conduct espionage or cyber sabotage.</p>
      <p>In March, the US ambassador to Berlin warned Ms Merkel that US authorities would consider scaling back intelligence co-operation should Huawei be given a role in 5G.</p>
      <p>The company has denied US claims that its technology poses a security risk.</p>
      <p>Ms Merkel reiterated her approach this week, saying the government had “reached a consensus that we need to improve the security level” of the mobile network — not by excluding individual companies but by raising security standards for all market participants. “That should be our benchmark,” she said.</p>
      <p>Officials in Berlin are concerned that an outright ban on Huawei could invite retaliation against German companies in China, which is Germany’s largest trading partner. Bilateral trade volume reached €199bn last year, a 6 per cent increase on 2017, while German investment in China rose from €30bn in 2010 to €81bn in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Germany underscored the risk for Berlin this week, saying any ban on Huawei that was “purely politically motivated” and “a result of foreign pressure” would have “an extremely negative effect on future economic co-operation between Germany and China”.</p>
      <p>The CDU motion calls on the government to present a bill to the Bundestag to clarify what telecoms equipment suppliers would have to demonstrate, in terms of their security and trustworthiness, to be allowed to take part in the 5G network buildout.</p>
      <p>“In this context, only those suppliers which are not under the influence of undemocratic states without functioning rule-of-law structures can be [deemed] trustworthy,” says the motion, which has been backed by at least 30 CDU MPs.</p>
      <p>It also calls on the government to enact a “transitional arrangement” to ensure that “no facts are created” by the 5G buildout “before parliament has made a decision on this matter”.</p>
      <p>The motion says the 5G network could form a “digital nervous system” for the German economy, society and security services. “For this reason, the safety of this network is of vital importance for the CDU . . . the party of security and law.”</p>
      <p>The CDU’s coalition partners, the left-of-centre Social Democrats, are also hardening their position on Huawei. In a policy paper signed by nine influential SPD MPs, the party said “non-trustworthy” equipment manufacturers suspected of “manipulation or espionage” or “interference” should be excluded from the 5G buildout.</p>
      <p>Ms Merkel is unlikely to change her stance on Huawei, stressing this week that the government had reached its decision to focus on tightening standards rather than banning individual companies “after careful consideration”.</p>
