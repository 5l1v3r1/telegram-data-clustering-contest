      <p>Samsung has kicked off the OneUI 2.0 Beta program for Galaxy Note 9 owners in South Korea. OneUI 2.0 is based on Android 10 and is currently under development for the recent Galaxy S and Galaxy Note devices.</p>
      <p>According to a recent post on <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B8/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C%EB%85%B8%ED%8A%B89-%EC%95%88%EB%93%9C%EB%A1%9C%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C-10-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8%EA%B0%80-%EC%8B%9C%EC%9E%91%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/2774868">Samsung Community</a> (<i>via <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-opens-one-ui-2-android-10-beta-galaxy-note-9-korea/">XDA Developers</a></i>) forum, the OneUI 2.0 Beta is now available for Galaxy Note 9 owners as well. OneUI 2.0 Beta will bring all the new features of Android 10 along with improvements to the overall stability of the device. Additionally, the update will also bring a system-wide dark mode along with Smart Lock Screen and Digital Wellbeing.</p>
      <p>The beta program is expected to extend to Galaxy S9 devices soon. Apart from that Samsung is also planning to extend it to a few other regions, including the US, Germany, Spain, France, the UK, and India. However, we don’t have an ETA or any other information on that at the moment.</p>
