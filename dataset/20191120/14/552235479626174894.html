      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-gets-top-celebrate-20920507">Lewis Capaldi</a> has been nominated for a Grammy after rising to the top of the charts in Britain and America.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old and his hit <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/lewis-capaldi-celebrates-someone-you-18296132">Someone You Loved</a> will face off against megastars Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift for Best Song at next year's prestigious music awards bash.</p>
      <p>Bathgate native Lewis was named on the short list for the top gong at the 62nd annual ceremony this morning. US rapper Childish Gambino took home the famous gong this year with This is America.</p>
      <p>Someone You Loved rose to the top of UK charts and stayed there for seven weeks before becoming 'America's Sweetheart' and landing him his first US No1 at the end of last month.</p>
      <p>His album "Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent" was also named best album in the UK during a stellar 2019.</p>

      <p>And his runaway success shows no signs of slowing down after he was tipped to scoop this year's Christmas No1.</p>
      <p>Odds on new ballad <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-gets-top-celebrate-20920507">Before You Go</a> grabbing the top spot fell from 12/1 to 3/1 less than 24 hours after his latest single was released.</p>
      <p>The Instagram joker celebrated yesterday's 5pm release in typically hilarious fashion by whipping off his top on social media.</p>
      <p>The bookies have hotly-tipped Robbie Williams (4/1) to come in second, with Coldplay in third place at 12/1.</p>
      <p>Late singer George Michael is rated 6/1 to finally get Last Christmas to the top spot, with the release of the film of the same name last week.</p>
      <p>And bookmakers have priced up the likelihood of Stormzy landing the number one spot (16/1) following the announcement of his new album Heavy is the Head.</p>
      <p>Also in the running is any Celebrity X Factor winner (8/1), Ed Sheeran (8/1), James Blunt (9/1), Little Mix (10/1) and the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey (10/1).</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Paddy Power said: “With the year he’s had, it’s only fitting that Lewis Capaldi is in the top spot for Christmas Number 1, and he was slashed into favourite with the release of his new song yesterday.</p>
      <p>“But plenty of punters still have Faith that George Michael could finally top the charts with Last Christmas – or could we see a grime winner, as Stormzy releases a new album in time for the festive period?”</p>
