      <p>Cape Town City have confirmed that one of their midfielders is expected to return to full training at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Chris David, who joined the Citizens in February this year, has made just 11 appearances in all competitions for the club, while also scoring two goals, this before being sidelined with a long-term injury.</p>

      <p>David's last appearance for the club dates as far back as August 10, when the Citizens locked horns with Stellenbosch FC in the first Western Cape derby of the season.</p>
      <p>He was thereafter left on the bench against Mamelodi Sundowns and Kaizer Chiefs and has been out with an injury until now.</p>
      <p>The Citizens have since confirmed that the 26-year-old is expected to return to first team training at the end of the month, after making a full recovery.</p>
      <p>“Chris David has been involved in light training and running sessions. He is expected return to full training at the end of the month,” City confirmed on their official Twitter account.</p>
