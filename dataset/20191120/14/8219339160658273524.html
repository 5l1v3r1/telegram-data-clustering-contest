      <blockquote>Welcome to the all-new Spark! Our team has put a tremendous effort to redesign Spark from scratch and bring the best email experience for professionals and their teams.<br/><br/>*** <b>Slick New Design</b> Spark now feels impressively smooth, effortless, yet super powerful to help you love your email again.<br/><br/>*** <b>Enjoy the stylish Dark Mode</b> We’ve carefully selected the colors to help you work better at night and save battery life. Select the Dark or a truly Black mode in Personalization settings &gt; Color Scheme.<br/><br/>*** <b>Inbox with Avatars</b> Now it’s a lot easier to breeze through your emails with people’s photos or company logos next to the emails. Turn them on/off in Spark Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Color Scheme.<br/><br/>*** <b>Customize Email Actions</b> Select which email actions are displayed at the bottom of an email to fit your personal Inbox workflow better and create the experience you love.<br/><br/>*** <b>Multiple windows support on iPad</b> Open two Spark windows side by side on your iPad. Why? You could open a long email on the left and compose a response on the right, without the need of going back and forth.<br/><br/>*** <b>Sync of contacts on all your devices</b> You can now label an email address as an important one on iPhone and it will be automatically defined as important on your Mac or iPad.<br/><br/>Beyond these major new features we’ve also included a handful of important bug fixes and enhancements:<br/><br/>– Fixed a rare but annoying issue with wrong email titles – Fixed a bug where some emails disappeared during the search – Fixed a problem with the incorrect name of video attachments – Fixed an issue with timestamp format – Fixed crash on watchOS 4 – Fixed incorrect email rendering for peculiar cases – Fixed the keyboard selection in the email lists – Improved email sync stability.<br/><br/>We hope you love this update as much as we’ve loved making it.
