      <p>Ramesh Jarkiholi, who joined the BJP after 35 years in the Congress, had interesting experiences during campaigning on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He visited the Jamia Masjid in Mamadapur village near Gokak and met Muslim community leaders who have been his long-term followers. Some of them told him that they were unhappy that he had joined the BJP.</p>
      <p>They said that across the country Sangh Parivar workers were engaged in intimidating and assaulting Muslim youth in the name of cow smuggling or other reasons and the BJP leaders were protecting them. He, however, told them that they had to believe in him and his leadership. “Don’t consider me as a BJP candidate. Please vote for me as Ramesh Jarkiholi and support me,” he said. He told them that he would not allow such incidents to happen in Gokak.</p>
      <p>In a meeting in Uppar Galli in Gokak, the leader asked voters to support the Congress. In a minute, he realised his mistake and said that he regretted the slip of tongue. He asked them to support the BJP and the crowd erupted in laughter.</p>
      <p>BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi campaigned for his brother in some places in Gokak on Wednesday. He addressed party workers and supporters at the Nayak Student Federation, a NGO run by the Jarkiholi family.</p>
      <p>He said that the BJP and the Congress cadre had merged. “Ramesh Jarkiholi’s hands are strengthened with workers from the Congress and the BJP in Gokak starting a joint campaign for him,” he said. He reiterated his statement that the brothers were united as a family, though they had political differences.</p>
