      <p>Caroline Flack was greeted at the airport by her toyboy beau Lewis Burton.</p>
      <p>The Love Island host, 40, had been in Capetown for 24 hours to shoot steamy scenes for promotion ahead of the new winter series in 2020.</p>
      <p>Lewis got himself boyfriend brownie points when he made a beeline to the airport so he could be reunited with his girlfriend as soon as she got off the flight.</p>
      <p>Caroline wasted no time in snapping pictures of her other half while they were stuck in traffic on the way back from the airport.</p>

      <p>Lewis looked less than impressed as he crossed his arms firmly across his chest.</p>
      <p>She wrote over the picture: "He should be the face of traffic 'Addison law'."</p>
      <p>Caroline loves her job and it shows because she was watching the Love Island reunion on her British Airways flight home.</p>

      <p>The Surjury star is used to flying back and forth from the UK to Mallorca for eight weeks over the summer while Love Island is on.</p>
      <p>But early next year, her schedule is about to get a whole lot busier.</p>
      <p>Love Island has launched its first ever winter series and Caroline signed on the dot to present the show.</p>
      <p>Instead, the winter version is set in Capetown which means the Love Island host will have to catch 13-hour flights to and from South Africa to the UK.</p>
      <p>However, it seems Caroline is prepared for the madness.</p>
      <p>She said: "24 hours in Capetown best time ever makes me so excited for next year."</p>
      <p>Caroline crossed paths with her boyfriend Lewis at the start of the summer after she wrapped up her stint on Love Island.</p>
      <p>The lovebirds even sparked engagement rumours in recent weeks but it seems the couple are happy just dating for now.</p>
