      <p>A new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> documentary has continued to unveil claims of mental and physical abuse at the hands of the leader of Bikram yoga.</p>
      <p>For years Bikram Choudhury has been accused by multiple women of sexual abuse and rape, with the creator of the cult-like fitness phenomena currently a fugitive in the US where he has refused to pay millions in a recent civil suit.</p>
      <p>Since 2013, six women have come forward to accuse the yogi of rape and sexual assault, including Jill Lawler, Sarah Baughn, Larissa Anderson, Maggie Genthner, Dana McLellan, and one who goes by Jane Doe #3.</p>

      <p>He’s settled four cases, without any criminal indictments or warrants issued. However, after fleeing the US, to this day he still continues to teach in Mexico and Spain.</p>
      <p>While the accusations are not new, with an in-depth coverage in ESPN’s 30 Under 30 podcast bringing many details to light, Eva Orner’s visual depiction in Netflix’s Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator, which began before the #MeToo movement, has detailed in-person accounts by some of his public accusers as well as numerous of his clients and Bikram teachers.</p>

      <p>Calling upon the stories of his former students and cult-like devotees, some of the documentary subjects were still incredibly praising of Bikram, who famously teaches his class only wearing a Rolex and a pair of black Speedos, while others recalled their own interactions with the Indian-born yoga guru.</p>
      <p>As the documentary leaves the glitzy introduction to Bikram’s fame in the 70s after reaching the US, Jakob Schanzer, a Bikram teacher who was taught by the yogi and taunted for his weight admitted he soon began noticing ‘red flags’ as he said: ‘This guy might not be mentally stable’.</p>

      <p>Footage then shows Bikram humiliating his students in front of hundreds of their contemporaries, while enforcing cruel rules on those who had paid upwards of $10,000 to learn the practice in order to obtain a license to teach.</p>
      <p>In one, he’s seen berating a student, calling one ‘b*tch’ and ‘chickensh*t’ as they attempted a pose.</p>

      <p>According to Jakob, he’d be told: ‘Make sure you’re hydrating… then the first thing he’d tell us “if you have a d*ck tie a string around your d*ck and if you have a p*ssy put a cork in your p*ssy because you’re not allowed to pee”.’</p>

      <p>He said after a man peed in a plastic water bottle in the corner, ‘Bikram is like, “oh see, he gets it”’.</p>
      <p>The documentary focuses on the story of Sarah Baughn and Larissa Anderson who brought sexual assault and rape accusations after learning from Bikram. Orner also speaks with Minakshi ‘Micki’ Jafa-Bodden, who served as Bikram’s Head of Legal and International Affairs from 2011 to March, 2013, when she claims she was ‘abruptly and unlawfully terminated’.</p>
      <p>She ended up winning a civil case against Bikram, and in January 2016, a jury awarded her $924,500 (£715,000) in actual damages while the jury also found that Bikram acted with malice, oppression and fraud and she was awarded an additional $6.4million (£4.9million) in punitive damages which she’s yet to receive a dime of after Bikram fled the country.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a very dystopian environment,’ Miki recalled of his seminars and nine-week teaching conferences.</p>
      <p>She claimed the ‘colour green was banned’ and even though the very purpose of the yoga practice is to be sweltering in 35-42 degree heat he ‘has a personal air conditioner blowing cold air to the back of his head’.</p>

      <p>As more revelations came to light with archival interviews with Bikram – who declined to be interviewed for the documentary – he claimed he sleeps ‘not even 30 hours a month’, with many of his students called to his room at all hours for ‘massages’. In a 2015 deposition, he was seen saying his four dislikes: ‘Cold weather, cold good, cold heart and cold p*ssy.’</p>

      <p>Sarah claimed she hadn’t been at the conference for four days when he called her out of class and said ‘what are we going to do about us? Should we make this a relationship?’</p>
      <p>She then claimed during a pose in the class he approached her and tried to help her into a deeper position, which wasn’t unusual, however she claimed he ‘pushed himself against her and whispered in her ear’.</p>
      <p>‘I’m split in half, with my heart dropping down real low, so emotionally I just broke, and I had to stand up and as soon as I did, he continued the class’, she said, claiming she then went to a senior staffer the next day.</p>
      <p>Larissa accused the yogi of raping her when she was staying at his home, with his wife and two children sleeping upstairs.</p>
      <p>Bikram has denied all the accusations against him, once saying: ‘It’s not truth. I don’t do that.</p>
      <p>‘If I want to have sex with the women, I don’t need to attack them or rape them or abuse them or assault them. There’ll be a line of millions of women in the world as a volunteer.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The cult-like stance of the yoga and Bikram himself is exemplified in the final comment from Patrice Simon, who said the only reason she was doing the interview was because Bikram yoga ‘is magical’ and she’ll never stop practicing it.</p>
      <p>‘I’m happy he’s still doing his teacher training,’ she smiled. ‘For some reason, I get the feeling he’s going to make a comeback.’</p>
