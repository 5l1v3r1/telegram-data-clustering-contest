      <h1>‘Tangled’ Honest Trailer: The One with Half an Album of Alan Menken’s B-Sides No One Remembers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/ethan-anderton/" target="_blank">Ethan Anderton</a></address>
      <p>Following the box office performance of <i>The Princess and the Frog</i> (which was only seen as a disappointment thanks to Avatar stealing all of the attention), Walt Disney Animation Studios decided to abandon traditional 2D animation and charge into the computer animated arena with a new take on Rapunzel. However, eager to move away from the Disney princess moniker that didn’t appeal to boys as much, they called the movie <b><i>Tangled</i></b>, and it was the beginning of a whole new creative era for Disney.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, since <i>Tangled</i> was the first, it wasn’t quite as polished as the movies that would follow, like <i>Frozen</i> and <i>Moana</i>. In fact, while some of the characters and writing might be a little more clever in some respects, as the <i>Tangled</i> <b>Honest Trailer</b> will point out, the soundtrack isn’t exactly full of the most memorable tunes, even with music composed by Disney legend Alan Menken.</p>

      <p>Honestly, I completely forgot about the fact that Flynn Rider had a rivalry with a horse in this movie. That’s actually really funny, and it’s one of the things that made Tangled stand out more than your average Disney fairytale. Having Mandy Moore as a feisty but sheltered leading lady certainly helped too, even if they traded out Rapunzel’s golden locks for a brunette Starbucks Mom haircut in the end.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, even if <i>Tangled</i> doesn’t succeed in every regard, it’s certainly responsible for reinvigorating the creative side of Disney Animation, and it would pave the way for much more success at the box office.</p>
