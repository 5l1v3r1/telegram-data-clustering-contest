        <b>Martin O’Neill has spoken about the dynamic between himself and former assistant manager Roy Keane as well as his memories of the ex-Manchester United man during his time as the club’s captain.</b>
      </p>
      <p>O’Neill and Keane worked together for almost six years, first as a duo with the Irish national team where they helped the Boys in Green qualify for Euro 2016, before moving on to Nottingham Forest in 2019.</p>
      <p>The pair have been out of management <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/nottingham-forest-martin-oneill/">since leaving the Championship club in June of this yea</a>r and O’Neill was a guest on Eamonn Holmes’ <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/eamonnandthegaffers/2cda3375-fe10-4c20-856c-a4852acef821">‘A Pint With Eamonn’</a> podcast earlier this week.</p>

      <p>He spoke about how he and Keane would operate in the dressing room outlining that he would always speak first before letting the former United captain or other players discuss whatever else was required.</p>
      <p>“I speak. I am the manager. That is very important. Once I have spoken, I think you should allow it to settle down. Then if there are little points players want to make or the assistant manager, in the case of Roy, wants to make, fine.</p>
      <p>“But he is not ripping into players immediately because if that is the case, I might as well make myself redundant.”</p>
      <p>O’Neill has been in the game for almost 50 years as both a player and a manager and has seen it change significantly since his early days, and he was quizzed as to whether he feels modern football lacks leaders.</p>

      <p>“When Roy Keane and ex-players of that ilk talk about there being no leaders in the game it’s a funny thing,” he began.</p>
      <p>“You can have different styles of captain; you can have a ranter or a raver of a captain, you can have someone who does it by example, or you might have a combination of both.</p>
      <p>“Roy Keane probably was that. You need a captain to be one of your fine players. Roy Keane drove Manchester United on for ten years. ”</p>
      <p>O’Neill also told a story highlighting Keane’s leadership style, taking one particular game between his Leicester City side and Manchester United as an example.</p>

      <p>“I remember when I was managing Leicester at Filbert Street against Manchester United and within six minutes he had bawled out both David Beckham and Gary Neville, mind you I was quite glad to hear Gary Neville getting it.</p>
      <blockquote>“But after six minutes of a game? They had hardly even touched the ball?!”</blockquote>
