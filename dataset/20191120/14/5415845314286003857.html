      <h1>Arsenal: Don’t worry, no one that matters wants to leave</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are concerned by the sheer magnitude of players seeking January or summer exits, but ask yourself if they really matter and you’ll like the answer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>I just wrote an article a couple days ago about how many <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> players are linked to an exit, and now we’re all talking about how worrisome that is. How does a club keep their head above water if five, six, ten people all leave at once?</p>
      <p>Well, let’s start with the basics—we are not going to lose <i>that</i> many players. And, moving on from there, just because they are rumored to be considering an exit doesn’t mean they actually want to leave. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/f874dd44/Hector-Bellerin?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Hector Bellerin</a> and <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/2628fd2b/Bernd-Leno?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Bernd Leno</a>, for instance, have given us no reason to think that they want to leave. But that won’t stop other clubs from sniffing around.</p>
      <p>More than that, look at the players most likely to leave the club. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/e61b8aee/Granit-Xhaka?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Granit Xhaka</a>? I’ll be heartbroken, but I know most of you won’t be. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/16380240/Mesut-Ozil?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mesut Ozil</a>? It’s long overdue. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/52611641/Lucas-Torreira?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Lucas Torreira</a>? A bummer, and a missed opportunity, but depending on the profit, it’s not like we’re using him anyway.</p>
      <p>These are the big three that look to be on the out, but there’s also rumors of more. But even looking at those three, who is essential personnel? I’m not asking myself that question or you all wouldn’t like the answer, but think about it.</p>
      <p>And anyone else who leaves? Non-essential. No one who leaves is essential. We don’t want them at the club anyway. If <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d5dd5f1f/Pierre-Emerick-Aubameyang?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> leaves, good riddance. <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/9dbb75ca/Alexandre-Lacazette?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Alexandre Lacazette</a> will take over and be the superstar he is.</p>
      <p>If <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/c0617e2b/Dani-Ceballos?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Dani Ceballos</a> leaves? We’ll try another creative option. We’ve tried so many recently, what’s one more?</p>
      <p>And what if Hector Bellerin does leave? We have <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/e3a5814e/Ainsley-Maitland-Niles?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Ainsley Maitland-Niles</a>, a very capable <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/dc6f5bdd/Calum-Chambers?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Calum Chambers</a>, and it’s not like Unai Emery and the honchos have shied away from investments recently. Bernd Leno? Same deal. We will replace if necessary, or we will extend an opportunity down the pipeline.</p>
      <p>The only kinds of people I would struggle over losing (other than you know who) are the likes of <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/5ea8ef20/Matteo-Guendouzi?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Matteo Guendouzi</a>, <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/bc7dc64d/Bukayo-Saka?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Bukayo Saka</a>, Gabriel Martinelli, etc. but these are all guys who are happy with their opportunities and young enough to know how to be grateful.</p>
      <p>Don’t fret. Whoever leaves, we will replace. If it’s even necessary too. And whoever stays we will support. Until the boo birds get tired of them.</p>
