      <p><b>LOS ANGELES —</b> Jordan Morris and teenager Josh Sargent scored two goals apiece as the United States eased into the final four of the CONCACAF Nations League on Tuesday with a 4-0 win over Cuba.<br/><br/>Seattle Sounders forward Morris struck twice in the first half as manager Gregg Berhalter's side bagged three points to finish top of Group A, ahead of Canada on goal difference.<br/><br/>Werder Bremen's 19-year-old striker Sargent bagged the other goals in a game played at George Town's Truman Bodden Stadium in the Cayman Islands after Cuba's proposed home venue failed to meet CONCACAF standards.<br/><br/>The US had put themselves in the driving seat to qualify after a comprehensive 4-1 defeat of Canada on Friday.<br/><br/>Needing only a win to advance against a Cuban side they had already beaten 7-0 earlier in the qualifiers, the US wasted no time in taking the lead when Sargent bundled in the opener after just 34 seconds.<br/><br/>Despite relentless US pressure however, Berhalter's side were made to wait until the 26th minute before they doubled their lead.<br/><br/>A flicked header by Schalke 04's Weston McKennie found Morris unmarked inside the penalty area and the Seattle man made no mistake with a cool finish past Cuba goalkeeper Sandy Sanchez.<br/><br/>Morris was then on target again six minutes before half-time, tapping in Aaron Long's goal-bound cross to effectively seal the outcome.<br/><br/>Sargent then grabbed his second of the night in the 66th minute, rifling home a low shot after Tyler Boyd's assist.<br/><br/>The US will now face Honduras in the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Nations League next June, with Mexico and Costa Rica meeting in the other half of the draw. — AFP</p>
