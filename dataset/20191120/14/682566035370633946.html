      <p>Cape Town - The <b>Springboks</b> will play <b>Scotland </b>and <b>Georgia</b> in home Tests in July 2020, SA Rugby confirmed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The world champions will play two Tests against the Scots - on July 4 and 11 - before facing Georgia the following weekend on July 18.</p>
      <p>The venues and kick-off times will be announced at a later stage, SA Rugby said via a press statement.</p>
      <p>It will be Scotland's first visit to South Africa since June 2014, when they were thumped 55-6 by the Boks in Port Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Overall, the Springboks have won 22 Tests against Scotland and lost five.</p>
      <p>South Africa and Georgia have met only once before - at the 2003 Rugby World Cup when the Boks won 46-19 in Sydney.</p>
      <p>The Springboks currently top the World Rugby rankings, while Scotland are ninth and Georgia 14th.</p>
