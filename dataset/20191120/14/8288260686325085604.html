      <h3>What can we expect at Birmingham Music Awards 2020?</h3>
      <p> <b><br/></b>Jo said “At our last ceremony, the incredible band KIOKO were spotted by UB40 and invited to join them on a huge tour. They’ll be performing at the press launch on Wednesday 20th November fresh from their trip.” <br/>“The amazing quartet Riscas will also be performing for us as well.” <br/>Jo remains determined to steer the spotlight from the capital city onto the wealth of talent in Birmingham. <br/>“We need events like this in Birmingham because people are prone to either quitting or moving to London. There are no big labels or publishers over here.”</p>
      <h3>Trending Talent</h3>
      <p>Jo is a big fan of Birmingham's musical talent praises a host of bands including:</p>
      <p>Flares - Birmingham based indie rock band quartet</p>
      <p>North Parade - Indie Alt-pop 4-piece from Birmingham</p>
      <p>MC T.Roadz - 13-year-old spitter from Birmingham</p>
      <p>The Clause - Alternative indie group born in Birmingham</p>
      <p>Mahalia - 21-year-old soul singer</p>

      <h3>Events in Birmingham’s music scene</h3>
      <p>The founder of BMA also recommends a host of events coming to the city over the coming months.</p>
      <p>5th December, BIMM Birmingham’s end of term gig - she says is “always awesome platforms for new talent; we love working with the students at BIMM and seeing what they can do.”</p>
      <p>18th December, BMA Music Network London - this is Christmas party at Mama Roux in which “The Brum music community comes together for one massive festive jolly, dressing for the part and networking.”</p>
      <p>January 2020, Discover Birmingham 2020 - she says this initiative throughout January at the sunflower lounge will “exhibit the very best emerging talent from across the Midlands.”</p>
      <h3>Changes UK and other sponsors</h3>
      <p>Jo has also ensured to incorporate the work of  ‘Changes UK’ into the event. Identifying themes of addiction and mental health issues in music, she’s determined to make a change.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the charity she added “I came across it three years ago, the work they do is astounding. They work to recapture people’s identities and even rehouse them.”</p>
      <p>There will also be a corporate presence at the show, with the likes of Tileyard Music and CD Baby set to return as well. <br/><br/><i>Birmingham Music Awards 2020 launch on Wednesday 20th November. For more information <a href="https://birminghammusicawards.com/">click here</a></i></p>
