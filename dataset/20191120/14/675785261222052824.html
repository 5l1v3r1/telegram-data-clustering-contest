      <h2>Tory leader Boris Johnson was caught on the hoof by a factory worker who skewered him with a question on tax cuts for people like him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:15:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson spoiled his own manifesto launch by accidentally blurting out a major policy announcement days early.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader appeared to be caught off guard by a factory worker asking if he was only planning tax cuts for people like him.</p>
      <p>As he took questions from workers at the Teesside factory, one worker asked: "You just said low tax. Do you mean low tax for people like you or low tax for people like us."</p>
      <p>On the hoof, Mr Johnson appeared to confirm he plans to increase the threshold for paying National Insurance from £8,632 to more than £12,000.</p>
      <p>He said: "I mean low tax for people of the working people."</p>
      <p>He added: "And if you look at what we're doing and what I've said in the last few days, we're going to be cutting national insurance up to £12,000, we're going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses, we are cutting tax for working people."</p>

      <p>The Institute for Fiscal studies estimates the policy move would cost £10bn.</p>
      <p>The policy had been rumoured to be a major plank of the party's manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson's interviews with broadcasters, scheduled for after the event, were delayed while top Tories scrambled to decide what to do.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader went on to make an unfounded claim <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> policies would result in a tax increase for working people.</p>
      <p>Labour say their manifesto, to be launched tomorrow, will be fully costed - and will only increase taxes on the top 1% of earners.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson added: "Labour's policies inevitably lead - they always say they're going to point the fingers at billionaires or whatever - and in the end it's everybody who pays."</p>
      <p>He was also challenged to guarantee he would never sell off the NHS, to which he replied: "I can - and I was amazed by what (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>) had to say. It's a complete invention."</p>
