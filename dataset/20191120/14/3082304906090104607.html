        <b>Luke Shaw, Axel Tuanzebe and Nemanja Matic are all nearing a return to action as Manchester United prepare for Sheffield United.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester United have been boosted by the return of trio Luke Shaw, Axel Tuanzebe and Nemanja Matic to full training.</p>
      <p>United visit Sheffield United on Sunday following the international break, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men chase back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March.</p>
      <p>The return of first-choice left-back Shaw comes as a big boost, the England international having been out with a hamstring injury since August.</p>
      <p>Tuanzebe was one of the players tasked with filling the void on the left side of the defence but he too is only now back in the frame after a hip injury forced him out of the warm-up before the match against Liverpool last month.</p>
      <p>Teenage defender Brandon Williams has impressed at left-back in the meantime.</p>
      <p>United could also soon have Matic back involved. He has not played since the start of October but rejoins the fold as midfield colleague Scott McTominay battles an ankle issue.</p>
