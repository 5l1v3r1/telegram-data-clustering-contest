      <h2>Congress, JD(S) leaders target A.H. Vishwanath for his ‘betrayal’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:20:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Campaigning for the Hunsur by-elections gained traction on Wednesday with the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) leaders making a foray into the constituency where the BJP leaders have already pitched their camp.</p>
      <p>The constituency witnessed high decibel campaigning and the Congress was led by the Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah while the JD(S) was led by the party supremo and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy.</p>
      <p>The disqualified MLA, A.H.Vishwanath, who is contesting on a BJP ticket was the common target as both the Congress and the JD(S) leaders have vowed to ensure the defeat of the defectors which brought the Kumaraswamy-led coalition government down.</p>
      <p>Mr. Vishwanath’s defection was highlighted by Mr. Kumaraswamy during his campaign speech. “Mr. Vishwanth entered the JD(S) fold as he was sidelined in the Congress. Not only did he receive a party post but was elected from the constituency which saved him from political oblivion. Yet, he has betrayed us by defecting’’, said Mr. Kumaraswamy.</p>
      <p>Addressing people at Ramenahalli, Mr.Kumaraswamy said ensuring the defeat of the disqualified MLAs seeking a re-election was their goal and this election will prove the “prowess of the JD(S).”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kumaraswamy said the JD(S) had planned its own strategies for the by-elections and opined that the fall of the BJP government in Karnataka was imminent after the announcement of the results.</p>
      <p>He took exception to the recent statements of Mr. Vishwanath that the coalition government was demonic in nature. “He should speak in a manner that behove his age. For his act of betrayal the people of the constituency would teach him a befitting lesson’’, said Mr. Kumaraswamy.</p>
      <p>Mr. Siddaramaiah had a schedule of 16 campaign rallies including Chinnasoge, Hanagodu, B.R.Kaval, and Mallianthapura in the constituency and the crux of the campaign speech revolved around the ‘betrayal’ by Mr. Vishwanath and “lack of governance” by the BJP government in the State. He launched a diatribe against the BJP and described it as a ‘fascist’ party. Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to remind the voters that Mr. Vishwanath was a “party hopper’’.</p>
      <p>The BJP too has deployed its leaders some of whom are in the constituency since the last two days. Mr. Vishwanath has vowed in his speeches to ensure development of Hunsur by upgrading its status to that of a district by hiving it off from Mysuru.</p>
      <p>The Congress has fielded former MLA Manjunath while the JD(S) has placed its hopes on Somashekar.</p>
