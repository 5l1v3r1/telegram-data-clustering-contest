      <p>The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) said its officers would be out in full force on the roads this festive season.</p>
      <p>JMPD chief David Tembe was speaking during the city’s monthly crime stats briefing earlier on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Johannesburg metro police will introduce special measures to deal with traffic offenders during the festive season.</p>
      <p>Tember has issued a stern warning to motorists.</p>
      <p>“Those who will be speeding, I’ve got 330i BMWs and they’ve got number plates recognition. On the freeway, there’ll be 80 of them.”</p>
      <p>He said they would also introduce cops on bikes.</p>
      <p>“I’m looking at people who are drinking on our parks because sometimes they end up committing crimes. That unit is about 30 officers.”</p>
      <p>He said he was also in talks with the Durban metro police to introduce blue light vehicles every 20 kilometres on the N3 between Durban and Johannesburg.</p>
