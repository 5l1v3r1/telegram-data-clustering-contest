      <h1>Paul Finebaum Has Already Eliminated A Conference From The CFB Playoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:28:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the College Football Playoff committee <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">released its new rankings</a> following another weekend of games.</p>
      <p>Two undefeated teams went down as Minnesota and Baylor fell to Iowa and Oklahoma respectively.</p>
      <p>The latter may have eliminated a conference from the playoff. ESPN’s Paul Finebaum has already eliminated the Big 12 from the playoff after the conference’s top team came in at No. 10.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma made an epic comeback against Baylor, but Finebaum thinks it was in vain.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Oklahoma-Sooners-college-footbal-playoff-Jalen-Hurts-Paul-Finebaum-eliminated-Baylor-Bears-138897682/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I know I’m occasionally guilty of pronouncing people dead without having a medical license and taking (them) out before I should … I did that a couple weeks ago with Oregon, but I don’t think there’s any way the Big 12 makes the Playoff. They shouldn’t have lost to Kansas State.<br/><br/>“They shouldn’t have fallen behind, but even coming back they probably eliminated Baylor, which may have had a better path since they were unbeaten until last week. Once again, bye bye Big 12, we’ll see you next year. Everybody wants to say the Big 12 is great, but if you look at Oklahoma’s resume, it’s not all that great.”</blockquote>
      <p>He’s not wrong.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma faces TCU and Oklahoma State in the final two weeks of the regular season before a potential Big 12 title game appearance. The Sooners could be on the outside looking in unless they get some help down the stretch.</p>
