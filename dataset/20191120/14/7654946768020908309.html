      <p>A 5-year-old girl was reportedly left with an inch-wide hole in her throat after she fell off her bed with a toothbrush in her mouth, according to her distressed dad, who is warning other parents in the wake of the frightening accident.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Gravenmier, 27, of Utah said that just before he was preparing to put his two kids, Celeste and 2-year-old Matthew, to bed, they were bouncing around on the bed while brushing their teeth.</p>
      <p>Gravenmier told his kids to stop jumping and when he turned his back for a few seconds to talk to his wife, Victoria, 25, the accident occurred.</p>
      <p>Celeste yelled and blood poured out of the tot’s mouth.</p>
      <p>“She stood up screaming and I looked in her mouth and could see there was a bit of blood around it,” Gravenmier said, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dads-horror-girl-5-punctures-20913571">according to UK’s The Mirror</a>. “At first I didn’t realize that she’d actually poked a hole in the back of her mouth, in her throat.”</p>
      <p>When Gravenmier shined a flashlight into his daughter’s mouth, he found “a very large hole,” adding, “It was close to an inch.”</p>
      <p>“We’re just glad [the toothbrush] didn’t go down her throat. [Doctors] said if it was any further to the sides, it could have severed a blood vessel and caused more significant bleeding,” Gravenmier said, according to the news outlet.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, Gravenmier rushed his daughter to the hospital, where she had an emergency two-hour surgery to close up the wound.</p>
      <p>“She was crying at the time because her mouth quickly filled with blood,” the dad said.</p>

      <p>The injured tot is now recovering at home with her family and will be on a soft food and liquid diet for the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to be more strict on the kids now as Matthew is also very energetic. We don’t take our eyes off them until they’re done brushing their teeth,” Gravenmier said, according to the news outlet.</p>
      <p>He added that his daughter is “very nervous now about brushing her teeth.”</p>
      <p>Gravenmier issued a warning to other parents about the incident, saying: “Everyone is told not to run around with things in their mouth, but they don’t see what the result of it [can be].”</p>
      <p>“This is something that could happen to any child so quickly,” he said.</p>
