        <b>Graham, I feel like it's a bit like Groundhog Day, as, like we said after the Swindon game, you got there in the end and did what you needed to do.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah, we did. We came here with a game plan. We showed character and heart and desire. Yes, we didn't bring our quality with us but we brought our hearts and desire. We got into the next round of the cup and that's what we asked the lads to do. We ask them to respond, obviously when we don't win games, and over the last four games they have really responded.</p>
      <p>Yes, we possibly in a month where we don't play well. There's always a month in a season where you don't play well and we're possibly in the midst of it. We've left our quality on the bus, obviously, but we brought our hearts and that was enough to get us through to the next round, which is what we came here to do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You got through to the next round but you said pre-match you wanted to see improvements - are you seeing these improvements?</b>

      <p>I'm seeing massive heart, I'm seeing massive desire, I'm seeing massive character. I'm seeing the boys going in the trenches week in, week out. You're not going to play well every game, we've not played well for maybe the last two or three games, but we've progressed through to the next round of both cups.</p>
      <p>I would take progress and into the next round of both cups over performances. Performances thus far have been very good and have got us a point outside the play-offs and into the next round of the EFL Trophy and got us into the next round of the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>We are getting there, slowly but surely. When we play well, we might not win a game, so let's just take the result, take the enjoyment and put a smile on our face. I think that's only the second time this club has got to the second round in I think 11 years, one of the reporters said before the first Bromley game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rollin Menayese collected the man of the match award, his opportunity has opened up in the last couple of games. What have you made of his performances?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I thought Rollin has been very positive. The easy thing with the young lads is to send them out on loan but I like coaching, I like getting on the grass with the lads and just educating and coaching them up to the way we are and the way we want to be. You send them out on loan and they're out of sight and out of mind, so I like holding onto the ones that are on the fringes of the first team.</p>
      <p>Rollin has been able to show us and remind us tonight that he's still here and still part of our plans.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jonson Clarke-Harris got the goal, how important was it to score early and silence the fans?</b>
      </p>

      <p>We had that with them, I said that to them. Early starts, we need to get out of the blocks, because, let's be honest, we didn't play particularly well at home. We should have won and seen the game through but we didn't. We took a lot of pressure tonight, there were a lot of throw-ins and a lot of corners, we knew we were going to come under pressure but once again I have to take my hat off to the lads.</p>
      <p>I do wish they'd make it a little bit easier on me on the sidelines. I keep saying I'm seeking perfection, does perfection exist? I would much rather have progression in the cups than performances. Sometimes you play well in the cups and don't progress, sometimes you don't get what you deserve.</p>
      <p>I think we deserved to get through to the next round of the EFL Trophy and we're in the next round of the FA Cup. Now we've got to get our heads and refocus and go again on Saturday in the league.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How important is it to get through in the cup financially?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's been a very positive couple of weeks, being on the telly and getting through to the next round of the EFL Trophy. Finances aren't my issue, I'm not a financial man - I never have been and I never will.</p>
      <p>It's those lads upstairs that are probably best to judge but I'm just hoping that progression that we've made, the game on the telly, games being moved to a Sunday, I just hope that the kitty is building and we may be able to do a player or two in January.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Any thoughts on their goal? Apparently it was onside but ruled offside.</b>
      </p>
      <p>I've not seen it back to be honest. If the referee has given it offside, referees have given us offside so many times this season, so if it's gone in our favour then I'll take it and accept it no problem because I'm pretty sure it's swings and roundabouts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plenty of long balls into the box from Bromley tonight, but I thought Jordi in particular coped well with them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He did. That's why we put Rollin, Alfie and Tony in, we had to try to be big, strong and manful as they were sticking balls in from all over the park, it was just an onslaught at times. I use the word warriors, as we had warriors tonight, they were sticking their head on the ball, clearing from the box, putting in last-ditch tackles and blocks. It was always going to be like that.</p>
      <p>Ed Upson didn't play tonight and we knew from the surface that it wasn't going to be pretty. We knew exactly what we were getting into but the lads stood up and responded really, really well to be fair.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What did you make of the surface?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was difficult. I'm just delighted we've got out of here with a victory and no significant injuries. Look at Pompey at Harrogate a couple of weeks ago, they had two players go off with muscular injuries and could be out for a period of time. So I was delighted when we came off the pitch with no serious injuries, all in tact and in the next round of the cup. All in all, I have to be pleased and jubilant tonight.</p>
