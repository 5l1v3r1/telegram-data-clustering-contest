      <p>BTS will not be exempt from mandatory military service despite the guidelines being revamped, the Korean culture minister has said.</p>
      <p>Bad news for ARMYs everywhere.</p>
      <p>While it’s mandatory for able-bodied young men in South Korea to undertake military service, there has previously been an exception for global award-winning athletes and classical musicians.</p>
      <p>However, it seems it’s not going to be possible for the K-Pop heroes – especially since the guidelines are being altered to make them more fair.</p>
      <p>‘In the case of BTS, I personally wish I could allow exemptions for them under certain standards, but the Military Manpower Administration and the Ministry of National Defense [in charge of conscription] are inclined to downsize the overall scope [of exemption],’ Culture Minister Park Yang-woo said, according <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20191120008000315">to Yonhap News.</a></p>

      <p>He added: ‘Unlike classical arts or sports, it is difficult to fix the criteria of the selection in the popular culture and arts fields, which makes it difficult to institutionalise [a waiver system].’</p>
      <p>The eldest member of BTS, Jin, will be required to enlist by the end of 2020, when he turns 28.</p>
      <p>However, it doesn’t seem like a disastrous result for the boys, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/bts-star-rm-admits-feels-pressure-perfect-part-life-11183754/">who recently spoke out about the pressure to be perfect</a>, as Jin previously told CBS that they’re fully prepared to be called up.</p>
      <p>‘As a Korean, it’s natural, and someday, when duty calls we’ll be ready to respond and do our best,’ he said.</p>

      <p>And hopefully they’re getting some inspiration from fellow K-Pop star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/big-bangs-g-dragon-marks-end-military-service-string-emotional-photos-11005013/">Big Bang’s G-Dragon, who recently returned from serving.</a></p>
      <p>The star was officially discharged from his mandatory service on 26 October.</p>
      <p>After G-Dragon completed his service, almost 3000 fans waited to see him as he stepped out in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.</p>
      <p>In his uniform, he bowed and said: ‘I’ve returned after completing my military service. Thank you for waiting for me and for coming to see me today.</p>
      <p>‘I will be returning to my original occupation, and I will work hard.’</p>
