      <p>Super Eagles star Victor Osimhen must be focussed on his game instead of trying to match Rashidi Yekini’s records, says a former international Victor Ikpeba.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Osimhen has been in a rich form for the West Africans lately, scoring four goals in four matches.</p>
      <p>The former U-17 World Cup winner scored twice as <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/17/nigeria-come-from-behind-to-maul-lesotho-4-2/">Nigeria mauled Lesotho 2-4</a> in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers last weekend.</p>
      <p>Before then, he got a goal as <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/13/afcon-qualifiers-nigeria-defeat-benin-republic-2-1/">Nigeria saw off the Benin Republic 2-1</a> in Uyo last week.</p>
      <p>Also, he has notched up nine strikes for Lille in seven matches in France but Ikpeba has advised him not to be carried away.</p>
      <p>Ikpeba who represented Nigeria in the 1998 world Cup believed it would be too early for the youngster to start comparing himself with Yekini.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it will be right for Victor Osimhen to start comparing himself with late Rashidi Yekini when it comes to goal scoring in the Super Eagles,” Ikpeba told Brila FM.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he’s a young striker who has shown so much potentials to be great if he maintains the height that he’s going.</p>
      <p>“However, it will be good for him to focus more on developing his goal-scoring skills first.</p>
      <p>“As you have known, he started his football career on a wrong foot by joining VfL Wolfsburg and Charleroi after his success at the FIFA U-17 World Cup.</p>
      <p>“However, I am delighted that he has gotten it right by joining Lille in Ligue 1, where he is banging in the goal.”</p>
