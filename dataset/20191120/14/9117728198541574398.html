        <b>Williams are refusing to concentrate too much on 2021, instead being confident they can recover somewhat next season after their horror showing in 2019. The former greats have scored just one point this season, with Robert Kubica coming home 10th in a crazy German Grand Prix that saw seven retirements and hefty penalties for both Alfa Romeos.</b>

      <p>Williams have been on the decline since the new rules in 2014 came into place, culminating in a dreadful series for the team this year. They were late to pre season testing in Barcelona and have been by far the slowest car all season.</p>

      <p>Despite this, senior engineer Dave Robson says the team are not giving up on 2020 just yet. According to <a href="https://www.motorsportweek.com/news/id/25249">motorsportweek.com</a>, Robson said: <i>“It’s a good opportunity to have a bit of a reset and put into practice what we’ve been learning the last year and what we’ll continue to learn into next year.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“So undoubtedly we’ve got to work out how to divide the resources up, but you never write next year off, we’ve got to prove to ourselves and everyone else that what we’ve done this year was correct.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“If it is, and we can keep developing that, then that will still help the development of the 2021 car. We’re definitely not writing off next year.”</i>
