      <h1>Man poses as pilot to dodge airport queues</h1>

      <p>Police on Wednesday said a man who posed as a Lufthansa pilot so that he could enjoy quick boarding and upgrades has been arrested in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>Deputy Commissioner of police, Sanjay Bhatia, said Rajan Mahbubani, 48, was wearing a Lufthansa airlines pilot’s uniform and was carrying a fake ID card when he was detained at the airport in the Indian capital.</p>
      <p>Mahbubani was detained at the departure gate of a flight to Kolkata after the chief security officer of Lufthansa at IGI Airport reported a suspicious movement of a passenger in the uniform of Lufthansa airlines.</p>
      <p>According to the police, Mahbubani revealed during interrogation that he was a frequent traveller and would wear the pilot’s uniform to escape queues and the longer screening process for normal passengers.</p>
      <p>The police added that Mahbubani said he always uses the passage reserved for airline crew members and sometimes he would get his seat upgraded.</p>
      <p>“He revealed he had used the fake ID numerous times over the past six months.’’</p>
      <p>Bhatia however, said a criminal case has been registered against him and further investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>He added that Mahbubani, who runs a training and consultancy firm, was fond of wearing uniforms of different professions and getting photographed or got videos made which he shared on social media.</p>
      <p>“There was a picture of him in an Indian Army colonel’s uniform on his phone.’’</p>
