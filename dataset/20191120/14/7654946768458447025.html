      <p>It seems Camille Kostek taught boyfriend Rob Gronkowski a few moves.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Gronkowski and James Corden of the “Late Late Show” joined the Laker Girls for a halftime performance inside the Staples Center. Dancing to “Stay” by Alessia Cara and Zedd, the dynamic duo showed off their skills at center court to an enthralled audience, which also included Kostek, a former Patriots cheerleader.</p>
      <p>“A little role reversal tonight 💃 I used to be the halftime cheerleader, now I’m sidelines to his performance tonight,” Kostek posted on Instagram. “Still deciding if I’m a proud girlfriend over this 😅 nevertheless …. this is an EPIC #NeverNotDancing moment I am proud to witness by Mr James and Robert James 😂 I LOVE YOU BOTH.”</p>
      <p>Venus Williams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76etPlg3g4o">also performed</a> with the Laker Girls, along with comedian Ian Karmel.</p>
      <p>Gronkowski’s set came hours after the former Patriots tight end <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/19/gronk-is-heading-to-miami-for-super-bowl-2020/">announced a major Super Bowl bash</a> in Miami ahead of February’s big game.</p>
      <p>“No one knows Super Bowl weekend like myself. I’ve experienced it in every aspect — as a player, as a spectator — I wanted to do my very own thing and Gronkify it,” Gronkowski told Page Six. “Why not spice up the Super Bowl?”</p>
      <p>Kostek, who has been linked to Gronkowski since 2015, is also expected to attend the party.</p>
