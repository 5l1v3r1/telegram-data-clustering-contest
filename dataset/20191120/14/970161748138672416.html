      <p>A six-months pregnant woman was mauled to death by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> while walking in woodland during a deer hunt, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Elisa Pilaski, 29, was found dead in the Forest of Retz, around 55 miles northeast of Paris, on Saturday afternoon while a hunt was underway with a pack of hounds.</p>
      <p>An autopsy showed she died at some time between 1pm and 1.30pm after suffering ‘bleeding after several dog bites to the upper and lower limbs and the head’, prosecutor Frederic Trinh said.</p>
      <p>Some of those wounds had been inflicted ‘post-mortem’, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/france-pregnant-woman-killed-by-dogs-during-hunt-with-hounds">The Guardian</a> reported him adding.</p>
      <p>Tests have been carried out on 93 dogs so far, including some from the hunt as well as five of Ms Pilaski’s, in order to try and determine which, if any, were responsible.</p>
      <p>Police have reportedly launched a manslaughter probe.</p>
