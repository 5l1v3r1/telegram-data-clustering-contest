        <b>The Prosecutor's Office will prosecute foster parents who have physically and emotionally abused eight foster children over several years, including two underage girls whom the foster father sexually abused, according to LETA.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Prosecutor's Office Press Secretary Laura Majevska the woman has been accused under criminal law of cruelty and abuse of eight minors. LETA also has information that the woman previously received the <a href="https://skaties.lv/latvijas-lepnums/">“Pride of Latvia”</a> award, which is a TV3 and Latvijas Mediji project acknowledging everyday heroes.</p>
      <p>The man has been accused under the criminal law of cruelty and abuse of a minor, sexual abuse and rape. His case involves four children. The man faces possible life imprisonment or imprisonment for five to ten years.</p>
      <p>The case was investigated by the State Police after they were approached by two of the underage girls before being handed over for prosecution. A departmental investigation began immediately and in August of 2018 criminal proceedings were brought forward.</p>
      <p>The police also informed the local government leadership and the State Inspectorate For Protection Of Children's Rights. Due to the scope and complexity of the case the investigation was taken over by the State Police Sex Crimes Unit</p>
      <p>In February 2019 the police removed the five underage children and placed them in a crisis center. Both of the foster parents were detained and their home was searched. The woman born in 1961 has currently not been arrested, but the man born in 1968 has been arrested.</p>
