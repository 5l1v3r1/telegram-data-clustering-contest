        <b>Bayern Munich superstar Robert Lewandowski has 23 goals already this season but believes he is only going to get better.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Robert Lewandowski is enjoying an outstanding start to the season with Bayern Munich but insists there is room for him to get even better.</p>
      <p>The Poland international has 23 goals in 18 club matches so far this term, more than any other player in Europe’s top leagues.</p>
      <p>However, Lewandowski believes he is only now approaching his peak and can improve further, insisting he does not feel his 31 years.</p>
      <p>“I worked very hard for this form. Currently it is going perfectly, my body feels good,” he told Sport Bild.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have that in mind, but it does not mean that I’m resting. I want to get even better.</p>

      <p>“I know when I can do more and when I need to slow down. My passport says: ‘Robert Lewandowski, 31 years old’. But that’s not how I feel.</p>
      <p>“My best spell is just starting now and hopefully will continue for some more years. The best is yet to come.”</p>
      <p>Lewandowski is set to return to club action following the international break on Saturday, as Bayern visit Fortuna Dusseldorf.</p>
