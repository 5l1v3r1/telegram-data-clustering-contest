      <h1>Sean Wotherspoon Teases Corduroy-Equipped ASICS Collab (UPDATE)</h1>
      <h2>The king of corduory kicks is back at it again, working with ASICS and atmos.</h2>

        <b>UPDATE: November 20, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sean-wotherspoon">Sean Wotherspoon</a> has revealed more images of his collaborative <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/asics-gel-lyte-3">GEL-Lyte III</a> with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/asics">ASICS</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/atmos">atmos</a>. The design comes complete with a plethora of customizable accents to match its colorful corduroy construction. Logo hits, laces and tongue patches are all interchangeable, allowing the wearer to alter the look as they see fit. Tear-away detailing is present on the heels, and everything comes packaged in a special box. Release info has yet to be announced, as Wotherspoon stated the shoe is an “early sample” in his post.</p>

        <b>UPDATE: October 30, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sean-wotherspoon">Sean Wotherspoon</a> has confirmed that the shoe is a three-way collaboration between himself, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/asics">ASICS Japan</a>, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/atmos">atmos</a> head <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hirofumi-kojima">Hirofumi “Koji” Kojima</a>.</p>

        <b>ORIGINAL STORY: October 29, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/round-two">Round Two</a> co-owner <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sean-wotherspoon">Sean Wotherspoon</a> has taken to his Instagram to tease what appears to be a corduroy-covered <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/asics-gel-lyte-333">ASICS GEL-Lyte III</a>. Although the images only show part of the shoe, the design is unquestionably in line with the vintage clothing maven’s taste for traditional materials, bright palettes and unique embellishments.</p>
      <p>Corduroy coats the upper of both shoes in a “What The”-style combination of colors, ranging from a powder blue to a deep blue-green and a bright red. There also appears to be a Velcro base on each shoe’s midfoot, a potential indicator that they’ll feature interchangeable branded accents. Yet another photo posted from a private account shows wear-away detailing on the heel ovals. Interestingly enough, the left shoe features an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/atmos">atmos</a> logo while the right features a teal and pink detail.</p>

      <p>As this is a first look at the new design, it has yet to be determined if it’s a three-way effort between Wotherspoon, atmos and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/asics">ASICS</a>, or simply an atmos x ASICS collaboration. Nevertheless, it’s been an eventful year for Wotherspoon: he announced in March that he  <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/sean-wotherspoon-x-nike-air-max-1-97-ends-collab">ended his partnership with Nike</a>, then teased a 100% vegan collaboration with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/guess">GUESS</a> this previous summer as well.</p>
      <p>In other ASICS news, the Japanese brand recently <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/capcom-rock-man-mega-man-asics-gel-bnd-sneaker-collab-1021a313-400-release-date">teamed with <i>Mega Man</i> for a pixellated GEL-BND</a>.</p>
