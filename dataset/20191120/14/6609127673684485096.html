      <p>Kids were sent home with letters yesterday, informing parents the school would be closed today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The school has also sent texts to families, keeping them up to date with the closure - which is due to end on Friday.</p>
      <p>Elmvale also released a statement on social media shortly after it closed.</p>
      <p>The tweet read: "Please could all parents and carers check school bags for letters as the school will be closed until Friday 9am due to an outbreak of the Norovirus.</p>
      <p>"We hope to see everyone back and feeling better on Friday."</p>
      <p>This morning, they tweeted a link to the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/norovirus">NHS Inform website</a>, with details on the vomiting bug, how to avoid catching it and how to deal with catching it.</p>
      <p>Elmvale wrote: "Following the schools temporary closure due to the Norovirus outbreak, please see the attached information from the NHS website."</p>
      <p>The school will also undergo a deep clean on Monday.</p>
      <p>Norovirus can affect people of any age, causing vomiting and diarrhoea - and is most common in the winter months.</p>
      <p>Anyone who has caught the bug is advised to stay away from school or work for 48 hours after their symptoms stop.</p>
      <p>To reduce your chances of catching norovirus, people should regularly wash their hands with soap and water, avoid unwashed raw food and not share towels or toothbrushes.</p>
      <p>A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: “Over the last couple of days the school has been dealing with a high number of pupil and staff absences due to a vomiting bug and school staff are liaising with the public health team from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
      <p>“Norovirus information has been sent home to all families and a deep clean of the school premises is being carried out.</p>
      <p>"Norovirus, sometimes known as the ‘winter vomiting bug’, is the most common stomach bug in the UK, affecting people of all ages.</p>
      <p>“Most people with norovirus will make a full recovery in 1-2 days. It is important to keep hydrated – especially children and the elderly.</p>
      <p>"Good hand hygiene using soap and water is important to stop the spread of the virus. Anyone with norovirus should stay away from school or work until 48 hours after their symptoms have stopped.”</p>
