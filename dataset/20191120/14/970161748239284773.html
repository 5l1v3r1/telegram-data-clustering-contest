      <p>The UK remains in the top 30 countries worldwide at risk from terrorism, the latest Global Terrorism Index has revealed.</p>
      <p>Out of 163 nations on the list, Britain is ranked in 28th position based on measurements of the impact of terrorism over the past five years.</p>
      <p>The index, compiled by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides the most comprehensive resource on global terrorist trends.</p>
      <p>It found the number of deaths from terrorism worldwide has halved but the number of countries affected by terrorism is growing.</p>
      <p>It also revealed that far-right extremism is on the rise, with a massive 320% surge in far-right terrorism in the West in the last five years.</p>
      <p>Thomas Morgan, senior research fellow at the IEP, told Metro.co.uk it would be ‘too strong’ to say that far-right terrorism is now more of a threat than Islamic terrorism but added ‘it is certainly more of a threat’ than in previous years.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Far-right acts of terror are still relatively small, even when looking just at the West. But we have seen a 320% increase over five years including into 2019.</p>
      <p>‘We see Brexit as a symptom of the rise in far-right terrorism.</p>

      <p>‘We see across Europe and western countries, including in the US, a rise in political instability, in disenfranchisement and in protesting against traditional political parties.’</p>
      <p>In the UK, official figures show that in the year to June 30, 2019, just under 29% of the 266 terrorism arrests made were linked to far-right extremism.</p>
      <p>The number of disrupted plots linked to the ideology has also increased, with four stopped so far in 2019 alone.</p>
      <p>Globally, GTI found that the number of deaths by terrorist attacks has decreased by 52% since 2014, falling from 33,555 to 15,952.</p>
      <p>In 2018 alone, the total number of deaths fell by more than 15%, with researchers pointing to the defeat of Islamic State (Isis) as the cause.</p>
      <p>Thomas said: ‘We know that is mainly due to a reduction in conflict in Syria and Iraq. We know 95% of the terrorist acts prior to this year were from countries in conflict.</p>
      <p>The IEP has said the threat of terror remains ‘widespread and increasing’, with 71 countries suffering from at least one death, the second highest number since the beginning of the century.</p>
      <p>Steve Killelea, Executive Chairman of IEP, said: ‘Conflict and state sponsored terror are the key causes of terrorism.</p>
      <p>‘Of the 10 countries most impacted by terrorism, all were involved in at least one violent conflict last year.’</p>

      <p>In North America, Western Europe, and Oceania, the threat of far-right political terrorism affected 19 countries in the last five years.</p>
      <p>In 2019 alone, 77 deaths have been attributed to far-right terrorism in these regions.</p>

      <p>Unlike Islamist terrorism, none of the perpetuators claimed to be a member of an organised terrorist group, making it difficult for security organisations to prevent such attacks.</p>
      <p>In Europe, the number of deaths from terrorism fell for the second successive year, from over two hundred in 2017 to 62 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Only two attacks killed five or more people.</p>
      <p>Mr Killelea added: ‘The collapse of Isis in Syria and Iraq was one of the factors allowing Western Europe to record its lowest number of incidents since 2012, with no deaths attributed to the group in 2018.</p>
      <p>‘However, the situation still remains volatile, leaving the possibility of further Islamist attacks in Europe.’</p>
