      <h1>Pregnant woman, 29, mauled to death by dogs in northern France</h1>

      <p>A 29-year-old pregnant woman has been mauled to death by a pack of dogs while she was out walking near her house in northern France, according to local prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The victim, who has been named locally as Elisa Pilarski, was walking her own dog through Retz forest, near Villers-Cotterets, on Saturday, when she was attacked.</p>
      <p>She had earlier described coming across some "threatening dogs" in a phonecall to her partner, who later found her body after going out to look for her.</p>
      <p>Following a post-mortem, the prosecutor said Pilarski had died from "bleeding after several dog bites to the upper and lower limbs and the head."</p>
      <p>He added that several of the bites had been suffered after her death.</p>
      <p>Local police have since launched a manslaughter investigation and have conducted tests on 93 dogs, including hounds from a hunt that was ongoing nearby at the time the attack, and five of the victim's own dogs.</p>
      <p>Dozens of people have also added condolence messages to Pilarski's Facebook page, where she had regularly posted about her dogs and uploaded a picture of herself earlier this month to share an update on her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a woman connected to the hunt on Saturday told <a href="https://www.lunion.fr/id110015/article/2019-11-19/aucun-rapport-ni-avec-nos-chiens-ni-avec-la-chasse-courre">L'Union</a> that she believed the two weren't connected.</p>
      <p>"To our knowledge, the tragic accident that occurred has no relation neither with our dogs, nor with the hunt with hounds," she said.</p>

      <p>French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot wrote a letter to the French ecology minister Elisabeth Borne as a response to the incident, and called for an immediate suspension to hunting season.</p>
      <p>"I follow, as all the French, upset and deeply scandalised," she wrote in the letter, which was published to Twitter.</p>
