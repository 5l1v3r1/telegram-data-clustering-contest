      <h1>Balance your spend across YouTube and TV with Reach Planner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dacheng Zhao</a></address>
      <p>YouTube is focused on helping brands reach their audiences and drive business impact. That’s why we launched Reach Planner in April 2018 to give advertisers a better way to plan their YouTube and video media. To help make it even easier for users to for users to discover the optimal mix of TV and YouTube to maximize the reach of a video based media plan, today we’re launching  Nielsen TV Data in Reach Planner. Now you can see how different distributions of spend on TV and YouTube can affect your reach.</p>
      <p>Using this together with Nielsen Total Ad Ratings (TAR), you can compare YouTube and TV reach from the planning stages through to post campaign reporting.</p>
      <h3>With audiences shifting to digital, it’s important to plan TV and digital together</h3>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/video/personal-primetime/">audiences shifting to digital</a>, it’s important to plan across channels. According to Nielsen, there are thirty one percent fewer available weekly 18-49 GRPs across broadcast and cable television compared to just five years ago. TV’s decline in reach to 18-49 year olds now requires a forty six percent increase in frequency for marketers to achieve the same GRP levels.<sup>1</sup></p>

      <p>Advertisers can offset this decline and grow their business by adding YouTube to their overall video plan. Across the 20 Total Ad Ratings (TAR) studies we’ve commissioned with Nielsen, YouTube has consistently driven incremental reach at a more balanced frequency compared to TV.<sup>2</sup></p>
