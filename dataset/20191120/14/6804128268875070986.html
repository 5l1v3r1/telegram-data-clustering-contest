      <h2>Arsenal are reportedly set to rival the likes of Manchester United in the market for Erling Braut Haaland</h2>

      <p>Arsenal have plenty of work to do if they are to claw their way back into the hunt for Champions League football, as Unai Emery's side sit eight points behind the top four.</p>
      <p>The January transfer window presents the opportunity for the <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Gunners </a>to improve their fortunes by bolstering their squad in the market and some intriguing reports have surfaced.</p>
      <p>According to claims from German outlet SportBild, Arsenal are as interested as Manchester United in RB Salzburg sensation Erling Braut Haaland and could make a swoop.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old forward has been in sensational form for the Austrian side this season, scoring 15 goals and contributing four assists in the league - as well as adding seven Champions League goals to his tally from just four matches.</p>
      <p>That has seen the Leeds-born striker linked with some of the biggest clubs across European football but Arsenal are not prepared to let the services of the Norway international pass them by.</p>
      <p>With the reports suggesting that the Gunners are in the hunt, plenty of fans took to social media to share their thoughts on the rumour and would come be a major coup for the North London side.</p>
