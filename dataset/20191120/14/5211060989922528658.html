      <p>TORONTO - A Toronto police officer involved in the 2016 arrest and release of serial killer Bruce McArthur has pleaded not guilty to disciplinary charges.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Lawrence Gridin entered the plea this morning on behalf of Sgt. Paul Gauthier during a brief appearance before the Toronto police tribunal.</p>
      <p>Gauthier is charged with insubordination and neglect of duty related to his handling of a complaint by a man who alleged McArthur tried to strangle him.</p>
      <p>The officer was not present Wednesday. He has yet to appear before the tribunal, with his lawyer citing an undisclosed illness.</p>
      <p>Gridin has said his client will be at the hearing to face the accusations against him when the time comes.</p>
      <p>A notice of hearing released earlier this year alleges Gauthier did not record a video statement from the complainant or photograph his injuries within 72 hours, as required by the force's policy on domestic violence investigations.</p>
