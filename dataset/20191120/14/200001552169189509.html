      <h1>Crystal Palace have ‘moved concretely’ for signing, as player asks for €8m deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:45:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Olivier Giroud continues to be all over the Italian sport media, with the possibility of a move to Inter Milan being reported daily.</p>
      <p>The French striker has long been relied upon by Didier Deschamps and has never let the manager down. He has a good chance of being at Euro 2020 with his country, but there’s a danger a lack of football with Chelsea could endanger that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fcinternews.it/esclusive/fcin-offerta-palace-sondaggio-bvb-giroud-aspetta-l-inter-c-e-la-richiesta-d-ingaggio-a-lui-la-prossima-mossa-323519">FCInterNews</a> have some claims today which they state are from their own information, and whilst it’s obviously focused on Inter, there’s some snippets for Crystal Palace there too.</p>
      <p>Palace have, according to the report, ‘moved concretely’ for Giroud in recent days. The Premier League side want to satisfy the striker on wages, and that could make things difficult for the Milan club.</p>
      <p>Giroud is said to be asking for one of two things, either a two and a half year contract, which would take him to 2022, or, if Inter won’t agree to that, a deal from January 2020 until June 2021 on a salary of €8m for the 18 month period.</p>
      <p>It’s not made clear whether the same request would be made to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Another problem for Inter is that Chelsea won’t allow the player to leave for free in January.</p>
