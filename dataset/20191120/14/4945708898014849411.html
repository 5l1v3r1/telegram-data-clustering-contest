      <p>True wireless earbuds are the rage for many but I often hear others who are skeptical simply from the fear of having them fall out.</p>
      <p>AirPods are the leader of the pack when it comes to truly wireless earbuds and an inexpensive, yet perfect solution to keep Apple's pricy earbuds (AirPods 1 and AirPods 2) in place is the KeyBudz EarBuddyz Ultra ear-hooks.</p>
      <p>The ear hooks also work with Apple wired EarPods and include multiple sizes for a perfect and secure fit. Just slide the dual durometer silicone ear hooks right over the earbuds and put them in your ear. Each pack includes three pairs; small, medium and large.</p>
      <p>Once installed, with a better seal on the earbuds, they help improve noise isolation and overall sound performance by keeping additional unwanted noise out of your ears.</p>
      <p>The accessory also ensures the earbuds won't twist and slide around to keep the sound consistent.</p>
      <p>For the record, I've tried dozens of true wireless earbud samples and have never had one fall out. There, I was jinxed so the EarBuddyz Ultra will solve that problem ahead of time.</p>
      <p>The EarBuddyz Ultra, $13.95 in choices of white and black.</p>
      <p>KeyBudz has another handy AirPod accessory, the PodSkinz case with carabiner.</p>
      <p>The skin case covers and protects your AirPods case and clips to a belt, backpack, or whatever, to ensure you know where they are.</p>
      <p>The protective case has a slim design with a 1.3 mm thickness with a hinge-less lid to protect both AirPods 1 and AirPods 2 with full light sensor functionality.</p>
      <p>The PodSkinz, $8.95 are available in nine colors.</p>
      <p>And if that's not enough, there are times when you are sound free and the AirPods need to be put down for a few minutes and that's where the AirDockz comes in.</p>
      <p>The dock has a residue-free restickable adhesive strip on the bottom for securing the magnetic base to any flat surface. Just place the AirPods in or out of the AirDockz ($8.95) when needed.</p>

      <p>Some of us have the original USB connection and many have the newer USB-C. And many of us have both.</p>
      <p>Whatever you have, they are used for charging and that's where Moshi's new QuikDuo Car Charger is a simple, yet highly useful gadget.</p>
      <p>It plugs into a 12V socket, known to many as a cigarette lighter and has both a USB-C and USB-A ports on a front-facing aluminum faceplate.</p>
      <p>Each port supports secure quick charging on Android and iPhones and Moshi's over-charge protection with Smart power management circuitry provides protection. The QuickDuo produces 36 W of total power so the ports can be used simultaneously, which is a plus and worked perfectly in my testing.</p>
      <p>In addition to smartphone charging, the charger has other uses. It powered a dashboard camera and charged a pocket digital camera, as well.</p>
      <p>moshi.com $29.95</p>

      <p>Amazon Kids &amp; Family and Amazon FreeTime Unlimited has expanded to even more devices so families can enjoy premium, kid-friendly content with parental controls.</p>

      <p>FreeTime monitors kids' use of digital content from one device to another, so parents have an aggregate account of how much and what type of content their kids are interacting with daily and weekly, and not worry about kids being exposed to inappropriate content.</p>
