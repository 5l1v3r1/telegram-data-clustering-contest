      <h1>Help! My ex-boyfriend is blackmailing me</h1>

      <p><b>Question</b>: I am a 27-year-old woman and just got married. Last year I had a very ugly break-up with my boyfriend with whom I have been in a relationship for seven years. I married the man chosen by my parents. Now, my ex-boyfriend has been blackmailing me saying he would tell my husband about us, especially about our physical relationship. I had told my husband about my past but not about how close we had been. I am so scared now because I am in a new environment with new people. I don't know how they might react. This is giving me sleepless nights. Please help. <b>—By Anonymous</b></p>
      <p><b>Response by Rachana Awatramani: </b>Everyone has a past and that surely can not determine your future, as past is over and we can not do anything to change it but learn from it. Your present, however, can help you shape your future and current relationship.</p>
      <p>I see that you are married and your ex-boyfriend has been blackmailing you and threatening you that he will tell your husband about your relationship. I can understand that this is creating anxiety in you and your sleep is disturbed as well.</p>
      <p>You did the right thing by telling your husband about your past relationship. As he has accepted you and your past the way it is, you can see if he can understand your fears as well.</p>
      <p>In this situation you can either tell your husband that he is blackmailing you or you can tell your ex-boyfriend that you have told your husband about your past and he can not do any damage. Both situations would have its own consequences and the only thing that you can do is be prepared for whatever is the outcome. Avoid speaking with your ex-boyfriend and seek help from a professional counsellor to address your fears. In this situation, you will need to also inform a family member or a friend whom you trust.</p>
      <p>If someone wants to scare you or create fear in you, you can only respond to in a flight or fight response. That is, either you face him or don’t talk to him at all. Make sure you have a confident person with you for support in this situation.</p>
