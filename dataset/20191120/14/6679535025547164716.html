      <p>Tamil Nadu has had a great start to its domestic season after two disappointing years and comes into the Super League phase of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament having topped its group.</p>
      <p>Happy with the way the season has started, coach D. Vasu said: “It has been a good start but we can’t be complacent with what we have achieved. It is a competitive group and we will have a fight on our hands with teams like Karnataka, Mumbai and Jharkhand.”</p>
      <p>On the areas he felt the team could improve, Vasu added: “Opening is an area of concern. Constantly we have not had a great partnership to start with and that is an area I am worried about.”</p>
      <p>Without M. Vijay, Washington Sundar might be promoted up the order alongside N. Jagadeesan to have a left-right combination.</p>
      <p>It is also expected that R. Ashwin is likely to join the squad immediately after the second Test against Bangladesh gets over in Kolkata, which should help the team’s cause.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Solid on all fronts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Karnataka has been looking solid on all fronts and senior player Karun Nair said the fact that team has been in knockout stages regularly in the last few years means the players are well equipped to handle pressure.</p>
      <p>“I think we as a team are confident of doing well in this phase of the competition. We have covered all our bases and if we play as a team we have the potential to beat anyone in India,” Karun added.</p>
