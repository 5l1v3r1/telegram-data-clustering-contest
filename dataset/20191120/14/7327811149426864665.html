      <p>GREAT KILLS, Staten Island (WABC) -- A box truck overturned into a home in the Great Kills section of Staten Island early Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The truck flipped in the driveway of the home on Hillcrest Street just after 7 a.m.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck suffered injuries and was taken to a local hospital.</p>
      <p>"We had a box truck that overturned and crashed into a private dwelling. We suspect it was a medical episode. The driver had a condition that caused him to crash into a house. He is being evaluated at a local hospital," the FDNY said. "The occupants of the house were in the house but are OK."</p>
      <p>The house appears to have sustained minor structural damage.</p>
      <p>"It was surreal," the homeowner said.</p>
      <p>The Department of Buildings will check the structural stability of the residence.</p>
