      <p>While many Bloody Disgusting readers may have grown up alongside the J-horror craze and the several <i>Ju-On/Grudge</i> films, our younger readers may not know the story behind the franchise’s haunts: Kayako and Toshio.</p>
      <p>“When someone dies in the grip of a terrible rage, they leave behind this grudge, this unanswered desire for vengeance and violence,” Producer <b>Sam Raimi</b> explains in this new <b><i>The Grudge</i></b> featurette.</p>
      <p>“This grudge can spread anywhere and everywhere,” adds <b>Nicolas Pesce</b>, who directed the newest installment.</p>
      <p>However, the biggest reveal comes from co-star <b>Demian Bichir</b> (<i>The Nun</i>), who teases the possible introduction of a <i>brand new cursed entity</i>!</p>
      <blockquote>“This is a completely different entity, charged with its own personality and its own terror,” Bichir says.</blockquote>
      <p>While we know that <b>Junko Bailey </b>plays Kayako in the next <i>Grudge</i>, we have no idea who this alleged new spirit is and who plays it. I guess we’ll find out on <b>January 3, 2020</b>.</p>
