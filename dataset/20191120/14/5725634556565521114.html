      <h1>A High Dividend Strategy During The Tech Bubble</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:53:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author">Ploutos</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The old saying goes "history never repeats itself, but it rhymes."  If that is the case,we should understand how equity strategies performed in historical risk-off environments for the market.</li>
        <li>This article looks at the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Index during the deflation of the tech bubble.</li>
        <li>Building on recent articles on factor tilt strategies during risk-off environments, this article examines the efficacy of a popular high dividend equity strategy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307440-performance-factor-tilts-tech-bubble">Monday's article</a>, I showed the performance of my "7 Ways to Beat the Market" during the peak-to-trough drop during the deflation of the tech bubble. These seven factor tilts or alternative weighting schema - <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4273865-7-ways-beat-market-small-cap-update">Size</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274057-7-ways-beat-market-value-update">Value</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274256-7-ways-beat-market-low-volatility-update">Low Volatility</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274456-7-ways-beat-market-dividend-growth-update">Dividend Growth</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274675-7-ways-beat-market-update-equal-weighting">Equal-Weighting</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4274956-7-ways-beat-market-momentum">Momentum</a>, and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4275169-7-ways-beat-market-quality">Quality</a> - have delivered long-run outperformance versus the traditional capitalization-weighted benchmark. As seen in the graph below covering this historic drawdown, these strategies tended to outperform the capitalization-weighted index, which had experienced an increasing tilt towards high multiple tech stocks during the bubble's expansion.</p>

      <p>For Seeking Alpha readers, I wanted to supplement that piece with an examination of the performance of the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio Index. The index screens for the 75 highest dividend-yielding stocks in the S&amp;P 500, and then selects the 50 components of that group with the lowest realized volatility over the past year. This index is replicated by a dividend ETF - the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPHD">SPHD</a>) - that has become popular with Seeking Alpha readers given its strong performance, below average volatility, and monthly-pay feature. Before diving into the performance of that strategy during the 2000-2002 drawdown, the graph below is of the full available history of the index methodology. Over the past roughly three decades, this strategy has outperformed the S&amp;P 500, from which the constituents are drawn, by 1.8% per year.</p>

      <p>In <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4296797-high-dividend-strategy-since-07-peak">"High Dividend Strategy Since '07 Peak,"</a> I showed that this index outperformed the broad market during the October 2007-March 2009 drawdown by 6%. The strategy has also outperformed the broad market index by nearly 2% annualized over the subsequent decade-long bull market that followed that historic drawdown.</p>
      <p>In the 2000-2002 market drawdown, the performance of the High Dividend Low Volatility strategy was even better. From the then all-time high for the S&amp;P 500 on March 24, 2000 to the cyclical nadir on October 9th, 2002, the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility strategy actually produced a positive 10% return while the S&amp;P 500 corrected by 47%.</p>

      <p>It is never possible to know what stage of the business cycle we are in at the current moment. Amidst a historically elongated economic expansion and with stocks at all-time highs, some investors may believe the end of the cycle is near and on the lookout for strategies that offer downside protection. As this article describes, the S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index outperformed during the Great Recession and bursting of the Tech Bubble.</p>
      <p>During the bounce from the bottom in 2009, it has also managed to outperform the broad market over this elongated expansion. A strategy that can keep pace in up markets and provide decent downside protection in down markets should interest many readers. At an indicated dividend yield of 4.3%, it also offers decent current income in a low interest rate world. I hope this historical examination of the underlying index for this strategy was of value to readers.</p>
