      <p>Condemning a recent circular issued by the Department of Education which is said to have insulted the architect of the Constitution B.R. Ambedkar by showing him in poor light, members of the Karnataka Rajya Dalit Sangharsh Samiti demanded that Primary and Secondary Education Minister Suresh Kumar submit his resignation.</p>
      <p>Samiti State convener D.G. Sagar, addressing presspersons in Kalaburagi on Wednesday, said that serious action should be taken against Principal Secretary of Primary and Secondary Education Department S.R. Umashankar for issuing the controversial manual spreading falsehood about the architect of the Constitution.</p>
      <h3>Roster system</h3>
      <p>In 2015, the State government had filled 181 posts of head masters in high schools without giving reservation to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, violating the roster system and reservation in promotions.</p>
      <p>Now, the department has started the process of filling 363 vacant posts of head masters in high schools across the State, he said and urged the government to follow the roster system and reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes employees in promotions.</p>
