      <p>Earlier this year, for some bizarre reason, #JCBKiKhudai trended on Twitter in India and since then, the yellow machine has become people’s favourite meme on the Internet.</p>
      <p>Well, JCB has hit the headlines once again and the reason is a little bizarre again. This time, a man drove a JCB tractor so fast that he ended up setting a new Guinness World Record.</p>
      <p>Yes, lorry mechanic and motorcycle racer Guy Martin rode the JCB tractor at a whopping speed of 217 Km/h. The Guinness World Record website says that Martin initially broke the record by attaining a new record of 166.79 Km/h  before going faster by reaching 217 km/h.</p>

      <p>Well, seems Martin has a fascination for weird speed records as he currently holds records for the fastest speed on a gravity-powered snow sled (83.49 mph/134.368 kph), the fastest soapbox (85.61 mph/137.78 kph), and highest speed on a Wall of Death (78.15 mph/25.77 kph).</p>
      <p>Martin used to be a truck mechanic before making a career in racing and then later on Television.</p>
      <p>“There are some good folk there and they said about this idea of building the world’s fastest tractor. So I said ‘if you want it piloting give us a shout’ and that’s where it came about,” <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2019/11/guy-martin-reaches-135-mph-to-obliterate-the-worlds-fastest-tractor-record-598759">he told Guinness World Records.</a></p>
