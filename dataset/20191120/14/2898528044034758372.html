      <h1>Luke Rockhold: ‘Right now, I’m just happy not fighting’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/98/luke-rockhold">Luke Rockhold</a> isn’t making any declarations about retiring from mixed martial arts, but it’s likely he’s fought his last fight.</p>
      <p>The former UFC and Strikeforce middleweight champion last competed in July where he suffered a broken jaw in a knockout loss to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/620/jan-blachowicz">Jan Blachowicz</a> in his debut at 205 pounds. In the aftermath of that fight, Rockhold took time off to recover, and while he’s recently signed up for a grappling match against ADCC runner-up Nick Rodriguez at Polaris 12 on Nov. 30, his future plans probably won’t involve fighting again.</p>
      <p>“My head is content where I’m at right now,” Rockhold told MMA Fighting. “I’ve done a lot of things in the sport. I’m not trying to be a headline maker. I’m not trying to say I’m going to retire and then want to come back. I don’t like to close doors on things in life.</p>
      <p>“Right now, I’m just happy not fighting. It feels good to focus on other things.”</p>
      <p>In recent years, Rockhold has gained traction in business outside the cage including a lucrative modeling contract with Polo Ralph Lauren where he became one of the faces of the brand. He’s also recently started dabbling in acting with a couple of film roles already locked down.</p>
      <p>More than anything, Rockhold is just content with the work he’s doing that doesn’t involve fighting in mixed martial arts.</p>
      <p>“Fighting takes a lot. I’ve done it, I’ve been to the top of the game. I just don’t have the same passion, the hunger for it at this point,” Rockhold said. “I’m excited to go in other realms of life. I know I have a lot of fans out there. I’m sorry I’m not fighting but you never know. Maybe someday I will but I don’t foresee it at this point.</p>
      <p>“A couple grappling matches to keep myself entertained in the process, I think the people who tune in will have some fun watching. I’m going to bring it to this kid, and if I do another one, I’m sure it’s going to be fun and entertaining.”</p>
      <p>Financially, Rockhold is in the position where he doesn’t have to fight again, which allows him to make a decision on his future based on what’s truly best for him rather than returning to action out of necessity.</p>
      <p>If he ever decides to compete again, the 35-year-old veteran will do it for the right reasons, which means he wants to fight — not because he needs to fight.</p>
      <p>“I’m well off. I can choose what I want to do,” Rockhold said. “I’ve got a couple companies I’m working with, and I’ve got checks flowing from so many different ways. I’m not like the rest of these guys where I have to pursue and beat the thing into the ground with fighting or jiu-jitsu or anything. There’s other areas of life and I can put some energy and focus on those things.</p>
      <p>“Obviously you can’t fight forever. I can make more money outside the cage so if I can do that, why not? Not have to deal with the political bullsh*t that comes with fighting and the UFC, all that stuff we know about. I like it. It makes me happy.”</p>
      <p>Just because fighting may be behind him doesn’t mean Rockhold is giving up on challenging himself in different avenues in his life.</p>
      <p>Case in point, he’s facing one of the top grappling prospects in the world on Nov. 30 because he wants to test himself while still having fun doing something new.</p>
      <p>“I’m not trying to make it a job. I’m just having fun with it,” Rockhold said. “I’m not going out there and pursuing all these grappling things but to go pick off a couple guys and prove that I’m still at the top of my game. Why not?</p>
      <p>“I’m an extremist. I’m going to find anything that challenges me in life. I’m going to f*cking try to tackle it. I’m going to try to conquer it. There’s a lot left for me to conquer. I think it will always be that way. I’m not trying to beat fighting into the ground. I can do a lot of other things. Fighting consumes you. It consumes your body, your mind and it consumes your life and not able to enjoy other things in your life. Not chasing it and being consumed by it, it’s freeing. I’m excited to do what I’m doing and keep pursuing more.”</p>
      <p>In his pursuit of those extremes, Rockhold even jumped into a rodeo in Montana where he took second place in a steer wrestling competition. The former UFC champion blames “Montana whiskey” for the impromptu decision to get involved with the rodeo but he had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
      <p>“I think I should have got first place,” Rockhold said. “I’m pretty pissed about that. I was going to go back and dispute that. I did get myself a buckle.”</p>

      <p>Whether it’s grappling competitions, acting roles or maybe another rodeo, Rockhold is just in a better place currently, which is why he’s completely OK putting fighting behind him for now.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy not fighting. I’m happy being back on the west coast. I’m doing what I’m doing and not worrying with that burden of fighting over my head and pursuing that,” Rockhold stated.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been doing it for nearly 14 years. I’ve conquered two different companies. I’ve been the best in the world undisputedly. I sleep well with that. Not a lot guys can do that.”</p>
      <p>For all the signs that point towards Rockhold never stepping back into the cage again, he’s not ready to say it with absolute certainty.</p>
      <p>That’s why he refuses to completely shut the door by using a word like “retirement” when it comes to his fighting career.</p>
      <p>“I don’t live my life on nevers,” Rockhold said. “I’m never one to quit something entirely. I don’t want to put a roadblock anywhere in life. I always leave doors open. That’s how I live my life. I’ve fared well for myself thus far. I’m going to keep that mentality and keep that lifestyle.</p>
      <p>“I’m doing what I want to do and creating different outlets. I love it.”</p>
