        <b>Former England Women manager and current Stevenage caretaker boss Mark Sampson has been charged with alleged racist abuse by the FA.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In September, Stevenage said that racism allegations surrounding their caretaker boss had <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/18940/11808397/stevenage-claim-racism-allegations-about-mark-sampson-have-no-foundation">"no foundation"</a>, after conducting their own investigation.</p>
      <p>He is accused of having made the remark to a coach who used to work with the Sky Bet League Two club earlier this season and it was alleged that the comment was aimed at a player during a conversation about transfer targets.</p>
      <p>Sampson, who was named as the interim manager at the League Two side following the dismissal of Dino Maamria earlier this season, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/18940/11810030/mark-sampson-says-racism-allegation-made-against-him-is-untrue">denies the accusations.</a></p>
      <p>An FA statement read: "Mark Sampson has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3.</p>
      <p>"It is alleged that a comment made by the Stevenage FC caretaker manager breached FA Rule E3(1) as it was improper and/or abusive and/or insulting.</p>
      <p>"It is further alleged that the comment also constitutes an 'aggravated breach', which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it referenced ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality.</p>
      <p>"He has until 6 December 2019 to provide a response to the charge."</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was relieved of his duties as England Women boss in 2017 after bullying and discrimination allegations.</p>
      <p>He was also alleged to have had a relationship with a player during his time as a coach at Bristol Academy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/28508/11795960/eniola-aluko-has-forgiven-mark-sampson-after-england-women-bullying-allegations">Former Lionesses forward Eniola Aluko</a> said she has forgiven former boss Sampson, following her claims of racism, harassment and bullying in the Lionesses camp.</p>
