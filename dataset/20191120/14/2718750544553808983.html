      <p>Lil Nas X has somewhere else to take his horse to: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/2020-grammy-nominations-complete-list.html">the Grammy Awards</a>. The breakout country rapper not only earned an expected top nomination for Record of the Year for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/lil-nas-x-billy-ray-cyrus-old-town-road-longest-no-1-ever.html">his record-breaking hit “Old Town Road”</a> (which is also Billy Ray Cyrus’s first nomination), but also Album of the Year for his EP <i>7</i> and Best New Artist. He additionally showed up in the pop category with Cyrus <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/how-old-town-road-put-kids-in-control.html">for “Old Town Road”</a> (Best Pop Duo/Group Performance) and the rap category for “Panini” (Best Rap/Sung Performance), along with a nomination for Best Music Video for “Old Town Road,” for six total nominations. A versatile king! <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/lil-nas-x-thought-you-already-knew-he-was-out-but-okay.html">Lil Nas recently made history as a black gay winner</a> at the CMA Awards for “Old Town Road” — and we’ll see if he continues his streak in January.</p>
