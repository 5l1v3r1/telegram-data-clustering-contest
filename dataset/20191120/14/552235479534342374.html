      <h1>Fraser Forster dismisses Celtic loan recall as Southampton keeper opens up permanent switch</h1>
      <h2>The keeper has been in impressive form since returning to the Parkhead club in the summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:14:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic keeper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Fraser Forster</a> has dismissed claims Southampton have an option to recall him in January.</p>
      <p>The Englishman returned to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in the summer on a short-term deal as he fell out of favour at St Mary's behind Angus Gunn and Alex McCarthy.</p>
      <p>Reports suggested there was a clause in his deal that would give his parent club the option to bring him back in the New Year.</p>
      <p>But the keeper has denied those rumours and insists he will be at Parkhead until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>He said: "I don't think there's a recall (option to go back to Southampton) so I think I'm here for the season from my side of things.</p>
      <p>“I'm happy here and glad to be back here playing.”</p>

      <p>Forster still has two and a half years left on his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> deal and Celtic fans would love to see him sign a permanent deal after his impressive start to the season for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>'s men.</p>
      <p>But the goalie says the decision is out of his hands as he opened up on his future at Saints.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm only focusing on the short term really.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"So much of what will happen will be out of my hands.</p>
      <p>"I'm just concentrating week by week, enjoying it while I can. The rest will take care of itself."</p>
