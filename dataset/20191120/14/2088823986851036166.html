      <h1>Jail deputy sues his boss, Sheriff Howard, alleging defamation</h1>

      <p>The top staff members at the Erie County Sheriff's Office rarely comment on personnel matters.</p>
      <p>But Sheriff Timothy B. Howard spoke up when one of his jail deputies, Jeremiah Nolan Jr., was accused of stealing another lawman's ammunition pouch, charged with petit larceny and fired.</p>
      <p>"I cannot understand," <a href="http://www2.erie.gov/sheriff/index.php?q=press/former-deputy-arrested-and-terminated">Howard told reporters</a> in June 2018, "how a sworn officer could take another officer's lifeline – the magazines for his duty gun. It was evident that his misconduct warranted his termination."</p>
      <p>But Nolan went to trial, was found not guilty and was reinstated.</p>
      <p>Weeks ago, Nolan filed a lawsuit against Howard and other sheriff's officials for wrongful termination and defamation, among other things.</p>
      <p>Howard sometimes stands by his deputies, as he did when Kenneth P. Achtyl was accused of brutalizing a Buffalo Bills fan. While in uniform, the sheriff sat with Achtyl's family during the trial. When <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/09/27/deputy-achtyl-found-guilty-of-3-crimes/">the guilty verdict</a> was announced, Howard said he wished the district attorney had not let loose the body camera video that sealed the conviction.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, Howard has taken a hands-off approach, even when the evidence against a criminally accused deputy was flimsy. In contrast to Achtyl, Howard never attended Deputy George Avery's trial in 2007. Prosecutors failed to prove any aspect of the accusation that Avery had sexually attacked a male defendant. <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2007/09/13/deputy-cleared-in-alleged-rape-of-prisoner-avery-supporters-want-perjury-probe-of-accuser/">Avery was found not guilty</a>, reinstated and retired years later.</p>
      <p>Why did Howard single out Nolan? Because the jail deputy speaks up when he sees wrongdoing, said the lawyer who filed the lawsuit, Steven M. Cohen.</p>
      <p>"The culture of the Erie County Sheriff's Department, like other departments I have dealt with over the decades, has officers they consider to be insiders and those they do not," Cohen said. And Nolan is no insider, he said.</p>
      <p>"When he sees wrongdoing, when he sees prisoners being abused, when he sees safety issues, he speaks up," Cohen said. "Not too many people like Jeremiah Nolan. Because he is a quintessential whistleblower."</p>

      <p>On May 27, 2018, Nolan was stationed on the ninth floor at Erie County Medical Center, a "lock-up" portion of the hospital housing inmates needing medical attention. According to the lawsuit, he found a pouch for an ammunition magazine in a desk drawer and moved it to the top of a gun box nearby. Days later, on June 2, 2018, his union representative told him he had been accused of stealing the ammunition magazine it contained from a corrections officer. The sheriff's detectives had investigated the matter.</p>
      <p>The law enforcement personnel who arrive are to check in their ammunition, their "magazine pouches," said Joel Daniels, the attorney who defended Nolan in the trial before City Court Judge Craig Hanna. An officer believed that when his pouch could not be found it had been stolen. In fact, it had fallen out of view, Daniels said.</p>
      <p>"The judge found reasonable doubt, and he was acquitted," Daniels said of Nolan. Because the criminal record was sealed, District Attorney John J. Flynn would not comment for this article, his spokeswoman said. A Howard spokesman would not comment because of the active lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The county doesn't dispute Howard's statement about Nolan or that the deputy was found not guilty. But the county's attorneys, who are defending the sheriff and three of his top aides, said the lawsuit should be dismissed for a range of technical reasons. Among them: Nolan needed to have filed the lawsuit within a year after Howard's statements, but the deputy instead waited more than 14 months. Further, the emotional distress Nolan says he suffered because of Howard's statement needs to be addressed in a workers' compensation claim, not a lawsuit, the lawyers said.</p>
      <p>As for the back pay owed for the six months in which he was terminated, Nolan should have filed an Article 78 proceeding – also known as a show-cause order – not a lawsuit, the County Attorney's Office says in its motion to dismiss the case in federal court.</p>
      <p>To counter, Cohen filed court papers saying, among other things, that an Article 78 proceeding isn't the way to seek back pay when the employee has been reinstated and the right to back pay established. He also said a workers' compensation claim isn't the right way to pursue damages for emotion distress because Nolan, and his wife, Sandra, are suing the sheriff and his top aides in their non-official capacities.</p>
