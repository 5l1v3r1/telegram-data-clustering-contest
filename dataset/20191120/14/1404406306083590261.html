      <p>YBN Cordae took to Instagram to react to being nominated for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song at the 2020 Grammys. Cordae is nominated alongside Dreamville, 21 Savage, Tyler, The Creator, and Meek Mill for Best Rap Album. Cordae's <i>The Lost Boy</i> debut album was released earlier this year to critical acclaim, which is why it was no surprise that the project was nominated for a Grammy.</p>
      <p>YBN Cordae started out by reacting to the news by tweeting, "Yo I got nominated for a fucking GRAMMY WHAT THE ACTUAL F**K." He followed up on Instagram by posting a video in his Stories, where he shed tears and stood in disbelief.</p>
