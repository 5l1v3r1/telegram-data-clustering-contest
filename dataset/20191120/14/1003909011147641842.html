      <p>Keith Urban’s brief halftime performance at the 2019 Grey Cup is sure to whet the appetite of Calgary country fans.</p>
      <p>So the good news is Calgarians won’t have to wait long to see an expanded set from the New Zealand-born superstar.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, it was announced that Urban will headline the closing night lineup of Country Thunder on Aug. 23. The festival runs from Aug. 21 to 23 at Prairie Winds Park.</p>
      <p>“I’m jonesing to come back and play,” said Urban, in an interview with Postmedia earlier this week. “The problem with only playing 12 minutes is it’s not long enough. You’re just getting going. With the CFL, literally it will feel like I’m just getting going. So, yeah, we’re coming back. We’ll do a much longer set. By then we’ll probably have a new song or two to put in the set if not more.”</p>
      <p>Urban has played Calgary several times over the years, but this will be his first performance at Country Thunder. He has earned 42 hit singles over 11 albums.</p>
      <p>Urban is the first performer announced for Country Thunder’s Alberta lineup. The full lineup will be announced on Nov 28.</p>
