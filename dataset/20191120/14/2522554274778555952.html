      <h1>Childish Major Recalls Getting in Trouble for Mimicking The Neptunes’ “Grindin'” Beat in School</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:16:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/robbyseabrookiii/" target="_blank">Robby Seabrook III</a></address>
      <p>Some people can do it all. Atlanta's own <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/childish-major/">Childish Major</a>, the 28-year-old producer and rapper (who also sings sometimes) first stepped into the spotlight when he produced <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/09/future-rocko-reunite-squash-beef-video/">Rocko</a>'s 2013 hit single "U.O.E.N.O." Since then, he's dropped his own album (2019's <i>Dirt Road Diamond </i>featuring the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/11/childish-major-interview-favorite-hip-hop-beats/v">Ludacris-assisted single "No Sweat"</a>) and mixtape (2017's <i>Woo$ah</i>) plus worked with artists like J. Cole, 6LACK, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/06/jid-2018-xxl-freshman-freestyle/">former<i> XXL</i> Freshman J.I.D</a>, in addition to appearing on Dreamville's <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2019/07/j-cole-dreamville-revenge-of-the-dreamers-iii-no-1-billboard-200/"><i>Revenge of the Dreamers III</i></a> compilation earlier this year. For someone who's just as comfortable behind the boards as he is in the booth, having a variety of influences should come as no surprise. For the latest episode of <i>XXL</i>'s <i>Pay Homage</i> series, Childish Major gives props to five producers whose hip-hop beats inspired and motivated him to take his production to the next level.</p>
      <p>Childish Major's first choice is a classic: <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/08/jay-z-kneeling-protests-nfl-partnership/">Jay-Z</a>'s "Hovi Baby" produced by <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/just-blaze/">Just Blaze</a>. "It's super big band-sounding," he explains. "I think they sampled like a TLC live show; I dunno how back then Just Blaze got his hands on that recording, but the way he cut that sample was crazy." He of course shouts out Hov for the work he put in: "Then Jay-Z comes on there and he just goes crazy."</p>
      <p>There aren't many beats that spread everywhere and are considered a classic like <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/10/kanye-west-clipse-reunite-sunday-service/">Clipse</a>'s "Grindin'" (courtesy of The Neptunes), making it an easy choice to honor. "<a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/the-neptunes-chad-hugo-pretends-to-retire/">Pharrell and Chad</a>, off top, that's like one of the best beats ever," Childish says. "Every kid, whether they was into hip-hop or not, was doing that on they desk, lunch table, during class. I'm pretty sure everybody else got in trouble. I know I got in trouble for, you know, doing that." Anyone who grew up during that era remembers this vividly. "Grindin'" was like no other beat at the time, and is still in a league of its own.</p>
      <p>For his third selection, Childish Major makes a throwback pick: <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2018/04/a-tribe-called-quest-the-space-program-video/">A Tribe Called Quest</a>'s "Bonita Applebum" produced by Q-Tip. "That beat [is] definitely, slower, more mellow," he explains. "But altogether amazing, maybe not a beat battle beat, but on some super, like vibing, chilling." He also adds in an observation of his own. "Women love that beat," he says with a smile.</p>

      <p>“We did this show in Atlanta on Ty [Dolla $ign]’s tour. We was all on the tour bus and it was a bunch of people I didn’t meet. Ty’s tour bus was like the fuckin’ Source Awards. But everybody was on there—Trouble, Migos, everybody. I’m going to introduce myself to everybody and everybody would be like, ‘Come on, dog, we know who you are. When we workin’? What we doin’?’ That was crazy, but I brought Jermaine [Dupri] out. I brought Hoodrich Pablo Juan out and he did a song; I brought [Lil] Scrappy out and he did 'Head Bussa.' And then I closed my set with Jermaine and he did 'Welcome to Atlanta' in Atlanta and the whole crowd went crazy. Like, no one really brings JD out to do that, so I’m thinking that’s Jay-Z level. That’s crazy. Do we have footage? I need that.”</p>

      <p>"I had a room, right? So I go in my hotel room and it was a girl that worked there. I don't know if she got drunk and got bold to do it, but when I go back in the room, she came out the drawer. She hid in my room until I got back and came out of the drawer. I think we were in Houston. I put her out—you gotta roll."</p>

      <p>“We were on the road with Dizzy Wright. I think it was like, Albuquerque, N.M. Or it might have been El Paso—one of those fuckin’ places. There were a bunch of fans arguing and screaming in the parking lot. Our security—his name is DJ—came and got me and was like, ‘Yo, you gotta check this out.’</p>
      <p>My first reaction is to jump in between them and try to make sure that everything’s cool, you know? Didn’t realize these kids were heavily gang-affiliated. You ever seen that movie, <i>Only the Strong</i>, where they sing, ‘Ba, na, na, weh,’ and they’re kinda stabbing at each other with knives and shit? It was some shit like that and I was in between them. They were trying to poke each other so I was like, ‘Y’all wanna keep having hip-hop shows? Y’all gotta stop this shit right now,’ so the crowd kinda dispersed. I foolishly thought it dispersed because I made an impact and I was like, 'Yeah, I fuckin’ killed this shit, brought the peace in.' Two seconds later, you hear tires screeching—one of the kids who was involved in the tussle, his peoples had pulled up. Crowd scatters. I’m not a street dude, like, fuck that shit. So I was like fuck it, I booked it to the merch, behind the merch truck. I was duckin’ and then the fighting still kept on going.</p>
      <p>Have you ever seen a hockey fight where they pull the shirt over? So these kids, one of them pulled the shirt over, he finally cut the other kid and he was just laying, bleeding in the parking lot. It was crazy. The police were on their own schedule. It was a good five, six minutes that passed. At a Dizzy Wright show, too. We’re like, peaceful; everybody’s chillin’.”</p>

      <p>"I was fuckin' performing and I just see something fly on the stage. This huge-ass item fly on the stage. Boom! I stopped the show. 'Yo, what the fuck? Who the fuck threw this shit on the stage?' I see a group of dudes ganged up in the corner. I'm like, 'Yo listen, I'ma fuck yall niggas up!' I continue the show, go home. I go in my Instagram messages, Some girl hits me up. She goes 'Did you get the cookie, filled with gelato, that I threw on the stage?' I'm like, 'Why would you throw some shit on the stage? You threw a cookie of all things. You had niggas in the crowd like, 'Ohhh,' why you do that shit?' I followed her right after though. We're friends now. I just hit her up the other day like, 'Yo, you good?'"</p>

      <p>"I've had crazy things happen. I've had a man ask me do I wanna have sex with his wife. Sometimes it won't be they wife. A muhfucka just be [like], 'This my gal, you can have her tonight Ke!' I be like, 'Nah'. I'm scared of that move really—that's too strong right there. I don't want that one. As far as like an autograph, women take they bra off, took they titty out: 'I want it on here!' I be like damn! Boy, I've had some women go far. They'll say any goddamn thing."</p>

      <p>“A whole show getting shut down because I guess it was getting too crazy. They pepper sprayed everyone in the crowd. It was an all-ages show. I had to sneak everyone out the back; it was getting too wild and people were climbing on the stage. It was crazy. It was in [Greater] Sudbury, Canada.”</p>

      <p>“My first tour, I went on the road with Tip. I’ve seen people fake pass out so he could run to their aide and try to save them. Then when he come over, they’re perfectly fine. Somebody peed on our tour bus before [<i>laughs</i>]. That’s probably the top two moments.”</p>

      <p>"When I was in Sweden, I stayed an extra day to two days. We were like, 'Fuck it, I'ma just see how many fans I have out here.' I was like, 'Yo, meet me here.' About 80 kids pulled up to my hotel. They're waiting to just take a picture with me and then dip. Some stayed, brought me weed, smoked it with me."</p>
