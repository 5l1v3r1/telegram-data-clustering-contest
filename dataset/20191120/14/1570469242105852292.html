      <p>Iranians have defeated the "enemy's conspiracy" and were celebrating their victory, President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday after deadly <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/iran-to-unblock-internet-once-abuse-stops-government-263177">nationwide protests</a> against a petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations broke out in the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/opinions/wion-edit-what-would-an-unstable-iran-mean-for-the-world-263349">Islamic republic</a> on Friday after it was announced the price of petrol would be immediately raised by as much as 200 per cent.</p>
      <p>"Our people have been victorious against... the enemy's conspiracy," Rouhani said in remarks at a meeting of his cabinet aired on state television.</p>
      <p>"Those anarchists who came out onto the streets were few in number," he said.</p>
      <p>"They were organised, armed anarchists" who took to the streets "based on a plot that the region's reactionary, the Zionists and Americans had hatched," he said, referring to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States.</p>
      <p>"You've seen in recent days huge spontaneous gatherings were held in various cities," including Zanjan, Shahr-e Kord and Zanjan among others, Rouhani said.</p>
      <p>"This is the biggest display of the power of the nation of Iran.</p>
      <p>"That is to say that the nation of Iran has shown the world its vigilance, awareness, unity and solidarity with the entire system" of the Islamic republic, he added.</p>
      <p>The protests began with motorists blocking major roads in the capital Tehran and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>They spread rapidly to at least 40 cities and towns, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including three security personnel stabbed by "rioters".</p>
      <p>But London-based rights group <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/more-than-100-protesters-believed-killed-in-iran-amnesty-263228">Amnesty International</a> said Tuesday that more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed.</p>
      <p>The full extent of the bloodshed is difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout, now in its fourth day.</p>
