      <p>A dad’s video of himself breastfeeding his daughter has gone viral after the internet praised the clip for being both inventive and adorable.</p>
      <p>The 8-second clip, posted to Twitter, shows the man holding the infant while she appears to be sucking from a bottle underneath his shirt.</p>
      <p>“Her mama gone and she wouldn’t take the bottle, so I had to trick her,” the caption reads.</p>
      <p>The clip has been retweeted more than 66,000 times and has over 288,000 likes.</p>
      <p>Many Twitter users praised the anonymous man as the dad of the year for doing whatever it takes to get his daughter to eat.</p>
      <p>“I love the innovation and ‘pure love’ this dad obviously has for his baby! Thanks for sharing!” a person tweeted.</p>
      <p>“This is what I call a real dad going the extra mile with some smart thinking! Kudos bro, fathers like him make me believe in mankind!” another Twitter user wrote.</p>
      <p>“The only thing that could spoil it for this wonderful dad is babies know the smell of their mamas:-) but still, very impressive A+ for effort!”</p>
      <p>“This is the kind of support woman needs! Take notes EVERYONE!” <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielatexas92/status/1196152626741751808">someone else commented.</a></p>
      <p>As adorable many commenters found the video to be, many pointed out that the young girl’s facial expression suggested she was skeptical of her dad’s breastfeeding tactic.</p>
      <p>“Don’t be fooled. Baby girl ain’t really fall for it,” one person tweeted. “Look at her face. She’s thinking, “Why this taste like fabric softener, tho’?!” If ever a face showed skepticism, this is it.”</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user wrote: “You know she’s like….I’m not buying it but I’ll give him points for trying.”</p>
