      <p>This won't be the first time that Tyga has performed in India: just last year he had a gig in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>The Sunburn event in Mumbai will not be the main festival: this year, the full-fledged music festival will be held in India’s beach-town Goa on 27 December, ahead of which world famous British-Norwegian DJ Alan Walker will also be touring for Sunburn across India.</p>
      <p>Along with Tyga and Alan Walker, other global music sensations like Chain Smokers, Martin Garrix, Flume and Jonas Blue will be performing in Goa later in December.</p>
      <p>Previously, artists including Wiz Khalifa, Dimitri Vegas, Like Mike, Afro Jack and DJ Snake have also been part of the music festival.</p>
