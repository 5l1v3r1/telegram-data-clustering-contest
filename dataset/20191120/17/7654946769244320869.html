      <h1>Devin Nunes argues Ukraine was ‘out to get’ Trump in 2016 election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:26:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Fredericks</a></address>
      <p>California Rep. Devin Nunes on Wednesday responded to EU Ambassador <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ambassador-gordon-sondland-testifies-there-was-a-quid-pro-quo-in-trumps-ukraine-dealings/">Gordon Sondland’s testimony</a> about a quid pro quo involving a Ukraine probe of Joe Biden’s son by detailing the country’s alleged efforts to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>The ranking GOP member on the House Intelligence Committee peppered Sondland with questions about what he knew about various theories involving Ukraine and the election.</p>
      <p>“I want to walk through some of those examples of why the president may be very upset with Ukraine and think that their country that’s out to get him as I think both you’ve said that and Ambassador [Kurt] Volker have said that,” he said, referring to a meeting in which Trump charged that Ukraine ‘tried to take me down.”</p>
      <p>Ukraine, Nunes said, wanted Clinton to win and Trump to lose, and released documents he described as “disputed” that led to criminal charges and a prison term for Trump’s one-time campaign manager Paul Manafort.</p>
      <p>He also pointed to comments in the media from Ukraine officials at the time that were critical of Trump prior to the election.</p>
      <p>Given those actions, Nunes said it “probably makes a little more sense now as to why the president may think that there’s problems with Ukraine and that Ukraine was out to get him.”</p>
      <p>“I understand your point,” Sondland replied.</p>
      <p>Sondland said in his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-gordon-sondlands-testimony/">opening statement to House impeachment investigators</a> that he raised concerns about a “quid pro quo” that tied a White House visit for Ukraine’s president to investigations Trump wanted into Joe Biden and his son Hunter as well as the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Sondland also said he came to understand that $391 in military aid was also linked to the probes into the Bidens and the 2016 election that the president had requested, according to his statement, which was obtained by The Post</p>
      <p>Sondland said that the actions he took were on orders from Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who was following the commander-in-chief’s direction.</p>
