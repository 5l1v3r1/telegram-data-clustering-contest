      <h3>Jimmy Kimmel</h3>
      <p>In Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> reacted to the third full day of televised impeachment hearings, this time featuring witnesses Lt Col Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine expert on the national security council, and Jennifer Williams, an aide to the vice-president, Mike Pence, on Russia. However, “if these impeachment proceedings have taught me anything”, said Kimmel, “it’s that there’s no sentence more depressing than: ‘The chair now recognizes Devin Nunes for 45 minutes.’”</p>
      <p>Nunes, a Trump stalwart from California, did not use his speaking time in the hearings to gather facts, “because those don’t look too good for Team Trump”, explained Kimmel. Instead, he lashed out at the media, which he called puppets of the Democratic party. “Someone who has the president’s knuckles so far up his butt they’re poking his tonsils – is that person allowed to call other people puppets?” said an unimpressed Kimmel. “We may have to ask Elmo to weigh in on that.”</p>

      <p>Nunes’s media screed echoed the strategy of other Trump loyalists such as the Ohio congressman Jim Jordan and Donald Trump Jr, who both tried to undermine Vindman’s credibility. “Their goal is to smear them, to confuse us, to bore us, to question the loyalty and patriotism of lifelong civil servants and even members of our military who’ve served heroically,” said a visibly frustrated Kimmel. “They’re intentionally damaging these Americans to protect the lowlife that they know is a lowlife. But they also know that defending him makes them popular amongst a certain group, so they do it anyway.”</p>
      <p>Vindman has a purple heart for military service, Kimmel continued, and they still tried to pick him apart. “The woman whose reputation they tried to stain works for Mike Pence! They’re actually trying to make us believe that a woman who voluntarily works for Mike Pence is on the other side!</p>
      <p>“We’re so used to these movies and TV shows where the criminal breaks down on the stand and confesses – it’s like we’re waiting for that to happen before we make a decision,” Kimmel continued. “But in real life – which, believe it or not, this is – that’s not how this goes. No one shouts ‘You can’t handle the truth!’”</p>
      <p>The information we have, Kimmel concluded, clearly adds up to one thing: “The president made it clear to Ukraine: ‘You’re not getting the money you need to keep your people alive unless you help me win the election, and that’s it.’”</p>
      <h3>Stephen Colbert</h3>
      <p>On the Late Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> also recapped the impeachment hearing testimony by Vindman. The Iraq war veteran began his time with a message to his father, who fled the Soviet Union 40 years ago, that he shouldn’t worry about his son speaking the truth in America. The statement was “beautiful”, said Colbert, “but you know it’s really going to enrage Trump because it features two of his least favorite things: immigrants and fathers who love their sons”.</p>

      <p>Throughout the testimony, Vindman expressed faith in American government to protect truth-tellers. “Yeah, in America, ‘right’, matters,” Colbert responded. “You know, unless you’re one of the congressmen on the right, then not so much these days.”</p>
      <p>Colbert also looked at several Republican efforts to undercut Vindman, such as the Utah congressman Chris Stewart’s attempt to throw shade at his military uniform. “I see you’re wearing your dress uniform, knowing that’s not the uniform of the day,” Stewart said. “You normally wear a suit to the White House. I think it’s a great reminder of your military service.”</p>
      <p>“Congressman, I see you’re wearing your little bitch face,” Colbert retorted. “It’s not the face the of the day, but it is a great reminder that you’re a total douche.”</p>
      <p>Then there was the Ohio congressman Jim Jordan, who tried to say Vindman’s superiors doubted his judgment; Vindman refuted the characterization by reading, verbatim, a sterling performance review from July.</p>
      <p>The review basically said, according to Colbert: “He uses excellent judgment, he plans ahead, he brings documents that rebut Jim Jordan’s weak-ass smack talk even before it leaves his dirty little mouth.”</p>
      <h3>Seth Meyers</h3>

      <p>And on Late Night, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a> reviewed the Republican attempts to discredit both Vindman and Williams. Trump, for instance, said he doesn’t know Vindman and had never heard of him. “You’ve never heard of him?” said an incredulous Meyers. “I mean it’s one thing to say you’ve never met him, but he’s been in the news for weeks. I mean, I’ve never watched the Masked Singer but I know it’s a TV show.”</p>
      <p>Meyers also pointed to the Texas congressman John Ratcliffe, a Republican who insisted that the hearings were pointless because neither witness had used, in any of their depositions, the specific word “bribery”.</p>
      <p>“That’s your argument? He can’t be guilty because they didn’t use that exact word?” Meyers marveled. “Republicans must spend all their time reading the federal code looking for crimes Trump isn’t guilty of. ‘Let’s see here … extortion – guilty. Fraud – yeah, he’s guilty on that. Uh, what about speeding? Has he ever run a red light?”</p>
