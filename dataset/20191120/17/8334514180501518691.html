      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nominee for the U.S. State Department’s number-two position said on Wednesday he had no reason to doubt reports about China’s treatment of ethnic minorities, including the Uighurs, and the elimination of Muslim heritage sites.</p>
      <p>“I have no reason to question the veracity of these, and in fact I think all of these reports suggest an appalling type of behavior that is targeted against an ethnic population and a religious community in China, and it’s unacceptable,” Stephen Biegun said during his hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
