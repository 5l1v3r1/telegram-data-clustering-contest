      <p>Best Buy is shaving $100 off of <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">the regular price</a> of this 55-inch LG 4K Smart TV, in its latest sale. Meaning that you can pick up this TV for just $399. That is a really great deal for this TV and one you won't see for long.</p>
      <p>This TV is part of the UM7300PUA series, which is a 2019 model. So you're getting the latest and greatest LCD TV from LG here, for just $399.</p>
      <p>As mentioned already, this is a 55-inch 4K TV, with an LCD panel. So it's not an OLED unfortunately, though if it were, this would be an instant buy â€“ those are normally north of $1000 even on sale. The picture on this one is still pretty good, but obviously not on the same par as OLED or even QLED.</p>

      <p>Blacks on this LCD TV are still pretty gray. That's to be expected on LCD's since there is a backlight in there.</p>
      <p>There are three HDMI ports available on this TV, as well as two USB ports. There is also the usual array of Optical, Composite and Ethernet ports included. This TV also has Bluetooth.</p>
      <p>Running on this TV is webOS. That's LG's proprietary operating system, that actually works really well. It also has a number of great apps available for you to play movies and TV shows off of. That includes <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/you-can-buy-verizon-stream-tv-android-tv-box-no+netflix.html">Netflix</a>, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and so much more.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There's also both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant support available, so no matter which assistant platform you prefer to use, you'll be all set here. Which is definitely great to see.</p>
      <p>You can pick up this 55-inch LG 4K Smart TV from Best Buy in this sale <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-55-class-led-um7300pua-series-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr%2F6334026.p%3FskuId%3D6334026">by clicking here.</a> This price won't last long though, so you'll need to get it before it's gone.</p>
