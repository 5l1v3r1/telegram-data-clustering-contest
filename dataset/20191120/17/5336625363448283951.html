      <h1>Elon Musk tells employees smoking weed with Joe Rogan was 'not wise'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:14:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/brenda-stolyar/" target="_blank">Brenda Stolyar</a></address>
      <p>Remember that time <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-smokes-weed/">Elon Musk smoked weed</a> on The Joe Rogan Experience? And then NASA had to conduct a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/nasa-review-space-x-elon-musk-weed/">pricey</a> investigation into SpaceX? Afterwards, Musk admitted to his employees that his actions were "not wise."</p>
      <p>The billionaire sent an email to his team to let them know he's sorry for what he did and to remind them that SpaceX is a drug-free environment, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/18/boeing-faced-only-limited-safety-review-nasa-while-spacex-got-full-examination/"><i>Washington Post</i> reports.</a></p>
      <p>In a copy of the email obtained by the<i> Post</i>, Musk not only takes responsibility for smoking weed but for smoking weed "with no skill, obviously." Of course, he also made sure to point out that he didn't break the law. After all, marijuana <i>is</i> legal in the state of California where the infamous puff took place.</p>
      <p>He also wanted to make it clear that weed isn't welcome in the SpaceX workplace. “SpaceX personnel may not use or posses any controlled substance while in the workplace, and also may not be under the influence of legal or illegal drugs while at work," Musk wrote.</p>
      <p>Now, nowhere in the note does he say that employees can't indulge in some marijuana <i>outside</i> of work. But if you waltz into work clearly under the influence, be prepared to pee in a cup. Musk made sure to include that “anyone who appears to be inebriated or under the influence while at work is subject to drug testing and potentially other employment actions.” </p>

      <p>As for that $5 million review, NASA spokesperson Josh Finch told the <i>Post</i> that SpaceX employees of all levels ranging from senior and mid-level managers to engineers were interviewed about things like safety procedures, drug policies, and training. </p>
      <p>SpaceX also has its very own anonymous tip line called "safety net." Employees can call to report any safety concerns, likely code for: If your co-worker looks and sounds high, he's probably high. Phone it in. </p>
      <p>Boeing, on the other hand, didn't receive as thorough of a review, which might have to do with the fact that said review would cost a whopping $25 million. At which point, NASA basically said, nah. Finch confirmed to the Post that instead "a review of documents" and "a limited number of interviews with company personnel" would suffice. </p>
      <p>The limited review of Boeing isn't, um, concerning at all, considering the two <a href="https://mashable.com/article/boeing-737-max-plane-crashes-reputation-passenger-outlook/">fatal crashes</a> that happened within a five-month span earlier this year. But hey, sometimes the price for safety is just too high. </p>
