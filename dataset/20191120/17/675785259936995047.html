      <h1>Man Utd handed Luke Shaw injury boost ahead of crunch festive period</h1>
      <h2>Luke Shaw's hamstring problem has kept him out since the third game of the season but he has stepped up his recovery for Man Utd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:56:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have welcomed Luke Shaw, Axel Tuanzebe and Nemanja Matic back to first-team training ahead of Sunday's trip to Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>The trio have all been on the sidelines recently, with Shaw's hamstring problem keeping him out since the third game of the season, while Tuanzebe and Matic have not featured in over a month.</p>
      <p>They joined a first-team group at the Aon Training Complex on Wednesday, though numbers were still down due to ongoing returns from the international break.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay, who pulled out of the Scotland squad after taking a knock in last week's win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> , did not take part, making fellow midfielder Matic's return all the more important.</p>

      <p>Three other rehabilitating players, Eric Bailly, Timothy Fonsu-Mensah (both knee) and Diogo Dalot, were given a separate workout but are not yet ready to rejoin the squad.</p>
      <p>Full-back Ashley Young is available at the weekend after suspension.</p>
      <p>Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will provide a further update on the duo when he speaks to the press on Friday.</p>

      <p>The Blades, meanwhile, will have to call on their goalkeeping reserves as on-loan Red Devils shot-stopper Dean Henderson is ineligible to face his parent club.</p>
      <p>Simon Moore and Michael Verrips will battle for the place between the sticks for Chris Wilder's men.</p>
      <p>Defender John Egan limped out of Ireland's Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark and faces a race against time to be fit to face the Old Trafford side.</p>
