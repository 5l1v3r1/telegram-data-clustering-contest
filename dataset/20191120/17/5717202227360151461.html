      <p>Harry Redknapp has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT (Wednesday, 7.40am) that Jose Mourinho will receive an enormous £5million bonus if he can deliver Tottenham into the top four this season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino in the Tottenham dugout after Daniel Levy decided to end Pochettino’s five-and-a-half-year stay at Tottenham, following a very poor start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs sit in 14th place with just three wins from 12 Premier League games. They have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup and though on course to qualify for the Champions League knockout stages, they were beaten 7-2 by Bayern Munich at home.</p>
      <p>With almost a third of the Premier League season gone, Mourinho is up against the odds to finish in the top four places and qualify for next season’s Champions League. But Redknapp reckons that if he does, he will be given a £5million bonus.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">“If Jose gets Spurs into the Champions League, he’ll cop about £5million. A little incentive to keep him going,” Redknapp said.<br/></span>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Can Mourinho deliver top-four finish at Tottenham?</h3>
      <p>For Mourinho to be a success at Tottenham, his first port of call is getting the Spurs players onside. Many players will feel like they have lost a father figure at Spurs in Pochettino, and Mourinho will be tasked with the ‘moving-on’ process.</p>
      <p>Re-installing confidence, spending money wisely in January and getting the team selection right is crucial. If any players want to leave Spurs, they should not be given game time – an area where Pochettino went wrong.</p>
      <p>There are a few things to consider but if Mourinho gets them right, a top-four finish is on the cards.</p>
