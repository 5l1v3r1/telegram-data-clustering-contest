      <blockquote>PR TIP FOR TACHA AKIDE<br/><br/>My second degree is a FIRST CLASS in Public Relations Management. USA’s renowned @gouchercollege school of Public Relations.<br/>In PR, you must maintain professional relationships to properly portray your client to the media. PR is NOT promotion. Some Publicists take up management roles and vice versa but looking at @teebillz323 who many in the industry has professed that his relationship with Tacha Akide will “end in tears” according to Joy, should keep it strictly professional. Tunji this is a $500 advise I’m giving you FREE. This is the same problem I have with Nigerians at home. Calling me Aunty, Mummy etc. No more familiarity and disrespecting my children who mummy is reserved for. Tacha is your CLIENT, Stop calling her “my daughter” in a management scenario. In real life she’s old enough to be your sister not close to your daughter. But take this girl International and stop calling her “my daughter”. Her fanbase ONLINE are really trying to bring her down but none of you see that yet. Good Luck<br/>.<br/>.<br/>#Kemitalksmotivation<br/>#KeminicationsDigital<br/>#KemiOlunloyo #DrKemi</blockquote>
