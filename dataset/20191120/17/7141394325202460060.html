      <h1>ShapeShift Aims to Revolutionize Bitcoin and Crypto Industry With New Token for Zero-Commission Trades</h1>

      <p>In a bid to revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry, ShapeShift, a leading self-custody digital asset exchange, is launching free trading. Users can now make trades without having to pay fees.  </p>
      <p>ShapeShift is reportedly the first crypto trading platform to allow free trading between different digital currencies. The company says it aims to “entice users away from custodial exchanges” and directs traders to its <a href="https://coincap.io/rate-compare">comparison list</a> of competitive fees.</p>

      <p>ShapeShift introduced its non-custodial trading model in 2014 enabling users to maintain control of their assets at all times.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shapeshift-brings-zero-commission-trading-to-crypto-300961373.html">company</a>,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“By promoting self-custody, ShapeShift is taking further steps to make a borderless, decentralized financial system a reality.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to offering zero-commission trading, ShapeShift is launching its own FOX digital token. Users of its new trading platform will get 100 FOX tokens each and can continue to make zero-commission trades by holding the tokens.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://medium.com/shapeshift-stories/you-can-now-trade-crypto-for-free-with-shapeshift-e1d84753c7de">says</a> self-sovereignty is essential to a borderless, digital financial future.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It is the whole point. Yet, most people still trust their crypto to a 3rd party. The big exchanges are unanimously custodial.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>ShapeShift’s goal — today as it was five years ago — is to make self-custody a seamless and enjoyable experience, because this will help the world move toward self-sovereign finance, and away from fiat. Decentralized digital assets are the future, and we will always champion their advancement.”</i>
