      <p>Amazon-owned audiobook and radio company Audible <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/essex/2019/05/20/amazon-audible-turns-newark-second-presbyterian-church-into-hip-work-space-innovation-cathedral/3708819002/">opened a new office</a> in a historic Presbyterian church its hometown of Newark, New Jersey in May.</p>
      <p>Audible is headquartered in Newark, New Jersey, where it moved in 2007. It has since become the city’s fastest-growing private employer, and its new “Innovation Cathedral” is located about a block away from the headquarters. In the renovation, it preserved historic elements while updating other features, and making additions for workspaces.</p>
      <p>The new workspace is part of Audible’s commitment to Newark, according to founder and CEO Don Katz.</p>
      <p>The cathedral is “proof that our efforts are yielding positive outcomes for business and invention culture, for the many talented people who want to work with us, and for the comeback of this great American city.”</p>
      <p>Audible also gives a $500 monthly stipend to employees living within Newark city limits, provides Amazon Fire tablets to Newark high school students, and offers those students paid internships. These policies are part of what Katz calls the “responsibility all corporations must take seriously” to invest in their communities.</p>
