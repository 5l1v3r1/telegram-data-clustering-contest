        <b>A sequel to the hugely popular Joker origins film is reportedly in the works.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Todd Phillips' film has been a massive box office hit, it's already passed the $1 billion mark, which saw it move past Deadpool to become the highest-grossing R-rated film ever.</p>
      <p>Joaquin Phoenix's stunning performance has led to plenty of speculation about a sequel, with the actor indicating he'd be happy to work with Phillips again and reprise the role.</p>
      <p>A sequel is now in final-stage discussion according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, the publication reports that Phillips and Phoenix are "likely to reteam".</p>
      <p>The director is set to write the screenplay for the Joker sequel along with co-writer Scott Silver, who he worked with on the script for the original.</p>

      <p>The box office returns for Joker were enough for Warner Bros to agree to Phillips' request to direct another DC Comics origins story, rumoured to be about Batman's nemesis Lex Luthor.</p>
      <p>A new Batman film is currently being shot by Matt Reeves, with Robert Pattinson in the lead role.</p>
      <p><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> add that Phillips will earn around $100 million from his work on the film, after agreeing a similar percentage profit share deal to the one he negotiated for The Hangover (which cost $35 million and made $468 million).</p>
      <p>Phillips previously said a Joker sequel couldn't just be "this wild and crazy movie", adding: "It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that [Joker] does."</p>
