      <h1>Vegetarian 'chicken wings' part of new pit-style barbecue menu at Nottingham city centre bar</h1>
      <h2>There's PLENTY for meat-eaters too</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Gorman</a></address>
      <p>Popular city centre boozer Albert's (formerly Spanky's) has added yet another string to its bow, with a permanent kitchen takeover from a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/">street food</a> favourite.</p>
      <p>The down-right dirty barbecue scran - which is currently being served tapas-style - is being rustled up by pop-up regular Az Smith, the 'pit boss' of Smiffy's Smokehouse.</p>
      <p>Offering small plates of soft wheat tacos (£5.50 each or two for £10) and sharing plates (£4 each or three for a tenner) it's the perfect pub food to tuck in with mates over a pint or two (or three, if it's the weekend).</p>
      <p>Meaty taco options (all served with shredded lettuce, salsa, creme fresh, pickled red onion and a secret sauce) include cherry smoked beef cheek, apple smoked Mexican chicken and 16-hour pulled pork.</p>
      <p>Portions are certainly hearty with the two tacos failing to contain the generous portions, which happily come with plenty of lime and coriander to take the sting out of the hot but tasty dressing.</p>

      <p>The same dishes can also be ordered at tapas plates (garnished with spring onion, pepper and Smiffy's own sauce) making it easier to share and less likely to result in food envy of your neighbouring diner.</p>
      <p>Amongst the carnivore's in our party the chicken and pulled pork came out trumps, with little need for the kitchen to actually rinse the rustic-style dishes as they had actually been licked clean.</p>
      <p>Happily vegetarian diners have not been left out from all the naughty junk food fun.</p>
      <p>On the tapas menu there are vegetarian 'chicken wings' - which for a long-standing veggie gave the cheap thrill of looking like the real deal.</p>
      <p>Southern fried in beer batter the 'chicken' (actually cauliflower) was crispy, spicy and so delicious, no one else got a look in.</p>
      <p>The drunk beans were also a treat and not too starchy but instead nice and saucy with plenty of bite left.</p>
      <p>The five plates, the three of us shared, was more than enough to keep us going for the evening and (minus the beer) would set you back £20., making it pretty reasonable value.</p>
      <p>Best of all chef Az tells Nottinghamshire Live some larger plates will be appearing on the menu soon.</p>
