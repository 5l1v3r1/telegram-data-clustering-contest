      <h1>₹4.35 crore house tax notice on Anand Bhavan</h1>
      <h2>No tax paid after 1990, says Mayor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:41:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/PRESS-TRUST-OF-INDIA-6101/" target="_blank">PRESS TRUST OF INDIA</a></address>
      <p>A notice for the non-payment of house tax amounting to ₹4.35 crore has been slapped on Anand Bhavan — the ancestral house of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru — by the Allahabad Municipal Corporation.</p>
      <p>Confirming it, Mayor Abhilasha Gupta ‘Nandi’ on Wednesday said that the notice was sent a week ago as officials at Anand Bhavan could not provide any document proving that it was a charitable building.</p>
      <p>The Mayor said the officials had also claimed that the building was handed over (to the government) as a heritage of the nation.</p>
      <p>“However, the papers supporting their claims are not with them, and are not given to us,” the Mayor said.</p>
      <p>She added that the Anand Bhavan officials were seeking discount, but on what basis it should be given, they were unable to justify.</p>
      <h3>‘Entry fee charged’</h3>
      <p>“They are saying that their building is not commercial, but when the birth anniversary of former PM Indira Gandhi is celebrated, a ticket worth ₹50 is purchased by a visitor. You also charge tickets for the museum,” she said, adding that if the building was handed over to the government as a heritage structure, then it should have control over it.</p>
      <p>The Mayor further said, “They used to give a tax of ₹600 till 1990. After 1990, they have not given any tax.”</p>
