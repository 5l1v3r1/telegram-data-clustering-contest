      <h1>Cambuslang baker lands awards at cake show - thanks to Sylvester Stallone</h1>
      <h2>Anna Dillon won gold and silver at the Cake International competition at the NEC in Birmingham.</h2>

      <p>A Cambuslang baker’s remarkable confectionery creations resulted in sweet success at the world’s biggest cake show.</p>
      <p>Anna Dillon rose to the challenge and iced competition from around the globe to land herself not one, but two prestigious accolades at the glittering event.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Drumsagard</a> resident’s extraordinary cakes bagged her a gold and silver award at the Cake International competition at the NEC in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Anna’s incredibly lifelike Sylvester Stallone creation complete with “muscles and wrinkles” put her on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/cambuslang-boxing-girl-ruby-rocky-13399949">Rocky road</a> to gold at the international competition.</p>
      <p>And an equally impressive replica of Poppy, the family pet, scooped silver.</p>
      <p>A delighted Anna told the Reformer: “To get gold and silver is an absolute dream come true.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect it at all.</p>
      <p>“Poppy, our Beagle pup, is only eight months old and we all love her, so I thought, ‘I’m going to design a cake of her’.</p>

      <p>“She’s standing on one leg with those crazy eyes in an action shot because that shows her at her best.</p>
      <p>“Plus no-one has ever done a dog standing on one leg before so I went for it. I am so happy my wee Poppy won a prize.</p>
      <p>“As for my <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/tv-radio/tattooed-thai-boxing-scot-wows-14062707">Sylvester Stallone</a> , the inspiration for that came because the characteristics of his face are really good to recreate.</p>
      <p>“He looks amazing, so it was really good to get his wrinkles and muscles included.</p>
      <p>“To beat people from China, Japan, Italy and Germany left me totally gobsmacked, but also delighted.”</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old care worker started baking eight years ago when she owned a snack van and made tray bakes to sell.</p>

      <p>From there, Anna was asked to make birthday cakes for friends and family which then snowballed into baking the elaborate efforts she enters for competitions.</p>
      <p>Other famous faces Anna has recreated include the late George Michael, Bruce Forsyth and Freddie Mercury, as well as Wolverine and even ET.</p>
      <p>“From baking to decorating something like Sylvester Stallone takes about four days but I really love it, it’s a great passion of mine,” Anna explained.</p>
      <p>“I have another competition in April in London that I’m looking forward to.</p>
      <p>“My husband is so supportive of me competing; he isn’t creative but he certainly enjoys the fact that I am always baking at home.”</p>
      <p>Anna’s recent success has landed her a plum role on the judging panel of a competition next September.</p>
      <p>The organisers of the Scottish Baking Awards have asked her to judge the novelty cake category next year alongside some celebrity judges.</p>

      <p>Anna added: “I am honestly so excited. Especially when we have Phil and Christine Jenson from Extreme Cake Makers judging the same class as me.</p>
      <p>“I introduced myself to Phil earlier in the month and he said he knew who I was.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was dreaming. It was surreal. I couldn’t believe Phil from Extreme Cake Makers knew little me and my cakes.”</p>
