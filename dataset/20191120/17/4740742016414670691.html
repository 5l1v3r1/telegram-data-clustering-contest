      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:28:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">Bristol city centre's</a> newest bar and restaurant is now just one week away from opening.</p>
      <p>Bocabar, based at the Paintworks off Bath Road, is launching its second site in Bristol at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/le-vignoble-bar-wine-tap-3545778">Finzels Reach</a> on Thursday, November 28, creating a hub for drinking, dining and socialising.</p>
      <p>Open seven days a week, the team behind Bocabar said it will have an 'eclectic feel, combining a vintage and rustic look with a little bit of luxury'.</p>
      <p>They added people can expect to find 'velvet drapes in the doorways, vintage lamps, reclaimed wood and copper features'.</p>
      <p>Bocabar owners Mel and Paul Eavis, who started the business 15 years ago, have today announced the chef team behind the new venture.</p>

      <p>Head chef of its Paintworks venue, Jason McNeilly, will also oversee the kitchens at the Finzels Reach site.</p>
      <p>He will be joined by chef Jacob Norris, previously head chef at the Spotted Cow and the Sheppy Inn in Godney, and Ben Sacree, head pizza chef, previously of B-Block in Keynsham.</p>
      <p>Melissa said: "We're ecstatic to be so close to opening our exciting new restaurant and bar at Finzels Reach and we can't wait to welcome everyone in to try it out.</p>
      <h3>'A perfect fit'</h3>
      <p>"We've brought together the 'best bits' of our Paintworks and Glastonbury restaurants to develop a truly unique menu.</p>
      <p>"For us, Finzels Reach was a perfect fit for our business as it's right in the heart of the city and part of an established community of independent cafes and bars - we also love the character and charm of the Fermentation Buildings."</p>
      <p>The new venue will serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, including a menu of 25 different stone-baked pizzas, gourmet burgers, sharing mezze plates and daily specials focusing on small, local suppliers and seasonal ingredients.</p>
      <p>To wash it all down there will be cocktails, specialist gins, local craft beers and wines, with the bar aiming to offer something for everyone.</p>
