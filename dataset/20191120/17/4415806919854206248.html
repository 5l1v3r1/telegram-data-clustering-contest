      <p>A judge in London has ruled on a trans-Atlantic row over baby bath design after two firms, one from the North, fell out.</p>
      <p>Shnuggle, which is based in Newtownards, County Down, said Munchkin, which is based in Van Nuys, California, had infringed its design rights.</p>
      <p>Munchkin disputed Shnuggle’s claims.</p>
      <p>Judge Melissa Clarke has made rulings in favour of Munchkin after overseeing a trial at the High Court.</p>
      <p>She concluded that Munchkin’s “Sit &amp; Soak” bath was not a copy of Shnuggle Designs.</p>
      <p>The judge said she had last bought a baby bath 13 years ago.</p>
      <p>She said that bath was little more than an “elongated bucket” and designs had now become significantly more sophisticated.</p>
