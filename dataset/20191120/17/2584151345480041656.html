      <p>President Donald Trump sought to downplay bombshell testimony Gordon Sondland delivered to impeachment investigators that tied the president ever closer to a quid pro quo involving Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much," Trump told reporters. "This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though."</p>
      <p>Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, told the House Intelligence Committee earlier in the day that Ukraine needed to deliver politically motivated investigations Trump sought.</p>
      <p>“Was there a ‘quid pro quo?’” Sondland said. “The answer is yes.”</p>
