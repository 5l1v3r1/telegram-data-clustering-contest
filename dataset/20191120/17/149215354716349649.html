      <p>The U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, is a key witness in the ongoing House impeachment hearings, and before he testified Wednesday, both Democrats and Republicans were well aware he could <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879613/republicans-are-nervous-gordon-sondland-flip-trump-democrats-are-worried-wont">make or break their cases.</a> Ranking House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) nevertheless appeared confident in his opening remarks, noting that he anticipated Sondland would have his reputation "smeared" by the Democrats over the course of the next several hours.</p>
      <p>The GOP's tone swiftly changed when Sondland was given his turn to speak. The ambassador confirmed a quid pro quo between the Trump administration and Ukraine, and said he was following orders <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879653/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-points-finger-directly-trump">from the president</a> to pressure Kyiv into opening an investigation into the Bidens. Clinton impeachment prosecutor Ken Starr went as far as to call Wednesday a "<a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879707/ken-starr-sondland-testimony-over">bombshell day</a>" due to Sondland's dramatic flip.</p>
      <p>Republicans, naturally, didn't feel so peachy about Sondland by the time it was their turn to speak. Steve Castor, the Republican attorney, went as far as to — yep — smear Sondland's credibility. "You don't have records, you don't have notes because you don't take notes, you don't have recollections," he bashed. "This is a trifecta of unreliability."</p>
      <p>It didn't matter that the smear was coming from his own party; Sondland wasn't having any of it. Watch below. Jeva Lange</p>
