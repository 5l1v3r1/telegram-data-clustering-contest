      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi movement said on Wednesday it intercepted an F-15 warplane of the Saudi-led coalition near the border with Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>“Our air defense systems have intercepted an F-15 fighter jet belonging to the countries of aggression in Saada province,” the group’s military spokesman said in a Twitter post.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate confirmation from the coalition that has been battling the group for more than four years.</p>
      <p>(This story corrects throughout to say warplane intercepted, not shot down.)</p>
