      <h1>Lizzo Leads The Field Of Grammy Nominees With Eight Nominations And Sets Record With Billie Eilish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:26:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p>The nominations for the <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/alicia-keys-announced-as-grammy-host-for-the-second-straight-year-340796/">62nd Grammy Awards</a> have been announced, and Lizzo’s amazing year continues as she led the entire field with a whopping eight nominations. The singer also set a record along with 17-year-old Billie Eilish – who received a total of six nominations – when the two became the first artists in Grammy history to receive nominations in all four general field categories.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, Lizzo surprised the music world with her eight nominations that include Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Solo Performance. And Eilish became the youngest artist to receive nominations in all four general field categories with her nods for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist.</p>

      <p>Lil Nas X led the way for the guys, as he scored six nominations. And, the most amazing thing is that Lizzo, Eilish, and Lil Nas X are all first-time nominees.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, Taylor Swift was shut out of the Album of the Year and Record of the Year categories, but she will be going up against Beyonce and Ariana Grande in the Best Pop Solo Performance category. Both Swift and Beyonce scored four nominations, and Grande garnered five nods, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year.</p>
      <p>Lady Gaga received three nominations for the soundtrack to <i>A Star Is Born</i>, which was not eligible last year because it was released after the cut-off date. And, former First Lady MIchelle Obama received a nomination for Best Spoken World Album.</p>
      <p>Industry experts immediately noticed the “snubbing” of <i>Beyonce’s Homecoming: The Live Album</i>, which was thought to be the frontrunner in all of the major categories. Maren Morris was also expected to score a number of nominations – including Album of the Year – but only landed one nod for best country duo/group performance.</p>

      <p>Ed Sheeran only received one nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album for his latest release <i>No. 6 Collaborations Project,</i> and Bruce Springsteen, Halsey, and Sam Smith were completely shut out.</p>
      <p>Nipsey Hussle received three posthumous nominations after his tragic death in April when he was shot outside of his Marathon Clothing store in South Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The <i>62nd Annual Grammy Awards</i> – hosted by Alicia Keys – will air January 26th on CBS.</p>
