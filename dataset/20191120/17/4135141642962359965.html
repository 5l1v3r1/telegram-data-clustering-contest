      <h1>Cruickshank having best season for Badgers kick returner in over 40 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:00:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Heller</a></address>
      <p>A couple of weeks ago in the Young <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/wisconsin-badgers-team">Badgers</a> Tracker we observed “With the Badgers perhaps looking for a little spark, maybe [<a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/aron-cruickshank-player-stats">Aron] Cruickshank</a> is the player to do it.”</p>
      <p>Against Nebraska, Cruickshank did indeed supply Wisconsin with a little boost. His 89-yard kick return for a touchdown in the first quarter tied the game at 7 and put some juice into the Badgers, who would eventually win 37-21.</p>
      <p>It was the first kick return for a TD for Wisconsin since Natrell Jamerson did it against Maryland on Nov. 7, 2015 and just the fifth since 2000. Cruickshank finished with three returns for 133 yards.</p>
      <p>Cruickshank now is averaging 28.4 yards per his 15 returns. Quite simply, if he can keep up that average it will be one of the top kick return seasons for Wisconsin in over 40 years.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin uses a minimum of 10 returns to qualify among its single-season leaders. Since 2000, the Badgers have had only two players average better than 25 yards per return who had at least 10 kick returns: Kenzel Doe (26.5 on 20 returns in 2013) and Brandon Williams (28.0 on 22 returns in 2005).</p>
      <p>The only UW returners who had a better average than Cruickshank in that span are Jared Abbrederis (37.0 on three returns in 2010) and Lee Evans (one return for 34 yards in 2000).</p>
      <p>Cruickshank is currently tied for third on Wisconsin’s single-season kick return average list (again, min. 10 returns). The top three all occurred in the 1970s – Ira Matthews, 29.6 in 1976; Danny Crooks, 29.3 in 1970 and Greg Johnson, 28.4 in 1971.</p>
      <p>For what it’s worth, only two players have more than one kick return for a TD in Wisconsin history: Matthews in 1976 and Nick Davis in 1999 each had two. Cruickshank has a few games left to try and tie that record.</p>
      <p>Here’s the complete rundown of the young Badgers after 10 games:<b><br/></b><br/><b>“TRUE” FRESHMEN<br/></b><u><a href="https://www.foxsports.com/college-football/keeanu-benton-player-stats">Keeanu Benton</a>, NT<br/></u>South Florida: 2 tackles (solo), TFL<br/>Central Michigan: Started, 1 tackle (solo), TFL<br/>Michigan: Started, 1 tackle, QBH<br/>Northwestern: Played, did not record a statistic<br/>Kent State: Played, did not record a statistic<br/>Michigan State: Started, did not record a statistic<br/>Illinois: Did not play<br/>Ohio State: Started, 3 tackles (2 solo), sack, TFL<br/>Iowa: Started. 2 tackles (2 solo), QBH<br/>Nebraska: Started, 1 tackle<br/><b>Season totals: </b>10 tackles (6 solo), sack, 3 TFL, 2 QBH</p>
