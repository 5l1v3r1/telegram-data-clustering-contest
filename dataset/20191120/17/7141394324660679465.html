      <p>An entrepreneurship center at the University of Oxford says it’s joining Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI).</p>
      <p>On its LinkedIn page, the Oxford Foundry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/oxford-foundry-partners-ripples-university-blockchain-oxford-foundry/">announced</a> its plans to join the initiative.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Oxford Foundry has announced its plans to tackle the growing technology skills gap in the UK with a new partnership with leading blockchain technology provider Ripple and its University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI).</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Through the Foundry’s new Tech Series, up to 1,000 University of Oxford students from across all Oxford colleges and divisions will be given the opportunity to gain new skills in blockchain, AI and machine learning across different industries. Students will also be given the opportunity to learn how to code in Python and build smart contracts.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Foundry was created by the University of Oxford’s Saïd Business School to <a href="https://www.oxfordfoundry.ox.ac.uk/what-oxford-foundry">give students</a> a way to “co-create, collaborate and build solutions to global challenges.”</p>
      <p>It includes a startup accelerator that offers pre-selected startups a place to build their projects and collaborate.</p>
      <p>Ripple formed the UBRI in June of 2018 to collaborate with top universities around the globe to accelerate academic research, technical development and innovation in blockchain, cryptocurrency and digital payments.</p>
      <p>Kyoto University, which joined the initiative this summer, launched an XRP validator last week that will help the network verify and process transactions on the ledger.</p>
