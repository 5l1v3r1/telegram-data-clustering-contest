      <p>This collection is visually striking as it was filmed in the Bavarian Alps, which is known for mountains, castles, magical lakes, among other stunning scenery.</p>
      <p>In this well-crafted film, Brightman truly immerses her fans and listeners into her whimsical, musical world. It is divided into two acts, where it opens with "Gothica" and it is followed by "Fleur Du Mal" and "Stranger in Paradise," where it is evident that Brightman's voice is still powerful as ever.</p>
