      <h1>How to try the Facebook festive photo trend that turns your family into a cartoon</h1>
      <h2>The social network has got into the Christmas spirit - this is how you can have a go at home</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:44:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Gill</a></address>
      <p>It's the festive Facebook fad that seems to be taking the social media network by storm.</p>
      <p>The latest craze sees cartoon versions of people and their families - complete with a Christmas backdrop.</p>
      <p>And if you've been on the social media page today you'll have no doubt seen them cropping up on friends' pages, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/how-make-facebook-cartoon-family-17286080">Manchester Evening News reports</a> .</p>
      <p>But how is it done?</p>
      <p>Well the site wasn't set up for this purpose. It's actually a website where people can personalise their own Christmas mugs.</p>
      <p>The  <a href="https://www.mademine.com/products/christmas-best-friends-coffee-mugs">MadeMine site</a>  lets people select the number of people and pets in their family, add their names and even choose their hair colour and style to make it truer to life.</p>
      <p>Once designed, people are then sharing their creation on Facebook.</p>
      <p>There are various backdrops to choose from, but the family at the fireside seems to be proving most popular.</p>
      <p>You can order the mugs too if you like and with the Black Friday sale they're reduced from £30.85 to £18.50. Visit the  <a href="https://www.mademine.com/products/christmas-best-friends-coffee-mugs">website</a>  for more details.</p>
