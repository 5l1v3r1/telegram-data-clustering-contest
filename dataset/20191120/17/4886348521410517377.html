      <p><a href="https://www.ccn.com/treasury-yields-fall-again-economy-teeters-contraction/">U.S. government debt yields</a> extended their slide on Wednesday, as China trade tensions and fears of an overvalued stock market drove investors into the relative safety of bonds.</p>
      <h3>Treasury Yields Fall</h3>
      <p>The move into government bonds continued Wednesday, as Treasury yields touched fresh multi-week lows. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.73%, its lowest since Nov. 2. Yields fall as bond prices rise.</p>

      <p>The long end of the yield curve also fell, with the 30-year Treasury note hitting a low of 2.19%. That’s a decline of roughly 6 basis points from Tuesday’s close.</p>
      <p>Bond markets are becoming more sensitive to trade-war speculation as investors continue to hedge against political uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Progress towards a ‘phase one’ trade deal between the U.S. and China hit a stumbling block Tuesday after President Trump threatened Beijing with more tariffs. The developments prompted investors to move <a href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-dips-gold-rises-as-trump-derails-u-s-china-trade-talks/">capital into safe-haven assets</a>, with government bonds and gold benefiting.</p>
      <h3>Stocks are Overbought: JPMorgan Chase Analyst</h3>
      <p>An analyst at JPMorgan Chase has warned that the U.S. stock market is “overbought” following the record-setting gains of the past few weeks. Ironically, he’s not advising investors to sell just yet. Quite the contrary: The investment bank is still bullish on the S&amp;P 500.</p>
      <p>Jason Hunter, the firm’s head of global fixed income and U.S. equity technical strategy, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/stocks-are-overbought-but-jp-morgans-jason-hunter-wouldnt-sell-now.html">told CNBC on Tuesday</a> that,</p>
      <blockquote>We have a bullish view on the S&amp;P going into the early part of next year at least … You’re going to see further rotation away from defensives.</blockquote>
      <p>Regarding the “overbought” nature of the market, Hunter said,</p>
      <blockquote>You do have overbought momentum right now after a prolonged period of sideways price action … Typically, what you tend to see is momentum will peak before the price trend actually does.</blockquote>
      <p>Apparently, investors are “panic buying” to capitalize on the bullish revival. The S&amp;P 500, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-price/">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> and Nasdaq Composite Index have each set multiple record highs this month.</p>
      <p>But the disconnect between fundamentals and performance is likely to face sustainability issues moving forward. With the U.S. economy bracing for its <a href="https://www.ccn.com/manufacturing-recession-puts-u-s-economy-on-track-for-worst-quarter-under-president-trump/">worst quarter under President Trump</a> and no substantial progress made on a free trade deal, investors will have a harder time justifying the record valuations in stocks.</p>

      <p>Although the JPMorgan analyst said there’s no urgency in preparing for a stock market correction, a growing number of investors are already shifting course. The bond markets have been flashing a warning sign since the summer when an inverted yield curve forced investors to question the health of the U.S. economy. Although the yield curve has corrected, it’s <a href="https://www.ccn.com/u-s-yield-curve-devastating-recession-unavoidable/">behaving exactly as it would before a major downturn</a>. That’s because a sudden steepening of the curve following an inversion almost always happen before or during recessionary cycles.</p>
