      <h3>Black Friday PS4 deals may not be great right now, but they will improve</h3>
      <p>Here's why</p>

      <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-ps4-and-ps4-pro-deals">Black Friday PS4 and PS4 Pro deals</a>, it looks like the best deals are coming to US retailers. But have no fear, we're expecting better offers on the way. </p>
      <p>Already we've seen <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/sony-reveals-its-official-black-friday-ps4-and-ps4-pro-deals-with-top-games-from-dollar20">Sony reveal its official PlayStation Black Friday deals</a> over the water but, according the the PlayStation UK Black Friday page, we can expect "incredible Black Friday deals". Although, they haven't been revealed yet.</p>
      <p>We can, however, expect essentially the same deals as our US friends got, which means we'll see offers on top Sony exclusives, PS4 bundles, PS Plus membership and PSVR bundles. We're just not exactly sure when they'll be revealed.</p>

        <li>These are the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/the-best-ps4-black-friday-deals-we-saw-last-year">best PS4 Black Friday deals we saw last year</a></li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But what about other retailers outside of Sony itself? We're seeing some PS4 deals trickling out from the likes of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/best-currys-black-friday-deals-2019">Currys</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/amazon-black-friday-deals-2019">Amazon</a>, but we're expecting the best deals to roll out over this week and, obviously, during <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/cyber-monday/cyber-monday-2019">Cyber Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>This was the case last Black Friday, and we definitely weren't disappointed with offers on great PS4 bundles and titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and Marvel's Spider-Man. So hang in there!</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we've popped some of the best PS4 deals we're seeing ahead of Black Friday below for your perusal:</p>
