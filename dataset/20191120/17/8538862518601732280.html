      <p>After dabbling with various limited-time events since its September release, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/borderlands_3">Borderlands 3</a> is about to get its first major chunk of downloadable content in the form of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/borderlands_3_moxxis_heist_of_the_handsome_jackpot">Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot</a>. That's quite the mouthful, but you'll be playing it on PlayStation 4 before the year is out. It's scheduled to arrive on 19th December, so let's check out the announcement trailer above while we wait.</p>
      <p>As you can see, Handsom Jack is back in holographic form. You'll be assisted by Moxxi in an attempt to take the antagonist's casino back and place it in the right hands. There'll be new areas, more enemies to do battle with, and obviously, a lot of new loot to find.</p>
      <blockquote>Moxxi's assembling a crew to plunder a derelict space station casino and you've proven yourself worthy of joining her ragtag team of "experts." Successfully battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot!</blockquote>
