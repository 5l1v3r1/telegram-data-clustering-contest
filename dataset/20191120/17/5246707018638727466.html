      <p>The latest issue of Weekly Famitsu has been released, and once again we are treated to a column written by Masahiro Sakurai. This is a summary of the column, as translated by Nintendo Life.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> has exceeded the lifetime sales of <b>Street Fighter II</b> to become the best-selling fighting game of all time.</li>
        <li>In Japan, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is classified as a Battle-Action game rather than a Fighting game.</li>
        <li>With so many variations of Street Fighter II having been released on so many different platforms, a decision has to be made on what makes a title unique under the same name. (Is Street Fighter II Turbo and Super Street Fighter II both considered the same Street Fighter II?)</li>
        <li>Sakurai adds that despite Super Smash Bros. Ultimate exceeding its sales, he feels Street Fighter II will continue to be the king of fighting games.</li>
        <li>The recent DLC fighter, Terry, has a playstyle like that of a classic fighting game, such as a command input. His inclusion makes for a fun and exciting eSports game.</li>
        <li>Even though Super Smash Bros. Ultimate can be a challenging game, particularly online, it's still fun for fans of any age.</li>
        <li>Super Smash Bros. is a series based on the idea of a fighting game. A fighting game with many tactics is interesting once you get the hang of it. To keep from being stale, Super Smash Bros. is designed closer as a party game.</li>
        <li>Super Smash Bros. is a paradox of a game, but Sakurai is happy to see it top the fighting genre. Although he had always planned for it, it's not his achievement alone. As always, thank you for supporting Super Smash Bros. and Sakurai will continue to work hard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What do you think of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate becoming the best selling Fighting game of all time? Who do you think the next DLC fighter will be? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
