      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author">Nedi Putra AW</a></address>
      <p>Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park (TNBTS) Agency is set to implement an <a href="https://bookingbromo.bromotenggersemeru.org/">online booking system</a> starting Dec. 1 for visitors who use services provided by travel agencies, tour operators and event organizers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile domestic and foreign travelers who visit the destination without using such services, either alone or in a group, can opt to book online or purchase tickets manually at the counters if they arrive between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., according to TNBTS Agency head John Kennedie in Malang, East Java, on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>John told <i>The Jakarta Post</i> that the policy aimed to increase transparency, improve services for visitors and optimize the park's management in a bid to maintain the conservation area.</p>
      <p>After a trial period, the policy is set to be implemented permanently in the near future.</p>
      <p>The park's entrance fees are Rp 29,000 (US$2) and Rp 220,000 for domestic and foreign tourists, respectively, on weekdays, and Rp 34,000 and Rp 320,000 on holidays.</p>
      <p>A tourist business owner in Bromo Rahmad Hidayat said that he supported the policy, however, he urged the agency to boost its promotion efforts.</p>
      <p>Aside from transparent implementation, Rahmad also called on the management to increase its services and competence levels of its employees. </p>
      <p>"Increasing the available facilities is also very important, such as the number and cleanliness of the restrooms," he added. (kes)</p>
