      <h1>Hyundai RM19 Makes The Veloster N Look Tame</h1>
      <h2>The M stands for “Midship,” which is where you'll find the competition-spec engine on this latest developmental prototype.</h2>

      <p>Hyundai has, by all accounts, made a world-beating hot hatch with the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/veloster-n">Veloster N</a>. But this is another beast entirely.</p>
      <p>Called the RM19, it's the latest in a string of prototypes going back to 2012. Those numbers denote the year in which this iteration was developed, following the RM14, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hyundai-continues-teasing-mid-engine-veloster">RM15</a>, and RM16 that came before. But it's the letters that precede them that tell you what's really going on here: the R is for "racing," and the M is for "Midship." Because this machine packs its engine behind the cockpit, where you'd sooner expect to find it on a supercar than a hot hatch.</p>

      <p>Created as a test-bed for Hyundai N performance components, the RM19 packs between the axles the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine from the touring-car racing version, but without the restrictions imposed by the sanctioning body. So this version channels upwards of 390 horsepower through a six-speed sequential gearbox, yet it's still engineered to be street-legal. Hyundai says it'll rocket to 60 mph in under four seconds and top out at over 155 mph before the electronic limiter kicks in.</p>
      <p>It rides on a MacPherson front and double-wishbone rear suspension with gas-pressure dampers, with six-piston front and four-pot rear brakes packed inside 20-inch alloys. And as you can see, it has an aero kit befitting its racing demeanor.</p>

      <p>Impressive as those specs may be, they're just the start. Hyundai envisions adding electric powertrain components, leveraging its new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/rimac-to-help-build-electric-sports-cars-for-hyundai-and-kia">partnership with Rimac</a>. "RM19 serves as a development platform for future N brand products," notes the manufacturer, tantalizingly "including a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hyundais-mid-engined-performance-halo-model-will-be-affordable">potential brand-halo car</a>." And we like the sound of that.</p>
      <p>"The RM platform is a versatile engineering testbed, allowing effective evaluation of various powertrains and performance levels, all on normal roads and environments," said Hyundai's R&amp;D chief Albert Biermann. "Throughout the evolution of the RM series, our engineers have gained tremendous hands-on knowledge of high performance vehicle dynamics with various front-to-rear weight distributions coupled with the effects of a fully-weighted, high-strength body structure on vehicle performance."</p>
