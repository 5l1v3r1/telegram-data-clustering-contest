      <h1>Borderlands 3's first DLC Sends You to Handsome Jack's Space Casino</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:08:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p><i>Borderlands 3</i>'s first DLC arrives next month. Unveiled earlier today on The Borderlands Show, <i>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot</i> takes the Vault Hunters to a space casino formerly run by <i>Borderlands 2</i> baddie Handsome Jack in an attempt to reclaim both the station and the untold riches within.</p>
      <p>As is to be expected for Borderlands DLC, the new pack comes with its own mini-campaign, as well as new baddies, boss fights, and loot. The casino is mostly filled with Hyperion bots and crazed bandits, but I did spot something that looked a lot like an angry slot machine at one point in the trailer, which you can check out below.</p>

      <p>To access the DLC, you'll need to be at least level 13 (although enemies will scale with your level at any point beyond that), and to have completed the opening chapter of the game - once you're off Pandora, the casino is up for grabs. The new content will be available for free for Season Pass holders, but can also be purchased separately as long as you own the base game. It'll arrive on December 19, by which time my own (significantly-delayed) playthrough will have seen me finally leave Eden-6.</p>
