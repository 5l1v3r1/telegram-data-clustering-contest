        <b>New Fortnite leaks suggest that the Scoped AR and Heavy AR (AK) will be returning to Fortnite in future updates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It looks like Epic will be picking things up on the back-half of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1. We’re into week seven and have only seen the Harpoon Gun added to Fortnite. Epic have been prioritizing game optimization of late, which is why there has been a <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/no-new-content-how-epic-spoiled-the-fortnite-community/27839/">lack of new content</a> throughout Chapter 2.</p>
      <p>If we know anything about Epic, we know that things aren’t going to stay this way. The Fortnite team might slow some things down, but they’ll likely be back to regularly updating the game after the Christmas break.</p>

      <p>In fact, we should be seeing our first major update in the next few weeks. According to the data miner <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX">@Hypex</a>, we will be seeing the Scoped AR and Heavy AR coming back to the game in the near future.</p>

      <p>The Fortnite community has always seemed to be hot and cold on the Scoped AR. Players with above-average aim could beam people with the weapon, but it was far more situational than most of the other guns in the class.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>In Chapter 2, though, the Scoped AR could be in for a massive upgrade. The wide-open terrain and lack of mobility mean people will have more use for it.</p>
      <p>The Heavy AR – or the AK – was another weapon that had Fortnite players split. It’s a strong single-shot weapon but has always had a wide spread and slow fire rate, leaving you unable to effectively spray while you’re using it.</p>

      <p>We’ll have to see how things shake out when these guns go back into the game. Will players choose the AK over the AUG and Scar? Probably not, but I could be wrong.</p>
