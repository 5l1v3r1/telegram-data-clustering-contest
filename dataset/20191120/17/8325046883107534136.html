      <p>Hiring activity for professionals in Malaysia was more buoyant and active in 2019 compared to the year before, the latest Salary Survey report by Robert Walters has said.</p>
      <p>Released on Wednesday (Nov 20), the professional recruitment consultancy said similar levels of hiring activity are expected to continue into the first half of 2020, with companies likely to become more ambitious with their growth plans and hiring in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>Salary increments expected for 2020 range from 3 per cent to 8 per cent, but professionals who change jobs or get promoted can get between 15 per cent to 20 per cent more pay. Those who have niche skill sets can even expect salary increments of up to 30 per cent, the report said.</p>
      <p>In its 21st year, the survey analyses placements made across Robert Walters’ own network to provide benchmark salary levels within various industries.</p>
      <p>This year, digitalisation across all industries resulted in digital and technology talent being highly sought after. There was particularly high demand for developers and specialists of artificial intelligent (AI) and machine learning, it said.</p>
      <p>Additionally, to ensure smooth and seamless adoption and transition, hirers also sought talent with experience in leading transformation projects.</p>
      <p>And as businesses took steps to ensure they were aligned with Bank Negara Malaysia regulations, hirers also showed strong demand for risk and compliance professionals, Robert Walters said. Given the relatively small talent pool in this area, the demand for these professionals is expected to continue into 2020, it added.</p>
      <p>In other fields, recruitment was largely focused on replacement hires, with employers showing more commitment to filling vacancies compared to the previous year, Robert Walters said. The creation of new roles was limited, as businesses remained cautious in anticipation of global events and domestic policy changes, the London-based firm said.</p>
      <p>However, hiring activity is expected to pick up in 2020, especially in the second half of the year, when the impact of these global events and domestic policies becomes clearer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wanted: Digitally savvy employees with ‘progressive’ mindset</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2020, ongoing digitalisation is expected to drive the demand for talent beyond the tech sector, and companies will seek digitally savvy employees with a “progressive mindset” to bring fresh ideas and accelerate digitalisation efforts, the report said.</p>
      <p>It also highlighted marketing as an area where candidates will need to develop their digital expertise in order to secure good roles.</p>
      <p>“We will see high demand for professionals who are not only skilled at what they do, but also possess business acumen and the ability to leverage new technology to effectively innovate and drive the business,” the report said.</p>
      <p>“These professionals are often motivated and ambitious and they want to bring value to the organisation through their work,” it added.</p>
      <p>Employers who want such talent will have to be able to present clear career development pathways, and also show how the candidate’s work can impact the business or even the nation positively, Robert Walters said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Regional demand for tech professionals</b>
      </p>
      <p>Across South-east Asia, tech and transformation will also be the dominant focus, Robert Walters said.</p>
      <p>To this end, technology professionals with hybrid skill sets and well-rounded “glocal” professionals, who have a good understanding of both global and local cultures and mindsets, will be in high demand across all industries.</p>
      <p>As regulatory requirements and guidelines evolve alongside digitalisation, there will also be a strong regional demand for risk and compliance professionals, as well as risk, compliance and legal talent with specialist knowledge in technology.</p>
      <p>“Hiring managers are seeking mid-level and senior managers who can help their teams navigate change successfully as new technologies are adopted, as well as well-rounded talent across all industries,” Toby Fowlston, Robert Walters’ CEO for Asia Pacific said.</p>
      <p>“To secure and retain these talent, hiring managers will need to show a commitment to learning and development, while also demonstrating how the role contributes to the wider organisation,” he added.</p>
