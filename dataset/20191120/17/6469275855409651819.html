      <p>The defendant allegedly tied her up with electrical cable and molested her 17-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son.</p>
      <p>After they escaped, she tried to comfort her son, saying: "It's OK, son. We are alive," jurors heard.</p>

      <p>She said: "I have come back in a taxi where this fella has said 'I will come with you to make sure you get home OK'."</p>
      <p>McCann, 34, is accused of then producing a knife as he ordered the woman to lie down in her son's bedroom, forcing the children into another bedroom.</p>
      <p>As he tied her up, he allegedly told her: "Don't look at me or I will slit your throat."</p>
      <p>The woman went on: "He tied my legs together and then he turned me back over again but he kept coming in saying 'you watch, or say anything I will slit your throat.</p>
      <p>"I said 'are you going to kill us all' and he said 'shut up'.</p>
      <p>"I could just hear him in my bedroom with (the children) because I was face down I could only hear him say '(boy's name) lie down on the floor, don't look at me'.</p>
      <p>"I think I heard (the girl) say, 'no, no, I don't want to do that'. I thought, my God.</p>
      <p>"It was like I was in and out of consciousness. I don't know if it was fright.</p>
      <p>"I was trying to get out but I thought if he sees me he would kill me. He had my children in the bedroom."</p>
      <p>She said McCann checked on her three or four times.</p>
      <p>The woman added: "He said if I moved my eyes or anything he would slit my throat and I believed him. I did not even want to move my eyeballs."</p>
      <p>The woman told officers she heard her daughter taking a shower and ask, "is that OK now".</p>
      <p>She described how the girl then jumped out of a bedroom window to escape.</p>
      <p>The mother said: "He (the attacker) must have run down the stairs to go get to her and my son, God bless him, he must have run downstairs, put the safety catches on.</p>
      <p>"He said 'mum, mum, we are safe. (My sister) saved us'.</p>
      <p>The woman said her son then ran downstairs, grabbed their attacker's discarded knife and used it to cut her free, saying: "Mummy, let's go out the back door."</p>
      <p>The witness continued: "I said 'hold onto me'. I said 'run like you never ran before and you get out'."</p>
      <p>Jurors heard the boy told his mother details of sexual abuse he had suffered after she asked him what had happened.</p>
      <p>She said: "I said 'it's OK, son'. I just wanted him to be calm for a bit. I said, 'we are alive'."</p>
      <p>The woman said she was "petrified" and felt like she would pass out as police were alerted.</p>
      <p>She described her attacker as "calm and calculated", saying he appeared to be "enjoying it".</p>
      <p>He allegedly told her he was from Northern Ireland and had a son.</p>
      <p>McCann, from Harrow, west London, denies 37 charges relating to 11 women and children, including rape, kidnap and false imprisonment.</p>
