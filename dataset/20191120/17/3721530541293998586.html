      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/borderlands-3/40522"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a>’s first campaign add-on launches Dec. 19. Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot brings a bit of <i>Ocean’s Eleven </i>to Pandora, as the name implies.</p>
      <p>Players will need to have advanced far enough in <i>Borderlands</i><i> 3</i>’s main story that they have access to Sanctuary 3. The expansion will take them to the late Handsome Jack’s lavish resort, where they’ll battle it out against Hyperion security and “crazed casino-goers” to get to the jackpot, which includes “all-new Legendary loot” and a safe crammed full of Eridium.</p>

      <p>Enemies and loot will scale to the player’s level, Gearbox Software said on <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/handsomejackpot/">the expansion’s official page</a>. The loot will include new heads, skins and emotes for Vault Hunters, an ECHO Device skin, weapon trinkets, and plenty of Legendary guns and gear.</p>
      <p>Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot is part of the <i>Borderlands 3’s </i>$49.99 season pass for premium DLC, with three more campaign add ons coming over the next year. This content is also included with the $99.99 <i>Borderlands 3 </i>Super Deluxe edition. À la carte prices for the expansion were not shared.</p>
      <p><i>Borderlands 3</i>, the fourth game in the 10-year-old Gearbox loot shooter series, launched back in September. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/9/20852642/borderlands-3-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one">Our review</a> found it “safe, oddly careful … and, worst of all, corporate.”</p>
