      <p>Tom Felton has shared his love for Emma Watson, amid <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/harry-potter-star-rupert-grint-saw-sparks-emma-watson-tom-felton-always-something-11179568/">claims from their </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/harry-potter-star-rupert-grint-saw-sparks-emma-watson-tom-felton-always-something-11179568/"> co-star Rupert Grint</a> he saw a ‘spark’ between the two.</p>
      <p>Growing up with Emma – as well as Rupert and Daniel Radcliffe – Tom spoke of going through ‘something pretty unique together’, as in becoming worldwide famous before they hit puberty.</p>
      <p>Now adults and out of the franchise, Tom, 32, has shared his love for Emma, 29, who he reveals lives only around the corner from him.</p>
      <p>Not doing much to dispel any <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> rumours there, mate.</p>
      <p>Still, it’s clear the beloved friendship the pair shares, as Tom told <b>Metro.co.uk</b> about the close living quarters of all his Harry Potter co-stars, who have remained firm friends outside the movies.</p>

      <p>‘Emma’s got a place around the corner from me in LA, as does Bonnie [Wright, who played Ginny Weasley], I think Matt Lewis [who played Neville Longbottom] lived there for a while,’ Tom, who is starring as Laertes in Ophelia, explained.</p>

      <p>‘We’re growing up slowly but surely. I couldn’t say enough good words about any of them.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Rupert’s such a down to earth guy despite all the fandom and whatnot. Daniel, his work ethic is incredible. He’s a funny, witty guy…</p>
      <p>‘Emma’s Emma, she’s a unique, beautiful soul. It’s always nice to bump into one another.’</p>

      <p>When suggested Emma will rule the world one day, Tom replied: ‘I doubt it not.’</p>
      <p>It comes after Rupert’s admission he saw something between the two actors during their time working on the whimsical films.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Rupert, 31, said that he didn’t want to stir up any rumours… after he stirred up the rumours big time.</p>
      <p>When asked if he could ever see Emma and Tom together, the actor said: ‘Yeah I could.</p>
      <p>‘There was always something. There was a little bit of a spark.’</p>

      <p>While Emma recently insisted she was ‘self-partnered’ and Tom did the same, he seems pretty content with his work/life balance at the moment. Hardly scrounging around for a job and worth a few squillion dollars from his magical HP days, he laughed: ‘I won’t lie, I’ve got it pretty good, I’m pretty lucky.’</p>

      <p>Speaking about the undying love of Harry Potter and how we’re still obsessed with The Boy Who Lived, the Draco Malfoy actor insisted he was happy to chat about the film that launched his international career until the dementors come home.</p>
      <p>‘Oh he’s a sweetheart, he’s a soft little sweetheart,’ Tom said of Draco. ‘He’s got sh*t parents, I’ll tell you that much.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘It’s nice to look back and realise how lucky we are,’ before adding someone once asked him how he was going to ‘shake the burden’ of Harry Potter.</p>
      <p>‘Are you kidding me? I’m happy to talk about this ’til the day I die, I’m very proud of it,’ he mused.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not like I’m carrying him around with me.’</p>
