      <p>Reid, who is also president of the MusiCounts music education charity, said excitement is ramping up as the new year draws closer.</p>
      <p>“Up until December, everyone’s sort of getting things ready, but as soon as January hits, it’s execution time,” Reid said. “I can’t believe we’re only four months away.”</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-set-to-bid-for-2019-juno-awards">Juno Awards were last in Saskatoon in 2007</a>, when host Nelly Furtado took home an armful of awards including artist of the year and album of the year.</p>

      <p>Kurt Dahl, the drummer of Saskatoon rock band One Bad Son — which performed at Tuesday’s media event — said the change in the local music community since the last time the city hosted the Juno Awards has been “amazing.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen it through the eyes of a musician in One Bad Son, I’ve seen it through the eyes of an entertainment lawyer, and through the eyes of a board member and president of SaskMusic,” Dahl said. “Our city and province have produced a remarkable amount of musical success stories in the past few years.”</p>

      <p>Dahl cited performers and groups such as The Sheepdogs, Jess Moskaluke, Tenille Arts, The Dead South, Rosie and the Riveters, and The Deep Dark Woods as examples of bands that have broken through after starting off in Saskatoon and around Saskatchewan. With so many industry players in the city for the awards, and the JUNOfest musical showcase open for submissions from local and national bands alike, Dahl said 2020 was a golden opportunity to show the rest of Canada what Saskatoon is made of.</p>
      <p>“It’s the kind of thing that only comes around every 12-plus years,” he said. “All of the country is turning their eyes to Saskatoon … our hospitality is amazing, our people are amazing — that’s why I moved back here. Just be our regular selves, and that’s going to impress anyone from out of town.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, when Saskatoon was announced as the 2020 host city, Tourism Saskatoon president Todd Brandt said the city was able to “ignore the naysayers” in 2007 who said the city was too small or the event was too expensive. He said in 2018 that the Juno Awards would provide between $10 million and $12 million in economic spinoffs for the province.</p>
