      <h1>Fresh Manchester United injury update provided - including Paul Pogba hint for Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | Dean Smith's AVFC take on Man Utd at Old Trafford on December 1</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:09:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have a number of injury concerns ahead of a busy run of fixtures which includes Aston Villa’s visit to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> face Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side on Sunday, December 1 after United have taken on Sheffield United in the Premier League and Astana in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay are among the players who have been nursing injuries recently, while former Villa loanee Axel Tuanzebe has also been sidelined.</p>
      <p>And it looks likely that United will be without Pogba against Villa as he continues his recovery from an ankle problem.</p>

      <p>The France star has featured in just two of the last 14 matches for his club and the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-injury-news-pogba-17283932">Manchester Evening News</a> reports he isn’t likely to return to action until early December, which could rule him out of the clash with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s side.</a></p>
      <p>Diogo Dalot, Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah can also be considered doubts for Villa even though there is still 10 days to recover, while the severity of McTominay’s problem is unclear.</p>
      <p>McTominay pulled out of the Scotland squad for European Championships qualifiers and Solskjaer said the ankle injury could keep him out for between two and eight weeks.</p>
