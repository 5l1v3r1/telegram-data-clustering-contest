      <h1>Don’t chase helmet-less riders, says HC</h1>
      <h2>Police, MVIs not expected to physically stop vehicles by jumping on middle of road</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:53:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/K-C-Gopakumar-3840/" target="_blank">K.C Gopakumar</a></address>
      <p>The Kerala High Court has disapproved of police officers or motor vehicle inspectors chasing helmet-less two-wheeler riders who refuse to stop their vehicles during checking.</p>
      <p>The court also emphasised the need for adopting modern technology to detect traffic offences.</p>
      <p>The court observed that the officers were not expected to physically stop vehicles by jumping on the middle of the road.</p>
      <h3>Several lives lost</h3>
      <p>“Under no circumstances shall a two-wheeler rider be pursued in a hot chase for booking him for not wearing a helmet as this is likely to put the life of the officer and the traffic offender at peril. Several lives have been lost by these adventurous acts,” the court added.</p>
      <p>The court pointed out that a circular issued in 2012 by the State Police Chief advised motor vehicle inspectors or police officers to carry out routine checks at pre-announced and well-marked fixed points. Its objective was not to catch people by surprise but to educate the people on safety habit.</p>
      <p>The court made the observations while granting a helmet-less two-wheeler rider bail in a case registered against him for not stopping his vehicle and knocking down an officer carrying out routine checking of vehicles at Malappuram.</p>
      <p>The court also pointed out that the Motor Vehicles (Driving) Regulations, 2017 had given the manner in which vehicles have to be stopped by a police officer in uniform or an authorised officer of the State government.</p>
      <h3>What rule says</h3>
      <p>The regulation says that the officer may stop a motor vehicle by giving a signal by means of a technical device on the vehicle or a signalling disc or a red light for verifying certificate of fitness of a vehicle or for collecting required information in respect of the vehicle or the driver or other occupants of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the rules specifically have provided for stopping a vehicle by using signalling devices and not by physically obstructing the passage of vehicles.</p>
      <p>The court noted that though as per the circular, the police officers and other officers were exhorted to use digital means for detecting traffic related cases, it appeared that those directions remained only on the paper.</p>
      <p>It was high time the authorities take steps to adopt modern technology for detection of traffic offences, the court said.</p>
