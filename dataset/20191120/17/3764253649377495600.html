      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277079-troops-overcome-by-boko-haram-ambush-borno-state.html"> the Nigerian Army has dealt a heavy blow on Boko Haram terroris</a>t in Dikwa local government area of Borno when troops of 153 task force battalion deployed at New Marte fought off an ambush set by the insurgents.</p>
      <p>Col Aminu Iliyasu, the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/nigeria-army.html">Nigerian Army</a> operations media coordinator, in a statement on Tuesday, November 19, said the encounter took place on Monday, November 18, when troops embarked on a fighting patrol to Dikwa to hunt and destroy remnants of the insurgents.</p>
      <p>The army spokesperson said the troops encountered the ambush staged against them by the insurgents along the patrol route at Ala Village, 7 km away from New Marte.</p>
      <p>He said the insurgents reinforced the ambush with a crudely prepared Improvised Explosive Device (IED) planted by them against the troops.</p>
      <p>Iliyasu stated the troops that in a rare display of boldness and resilience rather than getting discouraged by the sudden attack on them, turned around the initial setback and dealt a devastating blow on their criminal attackers.</p>
