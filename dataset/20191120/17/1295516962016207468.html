      <p>Earlier this month, news broke that longtime star of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/">The Flash</a> Danielle Panabaker was pregnant with her first child. With Panabaker's character Caitlin Snow, AKA the ice-powered hero Killer Frost, such a central character on the Arrowverse series, speculation has arisen how the pregnancy will impact Caitlin moving forward.</p>
      <p>Panabaker revealed that the current plan for her character moving forward through Season 6 will be to simply hide her growing baby bump rather than make her character pregnant as well.</p>

      <p>"I don't think Caitlin is going to have a baby. I think the intention is sort of to ignore my rapidly growing size," admitted Panabaker in an interview with <a href="https://www.etonline.com/the-flash-star-danielle-panabaker-reveals-how-her-pregnancy-will-be-addressed-on-the-show-exclusive">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "It's been done before and I have complete faith that it will be done again, so hopefully it won't be too obvious."</p>

      <p>In addition to starring on The CW series, Panabaker also directed an episode from Season 5 along with Season 6's sixth episode "License to Elongate." Despite her increased role behind-the-scenes, Panabaker noted the decision where to take her character after she revealed her pregnancy was out of her hands.</p>

      <p>"It's not up to me. It's up to the writers. I told them when I was pregnant and sort of left it up to them to make a plan of however they wanted to [handle it], and I think they have a great vision for the rest of the season," explained Panabaker. "It is nice though that Killer Frost's clothes are a little bit looser than Caitlin's were. That's for sure."</p>
      <p>Airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW, <i>The Flash</i> stars Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Carlos Valdes, Danielle Panabaker, Tom Cavanagh, Jesse L. Martin, Danielle Nicolet and Hartley Sawyer.</p>
