      <h1>What Luis Campos has said about working with new Spurs boss Jose Mourinho again</h1>

      <p>Luis Campos has previously said he would keen to work with new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> and confidently predicted that his next job would be his most successful.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as Spurs head coach on Wednesday, with the Argentine dismissed just five months after the Champions League final following a poor start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is reportedly looking to stamp his mark on Tottenham and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-instructs-tottenham-appoint-lille-sporting-director-luis-campos-11189513/">wants Lille sporting director Campos</a> to head up the club’s recruitment.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, Campos was asked about the possibility of reuniting with Mourinho – who he worked with at Real Madrid – just last month and was very open to the idea.</p>
      <p>Asked if he would consider an offer to work with Mourinho in the future, Campos told <i>Sky Sports</i> in October: ‘Of course. Mourinho is like a brother to me. I know him very well and for a long time. He’s a wonderful person and the best coach in the world. So, of course, if he called me I would speak.</p>

      <p>‘In my opinion – football needs someone like Jose. Football needs this special coach with this energy and strong personality. I believe the next work of Jose will be his top work.’</p>
      <p>Campos was previously critical of the lack of support he felt Mourinho received at Manchester United, with the self-proclaimed Special One having wanted to bring his compatriot to Old Trafford too.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I speak to Jose every week, sometimes every day, and I saw that Jose, in my opinion, had difficulties in Manchester because the club has another culture, which I respect of course.</p>
      <p>‘If the coach is alone heʼs an easy target and he needs help. Everyone needs help in football. You canʼt play alone. Manchester United is an amazing club with an amazing story and for people around the world, it’s difficult to understand what has happened to this club.</p>
      <p>‘Itʼs difficult to see this club in difficulty, but if this difficulty is arriving itʼs because you have one problem. In my opinion the problem is sensibility. Itʼs important to work together. Sporting with economy. If you donʼt put these things together I believe you are heading for disaster!</p>
      <h3>Luis Campos' most notable transfer successes</h3>
      <p>Kylian Mbappe – Profit: £166m<br/>Nicolas Pepe – Profit: £63m<br/>Thomas Lemar – Profit: £63m<br/>Anthony Martial – Profit: £52m<br/>Fabinho – Profit: £43m<br/>Tiemoue Bakayoko – Profit: £40m<br/>Benjamin Mendy – Profit: £39m<br/>Bernardo Silva – Profit: £31m<br/>James Rodriguez – Profit: £24m</p>
      <p>‘I know very well the situation of Manchester United and other clubs – but, in my opinion, everybody needs a sporting director because the coach needs time to prepare for the next match and the super ego of the players too, so he needs people with sensibility. If a coach is alone it’s more difficult now.</p>

      <p>‘A sporting director is very, very important. Of course I believe I could help Manchester United, but I respect the politics of the club. Itʼs very prestigious, very, very prestigious, but in modern football you need a sporting director. If you have a sporting director you have this sensibility.</p>
      <p>‘Before, the coach did everything, but now the information is arriving very fast. Now the world is very different. You need to know players in every part of the world. It’s important the club has one project and with a sporting director everyone understands where they go. You need one person with the sensibility for the sporting and economic situation. In modern football you need both to work together. If they don’t work together you have a disaster.’</p>
