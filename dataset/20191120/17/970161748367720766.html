      <h1>Prosecutor who impeached Bill Clinton says Donald Trump committed bribery</h1>

      <p>The prosecutor who led the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton has sensationally claimed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> committed bribery.</p>
      <p>Ken Starr, a former US circuit judge and US solicitor general, told Fox News: ‘We now know that the president, in fact, committed the crime of bribery.’</p>
      <p>‘I think the articles of impeachment are being drawn up if they haven’t already been drawn up.’</p>
      <p>Starr’s comments were the first time the famed former prosecutor indicated that there were legitimate grounds for Trump to be impeached. He had previously said there were insufficient grounds to impeach the president.</p>
      <p>His statement came as US Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, testified Wednesday that there was ‘quid pro quo’ when Trump called the Ukrainian president ‘for a favor.’</p>

      <p>On Wednsday, the House Intelligence Committee heard Sondland’s bombshell testimony. He believes Trump withheld $400 million in security aid, as well as an invitation to the White House, in exchange for Ukraine’s public announcement that they would investigate Trump’s political rival Joe Biden. Trump wanted a probe into Biden’s son Hunter’s links to Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma and Ukranian election meddling in 2016.</p>
      <p>Starr also suggested that Sondland’s explosive testimony could even prompt Republican Senators to visit the White House and ask for Trump’s resignation.</p>
      <p>‘The real issue is that the senators are watching,’ Starr, a noted conservative who <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/25/ken-starr-trump-defense-team-220619">reluctantly voted</a> for Trump in 2016, said.</p>
      <p>‘Are senators going to now say in light of what we hear today, it’s going to be a long day even with the ambassador alone, in light of what we have heard, “We need to make a trip down to the White House”?’</p>
      <p>Starr said he does not think Trump’s allies are ready to ask for the president’s resignation, but cited similar in-house pressure before Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974.</p>
      <p>‘That historic example set during the Nixon presidency. From what I’ve been able to glean I don’t think that’s going to happen. But obviously what happens today could—has the potential to be a game-changer,’ he said.</p>

      <p>Starr is considered largely responsible for the inquiry that lead Clinton’s impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1998, but Republicans failed obtain a two-thirds vote to remove him from office in the Senate trial.</p>

      <p>Republican Representative Devin Nunes, who has lead defense efforts on behalf of Trump, repeatedly hit out at Sondland’s credibility and doubled doubled down on claims that Biden’s son Hunter received money from Ukrainian national gas firm Burisma because of his father’s political status.</p>
      <p>Sondland was also attacked for his forgetfulness throughout the proceedings, which Sondland said due to his inability to access important State Department documents that could have helped him better recollect the events central to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>However, Sondland damaged his own credibility when he changed his testimony prior the Wednesday’s hearing. He originally said he never talked to Trump about a his phone call with Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky, but later said he did speak with Trump who told him there ‘was no quid pro quo.’</p>
      <p>In a bizarre statement that was seemingly emblematic of Sondland’s forgetful testimony, the ambassador said he only remembered the conversation with Trump about rapper A$AP Rocky, who was found guilty of assault in Sweden. Trump intervened in the performer’s case.</p>

      <p>‘What triggered my memory was someone’s reference to A$AP Rocky, which I believe was the primary reference of that phone call,’ Sondland said.</p>

      <p>Trump spoke out amid Sondland’s testimony distanced him from the ambassador, saying: ‘I don’t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well’</p>
      <p>He denies claims of wrongdoing.</p>
