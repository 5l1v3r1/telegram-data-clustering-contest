      <h1>Hearts-daft Lee McGregor wants Kash Farooq rematch as he holds Tynecastle dream</h1>
      <h2>The capital boxer won a contentious split decision over his Glasgow opponent last weekend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:23:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>British bantamweight boxing champion Lee McGregor wants a rematch with Glasgow’s Kash Farooq at Tynecastle and believes he could sell out the famous old ground.</p>
      <p>McGregor, a lifelong Jambo, won a controversial split decision over Farooq at the Emirates Arena last Saturday to add the Lonsdale belt to the Commonwealth title he already held.</p>
      <p>Many fight fans believed the decision should have gone to Farooq, but ringside judges scored the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> boxer as the winner.</p>
      <p>McGregor has spoken before about his dream of fighting at Tynecastle, but it could now be a reality after a meteoric rise to prominence over the last year.</p>
      <p>"A year ago I would have said no, but now it is crazy - the support and the fanbase I am building is really exciting.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows I am diehard Jambo and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are right on board with me.</p>
      <p>"I am sure the fight at Tynecastle will happen one day. I think Kash is the perfect opponent to sell that fight out. It will probably be for European or world honours.</p>

      <p>"I'm not counting anything out at the moment, I'll keep preparing and training hard and I'll be ready for whatever my team bring.”</p>
      <p>Despite his allegiances lying in the maroon half of the capital, McGregor, who is a former Cyclone stablemate of world champion and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> fan <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/josh-taylor">Josh Taylor</a> , wants the whole of Auld Reekie behind him.</p>
      <p>“I also want the whole city behind me - the whole of Edinburgh and the whole of Scotland behind me,” he told <a href="https://stv.tv/sport/more/1442553-lee-mcgregor-wants-kash-farooq-re-match-at-dream-venue-tynecastle/">STV</a> .</p>
      <p>"Although I'm a Hearts fan and although Tynecastle is my dream venue I want Hibs fans to get behind me and support me as well.</p>
      <p>"I want to gather the whole city, the two teams, together and let's make some special nights come to Edinburgh."</p>
      <p>On his fight with Farooq, McGregor can see why there were questions based on the margins of the scorecards, rather than the outright result.</p>
      <p>He added: "At the end of the day it was a close, grueling fight that could have gone either way and the judges preferred my work - it is as simple as that.</p>
      <p>"I think the scorecard is more what the outcry was about, rather than me winning.</p>
      <p>"It's just making me more hungry, so if the re-match gets made then let's get it on - I am more than happy because I was born to do this."</p>
