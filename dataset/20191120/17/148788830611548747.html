      <h1>‘Better Call Saul’ Season 5 Arrives in February, Watch a Teaser Now</h1>

      <p>It’s time to LWYRUP – <b><i>Better Call Saul</i></b> is back. Well, not right this very second – but soon. The AMC <i>Breaking Bad</i> spin-off has finally announced its season 5 debut for February of next year, and the announcement sets the stage for <b>Bob Odenkirk</b>‘s Jimmy McGill to go full Saul Goodman. Watch a new teaser video, and learn the <i>Better Call Saul</i> season 5 premiere date, below.</p>

      <p>That’s right: <i>Better Call Saul</i> returns on <b>February 23, 2020</b>. As this quick promo strongly indicates, this new season will see Jimmy McGill fully embracing his new Saul Goodman persona. Last season’s jaw-dropping finale concluded with Jimmy revealing his true colors to Kim (Rhea Seehorn) and heading off to change his practicing name from Jimmy and Saul.</p>
      <p>The fact that it took us five seasons to get here shows how subversive <i>Better Call Saul</i> has been. Many assumed the show would be entirely about the shady lawyer we met in <i>Breaking Bad</i><i>. </i>Instead, the series has slowly worked its way up to that, first presenting us with the person Saul really is: Jimmy McGill, a flawed but seemingly decent guy who becomes more and more corrupted over time.</p>
      <p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: I think <i>Better Call Saul</i> is actually better than <i>Breaking Bad</i>. That’s not to say I dislike <i>Breaking Bad</i> – I think it’s a phenomenal show. I just find myself caring a lot more about the characters, and the world, of <i>Saul</i>. Many fans seem to be in a hurry to see <i>Saul</i> catch up to the <i>Bad</i> timeline and introduce more of that show’s characters. But I’m fine with the series taking its time and not rushing to its foregone conclusion.</p>

      <blockquote>Set in the early and mid 2000s, <b>Better Call Saul</b> follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), beginning six years before the events of Breaking Bad, showing his transformation into the persona of criminal-for-hire <b>Saul</b> Goodman.</blockquote>
