      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201909241076875092-indias-third-largest-foodtech-firm-woos-uber-co-founder-for-investment---reports/">Uber</a> on Wednesday introduced a driver rewards initiative titled “Uber Plus” that will allow its chauffeurs to earn points for rides.</p>
      <p>The new system means that drivers can unlock four different rating tiers -- blue, gold, platinum and diamond, the media reported.</p>
      <p>The driver rewards programme is being rolled out in Indian cities including New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Pune, Kochi, Guwahati and Jaipur.</p>
      <p>For medical support, Uber has inked a deal with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s national health protection programme “Ayushman Bharat” that would facilitate free healthcare to Uber drivers for bills up to Rs. 500,000 ($6,960 approx.) in hospitals.</p>
      <p>The “Ayushman Bharat” programme was launched in 2018 as a centrally sponsored national healthcare protection scheme.</p>
      <p>The first test phase of “<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910221077117802-uber-joins-hands-with-delhi-metro-in-india/">Uber Plus</a>” was initiated in New Delhi,  Mumbai and Chandigarh.</p>
      <p>The California-based company has previously said that it tests quite a number of its potential features in India first, before rolling them out globally, because the diversity in India helps the company tweak proposed features for its 95 million users worldwide.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, the cab-major partnered with <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910301077181750-uber-reacts-to-tana-mongeaus-claim-she-was-almost-killed-by-companys-creepy-driver/">online consultation</a> app DocsApp to provide free medical consultations, subsidised prescription medicines and lab tests for drivers and delivery partners across Uber rides and Eats platforms throughout India.</p>
