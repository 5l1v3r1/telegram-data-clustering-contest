      <p>A <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/this-24-year-old-rwandan-is-on-a-mission-to-educate-the-world-about-african-cultures-through-the-art-of-dance">South African</a> family has been forced to drop off a corpse at the offices of a banking and insurance firm, <a href="https://www.oldmutual.co.za/">Old Mutual</a>, for allegedly refusing to pay a funeral claim.</p>
      <p>The move by the family sparked outrage among South Africans, especially on social media.</p>
      <p><a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/uproar-as-seven-police-officers-drag-a-black-female-student-of-american-university-from-her-hostel">Videos </a>of the incident which emerged on Tuesday, show two women removing the “body” from Old Mutual offices, back into a hearse, with one of them asking, “Had we not done this, when were they going to pay?”</p>
      <p>The videos, which have since gone viral, sparked outrage on social media, with users slamming the company over its insensitivity towards the bereaved family.</p>
      <p>Responding to the backlash, Old Mutual described the incident as “isolated but regretful.”</p>
