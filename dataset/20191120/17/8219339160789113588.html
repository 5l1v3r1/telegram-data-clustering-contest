      <h1>Make someone’s holiday: Apple unwraps 2019 holiday gift guide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:43:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelsteeber/" target="_blank">Michael Steeber</a></address>
      <p>It’s that time of year again. Not just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boyI3hgCSSQ">picture-taking season</a>, but time to check out the Apple Store for the perfect gifts for family and friends. Just ahead of Thanksgiving, Apple has published its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts">2019 holiday gift guide</a> following last week’s redecorating of retail stores around the world with new holiday artwork.</p>
      <p>As is tradition, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts">Apple’s guide offers</a> suggested gift pairings and popular accessories to put a bow on. Featured this year are AirPods and the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/29/apple-store-airpods-pro-window-displays-tables/">new AirPods Pro</a>, sure to be on everyone’s list.</p>
      <p>Apple is also highlighting seasonal colors for the latest Apple Watch Series 5 bands, Apple Watch Studio, and iPad accessories like the Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard Folio. Joining the accessories are quick and easy home purchases like HomePod and Apple TV 4K.</p>
      <p>New this year, Apple is promoting its latest services as perfect digital gifts. 2019’s guide calls out Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Music. And to pay for those services? How about Apple Card?</p>
      <p>Apple doesn’t typically offer deep discounts or extended holiday sales at this time of year, but if you choose to pick up a gift from Apple online or in an Apple Store from November 15 – December 25, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/shipping-pickup">you can return it for free</a> if you initiate the return by January 8, 2020.</p>
