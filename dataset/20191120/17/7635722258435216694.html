        <b>US President Donald Trump held a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was nothing much out of the ordinary - except for the large, handwritten notes he read from.</p>
      <p>Before leaving Washington for Texas, he read a statement that appeared to be written in a black Sharpie pen.</p>
      <p>In large letters, the statement read: "I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zellinsky to do the right thing. This is the final word from the Pres of the U.S."</p>

      <p>This relates to the ongoing impeachment inquiry against him.</p>
      <p>The US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/trump-impeachment-gordon-sondland-927227">earlier said that</a></b> officials pushed for a "quid pro quo" arrangement with Ukraine on behalf of Mr Trump.</p>

      <p>Mr Sondland told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that officials pressured Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation into the son of Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden in return for a White House visit.</p>
      <p>He said the president ordered him to work with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on everything to do with Ukraine - and confirmed that Mr Giuliani was actively pushing for a "quid pro quo" arrangement.</p>

      <p>"We did not want to work with Mr Giuliani - simply put, we were playing the hand we were dealt.</p>
      <p>"We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr Giuliani, we would lose a very important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"So we followed the president's orders", he added.</p>
