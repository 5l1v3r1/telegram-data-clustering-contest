      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rte">RTE</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/2fm">2FM</a> presenter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/keith-walsh">Keith Walsh</a> has told of how he feared he would be seen as weak if he spoke about his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mental-health">mental health</a>.</p>
      <p>The former Breakfast Republic host told of how he turned to therapy after getting stuck in a rut when he finished the early morning show.</p>
      <p>He said: “I felt like I needed to tell people about this for a long time. I wanted to do it in a way that I was so comfortable to talk about.</p>
      <p>“It might be a man thing but it might be this industry. I felt and I could be wrong that I would be seen as being weak and that people would say that I wasn’t the man to be on the breakfast show.</p>
      <p>“And that I needed to be happy and funny and they don’t want me crying in the morning.”</p>

      <p>The father of two was inundated with messages after first sharing his story on his Instagram.</p>
      <p>And said he would have put on a show for three hours in the morning, pretending to be someone else.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jennifer-zamparelli">Jennifer Zamparelli</a> on 2fm, Keith said: “My wife said it to me, that there would be days that she would look at me and I’d just be watching a match and just thought there was something wrong with me and she was right.</p>
      <p>“I never did anything about my own head. So many people thanked me for doing the video that they could pass onto their partner. I know a good few men should do what I’m doing.</p>

      <p>“My point and what I’m trying to get across to people is let’s not get to a point that will get to rock bottom.</p>
      <p>“I drove up to Dublin yesterday and I cried the whole way up for no reason and I was just listening to a podcast and it touched a nerve.</p>
      <p>“And that’s fine and things are different now, it’s a positive thing and the more people I can get to realise that the better.”</p>
