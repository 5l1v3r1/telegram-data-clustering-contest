      <h1>Mourinho to Tottenham opens ‘escape route’ for player – Move to Spurs being pushed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:45:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Several things were inevitable once Jose Mourinho was named Tottenham’s new manager.</p>
      <p>The fanbase would be split, the English press would almost combust with excitement, old enemies in the Spanish media would predict doom for Spurs, and Gareth Bale would be linked with a return to his former club.</p>
      <p>Step forward <a href="https://as.com/futbol/2019/11/20/primera/1574266157_036224.html?id_externo_rsoc=CM_ES_TW">AS</a>, who have already ticked the boxes for the last two inevitabilities. Earlier today they published an article talking about Mourinho’s ‘propaganda’ getting him a job he doesn’t really deserve.</p>
      <p>Now they have the Bale claim.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s wish to have Bale at Manchester United was no secret, the manager spoke about it publicly, and according to the Spanish newspaper he’ll now ask Daniel Levy to get the player to Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Bale therefore has an ‘escape route’ open for him, and AS have a further interesting snippet. At the beginning of the season, when Zinedine Zidane was wobbling at Real Madrid, the club had a chat with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>According to to the story, Jose’s camp told Madrid ‘there were recoverable players in Los Blancos’ squad, such as Bale.’</p>
      <p>Real Madrid would be able to solve a problem of their own, and Tottenham could get the signing for far less than Mourinho has been quoted previously.</p>
      <p>AS contacted Jonathan Barnett, Bale’s agent, who told them the Welshman won’t move in the winter market, but in the summer things could be different.</p>
