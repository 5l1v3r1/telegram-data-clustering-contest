      <p>The notorious "White House" in Sunnyside, which has been a drug den and hub of criminal activity for more than a decade, will be nothing more than rubble in a couple of days.</p>
      <p>The City of Tshwane officially started demolishing the building on Wednesday morning after it was cleared of people and their belongings. </p>
      <p>A loader spent most of the day tearing down the building's exterior walls, ending the life-cycle of what has become an infamous building in the city.</p>
      <p>The "White House" is synonymous with crime, homelessness and the drug culture in Sunnyside, which has led to numerous complaints being laid over the years.</p>
      <p>It was originally a Memorable Order of Tin Hats (MOTH) club in Pretoria.</p>

      <p>Tshwane's MMC for community safety and emergency services, Karen Meyer, told the media the derelict building had been used as a temporary base for criminal activity for years, leading to an increase in crime in the area.</p>
      <p>Complaints received about the "White House" ranged from smash and grabs, theft, assault and drug use. It has also been used as a shelter by homeless people in Tshwane.</p>

      <p>Meyer said the building was condemned and declared uninhabitable which led to the decision to tear it down.</p>
      <p>She added occupants were given 48 hours to vacate the premises, saying raids on Monday and Tuesday came up empty-handed as they had already fled.</p>

      <p>As the demolition was underway, "residents" of the infamous building expressed their displeasure with the City's decision to demolish it. </p>
      <p>One man, who did not want to be named, told News24 he had been living in the "White House" for almost a decade and that all its occupants were law-abiding citizens.</p>
      <p>He said the demolition would leave scores of people without a roof over their heads, including children and pregnant women.</p>
      <p>"Our concern is where are we going now. We have no help."</p>
      <p>The ward councillor for Sunnyside, Godfrey Mulaudzi, denied people would be left destitute, saying plans were in place to move them to shelters.</p>
      <p>"We have a list of people staying here, and those who require services and shelter will be accommodated," Mulaudzi said.</p>
