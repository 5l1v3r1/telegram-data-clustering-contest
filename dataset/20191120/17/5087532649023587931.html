      <p>Google Stadia opened up preorders for its subscription gaming service on June 6th. However, <i>The Verge</i> reported that some so-called ‘Founders’ who pre-ordered the service are having issues getting in.</p>
      <blockquote>Though Stadia is now live, many buyers are reporting they haven’t received the most crucial piece of the entire Stadia package: the invite email that opens the door to actually let them in. Many on Stadia’s official Discord server are performing what they’re calling a “code check” to let others know whether their codes have been sent, and whether their devices have actually been shipped. Others are reporting the usernames they wanted are already taken.</blockquote>
