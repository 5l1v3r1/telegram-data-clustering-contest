        <b>Motorists heading to Garstang Road A6 from Fulwood are stuck in traffic.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not clear what the cause of the tailbacks are although roadworks are underway on the B6241 Eastway from Pittman Way to Sherwood Way.</p>
      <p>Temporary traffic signals are in place for work to improve the junction.</p>
      <p>According to the AA traffic map there is heavy traffic outside Royal Preston Hospital along Sharoe Green Lane heading towards the Black Bull pub.</p>
      <p>The B6241 is congested towards Garstang Road, as is St Vincents Road and Watling Street Road.</p>
