      <h1>Manager has ‘hope’ of getting Manchester United job – And a little worry as well</h1>

      <p>There are two Massimiliano Allegri slants in Italy today.</p>
      <p>On one side there are claims he turned Tottenham Hotspur down, and on the other side is the far more likely scenario that he wasn’t considered ahead of Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.it/news/357276/futuro_allegri_premier_ancora_possibile_in_serie_a_doppia_suggestione">Calciomercato.it</a> go with the latter, explaining Daniel Levy chose the Portuguese coach. However, it’s not a barren situation for Allegri, because he has ‘hope’ of the Manchester United job.</p>
      <p>The former Juventus manager has a chance of a role in England, and ‘this possibility is called Manchester United’.</p>
      <p>As far as Calciomercato are concerned, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s future is under threat because of the poor season so far at his club. That could present Allegri with the chance to takeover at Old Trafford in the summer, but there’s a problem: Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Should United part ways with their manager, and Pochettino remains available, it’s thought to be unlikely they’d overlook him for the Italian, so it could be another opportunity to slip away from Allegri.</p>
      <p>Still, there’s more hope. Real Madrid or PSG could decide to dispense with their managers, which would be more open doors, as long as Poch doesn’t get there first.</p>
      <p>What the Italian source appears to be trying to convey is that Allegri really wants a top job, and now has the problem of Tottenham’s former manager following him around.</p>
