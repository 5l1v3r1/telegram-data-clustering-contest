      <h2>NIT-T students have developed a street vacuum cleaner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:18:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Kathelene-Antony-55231/" target="_blank">Kathelene Antony</a></address>
      <p>A street vacuum cleaner developed by students of the National Institute of Technology- Tiruchi (NIT-T) has been deployed at the Central Bus Stand, say officials.</p>
      <p>A 13-member team of NIT-T had developed the cost-effective vacuum cleaner after studying the state-of-the-art machine worth ₹60 lakh, purchased by the Greater Chennai City Corporation. The machine consists of a turbine, which creates a vacuum, and an eight-inch pipe connecting the turbine to a plate, which covers a bin, which will hold the waste.</p>
      <p>From the plate, another five-inch pipe protrudes out and onto the main suction point. The length of the five-inch pipe is two metres and due to its flexible nature, can be moved around.</p>
      <p>Muni Kumar, technical head, Designers’ Consortium, the product designing club which made the cleaner, said: “It can be mounted on any truck and used for removal of garbage from streets. We promised a cost-efficient and power-efficient solution to corporation officials when we took up the challenge and have delivered as the cost of the entire set-up including trial-and-error cost us ₹90,000. In case of mass-production, it would be around ₹50,000,” he said.</p>
      <p>The product was conceived and funded by the batch of 1983, led by Richard Sekar, Sagayaraj Benedict and T. Suresh, who guided and trained the team.</p>
      <p>The project had its start in ‘Immacula Tiruchi Hackathon’ organised by the student’s welfare office and Alumni Relations office of NIT-Tiruchi during September 2018 after the alumni, during a clean-up drive, noticed it was difficult to clean up roads in Tiruchi.</p>
      <p>S. Sivasubramanian, Tiruchi Corporation Commissioner, said that a test run was done at the Pudukottai bay of the bus stand on Tuesday. ‘The machine is being deployed on a trial basis and will be used to clean the bus stand. Based on its merits and demerits, if required, more such vacuum cleaners will be procured,’ he said.</p>
