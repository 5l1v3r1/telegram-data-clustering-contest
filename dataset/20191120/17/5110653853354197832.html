      <p>Goodbye, "Baby Shark."</p>
      <p>Gerardo Parra, the Nationals backup outfielder who used the annoying/catchy children's tune as his walk-up song last season and created a phenomenon at Nationals Park, is headed to Japan to play for the Yomiuri Giants of theNippon Professional Baseball league, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28121384/gerardo-parra-leaves-nationals-mlb-play-japan-yomiuri-giants">according to ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>Parra, who was a free agent,will make $2 million this season plus a $500,000 bonus, a source told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/20/gerardo-parra-japan-yomiuri-giants-baby-shark-washington-nationals/">The Washington Post</a>. The deal also has a $3 millionvesting option for 2021, the Post reported.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Parra, 32, slashed .234/.293/.391 last seasonin 119 games with the Giants and Nationals, but his biggest contributionwas easily his introduction of the popular children's anthem during games in Washington.While stuck in an 0-for-22 slump in June, he decidedto switch things up, and he looked to his young daughter for inspiration.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to put on something different,” Parra said (<a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/nationals/baby-shark-his-new-walk-song-gerardo-parra-broke-out-his-slump-nats">via NBC Sports Washington</a>). "My [2-year-old daughter Aaliyah Victoria] loves that song. Before the game, I tried merengue, reggaeton, hip-hop, then I said, 'You know what, I want to put in Baby Shark.'I'm happy for that."</p>
      <p>Parra finished the day game 2-for-4 with a double and a home run, and, given the superstitions of baseball players,"Baby Shark" official became a thing at Nationals Park.</p>
      <p>By the time the Nats reached the playoffs, the song and associated clapping had grown into a Full-Fledged Happening and rallying cry, with the home crowds chirping alongenthusiastically. Things only intensified during the World Series, as the Nationals beat the Astros in seven games,despite beingswept in their three home games.</p>

      <p>One would assume that Parra will take the song with him to the Land of the Rising Sun, but itseems unlikely that the Nationals will continue to embrace the "Baby Shark"tradition in 2020, given its association with the departing outfielder. But then, they've spent money on it, <a href="https://www.mlbshop.com/Mens_Majestic_Navy_Washington_Nationals_2019_World_Series_Champions_Trophy_Shark_T-Shirt/t-36233470+o-4587+d-897200797+f-5093331+z-9-3628698581?utm_medium=cse&amp;_s=ak1944mlb-pla&amp;sku=13278515&amp;targetid=aud-372228220062:pla-336294741260&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oehAHHHqjPGp6B5jSeMb2bTcu1vqn6rj7MyRoiUmWu90pHbPSo6cX04aAmT8EALw_wcB">slapped it on merchandise</a>and kinda made it part of their championship identity, so don't be surprised to see it stick around for a least a little while.</p>
