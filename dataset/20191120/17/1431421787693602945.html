      <h1>Police Say Attack on 76-year-old Berlin Man Was anti-Semitic</h1>
      <h2>The victim, who is not Jewish, was cursed, punched in second such incident in recent weeks in Berlin's Pankow neighborhood</h2>

      <p>A 76-year-old man was punched in the face by a male teenager in broad daylight in Berlin in what police are calling an anti-Semitic incident.</p>
      <p>The suspect was released to the custody of his father, according to news reports. The victim, who was injured on his forehead and nose, was not Jewish, police later said.</p>
      <p>It is the second such incident in recent weeks in the Berlin district of Pankow.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred Monday morning, when the 16-year-old boy and four companions reportedly blocked the man’s path. When the man asked that he be allowed to pass, the boy demanded, “What do you want, you Jew?”</p>

      <p>As the man tried to respond, the boy — named by the German-language BZ newspaper as “Steven” — reportedly punched him several times in the face. Both fell to the sidewalk.</p>
      <p>A witness, Vincent Seidel, 29, pulled the teenager off the man and held him to the ground with his knee until police arrived. Seidel, too, was reportedly punched by the youth.</p>
      <p>Police also told BZ that the suspect is known to them. State security police are investigating the case.</p>
      <p>The incident follows a similar attack in the same Berlin district on Oct. 28, when a 70-year-old Jewish man was insulted with anti-Semitic comments and physically injured by unknown assailants. The man reportedly was not wearing anything that would identify him as Jewish.</p>
