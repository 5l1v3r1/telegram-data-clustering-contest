      <h1>Trump Cites Gordon Sondland's Testimony as Impeachment Exoneration</h1>
      <h2>President Donald Trump emphasized Wednesday he told Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland he wanted no quid pro quo with Ukraine.</h2>

      <p>Trump referred to Sondland’s testimony as the ambassador testified to the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>“That means it’s all over,” Trump said to reporters as he left the White House, adding he “turned off the television” after he heard Sondland’s recollection of a call he had with the president about Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Sondland testified Trump told him twice that he wanted nothing from Ukraine, other than President Zelensky to do the right thing.</p>
      <p>The president read off the testimony transcript from his notes as he left the White House for Texas to visit an Apple computer manufacturing plant.</p>
      <p>“It was a very short and abrupt conversation that he had with me,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>Trump recalled Sondland repeatedly asked him what he wanted from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“I want nothing, I said it twice,” Trump said, adding again he said he wanted “no quid pro quo.”</p>
      <p>Trump scolded reporters at the White House, saying,”If you weren’t fake news, you would cover it properly.”</p>
      <p>The only part of Sondland’s testimony that Trump disputed was Sondland’s assertion that the president was in a bad mood during the call.</p>
      <p>“I’m always in a good mood, I don’t know what that is,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump again distanced himself from Sondland, saying he only spoke to him a few times.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know him very well,” Trump said, recalling that Sondland supported other Republicans in the 2016 presidential primary.  “I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though.”</p>
      <p>Trump repeated his claim on Twitter, after leaving the White House.</p>
