      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/cardi-b/?tps=1">Cardi B</a> is sharing her hopes and dreams for her daughter, Kulture Kiari.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old rapper discussed Kulture, her 16-month-old daughter with Offset, during a Vogue 73 Questions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qTROr7cgCY">interview</a> published Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cardi B said she hopes to teach Kulture to become an independent and confident woman.</p>
      <p>"Don't worry what people say. And to dream big and follow it," she said. "I wish for her to be a successful businesswoman, an independent woman, confident woman."</p>
      <p>Cardi B said the biggest lesson she's learned from motherhood is that "you're never ready on time." She also said people underestimate how hard parenthood is.</p>
      <p>"The most underrated part of motherhood is that this is hard. People think that it's easy, but it's hard. We deserve more Mother's Day," the star said.</p>
      <p>"The most challenging part of being a mother, like I said, you're never on time," she added.</p>
      <p>Cardi B also explained why she once apologized for wanting to be pregnant again.</p>
      <p>"My fans, they want they tour. I feel like there's so many things in the world that they want, and they won't be able to done if I'm pregnant," she said.</p>
      <p>Cardi B said she's become a "different person" since welcoming Kulture in July 2018. She <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/07/11/Cardi-B-teases-new-song-in-honor-of-daughters-1st-birthday/8241562860841/">shared a sample</a> of a new song in honor of Kulture's first birthday in July.</p>
      <p>Cardi B said on <i>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ellen_DeGeneres/?tps=1">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show</i> in October that she planned <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/10/31/Cardi-B-teaches-Ellen-DeGeneres-to-twerk-as-Cardi-E/5601572532193/">to wear matching costumes</a> with Kulture for Halloween.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to dress up as Moana because my baby's dressing up as Moana," she said. "So I'm trying to go trick-or-treating for me because she can't eat candies. That's the fun thing about being a mom."</p>
      <p>Cardi B last released the single "Yes" with Fat Joe and Anuel AA in September. In the Vogue interview, she described her forthcoming new album as "spicy" and "controversial."</p>
