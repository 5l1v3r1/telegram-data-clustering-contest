      <p>Three has long been known for its low-price, high-data phone contracts, and its early Black Friday deal takes this to the next level. </p>
      <p>For just <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778250-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fthree-sim-only-deal-3778250%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.three.co.uk%2Fview%2Fbasket%2FSIMOnlyD13112019T144262">£18 a month</a>, you'll get unlimited calls, texts <i>and </i>data on a 12-month SIM-only deal. It will even be delivered by Royal Mail 1st class at no extra cost. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778250-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fthree-sim-only-deal-3778250%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fstore.three.co.uk%2Fview%2Fbasket%2FSIMOnlyD13112019T144262">Head over to Three to pick up its unlimited data deal now</a>.</p>
      <p>This the lowest price we've seen for an unlimited data contract, and will save you £24 a year on the £20 per month deal Three launched ahead of its 5G rollout.</p>
      <p>Three expects its 5G to be up and running in 25 towns and cities before the end of the year, and the great news is that this plan is 5G-ready at no extra cost. To take advantage you will need a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/5g-phones-3692968/">supported phone</a>, but your existing 4G device should be more than fast enough on Three, particularly with its estimated 99.8% coverage.</p>
      <p>As one of Three's Advanced Plans, this will also get you access to Go Roam Around the World, meaning you can still use this data in 71 global destinations at no extra cost. </p>
      <p>Personal Hotspot is also here, so you could even use the 4G signal to replace your home broadband. </p>
      <p>Superdrug also offers <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778250-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fthree-sim-only-deal-3778250%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superdrugmobile.com%2Four-plan">unlimited data for £20 per month</a>, but this gets you £20 worth of loyalty card points upon sign-up and double points on your shopping throughout the contract. SMARTY, owned by Three, is offering the same deal for <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778250-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fthree-sim-only-deal-3778250%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsmarty.co.uk%2Fplans%2Funlimited">£22 a month</a>, although its USP is usually that it will buy back the data you don't use.</p>
      <p>Both these companies use's Three's network as a 'piggyback' provider, so you'll be getting the same service whichever one you choose. </p>
      <p>Alongside EE, O2 and Vodafone, Three are one of the four main phone networks in the UK, with all other providers buying space from them. This shouldn't affect the quality of service you receive though, regardless of who you go with.</p>
