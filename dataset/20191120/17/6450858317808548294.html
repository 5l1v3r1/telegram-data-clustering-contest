      <h3>Samsung Galaxy phone buying advice</h3>
      <p>While to some the structure of Samsung's smartphone portfolio might seem obvious, if you're a long-standing iPhone user or you're not a tech fanatic, like we are here, there's every chance that understanding the difference between the S10e and the A20e isn't immediately clear.</p>
      <p>If that's the case, read on to understand the makeup of Samsung's lineup and to help you decide which device is will make the best fit.</p>
      <h4>Samsung Galaxy S series</h4>
      <p>Arguably Samsung's most well-known smartphone line, the Galaxy S series has served as the company's flagship brand since 2010. This year we were introduced to the biggest lineup of Galaxy S phones to date, in the S10e at one end and the S10 5G at the other.</p>
      <p>Four phones in all, with each offering a larger body, screen and battery than the one before, as well as additional features. Whichever one you pick, the Galaxy S10 lineup offers a flagship-class experience, no matter what and as such, without the great deals we've included here, you can expect to pay upwards of £650.</p>
      <h4>Samsung Galaxy Note series</h4>
      <p>Galaxy Note devices usually launch in the latter half of each year and bring with them refined experiences and features that were likely introduced on the company's Galaxy S devices from earlier in the year, as well as larger screens, more power and the inclusion of the company's S Pen stylus.</p>
      <p>2019 signalled a change for the Galaxy Note family, with a range of models that differed in more than just the amount of storage they offered.</p>
      <p>The standard Note 10 is slightly smaller and possesses a slightly weaker feature-set compared to the bigger Galaxy Note 10+, while, as the name implies, the Note 10+ 5G, simply adds superfast mobile connectivity to the already-snappy formula that makes up the Note 10+.</p>
      <h4>Samsung Galaxy A series</h4>
      <p>Following closely behind Samsung's flagship-class 'S' devices is the A-series. As you might be able to guess from the lettering, these are still capable phones, falling under what most could consider 'mid-range' with premium touches and features.</p>
      <p>Unlike the S-series, the numbering helps quickly distinguish between the pricer, more capable devices and the simpler, but more affordable entries. At the top of the pile in 2019 is the Samsung Galaxy A90 5G (RRP £669), while at the other end is the humble Galaxy A10 (RRP £139).</p>
      <p>Note: In previous years Samsung's A-series dealt in single digits, rather than tens, so if you come across the likes of a Galaxy A9 or A5, for example, just know it's one of Samsung's older mid-range devices.</p>
      <h4>Samsung Galaxy J &amp; M series'</h4>
      <p>If affordability is at the top of your list, then it's Samsung's Galaxy J and M lineups that you'll want to consider. The likelihood of encountering these device families varies by market. For instance, the J-series hasn't been updated for 2019 in the UK and the M-series doesn't feature at all.</p>
