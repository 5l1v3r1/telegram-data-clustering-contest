      <h1>CBI arrests contractor for forging letter of PM's Office for Mumbai property</h1>
      <h2>The complaint was filed by the PMO in February, 2019 for allegedly forging a letter signed by joint secretary rank officer in connection with a Mumbai property.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:52:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Munish Pandey</a></address>
      <p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday arrested a private contractor, Surinder Mittal, for forging a letter of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), officials said.<br/><br/>The complaint was filed by the PMO in February, 2019 for allegedly forging a letter signed by joint secretary rank officer in connection with a Mumbai property.</p>
      <p>According to the complaint, on November 27, 2017, a forged letter of the PMO signed by joint secretary rank officer, which was addressed to the then Chief Minister of Maharashtra asking him to give favours to M/S Vilayati Ram Mittal of Navi Mumbai, in connection with development of plot of land (bearing CTS number 418 [pt]) at Ghausia compound in Bandra (East), Mumbai.</p>
      <p>The federal probe agency was told by the PMO that in the forged letter, local authorities were biased in helping other developers. The letter also claimed that secretary of Bandra (East), Ghosia Compound Cooperative Society Limited, had submitted an application dated December 11, 2017 along with the copy of letter before Apex Grievance Redressal Committee, Slum Rehabilitation Committee, Mumbai.</p>
      <p>However, sources said that during the communication, the PMO got to know that forged letter is being used. During the CBI inquiry, the PMO informed that no such letter was ever issued by any joint secretary ranked official.</p>
      <p>"It was also revealed during the investigation that the said application/appeal was allegedly submitted on the forged letter head of 'CDP &amp; Company', a firm of an advocate. The signature on the application was not of the said advocate. However, it was allegedly signed by secretary of Bandra East Ghausia compound, Bandra (East), Mumbai, with a rubber stamp of the society," the CBI said.</p>
      <p>The CBI claimed that it was also found that Salim Shaikh, secretary of Bandra East Ghausia compound and the accused Surinder Mittal had allegedly possessed the copy of the said purported letter of the PMO dated November 27, 2017 and used as genuine before the Apex Grievance Redressal Committee of Slum Rehabilitation Authority, Bandra, Mumbai.</p>
