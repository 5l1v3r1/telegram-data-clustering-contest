      <p>You probably thought the North Pole, right? Nope, Oklahoma.</p>
      <p>Did you know Creek County, Oklahoma is home to the only reindeer farm in the state? Neither did I. Just south of Tulsa is home to the Creek County Reindeer Farm. He has five reindeer that are training to be on Santa's sleigh team. In the meantime, they travel throughout the country to different Christmas themed events.</p>

      <p>The reindeer do about 75 events each and every year. So if you need a reindeer for Christmas, this is who you want to call. Maybe we need to get these guys to close out the City Lights Parade next year?</p>
