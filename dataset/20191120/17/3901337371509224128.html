      <p>As far as the ex-Chelsea man’s car collection is concerned, Mourinho has taste for the exquisite and was often spotted in his Jaguar F-Pace while in England. It wasn’t always about luxury for the Portuguese man, as The Sun reported that his first car was a modest Renault 5 of which his father bought him when he was 18.</p>
      <p>It was also reported that Mourinho’s first car he purchased himself was a Honda Civic and while working under the tutelage of Bobby Robson at Barcelona, drove a Suzuki Vitara.</p>
