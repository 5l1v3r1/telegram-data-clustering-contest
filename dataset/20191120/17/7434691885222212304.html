      <hr/>
      <p>Don Pyle is a punk rock renaissance man. </p>
      <p>Since his time as an openly gay teen in Toronto’s first wave punk scene, Pyle has always had a unique perspective. His 2011 photo book, <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/art-and-books/trouble-in-the-camera-club-the-best-kind-of-book-launch/">Trouble In The Camera Club</a>, collects 35mm snapshots of early appearances by the Ramones, Patti Smith, Teenage Head and countless others. In addition to his celebrated surf-rock band <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/music/shadowy-men-on-a-shadowy-planet/">Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet</a> – best known for writing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhb138gLzJo">Kids in the Hall theme song</a> – he’s also drummed with the B-52’s’ Fred Schneider, did the Queer As Folk theme song with his electronic duo Greek Buck and is a composer for Baroness Von Sketch. Currently, he plays in the alt-country band <a href="https://longbranchmusic.bandcamp.com/releases">Long Branch</a>. </p>
      <p>Over the past two years, Pyle has added another accolade to his résumé: beloved barber. At Ossington and Dundas hot spot Town Barber, he sculpts the hair of myriad local musicians – Sandro Perri, André Ethier, Martin Farkas (Career Suicide), Chris Colohan (Cursed), Chris Swimmings (Teenanger) – and gets to trade stories along the way. </p>
      <p>This month is especially busy for Pyle, with Shadowy Men performing a three-night residency at the Monarch Tavern. Each show will feature new material in addition to songs dating back to the band’s formation in the mid-1980s. </p>
      <p>We caught up with Pyle to talk about how his barber work and music work feed each other.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Was it tough making the transition to cutting hair full-time after so long spent solely on art and music?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In some ways, it was a reaction against music after dealing with so many frustrating technology updates, computer breakdowns and that kind of endless cycle. I wanted something social, creative and simple – which it didn’t end up being, of course. The social part was a huge attraction because when I was doing music composition, I became really isolated. I went back to school and now I have my first straight job in almost 30 years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you become interested in cutting hair?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My interests always stem back to music and cinema. [Hair] is such a big part of the look of men. I look at haircuts all the time, admire them and have envy for beautiful hair. The cuts of 1950s and 60s are a big influence on my aesthetic, and almost all of my tastes come from the movie West Side Story.</p>
      <p>Cutting hair seemed like it was something portable, where I could be mobile and do it into old age. It was also easy for me to look at most men and envision what I thought could make them look better. My uncle was in the army when I was a kid and I loved his haircut. That’s always drawn me to short hair.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You cut the hair of many local artists. Is it a way of keeping your two worlds connected?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, that part has been fantastic! Quite often I think of it as being like a talk show. Someone sits in your chair for 30 minutes or a bit longer and we have an enjoyable interaction. The conversations I have with people are so much more fun than running into someone at a show where you have five minutes to talk.</p>
      <p>It’s really cool when I cut someone’s hair and see they have a photo published shortly after. Recently a few people who won the Governor General’s Award were my clients and I gave them haircuts right before they went to the award show.</p>
      <p>At first I was disappointed that more of my friends weren’t coming in. I understand, because some of my peers have been seeing another barber for 20 years. People from every area of my life have come in to let me cut their hair. Fortunately, a lot of them have come back, too.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shadowy Men performs so rarely these days that every time feels like an event. What inspired you to do the three-night residency at a smaller venue?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We usually end up playing at a bigger place like Lee’s Palace. That doesn’t necessarily feel like pressure, but it needs to be more of a show. We definitely have some restrictions because of everyone’s busy lives, so doing three shows allowed us to play a lot in a place where we like seeing bands.</p>
      <p>Funnily enough, when Dallas Good [of the Sadies] joined the band [in 2012], we ended up playing at the Cameron House and not selling it out. Sometimes playing a big show is part of the illusion that you’re a big band. We’ve had peaks and valleys of popularity in this city. At this point we do what we want to do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What other projects are you involved with these days?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cutting hair full-time is pretty demanding. I’m in two bands that rehearse weekly and play regularly, so that doesn’t leave a lot of time for anything else. I’m going to do a film score for [the artist] Wrik Mead, and [my duo with Dallas Good] <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FilthyGaze/">The Filthy Gaze of Europe</a> is working on another record, including a song with Limp Wrist’s Martin Sorrondeguy on vocals.</p>
      <p>I feel like one of the very fortunate things about my quote-unquote “career” is that I’ve always followed my instincts. I just want to do things one 7-inch at a time. </p>
