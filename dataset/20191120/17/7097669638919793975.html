      <h1>Prince Andrew to 'step back from public duties for the foreseeable future' over Epstein relationship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:59:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Jamie Johnson</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew is <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-bbc-interview-fallout-businesses/">stepping back from public duties </a>"for the foreseeable future", following the fallout from an interview about his friendship with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>In his statement, the Duke of York said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission."</p>
      <p>The Duke added: "I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>

      <p>The Prince had been under increasing pressure to resign his patronages and leadership roles with BT the latest company to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/19/prince-andrew-sponsors-call-step-pet-project-salvage-reputation/">pull out of an entrepreneurship scheme</a> set up by the Duke.</p>
      <p>Finance giants KPMG and Standard Chartered had already announced that they would not be renewing their sponsorship of another entrepreneurial scheme run by the Duke called Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>One sponsor told the Telegraph: “It is the sponsors’ view that the programme itself can survive with a new patron, but only with a new patron.”</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew denies allegations that he had sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and said he could not recall meeting her at all.</p>
