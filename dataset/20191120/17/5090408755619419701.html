      <ul>
        <li>It’s been a busy year for the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/royal-insider">royal family.</a></li>
        <li>While Kate Middleton and Prince William’s son, Prince Louis, made his <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-louis-trooping-the-colour-first-appearance-unimpressed-2019-6">first appearance on the palace balcony</a>, Prince Charles and Camilla were <a href="https://www.insider.com/donald-trump-queen-fun-state-visit-fox-interview-2019-6">welcoming Donald and Melania Trump to the UK</a>.</li>
        <li>One person there to witness it all was Getty’s Royal Photographer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-life-of-getty-images-royal-photographer-chris-jackson-2017-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&amp;amp;_ga=2.119434700.458016250.1566203856-724621302.1558344043">Chris Jackson.</a></li>
        <li>Jackson, who has been photographing the family for 15 years, said the busy royal calender “keeps you on your toes.”</li>
        <li>As we approach the end of 2019, Insider asked Jackson to round up his favorite photos of the royals so far this year.</li>

      <p>Royal photographer <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-life-of-getty-images-royal-photographer-chris-jackson-2017-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T&amp;amp;_ga=2.119434700.458016250.1566203856-724621302.1558344043">Chris Jackson</a> has witnessed every royal milestone you could possibly think of.</p>
      <p>With 15 years as a photographer for Getty under his belt, his achievements include photographing the weddings of both Kate Middleton and Prince William in 2011, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in 2018.</p>
      <p>With a hectic royal schedule to adhere to, life is far from quiet for Jackson.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“The royal diary is dictated by centuries of tradition, which forms the framework for christenings, weddings, and unexpected events. It keeps you on your toes,” Jackson <a href="https://www.insider.com/what-its-like-to-work-for-royal-family-buckingham-palace-2019-8">recently told Insider.</a></p>
      <p>“The really lovely, nice thing about photographing the royals is that they are a small group of people. So you’re always building up that knowledge and that relationship with them.”</p>
      <p>This year alone, he has photographed <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-pharrel-the-lion-king-premiere-strain-royal-life-2019-7">Meghan Markle’s royal red carpet debut</a> at “The Lion King” premiere, <a href="https://www.insider.com/donald-trump-queen-fun-state-visit-fox-interview-2019-6">Donald Trump’s visit with the Queen</a> and Prince Charles, and Prince Louis’ <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-louis-trooping-the-colour-first-appearance-unimpressed-2019-6">first public appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony.</a></p>
      <p>We asked Jackson to choose his favorite photos of the royals from this year so far – and you might be surprised by his picks.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>This candid photo of Kate Middleton, Prince William, and their children at the annual Trooping the Colour parade is one of Jackson’s favorites from this year. The event also marked Prince Louis’ debut royal appearance.</h3>

      <p>“Every Year the Queen’s official birthday is a colourful and vibrant occasion with the best pomp and ceremony that the UK has to offer,” Jackson told Insider.</p>
      <p>“It’s also the one opportunity we get to see much of the royal family together in one place and capture some lovely candid images!”</p>
      <p>He added: “I loved this moment with the Cambridge family during the traditional fly-past as the jets whizz over Buckingham Palace balcony.”</p>
      <p>This year’s event was extra special for the family, as their youngest son, Prince Louis, made his debut public appearance on the palace balcony.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-louis-trooping-the-colour-first-appearance-unimpressed-2019-6">Photos from the event</a>, however, show the one-year-old looking rather unimpressed by his royal debut.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Donald and Melania Trump’s photo op with Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall was a moment “for the history books,” according to Jackson.</h3>

      <p>The US President’s visit to the UK earlier this summer came with its share of controversy for the royals after he spoke about Meghan Markle during an <a href="https://www.insider.com/donald-trump-denies-calling-meghan-markle-nasty-audio-tape-2019-6">interview with British Tabloid The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>When informed by the interviewer that during his presidential campaign, Markle said she would “move to Canada” if he was elected, Trump responded: “I didn’t know she was nasty.”</p>
      <p>But it seems the bad press didn’t affect this visit, as Jackson told Insider it all seemed to go well.</p>
      <p>“People have all different political views, but I’m there to document the moments for the history books,” said Jackson.</p>
      <p>“They were at the American ambassador’s residence in London, and it looked like a relaxed and light-hearted evening.”</p>

      <h3>This photo of Kate Middleton was taken on the same day that she received a special honor from the Queen.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Another candid photo chosen by Jackson is of Middleton’s appearance at a children’s photography workshop back in June.</p>
      <p>“The boy in that photo was very sweet, and it was great to see them interacting so passionately about photography,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There was no better fit than the Duchess of Cambridge, who had just been made patron of the Royal Photographic Society that day.</p>
      <p>“It’s an incredible organization, and the Queen had been patron for 67 years before passing on the baton.”</p>
      <p>The duchess has shown off her own photography skills in the past, as she has now made a tradition of sharing photos she has taken of her children for their birthdays.</p>
      <p>Most recently, she shared <a href="https://www.insider.com/kate-middleton-shares-adorable-prince-george-pictures-6th-birthday-2019-7">3 adorable pictures of Prince George</a> for his sixth birthday in July.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>This “tender moment” between Harry and Meghan was captured during one of their first appearances since the birth of their son, Archie, in May.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Here, Jackson explains: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex share a tender moment as they prepare to watch the first pitch at the MLB Boston Red Sox against the New York Yankees baseball match at the London Stadium at the Queen Elizabeth Park.</p>
      <p>“There was an incredible atmosphere at the historic two-game ‘You Just Can’t Beat The Person Who Never Gives Up’ series marking the sport’s first game ever played in Europe, supporting Prince Harry’s Charity, The Invictus Games Foundation.</p>
      <p>“[It was] one of the duchess’s first outings after the birth of Master Archie, [and] both the royals were clearly excited about <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-yankees-red-sox-london-series-2019-6">meeting the teams!”</a></p>

      <h3>This sweet moment between Prince Charles and a fan who wore a Union Jack-themed Kimono was a highlight of Jackson’s visit to Japan.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>“I’ve recently returned from Japan for a special visit with the Prince of Wales as he attended the Enthronement of the new Emperor of Japan,” Jackson said.</p>
      <p>“The Prince had a busy schedule around his attendance at the ceremony and we also visited the beautiful Japanese Gardens at the Nezu Museum. The Prince, a keen gardener was no doubt fascinated by some of the exotic specimens.</p>
      <p>“I loved this moment the next day as the Prince met Kiyoko Kondo, a lady he first met during a visit over 30 years ago during a visit to Mitsukoshi department store. She had donned a Union Jack-themed Kimono in his honour. The Prince responded as ever with good humor!”</p>

      <h3>Middleton wore this traditional headscarf during her royal tour of Pakistan, and Jackson says the “light and saturation in the colours” made it a “dream” photo.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Jackson hailed Prince William and Kate Middleton’s tour of Pakistan in October as “one of the most memorable royal tours of recent times.”</p>
      <p>“I was last in Pakistan with the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall over 13 years ago and this visit reminded me what a colourful, energetic, and friendly place Pakistan was,” he added.</p>
      <p>“We were treated to some memorable sartorial moments, maybe most surprisingly the Duke wearing traditional dress to a Gala reception at the Pakistan National Monument. A huge amount was packed in to this relatively short tour!</p>
      <p>“The Duchess <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-kate-middleton-pakistan-royal-tour-style-headscarf-shalwar-kameez-2019-10">wore a stunning traditional headscarf</a> to visit the spectacular Badshahi Mosque in Lahore after getting stuck into some cricket at the National Academy that morning – a great day and for a photographer, the light and saturation in the colours was a dream 10/10!”</p>

      <h3>This photo of Harry and Markle with Nelson Mandela’s widow Graca Machel was a “standout moment” from their royal tour of Africa.</h3>

      <p>“I was very excited when I heard we would be heading to one of my favourite cities in the world <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kiss-pda-moments-royal-tour-2019-9">on tour with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex</a> – Cape Town,” Jackson told Insider.</p>
      <p>“The images from this visit certainly didn’t disappoint either and we had a fantastic start on day one as the royal couple attended a Justice Desk Initiative at Nyanga township just outside Cape Town and enjoyed a dance with some colorfully dressed attendees.</p>
      <p>“Another standout moment for me was when Harry and Meghan met Nelson Mandela’s widow Graca Machel in Johannesburg,” he added. “I had photographed Prince Harry in Nelson Mandela’s study a few years ago and it was very special to capture this moment too. The trio certainly seemed to have a huge amount to talk about.”</p>
