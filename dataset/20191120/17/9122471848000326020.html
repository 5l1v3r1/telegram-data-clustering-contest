      <h1>Giants Insider Has Discouraging Injury Update On TE Evan Engram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:12:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When the New York Giants host the Chicago Bears this Sunday they could be without one of their best playmakers. Evan Engram is not practicing this afternoon due to a foot injury.</p>
      <p>Engram suffered the injury a few weeks ago against the Dallas Cowboys. Fortunately for the former first-round pick, the injury isn’t considered a Lisfranc sprain.</p>
      <p>Although the Giants are coming off their bye week, the extra recovery time wasn’t enough for Engram.</p>
      <p>Per ESPN reporter Jordan Raanan, the Giants were without Engram during Wednesday’s practice.</p>
      <p>Raanan said it’d be “an upset” if Engram is ready for Sunday’s showdown with the Bears.</p>
      <p>What makes this situation very complicated for New York is the fact that backup tight end Rhett Ellison didn’t practice either this afternoon. He’s still recovering from a concussion.</p>

      <p>Engram was on pace to have the best season of his young career, but injuries have certainly affected his overall production. In eight games this year he’s totaled 44 receptions for 457 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>If the Giants don’t have Engram at practice in any capacity on Thursday or Friday, the chances of him playing this weekend are slim to none.</p>
      <p>We’ll know more about his status later this week.</p>
