      <h1>Mason Rudolph discusses role in Steelers-Browns brawl, why he went after Myles Garrett</h1>

      <p>Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph accepted some responsibility Wednesday for his role in escalating <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/myles-garretts-helmet-swing-hurt-mason-rudolph-damaged-the-browns-and-wrecked-his-own-budding-stardom/het3f2afq3ei1furi2gwpvd6r">the brawl</a> at the end of last week's loss to the Browns,but hedid not directly discusshis attempt to pull Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett's helmet off or his apparent kicks to Garrett's groin.</p>
      <p>"I should have done a better job keeping my cool in that situation," Rudolph said Wednesday, reading from a prepared statement while meeting with reporters.</p>

      </p>
      <p>From the context of the rest of the statement and media session, Rudolph seemed to be referring to his charging at Garrett without a helmet rather than any of his actions while he and Garrett were on the ground.</p>
      <p>"There's no acceptable excuse," the second-year QB said. "Should've done a better job keeping my composure."</p>
      <p>Rudolph said he "did not agree" with Garrett tackling him after he released a pass late in the fourth quarter of the Week 11 Thursday night game, and his "natural reaction was just to get him off from on top of me."</p>
      <p>A reporter later asked why that effort included grabbing onto Garrett's helmet and pulling it toward him, a questionRudolph mostly dodged.</p>
      <p>"The way he took me down late, basically the last play of the game, I was just trying to get him off from on top of me," Rudolph <a href="https://twitter.com/WillGravesAP/status/1197184975583547395">said</a>. "I think I addressed that already in my statement."</p>

      <p>In the days since the brawl, Rudolph has come under fire for his actions preceding Garrett tearing the QB'shelmet off and hitting himin the head with it. Garrett has received an indefinite suspension for the helmet swing — a punishment he appealed Wednesday — but Rudolph has <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/mason-rudolph-suspension-myles-garrett/1e9p6e3p28vd31bqe2bgpmst3y">avoided sanctions</a> thus far, though a fine is reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1195409049233158144">expected</a>.</p>
      <p>At his press conference immediately after the game, Rudolph didn't discuss his role in the fight.</p>
      <p>That changed Wednesday, and though Rudolph didn't discuss the helmet pull or kicks, he did <a href="https://twitter.com/NoahStrack/status/1197184434493173761">clarify</a> he "definitely didn't say anything" that would've set Garrett off.</p>
