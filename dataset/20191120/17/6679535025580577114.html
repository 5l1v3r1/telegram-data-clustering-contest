      <h1>Sabarimala: Pandalam Palace welcomes SC order, TDB raises objection</h1>
      <h2>Age-old custom, the sole concern, says palace; board to file counter-affidavit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:58:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Radhakrishnan-Kuttoor-962/" target="_blank">Radhakrishnan Kuttoor</a></address>
      <p>Pandalam Palace, the trustees of the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala, has welcomed the Supreme Court order directing the State government to frame a separate law for the management of the Sabarimala temples.</p>
      <p>Pandalam Palace Managing Committee (PPMC) president P.G. Sasikumar Varma, and secretary Narayana Varma, said on Wednesday that the palace was only concerned about the protection of the age-old custom and practices at Sabarimala.</p>
      <p>They said the Chandrashekhara Menon Commission that inquired into the stampede at Pulmedu on the Makaravilakku day in 2011, and other commissions constituted by the High Court and the State government had stressed the need for setting up a separate administrative body for Sabarimala and associated temples.</p>
      <p>Mr. Narayana Varma said there were attempts by certain vested interests to malign the Pandalam Palace that had always stood for protecting the interests of pilgrims and for strict adherence to the unique rituals at the temple. “King Rajashekhara of the erstwhile Pandalam royal dynasty is believed to be the foster father of Lord Ayyappa, alias Manikanta. The king had established the temple at Sabarimala and offered the Thiruvabharanam (sacred jewellery) to the deity,” they said.</p>
      <p>The hereditary chief priests (Tantri) hailing from Thazhamon Madhom in Chengannur and the hereditary trustees (Pandalam Palace) should have representation in the proposed administrative body to ensure that the custom and practices are protected at Sabarimala.</p>
      <h3>‘Violation of covenant’</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, N. Vasu, TDB president, told <i>The Hindu</i> that the board had been constituted under the Travancore Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act of 1950 for administering nearly 1,250 temples in the former princely State of Travancore.</p>
      <p>The constitution of the devaswom board was drafted on the basis of the covenant entered into by the Maharaja of Travancore in May 1949, and concurred to and guaranteed by the Government of India, Mr. Vasu said.</p>
      <p>Hence the government could not set up a separate administrative body exclusively for Sabarimala as it would be against the principles of the covenant, the TDB chief said.</p>
      <p>He said the board would file a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court, clarifying all these facts.</p>
