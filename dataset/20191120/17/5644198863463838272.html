      <p>DUBAI: The head of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the FAA will be tougher on the certification of the Boeing 777x, speaking at the Dubai Airshow on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>FAA Administrator Steve Dickson also repeated the message that the FAA was not following any timeline for the return to service of the grounded 737 MAX model and said time pressure cannot influence the FAA's regulatory process.</p>
