      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- A Japanese hotel offers a room that costs only $1 per night, but there's a catch -- the guest's entire stay is livestreamed on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Tetsuya Inoue, who took over the Asahi Ryokan hotel in Fukuoka from his grandmother last year, said he was looking for ways to boost business and was inspired by a British YouTuber who livestreamed his time at the hotel.</p>
      <p>"This is a very old ryokan and I was looking into a new business model," Inoue <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/livestream-hotel-room-japan-intl-hnk/index.html">told CNN</a>. "Our hotel is on the cheaper side, so we need some added value, something special that everyone will talk about."</p>
      <p>Inoue said room No. 8 is now equipped with cameras that are always livestreaming on his YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGp5tr2rRZCWhALrp9BBkw">One Dollar Hotel</a>. He said the feed is video only and the cameras are pointed away from the bathroom area to give guests some privacy.</p>
      <p>"Young people nowadays don't care much about the privacy," Inoue said. "Some of them say it's OK to be [watched] for just one day."</p>
      <p>He said the hotel loses money with the $1 stays, but once his YouTube channel reaches 4,000 view hours, he will be able to monetize the scheme with ads.</p>
