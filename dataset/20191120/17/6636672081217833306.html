        <b>Japanese researchers created an optical modulator using a thin layer of water, and got surprisingly good results.</b>

      <p>The Tokyo University of Science team was trying to find a way to exploit the large Pockels effect discovered in water by some of the same scientists in 2007.</p>
      <p>This effect is the linear change in refractive index with applied electric field that is exploited in commercial lithium niobate crystal modulators.</p>
      <p>However, in water the effect only occurs in quite contrived circumstances and, until now, not in ways that could provide much modulation depth.</p>
      <p>It only occurs at the interface between water and certain other substances, but not in bulk water.</p>
      <p>The Pockels coefficient of this interface was high enough to excite researchers, but the thin nature of interfaces meant any resulting modulation was tiny – there was not enough thickness for even a large Pockels coefficient to do much with light passing through it.</p>
      <p>“It is difficult to measure the electro-optic signal using water as the medium because it occurs in only a thin layer. Therefore, we wanted to find a way to extract a large signal from the medium, which would not require high-sensitivity measurements and would be easier to use,” said Professor Eiji Tokunaga, a member of both the 2007 team and group that just announced significant modulation.</p>
      <p>In slightly more detail: the effect is seen in the capacitor-like ‘electric double layer’ (EDL, like in supercapacitors) that forms in water that is in contact with a transparent electrical conductor, when that conductor is biased against an electrode on the ‘far’ side of the water. The EDL is a few nanometres thick.</p>
      <p>To get more modulation, an experiment was set-up to shine the light sideways through a piece of glass topped with an conductive transparent oxide, submerged in water (see diagram).</p>
      <p>The idea was that total internal reflection would bounce the light up to the interface many times, adding to the modulation at each bounce.</p>
      <p>However, “we were surprised to obtain a huge signal from a single reflection” according to the paper ‘<a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/osac/fulltext.cfm?uri=osac-2-12-3358&amp;id=423293">Giant Pockels effect in an electrode-water interface for a “liquid” light modulator</a>‘, which describes the work in the journal OSA Continuum.</p>
      <p>It transpired that the thin transparent-oxide electrode, whose thickness was similar to the wavelength of visible light, served as a Fabry–Perot resonator, “and our first trial happened to nearly satisfy the conditions for coherent perfect absorption at a specific wavelength”, according to the paper. “As a result, a sharp deep absorption dip appeared in the total-reflection spectrum, and a large differential reflectance was obtained due to a shift in the resonance wavelength caused by the change in the refractive index in the interfacial layer.”</p>

      <p><b>The whole modulator</b> – the bottom rectangle is the glass with its conductive oxide top coating, the top rectangle represents a metal electrode.</p>
      <p>In short, there was also a change in refractive index in the conductive oxide layer that worked in conjunction with the change in refractive index in the EDL.</p>
      <p>“Since the refractive index in the transparent electrode is larger than for both water and glass – 1.33 and 1.52, respectively, the amount of light reflected at both ends increases, thereby causing an enhanced Pockels effect,” according to the University.</p>
      <p>Said Professor Tokunaga : “Through our technique, we observed light modulation with a maximum intensity change of 50% proportional to the applied AC voltage.”</p>
