      <h1>2019 Classic Rock Documentaries: The Year in Review</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:21:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Lifton</a></address>
      <p>In a year when <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/rock-movies-ranked-2019/">rock-themed feature films</a> flooded cinemas around the world, numerous documentaries about classic rock musicians also reached theaters, streaming services and television networks in 2019.</p>
      <p>Take a look at them in the gallery below.</p>
      <p>The movies include the career-spanning stories of artists like <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/zz-top/">ZZ Top</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/linda-ronstadt/">Linda Ronstadt</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/ron-wood/">Ron Wood</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/david-crosby/">David Crosby</a>, as well as depicting a particular moment in their history, such as <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bob-dylan/">Bob Dylan</a>'s 1975 <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-rolling-thunder-revue/">Rolling Thunder Revue</a>, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/queen/">Queen</a>'s recent renaissance with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/adam-lambert/">Adam Lambert</a> as singer and the death of soul legend Sam Cooke.</p>
      <p>Filmmakers also focused their lenses on music scenes -- such as the Los Angeles neighborhood that spawned the <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/the-byrds/">Byrds</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/buffalo-springfield/">Buffalo Springfield</a> and the Jersey Shore town where <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bruce-springsteen/">Bruce Springsteen</a> cut his musical teeth. There was even a movie about a bar that became a famous hangout for Los Angeles rockers. On top of all that, we finally learned what actually happened to that fan who won an MTV contest to party with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/van-halen/">Van Halen</a> way back in 1984.</p>
      <p>There were also documentaries that went inside the makings of albums, like <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/neil-young/">Neil Young</a>'s first release with Crazy Horse since 2012 and a live gospel performance by <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/aretha-franklin/">Aretha Franklin</a>, the filmed footage of which was kept hidden from the public for nearly 50 years. <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/rush/">Rush</a>'s last tour was the subject of a behind-the-scenes too, and, seeing that 2019 was the 50th anniversary of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/woodstock/">Woodstock</a>, there was naturally a look-back at the historic festival.</p>
      <p>What lies ahead for rock documentaries in 2020 remains up in the air. For now, you can catch up with our look at 2019 Classic Rock Documentaries.</p>

      <h3>'The Show Must Go On: The Queen + Adam Lambert Story'</h3>
      <p>Broadcast on ABC in the U.S. in the aftermath of 'Bohemian Rhapsody''s Oscar triumph, 'The Show Must Go On: The Queen + Adam Lambert Story' details how Queen, shortly after cutting ties with singer Paul Rodgers, began working with 'American Idol' contestant Adam Lambert and revived their fortunes. In addition to Lambert and founding Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' star Rami Malek, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins and 'American Idol' creator Simon Cowell were interviewed.</p>

      <h3>'ZZ Top: That Little Ol' Band From Texas'</h3>
      <p>Released in conjunction with their 50th anniversary tour, 'ZZ Top: That Little Ol' Band From Texas' featured interviews with the trio, as well as perspective from Billy Bob Thornton, Josh Homme and others, as well as a concert shot solely for the movie. “I think even our most steadfast fans will find themselves surprised by what they learn about those men behind the beards and cheap sunglasses," guitarist Billy Gibbons said in a statement. "There we are, up there on the silver screen and it's something we're delighted to share with fans of all stripes.”</p>

      <h3>‘Lost Weekend’</h3>
      <p>In 1984, Kurt Jefferis won an MTV contest to spend a weekend with Van Halen. The accounts of those 48 hours were whittled down to 14 minutes and screened as 'Lost Weekend.' Jefferis was flown to Detroit and was brought onstage, where the band sang "Happy Trails" to him. What followed was a party where the winner was discovered in a locked closet wearing a bra. “I was in recovery and shock for many days afterwards,” Jefferis later said. “They were so friendly and entertaining, as huge as they are. … It was the best time of my life.”</p>

      <h3>'Somebody Up There Likes Me'</h3>
      <p>Director Mike Figgis spent nearly two years making 'Somebody Up There Likes Me,' a documentary about his friend Ronnie Wood.

      <h3>'Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice'</h3>
      <p>Linda Ronstadt narrates her own story in 'The Sound of My Voice,' which focuses on how she repeatedly bucked the system, first as a woman singing rock in a male-dominated industry, then following her muse to continued success with operettas, standards, country, mariachi and adult contemporary music. It ends with Ronstadt, who retired in 2013 due to Parkinson's disease, emotionally singing a traditional Mexican folk song with her family.</p>

      <h3>'The Rainbow'</h3>
      <p>The famed Rainbow Bar and Grill on West Hollywood's Sunset Strip received the documentary treatment in 2019. With contributions from Ozzy Osbourne, Slash, Gene Simmons, Lita Ford and Lemmy Kilmister -- for whom the place was a second home -- 'The Rainbow' delves into the story of Mario Maglieri, who founded the club and the nearby Whiskey a Go Go, and their place in rock history.</p>

      <h3>'Mystify: Michael Hutchence'</h3>
      <p>Named after INXS' 1987 hit, 'Mystfy: Michael Hutchence' used archival footage and interviews from those who knew the late singer. Producers described the documentary as a portrait of a “complex and shy man who spent the bulk of his life in the public eye, rarely revealing his true self to anyone except his very close friends.” The film was made by Richard Lowenstein, who directed several INXS videos.</p>

      <h3>'Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation'</h3>
      <p>In addition to never-before-seen footage from the famous 1969 festival, Barak Goodman and Jamila Ephron's 'Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation' caught up with those who were in attendance to see how the weekend impacted their lives, and also looked at the social and political climate of the era. After screenings in theaters across the U.S. in the spring, the movie was shown on PBS as part of the 'American Experience' series.</p>

      <h3>‘Mountaintop’</h3>
      <p>Working under his cinematic pseudonym Bernard Shakey, Neil Young directed 'Mountaintop,' an 86-minute film that took fans inside the creation of 2019's 'Colorado,' his first record with longtime colleagues Crazy Horse in seven years. Young called the movie “a wild one, folks, no holds barred. ... You will see the whole process just as it went down! Warts and all! I don’t think a film about this subject with the openness and intensity we have captured has ever been seen.”</p>

      <h3>'Amazing Grace'</h3>
      <p>In 1972, Aretha Franklin went to the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles to record her gospel album 'Amazing Grace' with Rev. James Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir. Legendary director Sydney Pollack was on hand to film the two sets, but even though the record was the biggest-selling of the late Queen of Soul's career, the movie remained unreleased for technical and legal reasons until 2019. The movie captures Franklin at the height of her powers -- at one point Cleveland, astonished by her technique, jokingly throws a handkerchief in her direction -- and also features a scene-stealing performance by choir director Alexander Hamilton.</p>

      <h3>'Chuck Berry: The Original King of Rock 'n' Roll'</h3>
      <p>Jon Brewer's documentary of rock pioneer Chuck Berry premiered in October in Nashville. In addition to devotees like Paul McCartney, Gene Simmons, Alice Cooper and Joe Perry providing insight, 'Chuck Berry: The Original King of Rock 'n' Roll' also includes the first-ever interview with Thelmetta Berry, to whom the late rock 'n' roll pioneer was married for 68 years. Brewer said he hoped to change the public perception of Berry, especially with regard to his business dealings.</p>

      <h3>'David Crosby: Remember My Name'</h3>
      <p>Cameron Crowe produced A.J. Eaton's documentary that looked back at Crosby's life as he entered a new phase of his career, regularly working with younger musicians on new material. Crosby admitted he wanted the movie to capture the entirety of his character, warts and all, and came to the conclusion that "the film is honest enough to qualify as an apology" to those he's wronged.</p>

      <h3>'Asbury Park: Riot, Redemption, Rock &amp; Roll'</h3>
      <p>Rather than focus on one particular musician, 'Asbury Park: Riot, Redemption, Rock &amp; Roll' tells the story of a city, Asbury Park, N.J.; its music scene that produced Bruce Springsteen, Steven Van Zandt and Southside Johnny; and how it eventually rebounded from race riots. Springsteen's management had originally denied director Tom Jones the opportunity to speak with the Boss, but after seeing it at a local festival, the rock legend contacted Jones directly and offered his participation.</p>

      <h3>'Echo in the Canyon'</h3>
      <p>Andrew Slater's 'Echo in the Canyon' looked at the folk-rock scene that centered on Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon from 1965-67, including the music of the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the Mamas and the Papas. The movie features performances by modern acts covering songs from that period, and contains one of Tom Petty's last interviews.</p>

      <h3>'Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese'</h3>
      <p>Once again, Bob Dylan and 'No Direction Home' director Martin Scorsese teamed up to chronicle a period of the legendary songwriter's life, in this case Dylan's famously shambolic 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour, which included longtime friends like Roger McGuinn, Joan Baez and Ramblin' Jack Elliott. The movie was released on Netflix, with a 14-CD box set containing five complete shows from the tour coming out concurrently.</p>

      <h3>'The Quiet One'</h3>
      <p>Oliver Murray's documentary about former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman, 'The Quiet One,' made headlines earlier this year when it was pulled from a festival for its reported glossing over Wyman's 1989 marriage to teenager Mandy Smith. For the movie, Wyman provided Murray with access to his famously vast archive of Rolling Stones memorabilia from his 30-year time in the band.</p>

      <h3>'ReMastered: The Two Killings of Sam Cooke'</h3>
      <p>For an installment in their music-crime documentary series ReMastered, Netflix and director Kelly Duane de la Vega took a deep dive into the 1964 murder of soul legend Sam Cooke, whose death has never been fully investigated by law-enforcement officials. Its title refers to not only the loss of Cooke as an artist, but also that his death stripped the world of a burgeoning leader in the civil rights movement, which is also covered in the film.</p>

      <h3>'Clarence Clemons: Who Do I Think I Am?'</h3>
      <p>Centered on a 2005 trip to China, 'Clarence Clemons: Who Do I Think I Am?' deals with the late E Street Band saxophonist's continuous search for spiritual enlightenment. Among those interviewed for Nick Mead's movie include Joe Walsh, Nils Lofgren, family members and former president Bill Clinton.</p>

      <h3>'Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love'</h3>
      <p>The relationship between Leonard Cohen and Marianne Ihlen was explored in Nick Broomfield's documentary. The couple met on the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, where she became his muse for many of his songs, most obviously "So Long Marianne," and they remained close until their deaths in 2016. In telling the story, Broomfield used his own footage -- he knew them at the time -- and other film shot by D.A. Pennebaker</p>
