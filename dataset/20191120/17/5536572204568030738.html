      <h1>Le’Veon Bell Blasts NFL Over Drug Tests &amp; ‘Dirty A** Needles’, Says He Won’t Take Another One For Rest of Season (TWEET)</h1>

      <p>Le’Veon Bell is looking to get himself in big trouble after the running back to Twitter and blasted the league’s drug testing program for basically singling him out almost every week.</p>
      <p>He also accused sample collectors of using “dirty a– needles” and said he will not take another test after submitting to five in the past 10 weeks.</p>
      <p>“I done had 5 ‘random’ HGH blood test in 10 weeks,” the NY Jets running back posted on Twitter … “I’m not doing another after today.”</p>
      <p>“Whatever y’all lookin for it obviously ain’t there &amp; I’m not about to keep allowing y’all to stick me with those dirty ass needles.”</p>
      <p>He continued, “Find the players who really do that HGH BS &amp; get off me.”</p>

      <p>The NFL regularly tests players for performance-enhancing drugs, but some players seem to get a lot more of those random tests than others. It was just last season when Eric Reid returned to the league and blasted the NFL for giving him 7 “random” drug tests in just 3 months after signing with the Carolina Panthers.</p>
      <p>He felt targeted because of his role in national anthem protests.</p>
      <p>The New York Jets running back has 817 total yards from scrimmage and four touchdowns so far in his first season with the franchise.</p>
