      <p><b>Coldplay</b>‘s new “more experimental” double album <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/coldplay-share-2-songs-off-new-album-one-ft-femi-kuti-playing-snl/"><i>Everyday Life</i></a> comes out this Friday (11/22), and today they put out two more songs from it: the tender piano ballad “Daddy” and the jangly, mid-tempo “Champion of the World,” which was (sort of) co-written by the late <b>Scott Hutchison</b> of Frightened Rabbit.</p>
      <p>Chris Martin says, “Scott had a song called ‘Los Angeles Be Kind,’ which I love. When I first heard it, I thought it was going to go one way; but it went another. Anyway ‘Champion Of The World’ is the song that came from following the other path, and that’s why Scott is a co-writer on this song. Today is also his birthday. So happy birthday Scott and thank you for your beautiful music, wherever you are.”</p>
