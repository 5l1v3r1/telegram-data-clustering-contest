      <p>Twitter issued a sharp rebuke to the Tories after the party rebranded one of its accounts as a fact-checking service during the TV election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats put stopping Brexit front and centre of their manifesto, and church leaders appealed to voters and politicians to “honour the gift of truth” during the campaign.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the highlights of Wednesday’s campaign trail:</p>
      <p>
        <b>– The Conservatives faced criticism for rebranding one of their official Twitter accounts as a fact-checking service</b>
      </p>
      <p>The move during Tuesday’s TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn prompted a warning from the Electoral Commission that voters were entitled to expect “transparency and integrity” from campaigners.</p>
      <p>Twitter cautioned that “any further attempts to mislead people” would result in “decisive corrective action” after the party’s verified press office account was temporarily renamed “factcheckUK”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Stopping Brexit is at the centre of the Liberal Democrats’ election offer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Publishing its manifesto, the party held out the prospect of a £50 billion “Remain bonus” for public services and tackling inequalities if it won a majority.</p>

      <p>The Lib Dems also laid out plans to recruit 20,000 more teachers, provide free childcare from the age of nine months and tackle the climate change “emergency” through generating 80% of the country’s electricity through renewables by 2030.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– The first TV debate of the election campaign drew more than six million viewers</b>
      </p>
      <p>ITV’s live leaders’ debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn attracted an average audience of 6.7 million, according to overnight ratings.</p>
      <p>The programme peaked at 7.3 million, ITV said. The political head to head was up against Holby City on BBC One and MasterChef: The Professionals on BBC Two, both airing 8pm-9pm.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– The Archbishops of Canterbury and York have appealed to voters and politicians to “honour the gift of truth” during the campaign</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Most Rev Justin Welby and Dr John Sentamu said everyone had a duty to “speak accurately and challenge falsehoods” when engaging in political debate.</p>
      <p>They urged people to discuss issues “with humility and in love” while acknowledging those who hold different views “are not our enemies” in a joint pastoral letter to the Church of England.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Two million people have applied to register to vote since the General Election was called</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 2,048,039 applications were submitted between October 29 – the day the Government called for an election on December 12 – and November 19, according to Government figures.</p>
      <p>More than a third of applications (35%) came from people under the age of 25. A further 30% were from 25 to 34-year-olds.</p>
