      <h1>India expands migrant-counting program nationwide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:38:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Nicholas Sakelaris</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- India Home Minister Amit Shah said Wednesday a government registry will regularly perform a national count of all Indian citizens to search for migrants -- drawing concern that the process could unfairly target Muslim minorities.</p>
      <p>Shah <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/india-implement-nationwide-citizenship-count-191120122109336.html">said the count</a>, officially called the National Register of Citizens, missed about 2 million Bengali people during a population check in Assam earlier this year. Those who are excluded can appeal to the government.</p>
      <p>The NRC was established in Assam in 1971 to locate undocumented migrants, mainly from Bangladesh, and deport them. Wednesday's move <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/amit-shah-nrc-rajya-sabha-1620810-2019-11-20">expands the program</a> nationally.</p>
      <p>Shah said religious communities should not be concerned with the expansion.</p>
      <p>Activist Harsh Mander, however, argues the change could have "catastrophic consequences," since it requires persons living in India to produce decades worth of citizenship documentation.</p>
      <p>"NRC is a communal act which clearly means that only Muslims will have to prove their citizenship in this country," he said. "This will destroy the secular, democratic and republic structure of India."</p>
      <p>Ruling lawmaker Sudhanshu Mittal defended the move, saying it's necessary to identify persons who shouldn't be in India.</p>
      <p>"If Shah wants to identify illegal citizens, what is wrong with that?" Mittal said. "This exercise is not to identify Muslims, but those who are non-citizens.</p>
      <p>"Giving NRC an anti-Muslim twist is perversion."</p>
