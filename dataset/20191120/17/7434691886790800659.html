      <h3>CITY</h3>
      <p>
        <b>1. Fat bike the Lower Don</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s a new way to explore the Lower Don in the winter. And it’s on a fat bike – or rather, a bike with fat tires. Sweet Pete’s runs two-hour fat-bike adventure rides on Sundays and Tuesdays out of the Bike Works location at Evergreen Brick Works throughout the winter. The tours cost $50 (that’s with a bike rental; $15 if you have your own bike). That buys you a sweet ride on a Trek Farley 5 and includes rides through little-known trails throughout the Don designed for both experienced and beginner riders. (Tuesday’s night ride is for intermediate riders.) This is going to be fun.</p>
      <p>
        <i>From November 18. Evergreen Brick Works (550 Bayview). Rides are Sundays at 10 am and 1 pm, Tuesdays at 7 pm. <a href="http://sweetpetes.com/">sweetpetes.com</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Learn how to “crokicurl”</b>
      </p>
      <p>This winter, Toronto gets its first-ever “crokicurl” rink, which combines two great Canadian pastimes: crokinole and curling. Invented in 2016 in Winnipeg, crokicurl is like a life-size version of crokinole on ice, where players slide plastic curling rocks toward an inner ring to win points. Located at the shipping-container market, Stackt, after playing a round of crokicurl, you can sip on a glass of wine in the holiday yurt bar and make a homemade present at a DIY workshop.</p>
      <p>
        <i>November 22-December 21. Stackt (28 Bathurst). Free. <a href="http://stacktmarket.com/">stacktmarket.com</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Go for a spin at Toronto’s newest skating rink</b>
      </p>
      <p>It seems like every year we get a new outdoor rink. Not that we’re complaining: skating is free, family-friendly and a fun way to get moving during a season when we’re prone to Netflix binges. This winter, Union Station’s Sir John A. McDonald Plaza transforms into what will be the city’s biggest outdoor rink – approximately half the size of an NHL pad. It’s open daily, so pack your skates (or rent a pair for free) and squeeze in a spin before you start your commute home.</p>
      <p>
        <i>November 29-January 4. Union Station (65 Front West). Free. <a href="http://torontounion.ca/">torontounion.ca</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Ride the Cavalcade of Lights</b>
      </p>
      <p>Glittering lights, live music, circus arts and fireworks are part of events at the Cavalcade of Lights, the city’s official kickoff to the holiday. The ice rink in front of city hall will also be ready for a skate. As in the past, this year’s 53rd annual celebration will feature the first lighting of Toronto’s giant Christmas tree. No worries if you can’t get to the official launch. There are events going on all month in the square.</p>
      <p>
        <i>November 30. Nathan Phillips Square (100 Queen West). 6 pm. Free. <a href="http://toronto.ca/cavalcade">toronto.ca/cavalcade</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Skate at one of city’s best icy trails</b>
      </p>
      <p>Toronto has plenty of great outdoor rinks, but we also boast an impressive selection of skating trails. Loop around the concrete beams at the <b>Bentway</b>, weave around the snowy gardens at <b>Evergreen Brick Works </b>or practise your twizzles at <b>Colonel Samuel Smith Park </b>near the lakeshore in Etobicoke. All of these trails offer skate rentals, lessons for beginners and spots for sipping hot chocolate.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Evergreen Brick Works (550 Bayview). Opens November 30. Free. <a href="http://evergreen.ca/">evergreen.ca</a></i>

      <p>
        <b>6. Shop local at holiday markets</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you despise the crowded malls and don’t want to support Amazon, Toronto is lush with holiday markets where you can check everyone off your list. Head to <b>Fan Expo</b>’s market to snag commissioned artwork from professional comic artists; the <b>Black Owned Holiday Market</b> for unique gifts made by Black-owned businesses; or <b>Pink Market</b>, the queer fair with vendors selling everything from Indigenous beadwork to sexy body harnesses. For the classic mulled wine and twinkly light experience, go to the Distillery District for the 10th anniversary of the <b>Toronto Christmas Market</b> and pick up some seasonal goodies.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Fan Expo. December 7. Metro Toronto Convention Centre (222 Bremner). $10. <a href="http://fanexpocanada.com/">fanexpocanada.com</a></i>

        <b>7. Go on an interactive night walk at the zoo</b>
      </p>
      <p>Montreal-based studio Moment Factory has created awe-inspiring luminescent night walks across Canada (including one in Rouge Park two years ago), Japan and Singapore using dazzling lights, installations and digital projections. It’s 11th experience, Terra Lumina, is coming to the Toronto Zoo with a one-and-half kilometre nighttime hike among the wolves and polar bears that’s meant to transport us to a bright future where people and nature live in harmony.</p>

      <p>
        <b>8. Get fired up at Kensington Market’s Winter Solstice Parade</b>
      </p>
      <p>Loud, commercial-free and fire-breathing, there’s no solstice celebration in the city quite like Kensington Market’s. The annual parade produced by Red Pepper Spectacle Arts to mark the longest night of the year – and the return of the sun – celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. Take in the pageantry and raise a lantern to welcome the light of the longer days to come. You should be here.</p>

        <b>9. Shoot the puck with neighbours</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shinny – aka pick-up hockey – is one of Hogtown’s time-honoured traditions. All you need is a helmet, gloves, skates and a stick – and know the basic rules: no slapshots, no goalies and no body contact. There are hundreds of games for adults and kids scheduled at community arenas across the city, but impromptu, unsupervised games also happen after hours at many outdoor rinks.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Escape to nature</b>
      </p>
      <p>From the wilds of Colonel Samuel Smith Park in Etobicoke (3145 Lake Shore West) to the hidden wonders of Glen Stewart Ravine (Glen Manor at Kingston) and Crothers Woods in the Don Valley (enter off Bayview, north of Pottery), there are plenty of picturesque green spaces to breathe in on a wintry day. If you prefer the northern reaches of the city, the rare stands of Sherwood Park (Blythwood, east of Mount Pleasant), the views from Topcliff Park (Finch West, east of Driftwood) and trails of Earl Bales Park (Bathurst and Sheppard) make great escapes. For the particularly adventurous, a trek to the lighthouse at the end of the Leslie Spit will free the mind.</p>

        <b>11. Marvel at Disney characters on ice</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Canada’s own skating royalty (Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir) officially retired this year, figure skating fans can still see magical routines at this spectacular performance. This year’s show, Dream Big, features Disney heroes including Anna and Elsa, Miguel from Coco, Moana, Belle and the Genie. Watch as they sashay, spin and jump to all your favourite Disney songs.</p>
      <p>
        <i>January 24-26. Scotiabank Arena (40 Bay). $15-$125. <a href="http://disneyonice.com/">disneyonice.com</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Embrace your inner child</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tobogganing might seem like a strictly kids-only pursuit, but is there an adrenaline rush more wholesome than speeding down a steep hill? Grab your snow pants and hand warmers and hit Christie Pits, Riverdale Park, Withrow Park or L’Amoreaux Park in Scarborough, which is located within the Hydro corridor south of the community centre and has nice, long and obstacle-free runs.</p>

        <b>13. Check out new Canadian artists at MOCA</b>
      </p>
      <p>A machine that logs silence and a virtual-reality walkthrough of a drag “house” are among this year’s BMO 1st Art! winners on display at the MOCA. The 13 works selected nationwide from post-secondary art school submissions encompass installations, digital prints and acrylic paintings. Some deal with race, colonialism and violence against marginalized bodies while others imagine how bodies and technology relate in the future.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The amusement park is extending its season to the end of the year as nutcrackers, elves and five million lights transform the summer staple into a holiday-themed wonderland for the first time. Even the funnel cakes will be sprinkled with gingerbread, candy cane and eggnog flavours. Some rides will still be operational, but not Leviathan – because who wants to kiss the atmosphere in this frigid weather?</p>

      </p>
      <p>The CNE is bringing this Instagrammable wonderland of light sculptures and installations back to Ontario Place. This theme park is basically the winter version of the Ex: it features a food village, a heated entertainment tent with live music (and mulled wine), a Ferris wheel, carousel and a 170-foot tube slide that should satisfy your winter-breeze craving. And if Christmas is your thing, there’s a Christmas market and photo ops with Santa.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Who doesn’t need a little light therapy come wintertime? Once again, more than 20 artists from Canada and around the world will illuminate the Distillery District’s Victorian industrial buildings with interactive installations and light sculptures. Last year’s fest included illuminated sea containers, a light tunnel, a spinning cylindrical light sculpture and a 35-foot-tall polar bear.</p>

      <p>Ringing in its tenth year in 2020, <b>DesignTO</b> (previously known as Toronto Design Offsite Festival) is back with over 100 exhibitions, events and installations workshops starting January 17. On this year’s docket is the fifth annual A Future Without Work symposium (January 25) and a tour of Don Mills Centre  (January 18) focused on the way planners are rethinking malls as part of suburban intensification. The Gladstone Hotel’s annual <b>Come Up To My Room</b> (January 16-19) event is also back to transform the hotel’s rooms into site-specific installations. Hot Docs is also getting in on the action with the inaugural <b>Art, Architecture, Design Film Festival</b>, which will feature documentaries on everything from urban planning and landscaping to feats of engineering.</p>

Also on offer: erotic-themed prints, cross-stitches, zines and other work from indie artists. Sex shop Come as You Are (now an online business) is behind this annual event, and though it’s left a gaping hole on Queen West – a hole that can never be truly filled – this helps ease the pain. Or create more pain, depending on what you’re into.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The sixth annual design competition is now a firmly entrenched Toronto winter tradition. Organized by firms RAW Design, Ferris + Associates and Curio, the event sees local and international artists and designers transforming lifeguard stations into art installations that animate otherwise desolate east-end beaches from Family Day weekend through early spring. This year’s theme is Beyond The Five Senses, meaning the winning seven installations will give viewers a sense of how humans make meaning of their world.</p>

It features 150 of the more than 500 photos the AGO acquired in 2016, including images of circus performers, which dovetails nicely into the gallery’s other winter show, <b>Illusions: The Art Of Magic</b>. The exhibit includes 55 posters from the period dubbed “the golden age of magic,” plus archival projections and a straitjacket belonging to Houdini.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Originally mounted at London’s Victoria &amp; Albert Museum and now touring the world, Winnie-The-Pooh: Exploring A Classic makes its sole Canadian stop at the ROM from March to August. It’s an all-ages exhibit celebrating the pure magic of A.A. Milne’s creation, and the simple beauty of E.H. Shepard’s illustrations, with interactive aspects for younger visitors and more detailed examinations of the words and pictures for older fans. Don’t expect to get through it without tearing up when you realize you’re looking at one of Shepard’s very first sketches of the characters you’ve loved your entire life. (Not that this happened to us, of course. We’re made of stone.)</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Tacos Rico</b>, a new vegetarian taco joint from the people behind Grand Electric, is set to replace GE’s Queen West location (grandelectrictoronto.com). Elsewhere in taco news, the former Schmaltz Appetizing on Ossington has just been replaced by Mexican joint <b>Gordy Smiles</b> (gordysmiles.com) – also from chef Anthony Rose, who has a revamp of Rose &amp; Sons in the works. The newly renovated Paradise Theatre (opening December 5) will be home to two on-site restaurants: <b>Osteria Rialto</b> and <b>Bar Biltmore</b>, from Porzia chef Basilio Pesce (paradiseonbloor.com). And if you haven’t checked out vegan fine-dining restaurant Avelo yet, its upstairs offshoot <b>Bar Avelo</b> is set to open any day now (avelorestaurant.com).</p>
      <p>
        <b>23. Dine on a dime at Winterlicious</b>
      </p>
      <p>That faint clacking sound you hear every January is the sound of the entire city typing frantically in an effort to score Winterlicious reservations. The biannual prix-fixe promo is returning for another year, bringing three-course meals ($23, $28 or $33 for lunch and $33, $43 or $53 for dinner) from roughly 200 local restaurants. This season’s lineup hasn’t been announced yet, but perennial hot tickets include high-end locales like Café Boulud, Canoe and Auberge du Pommier.</p>

        <b>24. Get cheesy with fondue</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 70s are back, as proven by the return of houseplants, macramé, flared corduroys and – of course – fondue. Nothing takes the edge off a bitter winter wind like a bubbling cauldron of hot cheese, and a few local spots have gotten in on the act. At <b>Le Swan</b> (leswan.ca), they roll out fondue (made with Gruyère, Emmental, garlic and a heroic amount of white wine) after 11 pm. A few blocks away, <b>Otto’s Bierhalle</b> (ottosbierhalle.com) does a German spin served with soft pretzels. East-end cheesemonger <b>Good Cheese</b> (goodcheese.ca) is serving the melty stuff Friday through Sunday. And if you really want to splash out (we’re talking $60 and up), <b>Barberian’s</b> (barberians.com) does a luxe version for the after-theatre crowd.</p>
      <p>
        <b>25. Raise a frosty stein at a beer event</b>
      </p>
      <p>A rotating slate of beer festivals help chase off the winter doldrums, and this year is no different, with perennial favourite the <b>Winter Craft Beer Festival </b>set to return to the Roundhouse for another day of Ontario brews (craftbeerfest.ca). If you’d rather pair a workout with your pints, the <b>Sud Salutations</b> yoga series is hitting a string of breweries December 7 through March (beckicharlesyoga.com). For something completely different, hop your broom over to CRAFT Beer Market on March 1 for <b>The Wizard’s Beer Festival</b>, featuring tastings, events like tarot readings and wand-making classes, and the requisite cauldrons of dry ice (eventbrite.ca).</p>

        <b>26. Give back to the community and your stomach at Chefs For Change</b>
      </p>
      <p>Break up your parade of after-dark Kraft Dinner in style with Chefs For Change, an annual midwinter dinner series that doubles as a benefit for Community Food Centres Canada, raising cash for food-oriented programs in low-income communities. This year’s bashes will be held at Propeller Coffee in late January to mid-February, and though the chef lineup is still TBA, each evening has historically featured a dozen culinary luminaries (with Ivana Raca, Paula Navarrete, Suzanne Barr, Ted Corrado and Carl Heinrich among last year’s participants).</p>

      <p>Long Winter is now long-running. Long since launching as a Fucked Up-led series, the all-ages, multi-room, venue-changing event has established a community-driven, anything-goes sprit. The first show of this eighth season is at the Tranzac with R. Flex, Pretty Matty, Scorpio Rising and more independent musical and visual artists from across the spectrum. Stay tuned for events on December 13 at Harbourfront Centre, January 11 at the Gladstone Hotel, and February 21 and March 21 at Workman Arts.</p>

        <b>28. Meet Jason Collett in the basement</b>
      </p>
      <p>Damian Rogers and Jason Collett’s annual year-end music/literary variety show is moving to a new not-so-basementy venue: the newly renovated Paradise Theatre. The Basement Revue, now in its 13th year, has had many homes since it launched at the Dakota Tavern, but the premise is still the same: the lineups remain a surprise until show night and feature a mix of live performances, readings and other intermingling artists from different disciplines. Maybe some cinema this year?</p>

        <b>29. Mosh to the year’s biggest breakout rapper</b>
      </p>
      <p>Charlotte, North Carolina MC DaBaby went from zero to 20 Billboard Hot 100 hits this year. Suge was his ubiquitous breakout smash, then he stole the spotlight with his guest verses for Chance the Rapper and Post Malone. His second album, Kirk, released in September, reaffirmed his ability to blanket every crevice of every track with playful, sing-songy verbosity. If you missed DaBaby’s quickie cameo at OVO Fest this summer, his gig at Rebel is your proper chance to see how he holds down a stage as headliner – and if his fans can keep up with his warp-speed rhymes.</p>

      <p>Hollerado have spent most of the last decade making catchy pop-rock, promoting it with viral music videos, whimsical gimmicks and delightfully giddy shows. Now mostly devoted to their record label, Royal Mountain, which has become one of the go-to Canadian indie rock labels, the Toronto band are ready to fire their confetti gun for the final time. (Well, the final three times.) If we know the band at all, these farewell shows will be more wake than funeral.</p>

The mystical folkie is resurrecting her long-running annual winter solstice show (she was a week early last year). If you’ve never been, it’s a nice and intimate hometown affair with plenty of yet-unannounced special guests, hushed renditions, spontaneous banter and other winter warmth.

The avant-garde icon will mix sounds, images, poems and electronics and performing her solo works with cellist Rubin Kodheli. The good news: if you missed getting tickets, Anderson is sticking around to present a screening of her 2015 documentary, Heart Of A Dog, at Hot Docs the following night.  Other 21C concerts include a staged version of Schubert’s song cycle Winterreis featuring a klezmer band and, Against The Grain Theatre’s production of the song cycle Ayre starring Lebanese-Canadian soprano Miriam Khalil.</p>

      <p>The reaction to his debut album, The Big Day, might have been a bit lukewarm, but Chance the Rapper’s long-awaited (and once-delayed) first Toronto arena show is happening in the dead of winter. The album has some undeniable songs worth revisiting at the show, along with his already long catalogue of sweet and soulful “mixtape” tracks.

      <p>It’s been way too long since Natasha Khan gave Toronto a headlining show. Last seen in town opening for Depeche Mode, the English musician known as Bat for Lashes has a rep for theatrical world-building, storytelling drama and emotive balladry. She’s taken a turn into 80s-horror-inspired synth-pop on her new Lost Girls album, and this run of North American dates is described as “intimate, vocal, electronic synth and piano sets” that mix new songs with never-performed-before BFL material. Fingers crossed for some Sexwitch deep cuts.</p>

      <p>The Paradise Theatre at Bloor and Dovercourt just got a big makeover – sort of. Originally built in 1910 and then renovated in an art deco style in the early 30s, the cinema’s aesthetic charm languished over the years.

      </p>
      <p>TIFF is using the release of The Irishman to launch a full-on Scorsese retrospective, screening his dramatic features – and one concert film. There’ll be week-long runs of Taxi Driver (November 29) and Raging Bull (December 6), and 35mm presentations of Mean Streets, After Hours, Kundun, Bringing Out The Dead, The Departed and more. But if you can only see one film in a theatre, make a date with Silence (December 22 and 31), the 2016 drama starring Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver as young priests searching for a friend in 17th-century Japan. In its majesty and eerie calm, and its unflinching inquiry into matters of faith and doubt, it feels like Scorsese’s masterpiece.</p>

It’s Die Hard for kids, with Macaulay Culkin’s elfish Kevin McCallister laying waste to Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern’s burglars using Christmas ornaments, paint cans and a flamethrower. Watching the score performed live by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra is worth it for the trap-setting sequence alone, during which choral voices singing Carol Of The Bells give way to a more action-packed take on soundtrack composer John Williams’s The Star Of Bethlehem.</p>
