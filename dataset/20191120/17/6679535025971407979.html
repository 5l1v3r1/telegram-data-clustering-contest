      <p>Climate change, urbanisation and industrialisation have hit the fisheries sector in the coastal belt hard with several fish species on the verge of extinction, according to A. Senthil Vel, Professor and Dean, College of Fisheries, Mangaluru.</p>
      <p>In a release on the occasion of World Fisheries Day, which falls on November 21, he said: “It has been observed that several fish species, which were available in abundant number along the coast, especially Sardines, Mackerels and Ribbon fish, are almost on the verge of extinction. In place of these commercially important species, several hardy, non-economically important fish such as trigger fish have appeared in large numbers. These fish are not consumed and they are occupying the space of other commercially important fish.”</p>
      <p>He said that climate change has affected fisheries and fishing community. The College of Fisheries is studying such impacts.</p>
      <p>Apart from depletion of catch, fisherman are facing serious consequences of climate change, i.e., high intensity winds and waves, including cyclonic conditions. These natural hazards are becoming more intense and frequent. Apart from these natural hazards due to high waves and currents, the coastal areas are experiencing serious erosion, he said.</p>
      <p>A United Nations study reported that more than two-thirds of the world’s fisheries have been overfished or fully harvested and more than one-third are in a state of decline because of factors such as loss of essential fish habitats, pollution and global warming, Mr. Vel said.</p>
      <p>Mangroves, sand dunes salt marsh and wet land are reclaimed for development. Thereby, fish breeding grounds, spawning and rearing grounds are lost, he said.</p>
      <p>The number of fishing fleets has increased phenomenally over a period of time thereby causing over-fishing.</p>
      <p>He said that from around 30 million to over 60 million people in the developing world are involved in inland fisheries. It is believed that of them, about 50 % are women. More than 25 % of the world’s dietary protein is provided by fish. The human population consumes over 100 million tonnes of fish annually, he said.</p>
