      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-who-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">The Who</a> have become the first artist to be recognised on London’s new Music Walk Of Fame.</p>
      <p>Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend were on hand to receive the accolade from Primal Scream frontman Bobby Gillespie in the city’s Camden area.</p>
      <p>The Walk Of Fame has been designed as a new cultural attraction in London and uses Augmented Reality technology which allows visitors to scan the founding stone where they’ll be “taken on a journey through the culture and history of music, using stones and landmarks as trigger points to learn more.”</p>
      <p>The Who say: "We are honoured to be the first band with a stone on the Music Walk Of Fame. Camden has always been vital to London’s thriving music scene and is, as we all know, a world-renowned hub for the arts.</p>
      <p>“As Londoners, it’s very surreal to be immortalised in stone on Camden High Street, and it’s quite something to know that people can pop by and see us anytime, albeit virtually!”</p>
      <p>Music Walk Of Fame founder Lee Bennett adds: “What a great day for music, fans, the world, London, and Camden. To cap it off by having one of the greatest bands of all time, I’m thrilled to bits.”</p>
      <p>Visitors can also get an exclusive preview of The Who’s new track <i>I Don’t Wanna Get Wise</i> by scanning the stone using the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/music-walk-of-fame/id1439478368?ls=1">Music Walk of Fame app</a>. </p>
      <p>The single will go on general release this coming Friday (November 22). It’s been taken from the band’s upcoming album <i>Who</i>, which will launch on December 6.</p>
