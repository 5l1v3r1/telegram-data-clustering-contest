      <h1>Megan Thee Stallion Explains Why She Doesn’t “Give A F*ck About Competition” Between Women In Hip-Hop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:44:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a> recently sat down with actor and playwright Jeremy O. Harris for an <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kxmkv/megan-thee-stallion-cover-the-get-up-stand-up-issue"><i>i-D</i></a> interview, during which they discussed the Houston rapper’s vocal support of other women MCs. Megan pointed out the double standards for women in hip-hop and expressed her opinion that there’s enough room for everybody to shine.</p>
      <p>After being asked whether her support of other female rappers came naturally, Megan expressed her frustration with how women are pitted against each other.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t give a fuck about competition. It’s not that serious,” she explained. “You know how many men make music without biting each other’s heads off? Why do we have to do that? There’s room for everybody.”</p>
      <p>The 300 Entertainment signee added that she is more focused on her career than paying attention to other women’s moves. “I really couldn’t care less what the next girl’s doing,” she said. “If she’s shining, that’s good. It’s not taking away from my light.”</p>
      <p>Megan has frequently spoken up about double standards in hip-hop in the past. In a May 2019 interview with <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/05/20/megan-thee-stallion-fever-cover-story"><i>The Fader</i></a>, she opened up about female rappers being under more scrutiny than their male counterparts.</p>
      <p>“Being a girl too—they criticize you harder than they criticize men,” Megan said. “If I was out there making little noises like Uzi and Carti be making, they would not rock with that. And not saying that they don’t be going hard, because we definitely finna turn up to both of them, but if it was a chick, like—no.”</p>
      <p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRO9jW6oQBI"><i>E! News</i></a> interview, she also pushed back against the narrative pitting <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Nicki-minaj">Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Cardi-b">Cardi B</a> against each other.</p>
      <p>“It’s really like a lot of the fans. They really make it seem like you’re picking sides,” she said. “I really, really, really like both of them. They’re two different people, two different rappers. It’s not even the same. I feel like we need to stop trying to compare them.”</p>
      <p>Genius' Head of Artist Relations <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Rob-markman">Rob Markman</a> previously hosted a <i>For The Record</i> panel on how Megan is challenging rap’s sexist double standards:</p>
