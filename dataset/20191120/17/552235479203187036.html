      <h1>Lonely This Christmas: One elderly person on every street is isolated</h1>
      <h2>Around 3,400 of our older people are estimated to go half a week without a visit or even a phone call – and many will spend Christmas Day on their own</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:13:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>One person on every street in West Dunbartonshire feels lonely most or all of the time.</p>
      <p>That’s the heartbreaking statistic from Age Scotland who say there are around 1,700 elderly residents in the region who feel isolated.</p>
      <p>They say this equates to around one person on every street in the area.</p>
      <p>And around 3,400 of our older people are estimated to go half a week without a visit or even a phone call – and many will spend Christmas Day on their own.</p>
      <p>It is a harrowing situation and it means there is somebody living near each and every person in Dumbarton and the Alexandria area who is suffering from loneliness.</p>
      <p>There is something we can all do about it.</p>
      <p>That’s why the Lennox Herald is this week launching our Lonely This Christmas campaign to encourage readers to use the power of kindness to alleviate the problem.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it’s something as simple as starting a conversation with a neighbour or checking in with someone who you haven’t spoken to for a while.</p>
      <p>We are also urging residents to sign up to a “life-changing” befriending service in Dumbarton in the run up to Christmas, which is in desperate need of volunteers.</p>
      <p>Alison McCurley, manager of the Ben View Resource Centre, said there is a “heartbreaking” number of elderly people on the <br/>waiting list who have cried out for help.</p>

      <p>The programme connects residents with people over 60 who are experiencing social isolation, with just a couple of hours a week being spared to make a huge difference to their lives.</p>
      <p>Currently only four people are signed up to the service but staff would like to see this reach 20.</p>
      <p>Alison said: “We are desperate for volunteers and have eight older people on our waiting list.</p>
      <p>“We are at the point where we can’t take any more referrals because we simply don’t have the volunteers.</p>
      <p>“Originally we called for people who may be retired or semi-retired and are looking for wee bits to fill their time.</p>
      <p>“We later opened it up to every age group to come forward but the interest didn’t come.</p>
      <p>“It’s absolutely heartbreaking to think of the older people meanwhile suffering the effects with many not seeing anyone from one week to the next.</p>
      <p>“It’s having a huge impact on their mental health.</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing signs of depression, low motivation, heightened anxiety. The longer people are on their own, the more difficult it is for them to step out.</p>
      <p>“The reality is it’s happening right on all our doorsteps.”</p>
      <p>People can become socially isolated for a variety of reasons, such as getting older or weaker, no longer being the hub of their family, leaving the workplace, the deaths of spouses or friends, or through disability or illness. Whatever the reason, it could happen to anybody.</p>
      <p>Alison says befriending can play a huge role, adding: “Befriending is unique and distinct from other services.</p>
      <p>“Research points to a number of key benefits for older people including that they feel life is worth living, they feel they are not forgotten and they belong.</p>
      <p>“They know they have a friend who cares who isn’t family, they feel less lonely and less anxious. They no longer feel a burden to society and their emotional and physical health is improved.</p>
      <p>“I sat in with one of the befrienders who had a befriendee. We were sitting talking and the befriendee turned around and said listening to us talking away was of comfort because they don’t get to experience something as simple as <br/>that any more.</p>
      <p>“Befriending might be going to the cinema or as basic as sitting in watching TV with a cup of tea. Just being in somebody else’s presence makes a huge difference. It can really be life -changing.</p>
      <p>“Through befriending, we also might find out they aren’t accessing the financial support they are entitled to. We can do benefit checks and refer them to support such as home care.”</p>
      <p>The latest Scottish Household Survey published in September found more than a quarter of people aged 75 and over said that they felt lonely some or most of the time. One in four people aged over 60 said that they do not meet a friend, relative, neighbour or work colleague socially at least once a week.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, people living in deprived areas are almost twice as likely as those in <br/>the least deprived areas to feel lonely.</p>
      <p>Harrowing figures from Age Scotland reveal that nearly half of all over 75s say their main form of company is the TV, radio <br/>or a pet.</p>
      <p>Brian Sloan, Age Scotland chief executive, said: “It’s heartbreaking that thousands of older people in West Dunbartonshire go days or weeks without <br/>even a visit or friendly voice on the phone.</p>
      <p>“The epidemic of loneliness among older people is having a devastating impact on their health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>“While most of us are looking forward to spending the festive period with family or friends, it’s sobering to think that more than 100,000 older people in Scotland say they feel lonely most or all of the time with only their television or pet for company.”</p>
      <p>The charity also say 59 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds surveyed say they feel <br/>proud, happy, uplifted or inspired when spending time with someone over the age of 65.</p>
      <p>Duncan Beattie is one of the volunteers with Ben View, having befriended a gentleman around two <br/>years ago.</p>
      <p>He told how he has struck up a special bond with the man and now considers him a lifelong friend.</p>
      <p>Duncan said: “I’m retired myself and decided to get involved for my own benefit too. We just clicked <br/>straight away.</p>
      <p>“If the befriending service was to close tomorrow, it wouldn’t change anything. I would still go to see him every week.</p>
      <p>“We go for days out here and there and share some of the same hobbies. It’s enriched both of our lives.”</p>
      <p>Local politicians agreed loneliness was a major local issue which needs tackling.</p>
      <p>Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said: “The fact that there are thousands of people in West Dunbartonshire who have admitted to feeling lonely is a heartbreaking reality of modern life.</p>
      <p>“It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to take the time to check in on friends and neighbours who live alone and who we suspect may not have <br/>much contact with others day to day.</p>
      <p>“Community groups and locally organised social events are a great way of bringing people together and I pay tribute to those organisations locally who do so much at this time of year and all year round.</p>
      <p>“The majority of lonely people are elderly and have become more isolated due to a deterioration in their health. Many of these individuals have social care visits sometimes for as little as 10 minutes.”</p>

      <p>Duncan Beattie has made a lifelong friend in the elderly gentleman he has befriended.</p>
      <p>The retired tree surgeon signed up to the volunteering service almost two years ago and now visits his befriendee every week having struck up a close friendship.</p>
      <p>The pair enjoy days out together and Duncan said he wouldn’t give it up now for the world.</p>
      <p>He said: “We just clicked straight away. He is a friend for life.</p>
      <p>“I decided to sign up because I had some time on my hands.</p>
      <p>“The man I have befriended tells me some days it’s been really hard for him. He’ll say things like ‘I had a bad day yesterday’.</p>
      <p>“I know me seeing him every Wednesday breaks up his week and we both enjoy the time we spend together.”</p>
      <p>The friends also have shared interests and both enjoy photography which they take part in together.</p>
      <p>The befriending service matches up volunteers with residents to ensure each pairing have common interests.</p>
      <p>Combatting loneliness through befriending is a powerful way to tackle social isolation and anybody with just two hours of spare time a week can get involved. Ben View Resource Centre’s programme is now set to be extended due to the need in the community.</p>
      <p>Alison McCurley, manager, described it as a “life-changing” experience for many and told how easy it is to be part of.</p>
      <p>She explained: “We are hoping those with a couple of spare hours per week will come forward and be our next volunteer befrienders, allowing us to reach more people who we currently have on our waiting list for the service.</p>
      <p>“No previous experience is required, full training and support is given to all our volunteers on an ongoing basis.</p>
      <p>“With befriending, each person is matched with a befriender who has similar interests.</p>
      <p>“Once you have met your match your friendship will involve regular weekly visits, either to our members in their home, perhaps for a cup of tea and a chat, or accompany them to an activity, such as a trip to the cafe or the theatre.”</p>
      <p>Anyone interested in volunteering should contact Alison by calling the centre on 01389 733030 or email alison@benviewcentre.org.uk</p>
