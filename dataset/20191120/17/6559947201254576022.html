      <hr/>
      <p>No matter your budget, <i>some</i> kind of name-brand <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tablets/10395/the-best-tablets">tablet</a> PC is in your reach. For tens of dollars, Amazon will sell binge watchers and email checkers a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-2018">Fire HD</a>. Big spenders and digital artists might gravitate toward an <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/apple-ipad/118383/apple-ipad-pro-129-inch-2018">Apple iPad Pro</a>. And for bleeding-edge dwellers, there's the new Microsoft Surface Pro X. (It starts at $999, in the configuration we're looking at here.) It's a candidate for the best-looking pure Windows 10 tablet ever, as sleek as the iPad Pro. And thanks to its custom, unique ARM-based processor, the Surface Pro X is whisper-quiet and features long battery life. All those high points, though, can't offset some key flaws: It suffers from occasional sluggishness and—crucially—software incompatibilities and nuances that buyers will have to navigate. It's fine for basic use but a poor value, appealing mostly to Surface superfans willing to work within its limitations. Microsoft's own Surface Pro 7 is a better bet.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Tablet as Eye Candy</h3>
      <p>In its most basic form, the Surface Pro X is a<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tablets/10513/the-best-windows-tablets"> tablet running Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system</a>. It's slim and sleek, with thin borders around its 13-inch screen and impressively trim dimensions: 0.28 by 11.3 by 8.2 inches (HWD) and 1.7 pounds. I find that the inky, matte-black color of the anodized aluminum exterior contributes to the tablet's aura of sleekness. If you'd rather have a Surface Pro X in a different color, though, you're out of luck. It's black or nothing.</p>

      <p>The 0.28-inch thickness and 1.7-pound weight are especially impressive when you consider that the Surface Pro X includes a built-in kickstand for propping up the tablet on your desk. Other Windows tablets, including Microsoft's <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/reviews/123617/microsoft-surface-pro-7">Surface Pro 7</a>, feature kickstands as well, but they're typically much bulkier or include smaller screens. The Surface Pro 7 is essentially the same size and weight as the Surface Pro X, but it has a smaller (12.3-inch) screen. Dell's analogue, the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/dell-latitude-7200-2-in-1/122041/dell-latitude-7200-2-in-1">Latitude 7200 2-in-1</a>, also with a 12.3-inch display, is 1.9 pounds and 0.37 inch thick.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Although you can use the Surface Pro X solely in its basic tablet form, tapping the screen as your primary means of interaction, I find that the experience is better if you use the optional Surface Pro X Signature Keyboard, which costs a hefty $269 and includes a robust (if small) touchpad and a nifty digital stylus. (To be clear: The Surface Pro X, like all of Microsoft's other Surface tablets, does not come with a keyboard solution in the box.) My preference for the keyboard is partly because it doubles as a magnetically attaching cover for the tablet when it's not in use, which you'll want anyway, and partly because it includes a built-in magnetic holder for the stylus, something the Surface Pro 7's keyboard cover lacks.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672331-keyboard-costs-extra.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Most of my preference for using the keyboard cover, though? I don't find Windows 10 functions very well as a tablet, touch-primary operating system. During testing, selecting text, finding apps to open, and multitasking was more difficult with the Surface Pro X in tablet mode than with Apple's iPadOS. Microsoft is already <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/08/29/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18970/">testing improvements</a> to the Windows 10 tablet interface, however, including a new touch-optimized version of the File Explorer window, so the Pro X's viability as a standalone tablet will likely improve in the future.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672338-alcantara-cover.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>With the backlit Signature Keyboard attached, the Surface Pro X transforms into a rough approximation of a laptop. You can even adjust the magnetic keyboard so it's attached at an angle for better typing comfort. Still, the experience is not comparable to using an actual laptop. The Surface Pro X is clumsy if you're trying to prop it up on your lap, where I found it to be quite prone to sliding between my legs if I moved them too much.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Signature Keyboard, Microsoft also offers a $140 keyboard without the Slim Pen or its holder.</p>

      <h3>The PixelSense Display: A Glorious 13</h3>
      <p>The Surface Pro X's PixelSense display is gorgeous. With a native resolution of 2,880 by 1,920 pixels and a maximum brightness of 450 nits, it rivals the iPad Pro's Retina display as the ultimate tablet screen. While I can abide lower-resolution screens (like the common 1,920 by 1,080 pixels that make up the "full HD" resolution) on conventional laptops, I find that their imperfections, especially grainy text, are more noticeable on a tablet. I saw no grainy text or washed-out images on the Surface Pro X. The resolution at the 13-inch screen size works out to an admirably high pixel density.</p>
      <p>The tablet's display also works flawlessly with the Slim Pen that's included with the Signature Keyboard. The Slim Pen has a built-in battery that recharges while it's stored in the Signature Keyboard. It has a more compact design than the original Surface Pen, and support for tilt/pressure sensitivity.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672332-nyc-microsoft-surface-event-24.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I found it an excellent writing and drawing tool. Also, in my trials sketching and note-taking with the Slim Pen, the Pro X's panel exhibited excellent rejection of accidental input when resting my palm on the display. And the screen didn't bounce even one millimeter as I jotted notes, a benefit of the Surface Pro X's rigid kickstand. Because 2-in-1 convertible laptops don't have kickstands, they almost always suffer from at least a little screen bounce when you're writing or tapping on them.</p>
      <p>The Surface Pro X's twin cameras are just as excellent as the PixelSense display is. There's a front-facing Windows Hello face authentication camera that takes 5-megapixel stills and records 1080p video, as well as a 10-megapixel, rear-facing autofocus camera that can record video in 4K. That makes for some crystal-clear Skype calling, even indoors. Most laptop webcams are limited to 720p, and serve up grainy video and images in low light conditions.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>LTE Connectivity Comes Standard</h3>
      <p>All versions of the Surface Pro X feature a Qualcomm X24 LTE modem, unlike the Surface Pro 7, which doesn't offer LTE connectivity. The X24 modem is the same one that's in the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-1">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> series, and it's the fastest one available right now. To gain access, you can either insert a nano SIM card from your carrier, or sign up for a limited-term data plan directly from within Windows using the Pro X's eSIM. If you go the latter route, the current options are limited to plans from obscure carriers such as GigSky and Ubigi, which offers a $30, 3GB data bucket good for 30 days. If you'd rather sign up for a mobile plan from a major U.S. carrier, the Surface Pro X's LTE band support includes everything that AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon use right now, including LAA. The tablet has most of T-Mobile's bands but lacks T-Mobile's Band 71, which extends rural coverage.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/666444-it-s-so-sleek.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Surface Pro X also includes support for Bluetooth 5.0 and 802.11ac Wi-Fi. It lacks support for the latest Wi-Fi standard, 802.11ax (<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-1/122115/should-you-upgrade-to-wi-fi-6">also known as Wi-Fi 6</a>), however. The tablet's port complement is also rather limited, comprising just two USB Type-C ports and a Surface Connect port. The latter can accept either a charging cord or the connector for the optional $199 Surface Dock, which offers two video outputs, an Ethernet jack, four USB 3.0 ports, and an audio jack. There's no headphone jack on the tablet itself, so a dongle, a dock, or <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/3346/the-best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> are your only options for private listening.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672334-built-in-kickstand.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Audio comes from 2-watt stereo speakers with a startlingly loud maximum volume level, more than enough to fill a living room or large bedroom. The sound quality is about what you'd expect from a thin tablet—that is to say, the bass is extremely limited, and higher frequencies sound tinny at maximum volume.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Testing: Let's Run With SQ1</h3>
      <p>The ability to run a full version of Windows 10 is the Surface Pro X's key theoretical advantage over the iPad Pro, limited as it is by Apple's iPadOS and that tablet universe of applications. As refined as Apple's mobile operating system has become with handling touch gestures, and even with the vast depth of the App Store, it can't match the power or third-party app compatibility that Windows 10 offers folks doing things beyond media consumption.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Surface Pro X's key theoretical advantage over the Surface Pro 7 is that it runs as efficiently as an iPad. Instead of using an Intel Core CPU mainly intended for larger laptops, the Surface Pro X employs a custom-designed Microsoft/Qualcomm chip dubbed the "Microsoft SQ1." The SQ1 is derived from the Qualcomm Snapdragon processors found in many cell phones.</p>
      <p>The SQ1 is so efficient that it requires no cooling fans, unlike most Intel and AMD mobile CPUs. Microsoft also offers robust memory and storage options for the Pro X to pair with the CPU. The $999 version I'm reviewing has 8GB of memory and a 128GB SSD, though you can bump up the memory to 16GB and the storage to 256GB or 512GB. So the promise is a no-compromises tablet, one that runs Windows as silently and efficiently as Apple's powerful A-series chips run iPadOS.</p>
      <p>Benchmark tests seem to bear out this theoretical promise, especially when it comes to graphics performance. On the 3DMark Night Raid gaming-graphics simulation (one of the few widely recognized graphics benchmark tests designed to run on both Intel and ARM-based systems), the Pro X scored very well compared with the results of close competitors that use Intel's integrated graphics processors...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672321-night-raid-surface-pro-x.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Likewise, the Surface Pro X's performance on the multi-core Geekbench 5 benchmark is highly competitive with that of the Surface Pro 7. It scored 2,443 on this test, compared with 2,257 for the Surface Pro 7. Neither of these systems holds a candle to the iPad Pro's score of 4,500 on Geekbench 5, but the vast differences between Windows 10 and iPadOS render such a comparison moot.</p>
      <p>The battery life is more clear cut. Lasting for 13 hours and 2 minutes on our battery rundown test, the Surface Pro X offers battery life more than sufficient for all-day computing. Here's how the battery life stacks up to some of the tablet's key alternatives...</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/674227-microsoft-surface-pro-x-performance-chart.png?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Our test involves playing a locally stored 720p video at 50 percent screen brightness and with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off. Most users perform tasks more varied than that, of course, so your results may sway a bit from our number. That said, Microsoft's own testing matches our result dead on, with the company claiming up to 13 hours of battery life with a mixture of active use and internet-connected standby.</p>
      <p>One thing to note, though: While long battery life should be expected of a chip that doesn't require active cooling, the Surface Pro X lasted just an hour longer than the Surface Pro 7 did on our battery test. That dampens the Surface Pro X's competitiveness versus its sibling, especially in light of the software issues I'll discuss next.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Where the Pro X Falls Short: Software</h3>
      <p>Despite its solid benchmark showing, the Surface Pro X's unique processor falls short in a few key ways. Chief among them is limited support for third-party software drivers that are needed to use many peripherals and run certain games or other apps.</p>
      <p>Any game that uses OpenGL version 1.1 or later, or that uses drivers intended for Intel processors, won't work. Only the drivers built into Windows or ones specifically designed for ARM-based PCs will work, and that could mean a lot of frustration. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-pro-arm-app-performance">As Microsoft puts it</a> in its own document addressing the Pro X's compatibility nuances at the link, "...if a driver doesn't work, the app or hardware that relies on it won't work either (at least not fully)."</p>
      <p>The app compatibility situation is a bit better, but still less than ideal. (<a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/adobe-photoshop-elements-12/94797/news/windows-on-qualcomm-gets-64-bit-app-support">Here's a bit more background</a>, still relevant, about the overall Windows-on-ARM situation that I wrote on last year.) Some apps that aren't designed for ARM-based PCs work, but only if they're written in 32-bit code. Apps that aren't designed for ARM will also run in emulation, which can result in very sluggish performance. This includes nearly all of the software PCMag typically uses to test performance on Windows PCs, including staples like Adobe Photoshop. Adobe says it is working on ARM-compatible versions of the Creative Suite apps, though it hasn't announced when they'll be available. (For more on how emulation might affect perfomance, check out our review of the ARM-based <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/tablets/118044/samsung-galaxy-book2">Samsung Galaxy Book2</a>.)</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/666438-a-pixelsense-display.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Even Microsoft apps that are designed to run natively on an ARM-based processor are occasionally sluggish. I observed some stuttering when I attempted to switch between tabs in Microsoft Edge, and entering the Windows timeline view to switch to a different app was also often laggy. Still, the overall experience was markedly improved from other ARM-based laptops and tablets PCMag has reviewed, including the Galaxy Book2. In fact, if you're planning on running only one or two apps at a time, and sticking to web browsing and email checking using Microsoft Edge and Windows Mail, the Surface Pro X will offer perfectly adequate performance.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, you can find plenty of other, far less expensive tablets and laptops based on Intel and AMD chips that also offer adequate everyday performance, and they don't suffer from the Surface Pro X's software-compatibility limitations. The Surface Pro X is therefore not only potentially frustrating to use, but also a poor value.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>The Surface Pro X: Not Quite Pro Grade</h3>
      <p>The Surface Pro X is a well-engineered tablet, but it bites off more than it can chew. Despite the best efforts of Microsoft's engineers, it turns out that it's not yet possible to cherry-pick the best parts of the Surface Pro 7 (the power of Windows 10) and the iPad Pro (a sleek tablet with a streamlined touch interface) and combine them into a single super-tablet. The app ecosystem isn't quite there yet. It might <i>get</i> there, in time, but you need to use your new tablet today, not a year from now.</p>
      <p>Worse, the Surface Pro X puts the burden on the buyer to recognize its nuances. You have to possess at least a rudimentary understanding of processor architecture and seek out compatible apps if you intend to do tasks more advanced than the default Microsoft apps can handle. Plenty of Microsoft superfans out there are willing to take this on, and if they have deep pockets, the Surface Pro X is definitely a lust-worthy gadget they will enjoy.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/672327-microsoft-surface-pro-x-pen.jpg?thumb=y"/>
      </figure>
      <p>For everyone else, the Surface Pro X's capabilities don't justify its high cost, given what capable alternatives exist, even within Microsoft's own Surface stable. The similarly expensive Surface Pro 7 offers a Windows experience free of compatibility problems, and with nearly as good battery life and a similar weight. <i>That</i> Editors' Choice winner is the Surface Pro model most people should buy, not the Surface Pro X. And don't forget that if all you need is a tablet to check emails and watch videos, there are much cheaper solutions, ranging from the bargain-basement Fire HD series to Apple's excellent iPads and iPad Pros.</p>
