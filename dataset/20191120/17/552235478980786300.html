      <h1>Former Alexandria businessman hits out over state of town</h1>
      <h2>Paul Cocozza likened the town to "war torn Bosnia" as the council revealed plans for a brand new masterplan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:11:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>A former Alexandria business owner has hit out at the state of the “ghost town” as the council revealed plans for a brand new masterplan.</p>
      <p>Paul Cocozza, who used to run the Fountain Cafe, says West Dunbartonshire Council (WDC) aren’t doing enough to regenerate the centre and drive regeneration.</p>
      <p>He says all the focus is being placed on Dumbarton and Balloch and likened Mitchell Way as resembling “war torn Bosnia”.</p>
      <p>His comments came as the local authority revealed an updated masterplan will be created next year to refresh the vision for the town over the next 15 years.</p>
      <p>The Vale of Leven Trust has welcomed the move but well known businessman Paul, who took over the family firm from his father who opened the eatery in 1961, says the plan is going over old ground.</p>
      <p>Paul, who now leases out the cafe, said: “Alexandria is a ghost town and there has been a total lack of regeneration.</p>

      <p>“I feel we have been left to rot while Dumbarton is regenerated through relocation of council buildings, new social housing and links to the retail park.</p>
      <p>“Balloch has new streetscape civic centres and interest in vacant sites. Alexandria has nothing.</p>
      <p>“What really galls me is that we have more consultants coming in asking questions that have already been answered. We need action now.”</p>
      <p>He sent an email to the council’s regeneration department last week outlining his frustration, saying: “WDC decided the way ahead was to sell the town centre and Mitchell Way to a developer and it appears that everything hinged on the anchor store Lidl locating.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile the council had emptied Mitchell Way, which is now like war torn Bosnia.”</p>
      <p>Plans have been afoot for years to regenerate the town but they have hit repeated stumbling blocks, including two firms withdrawing from taking the lead in the reinvigoration of Mitchell Way.</p>

      <p>In April this year, Lidl announced it was now leading the multimillion pound project and the supermarket held a public consultation in June.</p>
      <p>This week, the Lennox Herald asked Lidl for an update but they did not respond.</p>
      <p>Leven councillor Jim Bollan, of the Community Party, agreed the Vale had been left behind but he is hopeful the community will drive change following the creation of a new Town Centre Forum.</p>
      <p>He said: “I broadly agree with Paul’s view that the Vale town centre has been left behind for investment as opposed to Dumbarton and Clydebank by successive councils.</p>
      <p>“A new Town Centre Forum has been launched with a broad community membership who I hope will continue the challenge to the council to deliver investment tailored to the needs of local businesses and the local population who live work and shop in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>“It is early days for the forum but to be successful WDC need to come up with investment plans for the Vale town centre commensurate with what has been invested in Clydebank and Dumbarton.”</p>
      <p>Janice Ross, chair of the Vale of Leven Trust, said she is feeling hopeful by the creation of the new masterplan.</p>
      <p>She said: “We are also working on a neighborhood plan for Alexandria town centre that we expect to inform the masterplan. It will give us a much clearer way forward.</p>
      <p>“We are working on the principle that the consultants and council will listen to what the people who live and work here want.</p>
      <p>“A lot of business owners have felt they have not been listened to and there has been a lot of frustration.</p>
      <p>“However, we do feel that we are moving forward.”</p>
      <p>Leven SNP councillor Ian Dickson agreed Mitchell Way has lay undeveloped for far too long.</p>
      <p>He restarted Alexandria Town Centre Forum earlier this year, which gathers local businesses and community groups, and says it has helped secure investment.</p>
      <p>He commented: “Through the forum we have secured commitment to upgrade paving and lighting on Main Street, upgrade three vacant council owned shop units, started designs to restore Smollett Fountain and have started a town centre master plan which will shape the future for the heart of the Vale.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime councillors and council officers continue to push Lidl to deliver the redevelopment of Mitchell Way in a way that benefits the whole of the Vale.</p>
      <p>“This has to be something that benefits the whole town, and has to be right as we won’t get another chance at this for several decades.”</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman confirmed the updated masterplan will be created in 2020, shaped by input from the community gathered through engagement.</p>
      <p>She said it will be used by both the council and partners as a clear guide for development, improvement and change.</p>
