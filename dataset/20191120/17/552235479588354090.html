      <h1>Cambuslang family open up on their struggle with cerebral palsy, and the help of Bobath Scotland charity</h1>
      <h2>Rachel Collie was diagnosed with the lifelong condition shortly after birth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:29:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">Niki Tennant</a></address>
      <p>Cambuslang mum Sharon Collie found herself on a journey she hadn’t planned when one of her longed-for identical twin baby girls was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of eight months.</p>
      <p>She was on the wrong bus, she says, heading in the wrong direction, anxious to disembark and reach the destination for which she’d bought a ticket.</p>
      <p>Overwhelming feelings of panic, worry, anger and guilt consumed her the day Rachel was diagnosed, completely changing the Collie family’s world.</p>
      <p>Twins Rachel and Louise were born 12 weeks early at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on September 23 2004, respectively weighing 3lb 5oz and 2lb 13oz.</p>
      <p>They spent the first nine weeks of their lives in hospital, first in intensive care, then in special care.</p>
      <p>“I spent every day by their side,” said Sharon. “But I had to go home at night without them.</p>
      <p>"Every day, I made my way to the hospital, not knowing if they were okay and hoping they had gained a few ounces overnight.</p>
      <p>“The first time I fed each of them was by a tube in their nose – not what I had imagined during my pregnancy.”</p>

      <p>Both girls had a number of apnea attacks – when the brain forgets to tell the lungs to breathe – some during the day, some at night.</p>
      <p>When they eventually came home, the twins had monthly checks, during which consultants assured Sharon and husband David that both girls were developing as they should.</p>
      <p>But then came Rachel’s shock diagnosis during a routine hospital appointment.</p>
      <p>Sharon studied her beautiful babies, one the mirror image of the other, with a new realisation that life would be very different for both.</p>
      <p>“Thinking back, when we used to go in for monthly developmental checks, they used to pay more attention to Rachel than Louise. It all makes sense now,” said Sharon.</p>
      <p>The family had a health visitor, physiotherapist and occupational therapist assigned to them.</p>
      <p>“What’s different about Rachel and Louise is that Rachel’s legs don’t do what she wants them to.</p>
      <p>“Her arms and hands are affected to a much lesser degree,” continued Sharon.</p>
      <p>“Louise runs upstairs – Rachel transfers to her stair lift. Louise would get out to play in the garden doing handstands – Rachel would move around in her wheelchair, watching.</p>
      <p>“Louise would get to watch TV and play with her friends – Rachel would spend time doing physiotherapy to help her continue to have the movement she currently has. And she’ll need this for the rest of her life.</p>

      <p>“Rachel has spent a lot of her life either in or visiting hospitals. She once asked her Auntie Tricia, ‘what hospital do you go to?’ She thought it was normal for everyone to go to hospital.”</p>
      <p>Rachel, now aged 15, has endured a gruelling number of medical procedures, including botox injections to relieve stiffness in her legs and prevent spasms, while her calf and hamstring muscles have been lengthened.</p>
      <p>Muscles in her feet have been re-routed to stop them turning in the wrong direction, tendons on her heels have been stretched and both her hips have been reconstructed.</p>
      <p>Falls have resulted in two leg fractures and Rachel has had knee plates fitted to ensure her legs stay straight.</p>
      <p>But, uncomplaining, the plucky teenager takes all of those challenges in her stride with an unwavering, wicked sense of humour and a smile that can light up a room.</p>
      <p>On the recommendation of physiotherapist Donna Kennedy who has treated Rachel since she was a baby, the family first attended the Bobath Therapy centre when the twins were three, and were immediately struck by its non-clinical approach and friendly welcome.</p>
      <p>“It was a happy place,” said <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/burnside-woman-meets-calum-best-6897858">Sharon</a> , 52. “It was not like an NHS appointment. Everybody understood. Nothing was a bother.</p>
      <p>“They look at you as a family, and not Rachel, the one with cerebral palsy. They would teach you what to do with the therapy and Louise was always included in everything they would do.</p>
      <p>“They helped us to understand the difficulties. Rachel knows what she wants to do, but the message that comes from her brain to the parts of her body she wants to work is not the same as you and I, or her twin sister.</p>
      <p>“Bobath have a ‘can do’ attitude, which we have also developed. In our home, we don’t use the phrase ‘I can’t.’</p>
      <p>“Bobath therapists taught us how to adapt to things that made it easy for Rachel and Louise to play and go places together.”</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Calderwood Primary</a> pupils are now in fourth year at Stonelaw High and both are high academic achievers – Rachel in maths, and her sister in chemistry.</p>
      <p>Although Rachel has experienced prejudice borne out of ignorance, she always welcomes the opportunity to enlighten those who are curious about her condition.</p>

      <p>She explained: “We were in first year in technical class and a boy just came up to me and said, ‘were you born like that?’ I didn’t mind. He was genuinely interested.”</p>
      <p>And when people react with surprise when they learn that Rachel attends a mainstream school, Sharon and David view that as an opportunity to explain that cerebral palsy affects people in different ways and does not always mean an intellectual disability.</p>
      <p>Although it’s been three years since Rachel stopped routinely attending the Bobath centre, her daily life is enhanced by the many life skills she learned there.</p>
      <p>Rachel loves to cook and can whip up the chicken curry that’s loved by her family more easily by using different equipment that Bobath therapists helped them find.</p>
      <p>She can expertly apply her make-up, thanks to Bobath helping her practise different techniques – and that gave her a massive confidence boost.</p>
      <p>Continued Sharon: “When they were younger, Louise used to ask me: ‘Do you wish Rachel didn’t have cerebral palsy?’ I would say: ‘Yes – but simply for Rachel, but not for me.’ Rachel is Rachel. Over the years, there’s been resentment from Louise, who wants Rachel to be like her, and Rachel wants to be like Louise.”</p>
      <p>Thanks to Bobath staff, Sharon and David feel confident about what the future could and will hold for Rachel, who has her sights set on a career in accounting, with ambitions to be her own boss, in control of her own destiny.</p>
      <p>The endless visits to hospital with her twin sister have also inspired Louise, who aspires to a degree in children’s nursing.</p>
      <p>“As a mother of a child with cerebral palsy, it has made me a better person,” said Sharon.</p>
      <p>“Rachel is an amazing young lady, supported by her equally amazing twin sister, Louise.”</p>
      <p>Rachel will be speaking at the Sparkling Ladies Lunch in aid of Bobath Scotland at the Double Tree by Hilton hotel this Sunday.</p>
