      <h2>Football fans could watch the UEFA Euro 2020 Final from the comfort of their bedroom thanks to new accommodation in Wembley Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:09:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, https://www.facebook.com/juliedjourno</a></address>
      <p>Football fans could bag the ultimate stay for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">UEFA Euro 2020 Final</a> ; in a room which overlooks the match.</p>
      <p>That's because Booking.com, a partner of UEFA Euro 2020, is opening a swanky sports suite for the occasion complete with a bed, football-inspired decor and seats right in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows directly overlooking the pitch.</p>
      <p>It will be open for a stay on Sunday 12th July 2020 for the final of the tournament so you can catch all of the action, from the comfort of your room.</p>
      <p>But that's not the only perk on offer for guests.</p>
      <p>As part of the Ultimate Overnight Football Experience, visitors will also be given exclusive access to the players' changing rooms the following morning so they can freshen up before being treated to a pitch-side breakfast the morning after the final.</p>

      <p>Oh, and you'll be hosted by football legend <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-villa">David Villa</a> for the entire match too.</p>
      <p>The Spanish footballer said: "Wembley is one of the most iconic venues in world football, for players and fans alike, so the chance to stay in the Stadium Suite the night of the Final and experience the electric atmosphere is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity! I look forward to meeting the lucky winners on the 12th July next year."</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, you can't just book stays at the Stadium Suite - but you can bag a stay with a bit of luck.</p>
      <p>That's because Brits aged 18 or over who book a stay via Booking.com before the 31st March 2020 (and stay before this date) can opt to be added into the prize draw to try and bag the coveted Euro 2020 Final Stay.</p>

      <p>(The stay is for two people so if you win you can bring a friend along).</p>
      <p>Other prizes include a stay for the semi-final on the 8th July 2020, as well as an array of hospitality packages.</p>
