      <p>If you've been waiting for a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">good deal</a> on Audible to take the plunge, well now is the time.</p>
      <p>Right now, Amazon is offering 53-percent off of the first three months of Audible for new subscribers.</p>
      <p>Instead of Audible costing $14.95 per month like it normally does, it now costs just $6.95 per month for the first three months. Then it will jump up to $14.95 after that third month. This is a good way to jump into Audible and get a few audiobooks in your library for much less.</p>

      <p>Audible is an audiobook service, that offers you an audiobook and two Audible originals every single month. Which is more than worth the money you're paying even at full price. Considering most books are at least $14.95 by themselves and don't usually come with an audio version available to listen too.</p>
      <p>Audible also has some of the newest books, like "A Warning" by Anonymous. Which is a brand new book about the Trump Administration written by an anonymous person who work(ed) in The White House. It's supposedly the same person that wrote that anonymous Op-Ed in The New York Times back in 2017. It's a big seller already, and you can get it included in Audible.</p>
      <p>There are also some other great books like "Girl Stop Apologizing" by Rachel Hollis, and "The Guardians" by John Grisham, to name a few.</p>

      <p>Audible is a really great service to sign up for, considering it does have a number of great books that you can listen too. And the credits will stack. So if you didn't choose a new book this month, that credit doesn't go away. You can still use it next month. Which is a really nice feature.</p>
      <p>You can sign up for this Audible deal <a href="https://geni.us/jwPsP">by clicking here</a>. Just remember that after the first three months it will start charging you $14.95 per month for the service.</p>
