      <h1>Disney Plus blames past hacks for user accounts sold online</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:24:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matt O'brien</a></address>
      <p>Disney says Disney Plus account passwords being sold in underground hacking forums are coming from previous breaches at other companies, predating last week's launch of its streaming service.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/company/">company</a> reiterated Wednesday that it found no evidence of a security breach and that account problems are limited to "a very small percentage of users."</p>
      <p>Despite warnings by <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/security+experts/">security experts</a>, users often reuse passwords at multiple services, meaning a breach at one opens the door for a hacker to gain access to the others.</p>
      <p>The news site ZDNet found stolen account usernames and passwords selling for $3 on underground hacking forums. Disney's streaming service costs $7 a month or $70 a year.</p>
