      <p>VPNs are not something we regularly talk about when it comes to the biggest shopping event of the year, but that is about to change. The first reason for this is that VPNs are selling fast, as customers become more savvy about their online privacy and need for data protection. The second reason is that VPN providers are offering better and better deals on their services, with more offers expecting during the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>With so many deals likely to drop, and loads of providers offering different packages and features, it can be extremely difficult to find the best option for you. When it comes to preparing for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you need to work out what you want, understand what constitutes a good deal, and wait for the right time to strike. Or, you could visit this page and save yourself a lot of hassle.</p>
      <p>We have done the hard work for you and researched all the best VPN providers and services, so that we can give you all the answers when it comes to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <h3>When is Black Friday and Cyber Monday in 2019?</h3>
      <p>Black Friday traditionally takes place on the first Friday after Thanksgiving, and Cyber Monday comes right after. Things are no different in 2019, with Black Friday falling on Nov. 29, and Cyber on Dec. 2. The sales period will actually lasts much longer than one weekend, but those are the two most important dates to remember.</p>
      <h3>What VPN deals will we see in 2019?</h3>
      <p>You can expect plenty of VPN deals from the middle of November, as providers look to make the most of the increased number of shoppers by enticing some new customers. Deals will probably continue to drop throughout the first week of December, before eventually dying out.</p>

        <figcaption>Save on the biggest VPN providers, like PureVPN, CyberGhost VPN, and NordVPN. <br/>Image: Pexels</figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bbg8">CyberGhost VPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc1b">PureVPN</a>, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bbg9">ExpressVPN</a>, and <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9">NordVPN</a> are some of the biggest names in the VPN market, and we expect to see all of these providers offering deals over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are also plenty of lesser known names that will be launching promotions, so it makes sense to explore all of your options before committing to one service. You need to properly consider where your priorities lie, and what sort of deal you really want, before investing your hard-earned cash.</p>
      <p>VPNs differ from a lot of other products that will be on sale over Black Friday and Cyber Monday, in that each service is unlikely to offer loads of different packages in the same way that you can pick and choose from a wide range of Samsung TVs. Instead, you have the choice of contract term, with monthly rates getting lower the longer you commit.</p>
      <p>Some VPN providers do offer tiers of membership, and for the most expensive packages you can expect to get access to more servers or a higher level of encryption, but this isn't the case with most providers. You'll generally get the choice between a monthly, yearly, or multiple year contract, with the same benefits.</p>
      <p>We are expecting deals on absolutely everything when it comes to VPNs in 2019, but for the biggest savings, look to the longest contracts. These can often be discounted by well over 50%, and whilst we make no promises, we would be surprised if we didn't see much of the same this year.</p>
      <h3>Where can you find the best VPN deals in 2019?</h3>
      <p>All the biggest VPN providers will probably offer a bunch of impressive deals, but when it comes to the biggest savings, you are best off looking at a select few provider:</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc1b">PureVPN</a> — Often ranked as one of the best VPN services on the market, and that's down to its lengthy list of features and extra low prices. Keep your eyes peeled for exclusive deals on PureVPN.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bbg8">CyberGhost VPN</a> — One of the biggest names in the VPN market offers loads of servers, high speed connections, and posted some great deals during its Halloween sale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bbg9">ExpressVPN</a> — Arguably the best VPN when it comes to speed is also known for its higher prices, so Black Friday and Cyber Monday could be the perfect opportuity to invest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9">NordVPN</a> — Access to loads of servers and no-logging policy, with best deals found on the three-year contracts. We're expecting plenty more deals in 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bbgb">TunnelBear</a> — One of the few VPN providers with a genuine free service, but for the full list of features you will have to pay. Fortunately, TunnelBear often drops great deals, and we expect to see some serious savings on offer during Black Friday.</p>
      <p>This isn't to say that you won't find a great deal elsewhere, and we still recommend researching the whole market for the very best offers. We will keep you posted on all the best deals from the likes of ZenMate VPN, ProtonVPN, Private Internet Access, Ivacy VPN, and more.</p>

      <h3>The best VPN deals in 2018</h3>
      <p>VPN deals haven't been a regular of Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, but that's because VPNs haven't been massively popular until the last few years. In 2018, everything changed with absolutely loads of Black Friday VPN deals, with the best coming from the likes of NordVPN and PureVPN.</p>
      <p><a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/76q9">NordVPN</a> offers a huge 75% discount on its three-year plan, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bc1b">PureVPN</a> dropped the monthly rate of its five-year plan to almost £1, and CyberGhost offered an 18-month contract for under £40. This is just a flavour of what was on offer last year, and if you come across a deal that doesn't at least match these prices this year, move along.</p>
      <p>We're expecting more of the same in Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019, and we'll make sure you don't miss a thing. All you need to do to keep track of all the best VPN deals is bookmark this page. From the beginning of November, we'll be updating this page with the best offers so you can pick up a bargain. </p>
