      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/FabrizioRomano/status/1197190492057935878">Fabrizio Romano</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/ac-milan">AC Milan</a> have held initial talks with Mino Raiola to secure the services of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/zlatan-ibrahamovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a>. Talks have begun between all parties involved and although nothing has been finalized this point of time, the former Sweden international is set to make a decision in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old spent two seasons with the Italian giants, winning the Serie A and the Supercoppa Italiana in his time at the club and finishing the 2010/11 season as the top scorer in the Scudetto with 28 goals in 32 league games.</p>
      <p>After a season and a half in England with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-united">Manchester United</a>, Ibrahimovic opted to spend the twilight years of his career in the United States and signed a contract with LA Galaxy in March 2018, where he added to his cult-hero status with a series of impressive performances.</p>
      <p>Despite leading from the front and spearheading his side to the playoffs this season, LA Galaxy were beaten 5-3 in the Western Conference semi-finals by Los Angeles FC and the legendary striker announced his decision to leave the club via his Twitter account, shortly afterward.</p>
      <p>AC Milan are languishing in 14th place in the Serie A standings and opted to part ways with manager Marco Giampaolo after series of underwhelming results domestically. Stefano Pioli took over the reins from the Italian tactician and Rossoneri have failed to kick on under their new coach, with just 1 win in 5 games.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic is set to make his decision in the coming days but he looks primed to reunite with his former club on a short-term deal.</p>
