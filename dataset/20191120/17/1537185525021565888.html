      <p>SPEARMAN, Texas (KFDA) - Federal prosecutors filed cases yesterday against two Spearman men and an insurance agency for falsely collecting more than $250,000 from the government.</p>
      <p>From June of 2014 to September of 2015, court documents state that Justin Boyd, David Boyd and North Plains Insurance Agency, Inc. are accused of federal offenses for collecting $279,000 in crop insurance payments in the Texas Panhandle.</p>
      <p>Documents claim they made fake claims of losses in Hartley, Moore and Randall counties under another name.</p>
      <p>The charges say they used an alias to say they were new crop producers to qualify for higher insurance payments when they werenâ€™t even involved in farming.</p>
      <p>Because those customers were falsely wrote in, it caused the FCIC to lose more than $279,000.</p>
