      <p>Construction of the new regulator across the Kollidam at Mukkombu near Tiruchi was progressing well and is on course to be completed as per schedule by March 2021, N.D.Thoppu Venkatachalam, Chairman, Estimates Committee of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, said here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at Mukkombu after inspecting progress of the work, he said the regulator, executed by L&amp;T, was being built with very strong foundation. Piers were being erected for depth of 25 metres. The new structure would be strong enough to withstand even if there were to be a water flow of up to five lakh cusecs.</p>
      <p>He said that the kudimaramathu scheme was being executed well with participation of farmers. The sanctioned works are nearing completion. Renovation of irrigation tanks will not only help conserve rainwater but also prevent encroachments.</p>
      <p>Renovation under kudimaramathu and rainwater harvesting structures being created in the district are being executed well. Certain issues raised by farmers during interactions will be taken to the notice of government, he said. The State was poised to achieve a food grain production of 125 lakh tonnes during the current year. It has been bagging the Centre’s awards in foodgrain production repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Later, speaking at a review meeting, Mr.Venkatachalam urged officials to sensitise people to the schemes implemented by the government. He urged them to plant saplings in a big way to increase the green cover. Tamil Nadu’s forest cover which stood at 33% in 2000 had fallen to 18%. Thanks to the initiative taken by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, the forest cover improved to 23%. Officials should take steps to regain the lost forest cover.</p>
      <p>Earlier, committee members visited the Agriculture Department’s Bio Fertilizer Quality Control Lab in Tiruchi besides the kudimaramathu work at irrigation tanks at Sethurapatti and Paganur and a few other development works. At Sethurapatti, a group of farmers sought an increase in the number of work days under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme to 150 days a year from 100 days. Mr.Venkatachalam promised to take up the demand with the Chief Minister.</p>
      <p>Committee members C.V.Rajendran, I. Karunanidhi, V.S.Kalimuthu, S.S.Saravanan, M.Selvarasu, A.Natarajan, P.Periyapullan alias Selvam, K.Manickam and M.K.Mohan were among those who took part in the review. Collector S.Sivarasu accompanied the members.</p>
