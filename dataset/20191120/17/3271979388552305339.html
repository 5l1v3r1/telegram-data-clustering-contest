      <p><b>Katie Holmes</b> is not living “paycheck to paycheck,” as a phony tabloid report alleges. The story is completely false. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can bust it.</p>
      <p>In this week’s issue of <i><b>Star</b></i>, the outlet contends that Holmes is spending too much money and living beyond her means. According to the phony report, Holmes pays $25,000 a month in rent for her New York City apartment, and $56,000 for her daughter Suri’s school, “not to mention her signature high-end wardrobe.” As a result, the publication’s so-called “source” says she’s “living paycheck to paycheck” while “her career is going through a mini slump.”</p>
      <p>The supposed “insider” also falsely claims, “The talk is she’s pulling in $20K for red carpet events and she wants to do a lot more,” as the acting gigs aren’t coming as quickly as she’d like. The anonymous tipster adds, “She heard Kim Kardashian gets $100K just to show up to a Vegas nightclub and she’s eager to get in on that too.” The unnamed insider ends the story by saying, “Her paychecks don’t match her ambition.”</p>
      <p>There is a lot to unpack with this one. For starters, although the details of Holmes divorce from Suri’s father, Tom Cruise, have been kept under wraps, and even though Cruise is estranged from Suri, it’s safe to assume that Holmes gets significant financial assistance from her ex-husband. The idea that Holmes can’t afford Suri’s schooling is ludicrous. It’s also insane to purport, as the magazine does, that a woman with “$10 million in the bank” is “living paycheck to paycheck.” The tabloid even concedes that she’s earning big bucks as the face of a number of marketing campaigns, including Quaker Oats, Alterna Skincare, and Bobbi Brown makeup.</p>
      <p>Holmes, who has lived primarily in New York City for years now, also recently put her southern California home <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/20/katie-holmes-selling-stylish-calabasas-home-for-4-6m/">on the market for $4.6 million</a>, as she rarely uses it. The actress also has four completed projects, according to IMDB, and another one in post-production. It’s also hard to fathom that Holmes taking a page out of Kim Kardashians playbook, as she’s never been one to seek out cheap publicity. In fact, she’s quite the opposite, preferring privacy for her and her daughter. Holmes’ rep backs this all up, going on the record to dismiss the tabloid’s report.</p>
      <p>The real story here is how often <i>Star</i> incorrectly reports on Holmes. At least once a month, <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunks another tall tale the tabloid tries to sell. Just two weeks ago, we debunked the outlet’s bogus cover story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-justin-theroux-dating/">Holmes was secretly dating Justin Theroux</a>. The actress’s spokesperson assured us the actress doesn’t even know Theroux.</p>
      <p>This also isn’t the first time a tabloid has made up a phony story about the actress being strapped for cash. Last year, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out Star’s sister outlet, the <i>Globe</i>, for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-movie-roles-money/">Holmes was willing to take any movie role</a> offered to her because she desperately needed the money. This latest take on the subject is more nonsense.</p>
