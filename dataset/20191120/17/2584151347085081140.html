      <h2>Liberal Democrats launch election manifesto with a promise to stop Brexit.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:48:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:48</time> by <a rel="author">Eleni Courea, Emilio Casalicchio</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — Only the Liberal Democrats can stop Brexit by preventing Boris Johnson from remaining as prime minister, according to Jo Swinson.</p>
      <p>The party’s leader said the Liberal Democrats are “the only party that can win a significant number of seats from the Conservatives and deprive them of a majority.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch of her party’s election manifesto in London, Swinson presented herself as an alternative to the two “tired old parties” — Johnson’s Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.</p>
      <p>Swinson said Corbyn and Johnson were “two men who only know how to rehash ideas from the past, whether that’s the 1970s or the 1870s,” and that “whether Brexit is done by Boris Johnson or ‘sorted’ by Jeremy Corbyn, they are both gambling with your future.”</p>
      <p>The central policy of the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto is stopping Brexit — the party said it would revoke Article 50 if it won a parliamentary majority and push for a second referendum if it didn’t.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">chance of the Lib Dems</a> winning a majority at the December 12 election are virtually zero, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">according to current polling</a>. The party could be kingmakers if the Tories or Labour need help to form a majority after polling day.</p>
      <p>Swinson has ruled out going into a coalition with either Corbyn or Johnson.</p>
      <p>In setting out their Brexit plans, the party estimates remaining in the EU would deliver a £50 billion “bonus” to public finances on the basis that the economy will grow more quickly than it would after Brexit.</p>
      <p>Institute for Fiscal Studies Director Paul Johnson said there was “a lot of uncertainty over such an estimate.”</p>
      <p>In her speech, Swinson also outlined measures to tackle climate change, fund childcare and give more money to schools. The party is promising to raise income tax by 1p for every £1 to invest in health and social care and to legalize cannabis for sale in licensed premises.</p>
