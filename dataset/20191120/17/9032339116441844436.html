      <p>Chloe Kernaghan, Simone Nemirovsky, and Miranda Barnes—three women fearlessly carving out inspiring careers in creative fields that breed community, whether around the dinner table, in movement together, or in representation on the pages of national magazines.</p>
      <p>Kernaghan co-founded a yoga studio, Sky Ting, where her relaxed, process-based approach to yoga has garnered a cult following. Nemirovsky is a chef who brings mouthwatering food to her catering company clients across New York City. And photographer Barnes has gained a reputation for her intimate portraits of people of color (her photo essay on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination graced the front page of the <i>New York Times)</i>.</p>
      <p>All three are redefining what it means to be a leader—and doing so with exceptional taste. Discover how these three entrepreneurs approach their work on a magazine assignment, in front of a yoga class, and in a test kitchen.</p>

      <p>Meeting Chloe Kernaghan, it’s easy to see why <a href="https://www.skyting.com/">Sky Ting</a>, the yoga studio she co-founded in New York City’s Chinatown with Krissy Jones in 2015, has such devoted fans. She’s charismatic and disarming, the kind of person you’d trust to lead you into any posture.</p>
      <p>Kernaghan grew up on the island of Guam and came to New York to study performing arts at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, earning a B.F.A. in Drama in 2009. She draws on this background in her yoga teaching. “There’s a performer quality to [teaching] for sure,” she says. “But there's obviously a good deal of taking down the mask and trying to get raw and honest with those that you're with, too.”</p>
      <aside>Yoga doesn't need to be about contortion or showmanship or performance.</aside>
      <p>Kernaghan speaks passionately about the need for “safer, more accessible yoga.” She wants everyone to develop a practice they can sustain, and she’s leery of more “exercise-oriented” trends in the yoga space that might push people to overdo it. “Yoga doesn't need to be about contortion or showmanship or performance,” she says. “It's about process, and because we're so product-driven in so many parts of our world these days, I think it's easy for yoga to fall into that as well. People want to get to that pose, and they want to nail a headstand or handstand, and yes, of course that will come with time—but it's really not about that.”</p>

      <p>Kernaghan likes for her style to set the tone for the class: casual, unexpected, and not overly performative. She often pulls off outfits that depart from the default yoga teacher uniform of matching athleisure. “Obviously, there are days where I'm just going to be in super simple leggings and a T-shirt, but I've been known to teach in dresses,” or a “big, boxy shirt” and men’s gym shorts, she says.</p>

      <p>Kernaghan teaches around five classes daily at Sky Ting’s three city locations, and finds time to attend a yoga class four times a week. Work takes place anywhere and everywhere in-between. With an unpredictable schedule and no office, routine is important. Regular acupuncture, at least one weekly dance class, and dinners with friends are all part of her self-care.</p>
      <p>She draws inspiration from New York’s cultural scene, especially dance and museums. Kernaghan is also an avid reader; she recently enjoyed Colson Whitehead’s <i>The Nickel Boys </i>and<i> </i>Ocean Vuong’s<i> On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</i>. Above all, she’s inspired by the sea. “Maybe it’s where I grew up, but being near water is very important to me,” she says. “Even a cold Hamptons beach works in the winter. It helps with my soul.”</p>

      <p>Chef Simone Nemirovsky founded her boutique catering company <a href="http://www.table-bk.com/">Table BK</a> five years ago out of her apartment in, yes, Brooklyn. “I always loved cooking,” she says. “I’d cook all the time for friends, and they’d be like, ‘Oh Simone, you’re so good at this, you should do this.’”</p>
      <p>Taking the actual plunge, though, was a tough transition. Nemirovsky quit a relatively secure career in retail (she was a buyer and visual merchandiser at Anthropologie and One Kings Lane) to enter the ultra-competitive world of New York City catering as a newbie entrepreneur. “When I told my parents I was going to start a catering company, they were not happy,” she admits. “They were worried about insurance and stability.”</p>

      <p>Nemirovsky has used what she learned during her years in retail to make Table BK a sought-after caterer for events and dinners, especially among New York City’s fashion set. “Working in the corporate world gave me a lot of insight into organizations,” she says: how they work, how they’re structured, how they motivate people. And, of course, she was training her creative eye: “My favorite part of my previous career was merchandising. So I wanted to bring that element into catering.”</p>
      <p>Accordingly, Table BK is known for its sumptuous presentation — tablescapes that look as delicious as Nemirovsky’s food. And she’s often inspired by her peers. “I have a ton of friends in the business; they’ll come to work with me for a day and we’ll do an event and they’ll bring their style in,” she says.</p>
      <aside>What I’m trying to bring to the table is not just food—it’s a whole experience.</aside>
      <p>Travel is also a big inspiration. “I’ll go to Italy, and all I’ll want to do is learn how to make pasta from scratch, or make ragùs.” Reminded of Italy, Nemirovsky launches into a description of a particular breakfast cake—“beautiful, rustic-looking, with baked apples and sugar”—that she ate last year on a trip with her husband at a mother-daughter-run <i>masseria</i>, or a farmhouse bed-and-breakfast. “They made the most unbelievable breakfast cakes that I have ever tasted," she recalls. "All I wanted to do was run home and bake.”</p>
      <p>Most days, Nemirovsky can be found in her test kitchen or transporting food and equipment to and from events, so she strives to look “chic and clean.” Closed-toed shoes are a must. “I spend a lot of time on my feet, so I do a lot of fashion sneakers,” she explains.</p>

      <p>Nemirovsky’s favorite events to cook for are intimate dinner parties. “That’s when I can go to Union Square Greenmarket and pick out one bunch of the perfect vegetable for that evening, and just get to be really creative,” she says. “When it comes to catering, what I’m trying to bring to the table is not just food—it’s a whole experience. It’s about sitting with friends and family, eating family-style, and the beauty and execution of the whole table."</p>

      <p>Although she finished college just last year, photographer Miranda Barnes’ gentle but keenly observed studies of people of color in America have already earned her the <i>New York Times</i> front page, as well as a Magnum Foundation Fellowship for emerging photographers. Through her work, she marries her two passions: photography and social justice.</p>
      <aside>Sometimes, it's putting the camera down for a minute and just talking to someone.</aside>
      <p>That’s reflected in her B.A. in Humanities and Justice at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, from which she graduated <i>cum laude</i>. “If you want to know John Jay, 50 percent of the population is studying to be NYPD, right?” she says. “And then the rest of us are activists, lawyers, humanitarians, some forensic scientists. It’s all of these kind of opposite sides. I always found it to be such an interesting school because of that juxtaposition.”</p>

      <p>Barnes, who was born in Brooklyn to a Jamaican social worker mother, chose John Jay over art school partly because of the cost—“I couldn't fathom being that much in debt for a career that I didn't know if I was going to be able to make it in or not”— but also because she was drawn to the racially diverse environment and a curriculum that emphasizes aspects of law, history, and research. “The classes that I took were classes on the history of lynching, history of terrorism, things that I feel are so necessary to understanding what's happening right now,” she says. “It was really interesting to go to a school like that during this time in America.”</p>

      <p>Barnes cites inspirations as diverse as the late Robert Frank, whose poetic masterpiece <i>The Americans</i> documented American life in the 1950s, and fashion photographer Ellen von Unwerth. And Barnes’ interest in fashion spurs her to take some aesthetic risks in her daily life. “My friends make fun of me,” she laughs. “No, I love fashion. I also love comfort. I definitely love to feel like I can go from shooting all day to getting drinks with friends.”</p>
      <p>It’s easy to see how Barnes’ gentle manner informs the way she makes work, and the appearance of intimacy she can create, even with a stranger she meets on the street in Sunset Park. “I'm not going to take a photo of you if you don't want me to,” she says. “Sometimes, it's putting the camera down for a minute and just talking to someone."</p>
