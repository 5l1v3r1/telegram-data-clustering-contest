      <p>Recently approved <a href="https://fintechinsider.pro/u3z">funding portal, Fundopolis</a> has announced its intent to “make it simple for individuals and communities to invest in and support the small businesses they love.” Four issuers have now posted offerings on the Fundopolis site.</p>
      <p>The FINRA regulated funding portal issued a statement announcing its public launch this week. <i>Crowdfund Insider</i> noted its addition to <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/11/154240-reg-cf-funding-portals-50-in-total-with-several-exits-and-several-additions-is-reg-cf-ready-to-scale/">the list of Reg CF platforms on Monday.</a></p>
      <p>Fundopolis also announced that Michael Mook has joined the company as CEO. He is said to bring more than 30 years of financial technology and Wall Street experience to Fundopolis.</p>
      <p>Mook joins Fundopolis from Weeden &amp; CO. LP, a company that was recently acquired by Piper Jaffray. Mook is described as passionate about “making crowdfunding more accessible to the general population through the use of next-generation technology, including blockchain.”</p>
      <p>Mook explained that by shifting focus to the community aspect of equity crowdfunding, they will unlock the ability to tap into a treasure trove of opportunity for local businesses:</p>
      <blockquote>“With the launch of our platform, any individual will be able to invest and support the local businesses they are passionate about, through a seamless user experience. I am excited to assume this new role as CEO, and help Fundopolis make Main Street’s goals a reality.”</blockquote>

      <p>Jan Steenbrugge, founder and President of Fundopolis, explained that small businesses are at the heart and soul of communities:</p>
      <blockquote>“Successful businesses help communities thrive, and our platform gives owners and entrepreneurs a chance to succeed by providing people direct investment opportunities in businesses they love. It’s the dawn of a new era, and we are excited that Fundopolis will play an integral part by connecting small business owners with their most valued customers in a mutually beneficial relationship.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to Fundopolis, business owners may choose the terms for the securities they offer on their platform. The issuers may generate a return for investors with a combination of money, perks or a stake in the business.</p>
      <p>Fundopolis seeks to simplify the capital-raising process via investment crowdfunding, saving businesses time and money by making it easy to set their own terms and communicate with their supporters.</p>
      <p>Fundopolis says it also provides additional tools needed to manage the securities and perks they offer.</p>
