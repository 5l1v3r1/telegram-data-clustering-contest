      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sokratis-papastathopoulos/">Sokratis Papastathopoulos</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rob-holding/">Rob Holding</a> have backed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> to still qualify for next season’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a>.</p>
      <p>Manchester City currently occupy fourth spot, with league Chelsea, Leicester City and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> leaders Liverpool making up the top three.</p>
      <p>Many Arsenal fans wrote off their top four hopes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/unai-emery-posts-worse-record-arsene-wenger-arsenals-defeat-leicester-11072267/">after a 2-0 defeat to Leicester City</a> left Arsenal with an eight-point gap to overturn.</p>
      <p>Sokratis, however, called for calm, saying: ‘The team needs confidence and calm to show the quality we have. This will give confidence also,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘I think we can get [into the top four] because if we find one or two games where we can play very good and have a good result, after the team will take confidence and after that we have the quality.’</p>

      <p>Sokratis’ fellow defender Rob Holding also insisted qualifying for next season’s Champions League was still the goal at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>‘We just need to string a couple of wins together and I think that will lift the confidence again and hopefully set us off on a run.</p>
      <p>‘We just need to stay calm and stay positive. We’re sixth, we’re not a million miles off it,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘We’re eight points off the top four but if we have three wins in a week we’re back up within touching distance so it’s not crisis point by any stretch of the imagination. We need to keep calm.’</p>
