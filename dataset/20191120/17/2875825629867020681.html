      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> was once friends with OJ Simpson - although it was a reluctant relationship.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star met shamed ex-footballer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/oj-simpson">OJ</a> through now ex-wife Kris Jenner, but she never liked him.</p>
      <p>US reality star Caitlyn believes OJ committed and "got away with" the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.</p>
      <p>OJ always denied he was involved in the horrific crime, and was infamously acquitted of the murders at trial, where he was represented by a legal team that included Kris' ex-husband Robert Kardashian.</p>
      <p>OJ was later found legally responsible for the murders and ordered to pay millions to the families of the deceased, but they never saw a penny.</p>

      <p>However, Caitlyn's dislike for the disgraced athlete goes back way before that.</p>
      <p>She wrote all about her interactions with OJ in her book The Secrets Of My Life.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn explains that Kris was close friends with Nicole for years and that that's how OJ came into her life, when she was known as Bruce before her transition and married to the Kardashian momager.</p>
      <p>But the athletes had actually already crossed paths years earlier at the 1976 Olympics where Bruce won gold in the decathlon and OJ was working as a sports presenter.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn writes: "We have both come out of the same world of the male athlete with all its stereotypes and behavioural expectations, a type of identity that I come to call the male athlete gender.</p>

      <p>"I struggled against it because of my issues and extreme discomfort in that world and its constant objectification of women, and the endless bragging about f**ing to the point where you had to wonder what these guys were really hiding.</p>
      <p>"OJ was at the completely opposite side of the spectrum as me - women as eye candy and sex toys, physically abusive when he did not get his way or felt he was being defied, the loud life of the party anywhere and anytime, like so many other athletes."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says while she didn't care when her fame began to fade in the 1980s, OJ could not bear the thought of losing his and that he drew attention to himself at all times.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says OJ was put "high atop a pedestal" in his college football days and loved the attention.</p>

      <p>But OJ was everything Caitlyn, who was struggling with gender dysphoria, hated.</p>
      <p>She said: "If I looked in the mirror and loathed myself, I looked at OJ and saw a monster of a male athlete. I wonder if this contributed to my feelings of awkwardness around him, that even if he embodied an archetype that people expected from me.</p>
      <p>"There were other contributing factors in my distaste for him: he was the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of them."</p>
      <p>After describing their initial meetings, she continued: "I eventually found him exhausting and pathetic, his need for one-upmanship such that it was almost like he was on the football field again in which everyone else was an opponent. I was wary."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn says Kris had told her about OJ's tumultuous relationship with Nicole, but that OJ would say things during their meetings like "when your wife's happy, you're happy".</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says OJ had a "pathological need to be the big man on campus" and said she wondered how anyone could cope with being married to him and feeding his "insatiable ego day in and day out".</p>
