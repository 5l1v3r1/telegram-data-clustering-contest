      <h1>Production on Galaxy Note 10-like batteries for Galaxy S11 has begun</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:07:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>ITM Semiconductor has reportedly begun shipping battery Protection Module Packages (PMP) for the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-s11/">Galaxy S11</a> series to Samsung Electronics, according to a recent report by South Korean news outlet <a href="http://en.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=602"><i>The Elec</i></a>. The modules have reportedly been packaged in Vietnam and they are said to be paired with battery cells supplied by LG Chem.</p>
      <p>In essence, this means that the Galaxy S11 series should use the same type of batteries as the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-note-10/">Galaxy Note 10</a> and Note 10+. The technology will be the same but the capacities will likely differ. In contrast, the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-s10/">Galaxy S10</a> lineup features battery cells combined with Protection Circuit Modules. This solution requires more space, while Protection Module Packages allow smartphone batteries to decrease in size by up to 57%.</p>
      <h3>The Galaxy S11 series will likely strike a balance between size and battery life</h3>
      <p>Even though PMP solutions technically allow batteries to be up to 57% more efficient, that’s not to say that Samsung will push the Galaxy S11 to the absolute limit in this regard. In other words, don’t expect the Galaxy S11e to have a 4,867mAh battery that’s larger by 57% compared to the Galaxy S10e’s. Samsung will likely leverage the advantages of PMP to not only give the Galaxy S11 decent battery life but to also create a more compact design with thin bezels.</p>
      <p>In reality, the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/smallest-samsung-galaxy-s11-could-have-a-surprisingly-big-battery/">Galaxy S11e may end up</a> being powered by a 3,800-3,900mAh battery, while the Galaxy S11 and Galaxy S11+ could rely on <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/regular-galaxy-s11-may-or-may-not-have-a-4300-mah-battery/">4,300mAh and 5,000mAh units</a>, respectively. These details have yet to be officially confirmed but the series is expected to be unveiled in the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s11-launch-event-third-week-of-february/">third week of February</a> and we’re bound to find out more details by then.</p>
