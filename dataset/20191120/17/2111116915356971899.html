      <p>Curved monitors were once the height of computer luxury, but Samsung and Walmart are looking to change that for this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> season.</p>
      <p>The duo are selling a 32-inch curved monitor for less than $200 in advance of the shopping holiday as part of the early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/walmart-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-2019">Walmart Black Friday</a> sale.</p>

      <p>Here's a rather sizable monitor with an 1800R screen curvature for extra immersion in your games and movies. Just know that it's a 1080p display running at 60Hz refresh rate, which is basic but not bad at all for a whopping $170 off list price.View Deal</p>
      <p>This is undoubtedly a steal for a curved monitor that uses the arguably superior Â VA (vertical alignment) panel type, which offers higher contrast ratio than TN or IPS panels. As such, you're looking at a 3,000:1 contrast ratio here in a screen that displays 99% of the sRGB color gamut and 73% of the Adobe RGB gamut.</p>
      <p>With all of that considered, this is an excellent choice of monitor for playing games at 1080p resolution, as it even features a gaming mode for faster input delay. It's going to be tough to beat a deal like this for gamers this Black Friday or even <a href="https://www.techradar.com/cyber-monday/cyber-monday-2019">Cyber Monday</a>.</p>
