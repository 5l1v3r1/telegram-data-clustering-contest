        <i><b>Update (11/20/19 @ 5:00 PM ET):</b> OTA download links for the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3">OnePlus 3</a>/3T’s final <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/oxygenos/">OxygenOS</a> update have been added below.</i>
      </p>
      <p>While OnePlus started its journey back in 2014 with the launch of the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one">OnePlus One</a>, it wasn’t until the launch of the OnePlus 3/3T that the brand gained mainstream popularity. Both the devices have aged quite well over the years, with a number of people still using them as their daily driver. And OnePlus has done its part by providing prompt OS and security updates over the last three years. While most OEMs promise only 2 years of updates, OnePlus promised an additional year of security updates, which was relatively rarer at the time of the announcement. Thus, according to OnePlus’s <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/">software maintenance schedule</a>, the OnePlus 3/3T have finally reached the last leg of their update cycle and, as promised, OnePlus has now started rolling out the final security update for the two devices.</p>
      <p>Back in August this year, OnePlus <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-august-2019-security-patches-for-the-oneplus-3-3t-5-5t/">rolled out the previous update</a> for the OnePlus 3/3T, featuring the Android security patches for August 2019. When we reached out to OnePlus regarding the pending update, the company confirmed that it has already started phase 1 rollout for the last update. The update introduces the Android security patch for October 2019, along with a couple of minor bug fixes and improvements.</p>
      <p>Here’s the official changelog of the final update for the OnePlus 3/3T:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>System</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Updated Android security patch to 2019.10</li>
            <li>Updated GMS apps</li>
            <li>General bug fixes and improvements</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As with all OTAs from OnePlus, the latest update for the OnePlus 3/3T is being rolled out in a staged fashion. The phase 1 rollout will only reach a handful of users and once the company confirms that there are no major issues with the update, it will be rolled out to the rest of the devices.</p>
