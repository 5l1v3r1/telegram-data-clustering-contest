      <p>Reggae artiste Ras Kuuku has become the latest celebrity to call for the legalization of marijuana in the country.</p>
      <p>According to ‘Puom’ President, legalizing marijuana will create employment for the many unemployed.</p>
      <p>He went on further to state that unlike the public notion that the hard substance would cause more mental disability, he believes it will rather be a major product for export.</p>
      <p>Ras Kuuku added that he believes the Government is finding it difficult to fund their free SHS policy which they’ve rolled out and sees legalizing the drug to be the way out.</p>
      <p>The musician wants government to make laws on the usage of marijuana.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Developed countries have legalised marijuana…Do they have more sense than us? We are far behind time. We should legalise it [marijuana] to improve the economy.“</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ras Kuuku continued;</p>
      <p><i>“We lose nothing ‘akpeteshie’ is killing people more but there are laws regulating its use. We can legalise wee to fund Free SHS because we have the right climate and lands and there is money in the business [of selling marijuana],”</i> he said</p>
