      <p>The Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS)-led City Wide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS) Technical Support Unit team handed over upgraded co-treatment facilities to the Tiruchi Corporation’s underground drainage scheme pumping station near Anna Stadium on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The pumping station is one amongst the three operational decanting stations in Tiruchi.</p>
      <p>Co-treatment is a process where the existing sewage treatment facilities are utilised for treating faecal sludge. The objective of is to upgrade existing infrastructure to reduce spillage and provide a safe environment for de-sludge operators. The work included construction of a concrete platform to increase the efficiency of the decanting process, provision of sanitary facilities for workers, inclusion of hard and soft landscape features and design of wall murals advocating awareness of water and sanitation.</p>
      <p>Tiruchi is one of the cities where CWIS initiative is being implemented under the auspices of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. CWIS cities are expected to move towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for sanitation to ensure safe, inclusive and financially sustainable sanitation services and serve as global benchmarks.</p>
      <p>While the project aims at improving the overall sanitation, it will focus on improvement of service delivery to the poor. The project will attempt to mainstream sanitation into existing initiatives, showcase innovations and systematically document and share learning experience.</p>
      <p>City Engineer S.Amuthavalli flagged off the vacuum septage tankers at a function held at the pumping station on Tuesday. She planted tree saplings on the campus.</p>
      <p>She appreciated the efforts of IIHS team in identifying gaps in the city’s septage management and coming up with relevant solutions. She emphasised the need to maintain the decanting station “odour-free” as people commute and have work places around.</p>
      <p>I.Ambalavanan Director, People’s Development Initiatives, Parameshwar Hegde, Team Leader, CWIS project, S.Yohananthan, Engineer, IIHS and Sugantha Priscilla Senior Specialist Social Development, IIHS, spoke.</p>
      <p>A presentation about CWIS and safety measures to be followed by de-sludge operators was made during the event.</p>
