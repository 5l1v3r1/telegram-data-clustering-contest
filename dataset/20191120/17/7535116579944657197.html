      <p>Money does not change people, it unmasks them.</p>
      <p>That is why you should really rely on your instinct when it comes to love rather than money.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.asiaone.com/asia/till-wealth-do-us-part-thai-man-flees-wife-after-winning-270000-lottery?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR0AVLwlXJHvxBKU-Jj8pyYEszka8VKt7I2dXEBiCauQhKld58rJRC4iQG8#Echobox=1574222658">Asia One</a>, a Thai man who was blinded by a massive fortune decided to flee from his wife along with 6 million baht (RM827K) that they won together from a lottery last Sunday (Nov 17th)</p>
      <p>The poor wife, Pornthida Chamnanwet, 23, decided to make a police report when her husband, Wijak Wannaprasit, 34, ran off with the lucky ticket.</p>
      <p>Allegedly, she was the one that picked the ticket.</p>

      <p>Probably for safety, the two went to a police station near Bangkok and reported their win. Together, they signed their names on the ticket and took a photo with it.</p>

      <p>The two even agreed to equally split the winnings. She had even planned ahead on what to buy with the prize money. <i>Thatâ€™s why you canâ€™t count chickens before they hatch</i>.</p>
      <p>However, the next day, Wijak decided that his share was not enough as he told her that she would only get 2 million baht instead of 3 million, which lead them into a furious dispute.</p>
      <p>He walked away with the lottery ticket when they couldnâ€™t come to an agreement.</p>
      <p>Highly disappointed with the sudden outburst of her husband, Pornthida filed a police report to make sure that her husband wonâ€™t be able to cash in the ticket.</p>

      <p>According to a Thai lawyer, if he is found guilty, the man may be subjected to jail for up to three years.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Wijak returned home not long after and the two have reunited once more. However, they have yet to collect their winnings from the state office.</p>
