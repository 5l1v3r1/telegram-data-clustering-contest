      <p>Developers have axed "unthinkable" plans to turn a former Newcastle police station into a Burger King.</p>
      <p>Proposals to transform the disused West End police station sparked a huge backlash earlier this year when it <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/coppers-whoppers-burger-king-plans-16918725">emerged that part of the Westgate Road site could become a drive-through fast food restaurant.</a></p>
      <p>But ahead of city councillors ruling on whether the controversial project could go ahead next week, the redevelopment scheme has now been dropped.</p>
      <p>It was feared that the plans, which also included two shops and a dental surgery, would cause a traffic nightmare on the busy route and have a damaging impact on the health of residents in an area that already has some of the worst levels of childhood obesity levels in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>Residents had launched a ‘Stop the Woppa’ campaign against the project and described the drive-through Burger King as an “unthinkable proposition”. Objectors also included the Britain’s Fat Fight team, and the Centre for Food Policy.</p>
      <p>Locals in the West End say they now hope to be involved in producing a new vision for the vacant police station site next year, with suggestions that it would better be used as offices or a hotel.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from the West End Residents Association said: “It appears the developers realised their previous proposal won't work for the West End. We wait to hear what they plan now.</p>
      <p>“We want the old police station site to benefit the whole community and city and residents hope to meet with the developers in the new year to discuss the way forward.”</p>
      <p>The plans, from developer Hadrian Property Investments, were due up before Newcastle City Council’s planning committee on November 29 and it is understood that the local authority had serious concerns about the project.</p>
      <p>The transformation would have involved part of the four-storey station being torn down, including its old cell blocks.</p>
      <p>According to council documents, the developer withdrew its planning application via an email on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Both Burger King and planning consultants Fairhurst have been contacted for a comment.</p>
