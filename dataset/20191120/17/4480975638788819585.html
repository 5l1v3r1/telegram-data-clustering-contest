      <h1>US Pres. Trump: We continue to talk to China</h1>

      <p>While speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, United States President Donald Trump noted that trade talks with China continue. "They want to make a deal," Trump added.</p>
      <p>The market reaction to these comments was muted. As of writing, the 10-year US Treasury bond yield was down 1.4% on the day and Wall Street's three main indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, were down between 0.25% and 0.35%.</p>
      <p>Investors are likely to wait for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to publish the minutes of the October meeting at 19:00 GMT.</p>
