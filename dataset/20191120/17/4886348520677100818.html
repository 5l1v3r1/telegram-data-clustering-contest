        <li>Epic Games announced it is extending Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1 by nearly three months.</li>
        <li>Fortnite has been underwhelming of late with few updates and lackluster communication from Epic Games.</li>
        <li>What’s up with Fortnite?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Epic Games announced today in a rather vague fashion that <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1 is being extended to early February next year</a>. It makes us wonder what exactly is going on with Fortnite.</p>
      <h3>Epic Extends Fortnite Season by Nearly 3 Months</h3>
      <p>Here’s what Epic games said earlier today in a news bulletin announcing the extension:</p>
      <blockquote>With a new year comes new beginnings! Last year we celebrated 14 Days of Fortnite over the holidays. This year we’ve got even more content for you to unwrap, including new game features, free rewards, and a live experience that you won’t want to miss. To prepare for all the new holiday-themed updates, we will be extending Chapter 2’s first season into early February. Get ready for winter!</blockquote>
      <p>The notion of extending the season so Epic can pump out holiday-themed content makes sense. But, when juxtaposed with recent Fortnite activity, or lack of it, it paints a confusing picture.</p>
      <p>Fortnite dominated the news cycle for the better part of a week in mid-October. The advent of Chapter 2 and the associated live event saw the <a href="https://www.ccn.com/fortnite-the-end-black-hole-explained/">Fortnite world engulfed by a cataclysm</a> that left behind nothing more than a gently pulsating black hole. It came to be known as the Fortnite blackout.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The game went live again days later as a revamped 2.0 iteration with a map overhaul, among other significant changes. It was a stroke of marketing genius that saw devoted fans bleakly presage the end of Fortnite, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/fortnite-black-out-ends-servers-go-live-season-2/">only for the battle royale shooter to burst back to life</a> better than ever.</p>
      <h3>Epic Blackout Gives Way to Chapter 2 Slump</h3>
      <p>Since then, Epic has been comparatively quiet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ccn.com/fortnite-downtime-zero-patch-notes/">As we reported earlier today</a>, there’s the ongoing issue with Epic not releasing patch notes for Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1. That’s an odd move when compared to the diligent release of patch notes for each successive update up until that point.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/battle-royale-update-whats-new-in-11-20?fbclid=IwAR1RRF1h5pqn1AeoDgKnNIExn_RmOUfxxpBvDGWkjK-jiEHV2kOpWsdCr14">patch notes accompany today’s Patch 11.20</a>, although it has to be said they are pretty underwhelming. It’s also worth noting 11.20 is the first patch since Chapter 2 started.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Fortnite’s excellent track record of environmental storytelling has all but come to grinding halt in Chapter 2. The incremental changes to the map that previously pushed the narrative ever forward are nowhere in sight.</p>

      <p>Epic has continued to churn out new cosmetics and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-imperial-army-has-arrived">even landed a cross-over Star Wars event</a>, so it’s not as if there’s been complete radio silence. The game’s just lacked the palpable, headline-grabbing exuberance we expect from Epic. The Limited Time Modes, skins, and community engagement have all been a bit of a damp squib.</p>
      <p>By extending the latest season to what is akin to the length of two of them, there’s a distinct change of pace to the ever-churning Fortnite edifice. Why? Time will tell. Let’s hope Epic is brewing up new transformative and fan-pleasing additions to the game.</p>
