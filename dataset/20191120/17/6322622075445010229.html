      <p>PETALING JAYA (Nov 20): The developer of Battersea Power Station in London has given a sneak peek of the apartments being built at the Grade II* listed landmark on the River Thames before the iconic building opens in the summer of 2021.</p>
      <p>In unveiling the first completed and fully-furnished unit out of 253 new homes being created in the building, Battersea Power Station Development Co Ltd (BPSDC) said the design of the apartment features the original brick and steelwork dating back to the 1930s, new floor to ceiling Crittal windows, art deco inspired interiors and state-of-the-art appliances.</p>
      <p>BPSDC CEO Simon Murphy said the apartment is situated on the second floor of Turbine Hall A on the western side of the Power Station.</p>
      <p>“The unveiling of the first completed apartment in the Power Station is a major milestone for the project and is evidence of the huge momentum that is building as we look forward to opening the Power Station in 2021,” said Murphy.</p>
      <p>Many of the 253 homes being built will enjoy fantastic river views and the benefit of having an array of shops and restaurants at their doorsteps.</p>
      <p>The Battersea Power Station development is owned by a consortium of Malaysian investors comprising S P Setia Bhd, Sime Darby Bhd and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF).</p>
      <p>The commercial assets within the Power Station building are now directly owned by Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB) and EPF following an acquisition completed earlier this year representing one of the largest real estate transactions in the UK.</p>
      <p>Besides the residences, Battersea Power Station will also have half a million sq ft of office space, set to become Apple’s new London Campus, a further 40,000 sq ft of co-working space operated by No18, over 100 shops, a cinema and a 18,500 sq ft food hall.</p>
      <p>Work has commenced on the Chimney Lift Experience, a glass elevator inside the North West Chimney that will take visitors up to a 150m-high viewing platform to experience unparalleled views over London.</p>
      <p>Progress is also being made on Electric Boulevard, the third phase of the project which comprises buildings by Gehry Partners and Battersea Roof Gardens, where apartments are available to be purchased off-plan with prices starting at £671,000 (about RM3.6 million), said Murphy. <i>— EdgeProp.my</i></p>
