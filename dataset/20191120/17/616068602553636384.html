      <p>An Indigenous woman who was the subject of a controversial rape case interrogation with Kelowna RCMP is going public ahead of a protest.</p>
      <p>Castanet will have an exclusive one-on-one interview with Aden Withers, which will be published Thursday.</p>
      <p>Withers was the victim of an alleged rape in 2012. She was only 17 at the time.</p>
      <p>Her questioning at the Kelowna police detachment prompted a review of how such cases are handled, and the revelation that almost 40 per cent of sexual assault cases are deemed unfounded in Kelowna sparked a review of all such cases over the past two years.Â </p>
      <p>Withers says she is coming forward and making her name public to support other victims of sexual assault and to shed light on the Kelowna RCMP detachment's history of investigating sexual assault cases.</p>
