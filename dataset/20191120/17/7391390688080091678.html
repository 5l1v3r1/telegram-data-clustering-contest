      <p>Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas are feeling <i>so cool</i> after learning they scored their second Grammy nomination ever. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-2020-grammy-nominations-full-list-include-lizzo-ariana-grande-more-19367105">The Jonas Brothers reacted to their Grammy nom</a> Wednesday morning by sharing a video on social media following the 2020 nominations. And they clearly couldn't be more excited to be recognized for their song "Sucker" from their <i>Happiness Begins </i>album.</p>
      <p>Kevin posted a video of the exact moment they learned of their nomination on Twitter. In the video, fans can spot Kevin, Joe, Sophie Turner, and a group of other individuals checking their phones and the computer to see the 2020 Grammy nomination announcements. Once learning "Sucker" got nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance, they clapped and screamed with excitement. It's unclear <a href="https://twitter.com/nickjonas/status/1197149842520363008">where Nick was</a> during this moment, but he tweeted, "We're Grammy nominated!!!!!" They're nominated alongside "Boyfriend" from Ariana Grande &amp; Social House, "Old Town Road" from Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus, "Sunflower" from Post Malone and Swae Lee, and "Señorita" from Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello.</p>
      <p>Alongside his video, Kevin thanked "everyone for making this year possible" and expressed how "incredible" it is that he and his brothers have come so far since announcing <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jonas-brothers-reunion-new-music-sucker-late-late-show-801382/">new music and their reunion</a> in February. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5FxTIOBVS-/">Joe shared the same video as Kevin</a> on Instagram and captioned it, "10 years later we are nominated again for a Grammy thank you!"</p>

      <p>It's hard to believe this is only the second Grammy nomination for the Jonas Brothers. Their <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/jonas-brothers">first Grammy nomination</a> was in 2009 for Best New Artist. They ended up <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jonas-brothers-score-their-first-grammy-nomination-since-best-new-artist-nod-in-2009-136699">losing to Adele</a>. This year, they're also facing some major competition, but there's no denying the JoBros have been having a successful year since announcing their reunion after splitting up six years ago.</p>
      <p>From earning several <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-2019-mtv-vmas-full-winners-list-in-case-you-miss-anything-on-the-big-night-18694737">MTV Video Music Awards nominations</a> (and winning the Best Pop category for "Sucker") to scoring <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8543720/jonas-brothers-perform-2019-american-music-awards">two American Music Award nominations</a>, Nick, Kevin, and Joe have had a great year. And a Grammy could definitely be in their future.</p>
