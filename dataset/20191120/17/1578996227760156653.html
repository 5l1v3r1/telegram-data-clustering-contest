      <p>Consider our <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+ subscriptions</a> purchased. The new streaming service, which launched November 12, confirmed today that Adam Lamberg will return to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28804968/hilary-duff-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-details/">the reboot of </a><i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28804968/hilary-duff-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-details/">Lizzie McGuire</a> </i>as Gordo<i>. </i>In the original series, he played Lizzie's best friend and low-key love interest, a relationship explored further in 2003's <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B003XS78KG/">The Lizzie McGuire Movie</a></i>.</p>
      <p>"Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original <i>Lizzie McGuire</i> so authentic and beloved," Hilary Duff, who's starring in and executive producing the show, said in a statement. "I couldn't imagine the series without him. I can't wait for fans to see what he's up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie's adult world."</p>
      <p>McGuire and Lamberg also confirmed the news with a video on the official Disney+ Twitter account. Lamberg joked, "This is what dreams are made of."</p>

      <p>The reboot will follow Lizzie as she prepares to celebrate her 30th birthday. She'll start in New York City before returning to LA, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/interview-hilary-duff-younger-finale-lizzie-mcguire.html">Duff told Vulture</a>. The show started filming in early November.</p>
      <p>News of Lamberg's return comes after the late October confirmation that Hallie Todd, Robert Carradine, and Jake Thomas will reprise their roles as mom Jo, dad Sam, and brother Matt McGuire for the show.</p>
      <p>Duff's keeping mum about whether Lizzie and Gordo are still A Thing all these years later. When <i>Vulture</i> asked if she was upset that Gordo and Lizzie didn't end up together, Duff replied, "You know what, I don't know if I was as devastated by that," adding, "I feel like them not being together is what was so goodâ€¦it's that one person that you're like, <i>Was he the one? Is it ever going to be? </i>You're always kind of wondering. We wanted it to hurt everyone a little bit, and it'll continue to hurt."</p>
