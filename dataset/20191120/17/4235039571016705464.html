      <p><b>Space</b> satellites are increasingly required to maneuver to avoid possible collisions and damage with increasing amounts of <b>space</b> <b>debris</b>, according to DPA, citing astronaut and European <b>Space</b> Agency (ESA) coordinator Thomas Reiter.</p>
      <p>The situation has worsened significantly in recent decades and is not expected to change in the future, Reiter notes.</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of <b>space</b> junk. We prefer this term, not <b>space</b> <b>debris</b>," said an astronaut at an entrepreneur forum in Bremen.<br/>About 8,000 satellites have been launched since the beginning of the <b>space</b> age, 1800 of which are still active. Many of them has already entered the earth's atmosphere again.</p>
      <p>Over the next five to six years, more than 50,000 new satellites are expected to launch in space.</p>
      <p>"This is many times more than in the entire <b>space</b> age. As <b>space</b> infrastructure is concerned, adequate measures are urgently needed to tackle the <b>problem</b> - something ESA is striving for," says Thomas Reiter.</p>
