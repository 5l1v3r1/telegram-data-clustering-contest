      <p>Accra, Nov.19, GNA - The Henry Djaba Foundation, an NGO spearheaded by former Gender, Children and Social Protection Minister, Madam Otiko Afisa Djaba, is canvassing for votes for women and Persons with Disability (PWDs) in the December 17, District Level Election (DLE).</p>
      <p>The DLE is intended to elect assembly members to represent their constituents at the Assemblies, with many NGOs and other influential people urging the electorate to vote massively for female candidates and PWDs.</p>
      <p>They believed that women and PWDs are capable of making a difference in society since disability is not an inability.</p>
      <p>Madam Djaba, together with a group of influential people in society, including Reverend Eastwood Anaba, of the Anaba Ministries International are championing the cause of women and PWDs, to be elected to the various Assemblies nationwide.</p>
      <p>Madam Djaba, a former Women's Organiser of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), told the Ghana News Agency on Tuesday that, the time was ripe for women and PWDs to be given the chance and elected assembly members, in order to champion the development of their local assemblies.</p>
      <p>She noted that with about 22,000 assembly member aspirants, only 909 of them were women, and thus, called for massive votes for them, since they would equally perform like their male counterparts.</p>
