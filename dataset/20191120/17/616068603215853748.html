      <p>A pedestrian was hit by truck at about 2 p.m. this afternoon at the intersection of 32 Avenue and 34 Street.</p>
      <p>"The ambulances were on scene and the victim was conscious," said Captain Parsons. "I don't know the extent of her injuries but they weren't massive injuries or anything."</p>
      <p>Vernon Fire and Rescue wasn't sure about the cause of the incident, but Parsons speculates visibility may have played a factor since the sun was going down and may have shone in the driver's eyes.</p>
