      <p>Informal education will help students gain new insights through experiential learning, said historian Kesavan Veluthat, director of the Institute for Heritage Studies of Coastal Kerala.</p>
      <p>In his inaugural address at the Muziris Heritage Week celebrations that began at Muziris Activity Centre at Kottappuram near here on Tuesday, Mr. Veluthat said that informal education would provide students a chance to experience the various facets of heritage in a meaningful manner. The future generations needed to be given experience-based learning to understand the heritage better, he said.</p>
      <p>The heritage week, which will run till November 25, is being held on the occasion of World Heritage Week organised by UNESCO. The aim of the programme is to create awareness among the public on the importance of heritage and its conservation. The government had launched the Muziris Heritgae Project to conserve the 2,500-year old heritage and culture of the region.</p>
      <p>The key goals of the project include rejuvenating the local economy, creating more local employment, promoting traditional industries, encouraging production of handicrafts and the like. The authorities had given prominence for the conservation of old temples, churches and seminaries too.</p>
      <p>Exhibitions and classes will be held at Paliyam Palace, Jewish synagogue in Chendamangalam and Kottappuram Fort and market as part of the week celebrations.</p>
      <p>An exhibition of handloom products by units in Chendamangalam will also be held on the occasion, according to an official release.</p>
