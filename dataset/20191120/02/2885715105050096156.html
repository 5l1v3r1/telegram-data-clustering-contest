      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:26:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/chahat-rana/" target="_blank">Chahat Rana</a></address>
      <p>Trans-activist and member of the Transgender Welfare Board in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>, Kajal Mangal Mukhi, says that the welfare board has been practically defunct since the last two years.</p>
      <p>“It is inactive and purposeless. They barely hold meetings and even when they do, nothing substantial is discussed and no plans are made for welfare activities,” claims Mangal Mukhi.</p>
      <p>“The last meeting was held about three months ago and issues were discussed. We have many welfare activities in mind, including setting up a separate stall in the Rose Festival,” says Bisman Ahuja, programme officer for the Union Territory Child Protection Services and a member of the Board.</p>
      <p>As for the minutes of the last meeting of the Transgender Welfare Board, Ahuja said she did not possess the authority to disclose that information to Chandigarh Newsline.</p>
      <p>“We can send you the minutes after editing the parts out which might be worrisome. We will send only the relevant bits to you, but the processing will take a few days,” says Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Sachin Rana who is also the Chairman of the Board.</p>
      <p>Rana states that he is not aware of the particulars of the Board’s activities, including the exact number of members in the Board, since he is chairing so many committees. “Once you have the minutes, you can probably see how many members are there on the Board Committee,” adds Rana.</p>
      <p>The Board, which was formed in 2017, has been lauded for being the first board of its kind to be established in a Union Territory in India.</p>
      <p>Since its inception, the board, with the concerted efforts of its committee members and two trans-activists and representatives of the transgender community Dhananjay Chauhan and Kajal Mangalmukhi, has been able to establish separate bathrooms and ensure fee waivers for transgender students at Panjab University. It has also been able to incorporate the use of pronoun Mx for transgenders on forms and applications.</p>
      <p>ADC Rana claims that he had made efforts to organise a workshop on technical education for transgender students earlier, but the committee was not able to mobilise enough participants.</p>
      <p>“If there were normal people, I mean male or female, then it would be easier to mobilise them for workshops. We gave them two months, but the representatives could not even gather 20 people from the transgender community,” says Rana.</p>
      <p>Dhananjay Chauhan, a trans-activist and member of the Board, hopes that the Board will facilitate a cultural festival where transgender artists can display their talents in front of eminent dignitaries to sensitise a wider audience and mainstream the transgender identity. “We get an annual fund of Rs 5 lakh to conduct activities. Every year most of the money is remitted because nothing is done with the funds,” says Chauhan.</p>
      <p>She claims that she has sent many letters to the Board members, asking them to initiate plans for a cultural festival, the last of which she sent in October end. “I have not received any reply yet,” claims Chauhan.</p>
      <p>On being asked about Chauhan’s letter, board member Ahuja says, “There has been no letter addressed to me or the office. Perhaps it was sent to the ADC, you should check with him. Moreover, such a program will cost about Rs 3 lakh. We cannot afford that.”</p>
      <p>ADC Rana too claims that he has received no such letter from Chauhan and states that they do not possess adequate funds to initiate such a festival. “All our money goes towards sensitisation programmes,” says Rana.</p>
      <p>However, he also admits that a part of the fund was sent back last year.</p>
      <p>“They just want to appease us by conducting small-scale and purposeless activities. They will tell us to learn make-up skills or take sewing courses. Members of our community also want to be IAS</p>
      <p>officers like them and lead dignified lives in air-conditioned offices. Efforts can be made to truly mainstream our community but these efforts are not being made by the Board,” says an impassioned Mangal Mukhi.</p>
