      <h1>Veteran pro-democracy politician Albert Ho attacked outside Tin Hau MTR station</h1>

      <p>Police are investigating a reported attack on a former pro-democracy lawmaker that took place outside an MTR station yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>Albert Ho told reporters gathered outside Ruttonjee Hospital at 10pm last night that at around 7pm, as he was exiting Tin Hau MTR station, he was warned by some locals “that there were some people wearing black outside and that I should be careful.”</p>
      <p>He said he shrugged off the warning, and didn’t think anything was amiss when he got to the top of the stairs and saw a woman dressed in black, so he continued walking and turned a corner towards the bus station near the exit to take a minibus home.</p>

      <p>It was at this point that two men also dressed in black chased him into an alley and <a href="https://hk.news.appledaily.com/breaking/realtime/article/20191119/60286098">beat him with rods for about one minute</a>, <i>Apple Daily</i> reports.</p>
      <p>Ho said the assailants fled after he started yelling, “What are you doing? Why are you attacking me?”</p>
      <p>After the trio got away, Ho took himself to Ruttonjee Hospital and called the police. Outside the hospital hours later, he told reporters that doctors found six to seven welts on his back, and injuries to both arms. He had to get stitches on his left arm, and doctors suspect he may have fractured his right.</p>
      <p>Ho said he didn’t know why he was targeted, adding that he had received no threats in recent days.</p>
      <p>Ho is the former chairman of the Democratic Party, and the current chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, the group that organizes the annual June 4 candlelight vigil commemorating the Tiananmen Square Massacre and runs <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/museum-commemorating-tiananmen-square-massacre-re-opens-as-pro-beijing-supporters-gather-outside/">the June 4 museum</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2006, Ho was attacked in a McDonald’s in Central by a group of men wielding clubs; the attack was said to be linked to his work as a lawyer.</p>
      <p>Ho is just the latest pro-democracy figure to be attacked in recent months. Others who have been attacked in recent weeks include district council candidate and prominent activist <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/protest-leader-in-stable-condition-following-attack-by-masked-men-in-kowloon/">Jimmy Sham</a>, who was attacked by masked men with hammers in Kowloon; district council candidate <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/district-council-candidate-attacked-while-canvassing-in-north-point-on-saturday/">Jocelyn Chau</a>, who was assaulted while canvassing in North Point; fellow pro-dem candidate <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-democracy-candidate-for-upcoming-elections-attacked-last-night/">Leung Hoi-ching</a>, who was similarly attacked while canvassing in Kwun Tong; pro-democracy lawmaker <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/dashcam-video-shows-moment-pro-democracy-lawmaker-attacked-by-3-men/">Roy Kwong</a>, who was dragged out of his car by three men and kicked as he lay on the ground; and district councillor <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/pro-dem-district-councillors-ear-stitched-back-on-after-bloody-fight-outside-hong-kong-mall/">Andrew Chiu</a>, who had his ear bitten off while subduing a man who attacked pro-democracy protesters with a knife.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on the pro-Beijing side, fiery lawmaker Junius Ho was <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/breaking-pro-beijing-firebrand-junius-ho-stabbed-while-canvassing-in-tuen-mun/">stabbed while canvassing in Tuen Mun</a>.</p>
