      <h1>Samsung opens a One UI 2.0 (Android 10) beta for the Galaxy Note 9 in Korea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:22:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Samsung <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-announces-one-ui-2-android-10-beta-galaxy-s10/">kicked off the One UI 2.0 beta program</a> for the Galaxy S10 series early last month. Shortly thereafter, the program was <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-confirms-android-10-beta-coming-soon-galaxy-note-10/">extended to the Galaxy Note 10</a> series in Korea. While the stable version of the update is yet to land on any of these devices, the company has now added another device to the beta program in its home country.</p>
      <p>As per a recent post on Samsung’s community forums, the One UI 2.0 beta program is now available for the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-9">Galaxy Note 9</a>. The update brings all of the new features included in Android 10, along with minor improvements to Samsung’s own Android skin. For instance, the caller notification and volume bar have been decreased in size so that they aren’t as intrusive as before. Additionally, Samsung has extended the dark mode to the home screen, ensuring that users don’t face any eye fatigue while using their devices at night. The new dark mode can now also adjust the brightness of images, text, and colors on the display.</p>
      <p>On top of that, the One UI 2.0 update includes minor changes to the Smart Lock screen which now automatically adjusts the color of the text on the lock screen. There are some new tools for digital well and the Device Care menu has also received some new features. However, Live Transcribe is one of the coolest new features added to One UI 2.0 which will allow devices to automatically convert speech to text. You can check out our <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/one-ui/">previous coverage</a> of One UI 2.0 for an overview of all the new features making their way to Samsung’s updated Android skin.</p>
      <p>The One UI 2.0 beta will be available for the Galaxy Note 9 in Korea this week, while the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s9">Galaxy S9</a> series is expected to join the beta program next week. The beta program will also be extended to a few other regions, including the US, Germany, Spain, France, the UK, and India. However, we don’t have any information on the release timeline for the same.</p>
