      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri">Missouri</a> woman is accused of stabbing her daughter to death on Tuesday in a hotel room before trying to suffocate herself, police said.</p>
      <p>Marjorie Theleman, 78, of St. Louis has been charged with first-degree murder and armed criminal action, according to a St. Louis County police news release sent to Fox News.</p>
      <p>Theleman took her daughter out of a nursing home on Tuesday and brought her to a hotel room where she stabbed her with a knife, according to the probable cause statement, which added that Theleman then tried to suffocate herself with a plastic bag, but was not successful.</p>
      <p>Theleman left a typed note explaining her actions, according to court documents, which did not provide what was written in the note. She also left a hand-written note telling housekeeping to call the police, the probable cause statement said.</p>
