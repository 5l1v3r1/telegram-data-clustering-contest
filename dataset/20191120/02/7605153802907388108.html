        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 20 – Lucas Torreira’s agent has revealed that his client is still being chased by Atletico Madrid and suggested he is not entirely happy at Arsenal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Atleti were keen on the Uruguay midfielder when he was with Sampdoria but missed out on his signature after the Gunners managed to lure him to the English Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, it may not be long before he is back on the market as he has struggled for action with Arsenal this season, with Atleti keeping a close eye on developments.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has started just four games and a change in position has not helped matters, with Gunners boss Unai Emery putting him in a more advanced role when he has played him.</p>
      <p>Agent Pablo Bentancur suggested his client is not happy at the Emirates and also revealed a number of clubs in England and Spain, including Atletico, are keen.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to name the teams out of respect but I can tell you that Atletico had tried to take Lucas from Sampdoria two years ago,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Clearly there’s interest for Torreira, especially from Spanish clubs, but I have never sat down with any club to talk about his transfer. This is because of the great respect we have for the Gunners and their general manager Raul Sanllehi.”</p>
      <p>Whether that changes with the January transfer window fast approaching remains to be seen but Atleti will be in the hunt if he does become available.</p>
