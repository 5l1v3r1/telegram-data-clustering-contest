      <h1>'Will arrest if you do it': Philippines president Duterte bans e-cigarettes</h1>
      <h2>His comments come days after Philippine health authorities reported the nation's first vaping-related lung injury</h2>

      <p>A ban on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/e-cigarettes">e-cigarettes </a>has been ordered by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is threatening to arrest anyone vaping publicly in a country that already has some of Asia's toughest anti-smoking rules.</p>
      <p>Duterte is notorious internationally for his deadly anti-narcotics crackdown, but he has also imposed a wide-ranging ban on smoking in public that is part of his pledge to get tough on public disorder.</p>
      <p>The president told a late-night press conference on Tuesday that the use and importation of electronic cigarettes would be banned, but did not provide a precise timeline.</p>
      <p>"I will ban it, the use and the importation. I hope everybody is listening. Please relay this to them. You know why? Because it is toxic," said Duterte, an ex-smoker.</p>
      <p>"Now this vaping, they say it is electronic. Don't give me that... Better stop it because in -- I will order your arrest if you do it in a room," he added at his first public speaking engagement in weeks.</p>
      <p>His comments come days after Philippine health authorities reported the nation's first vaping-related lung injury, which resulted in a 16-year-old girl being hospitalised.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/e-cigarettes">E-cigarettes </a>have become hugely popular in the past decade but a rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses in the United States is feeding caution about the product, already banned in some places.</p>
      <p>In September 2019 India became the latest country to ban the import, sale, production and advertising of e-cigarettes, citing in particular concerns about its youth.</p>
      <p>The devices are already banned in several places such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and the US state of Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>Before Duterte's presidency, the Philippines already had a ban on tobacco advertising, as well as a law that requires graphic images of smoking health hazards to be printed on cigarette packaging.</p>
