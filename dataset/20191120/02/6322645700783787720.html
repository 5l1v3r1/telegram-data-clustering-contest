      <h1>Be prepared for the coming summer urges Rural Fire Service</h1>

      <p>Dungog Shire may have escaped from last week's catastrophic fire warning unscathed but the firies have a warning for residents: don't be complacent.</p>
      <p>While members of the shire's rural fire service brigades have been called to help at Old Bar, Stroud Hill, Greta and Rothbury, the focus is on their own home town and villages.</p>
      <p>"The message is to get ready, that's all we can do at the moment," said Dungog Rural Fire Service brigade's community engagement officer Calvin Vogele.</p>
      <p>"We can never be one hundred per cent prepared, there's always room for improvement.</p>
      <p>"We had the catastrophic day last week and we held an event for people to get information and we didn't have too many people attend, I think people still have that idea that since you're in town your safe.</p>
      <p>"But Greta for example is similar (landscape) to us and went to emergency warning level, evacuation, straight away. You can never be complacent."</p>
      <p>The Dungog RFS brigade's deputy captain Bob Humphrey advised residents to have the latest version of the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/fires-near-me-nsw/id370891827">Fires Near Me</a> app on their phones.</p>
      <p>He reiterated<a href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/plan-and-prepare"> the need for a plan</a> for dangerous days like last week.</p>
      <p>"Know what to take and where to go," he said.</p>
      <p>"For 99 per cent of people that is to go early.</p>
      <p>"Have your get ready box, all your passports, identification and anything that is precious at the door or in the car boot ready to go so you can leave.</p>
      <p>"Don't forget the pets, keep the cats and dogs close so if you have to leave you don't have to round them up.</p>
      <p>"When you do leave, tell people you are leaving. Phone your neighbor or someone to let them know. Put a note on your door saying you left at what time and where you were going. When you get to your destination, let the people know you arrived."</p>
