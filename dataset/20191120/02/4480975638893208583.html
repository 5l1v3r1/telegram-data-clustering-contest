      <p>USD/JPY has recovered from session lows but remains on the defensive below 109.07.</p>
      <p>The pair is currently trading at 108.50, representing marginal losses on the day, having hit a low of 108.36 earlier today.</p>
      <p>The 14-pip recovery is somewhat confounding, given the futures on the S&amp;P 500 are still reporting a 0.25% drop, courtesy of the renewed US-China political tensions.</p>
      <p>Further, the US 10-year Treasury yield is trading at 1.769%, the lowest level since Nov. 4. Notably, the yield has shed 20 basis points since topping out of 1.972% on Nov. 7.</p>
      <p>While the pair has trimmed losses, the bias remains bearish the daily MACD histogram printing deeper bars below the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of bearish momentum. The relative strength index is also reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 print, validating the pair's recent breach of an ascending trendline from the Aug. 26 low of 104.45.</p>
      <p>The outlook would turn bullish if and when the pair finds acceptance above 109.07 (Nov. 18 high). That would invalidate the lower highs setup.</p>
