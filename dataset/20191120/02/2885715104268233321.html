      <p>Following the setting up of medi-city, an ancillary site comprising multispeciality hospitals, in New <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> (Mullanpur Garibdas) and IT-city, a site for IT companies, near airport road, the state government is set to establish a Bio-Technology park near Mohali. The government will be offering land to Bio-Technology companies, for setting up the park, in the Progressive Punjab Investors Summit 2019, scheduled to be held in December.</p>
      <p>The government has planned to acquire 84.1 acre land in Chao Majra, Chilla, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/raipur-lok-sabha-election-results/">Raipur</a> Khurd and Mauli Baidwan villages for the same. The project will be located at a distance of 9 km from the international airport and 13 km from Chandigarh.</p>
      <p>A Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) told Chandigarh Newsline that the land would be offered for companies to set up Bio-Technology park as private and state universities were also coming up in the area, which would provide ample workforce for the companies. National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) is also near the project site.</p>
      <p>“The government has allowed setting up a mixed land use zone in Rajpura, near Mohali and the Bio-Technology park is being planned in a way that the requirements of the industry can be met at one go. A green industry is also coming up at Rajpura, which will boost the new project,” the officer added.</p>
      <p>On being asked about the response of the companies to the project, the officer said that during investors summit, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoUs) would be signed with the Bio-Technology companies, however, at present, there was no company which had showed interest.</p>
      <p>The officer said, “We have estimated that the establishment of a Bio-Technology park will generate employment for more than 50,000 youths of the state and will also provide business to hundreds of people and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The state government is working to promote medical tourism and Bio-Technology park is a part of this plan.”</p>
      <p>At present, the IT city is in its nascent stages of development, while the work for medi-city has almost reached its completion. However, the state government has not yet declared a dedicated zone for setting up the Bio-Technology park.</p>
