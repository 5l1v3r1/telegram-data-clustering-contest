      <h1>There’s A Dumb Theory Kylie’s Sisters, Already Rich, Are Jealous Of Her $600M Payday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:01:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author">By PEDESTRIAN.TV</a></address>
      <p>There’s a silly, silly theory going around about the <b>Kardashian / Jenner </b>family following the news of <b>Kylie Jenner</b>‘s latest business movie.</p>
      <p>If you’re unaware, Kylie recently became <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/kylie-jenner-sells-600-million-majority-stake-in-makeup-company-2019-11">USD$600 million</a> richer after she sold a majority stake in her makeup company, Kylie Cosmetics, to beauty beasts Coty Inc., which is a big power move.</p>
      <p>So then today, the Daily Mail published a <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7703211/Jealous-Kylie-Jenners-Kardashian-siblings-social-media-plug-projects.html?fbclid=IwAR2kQ1Ba3hQ7ilfaR5fmDUIitLo5A30qQqTelgnO71cGfzMOGsprWH3AEjg">yarn</a> about how Kylie’s sisters including <b>Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, </b>and <b>Kendall </b>have apparently snubbed her big business move because they’re not posting about it on Instagram. Yes, really.</p>
      <p>In the last day or so, Kim has used her IG Story to give a shoutout to the family’s loyal as hell friends <b>Malika </b>and <b>Khadijah, </b>who just released their own reality TV show. She also promoted her Solutionwear, the one that used to be called Kimono.</p>
      <p>Khloé used her clout to plug perfume by “The OG trio” on her feed. But she supported Kylie’s latest Christmas collection on her IG Story.</p>

      <p>Kourtney promoted her latest blog posts on her website Poosh as well as the perfume.</p>

      <p>And Kendall posted a cute piccie sponsored by Proactiv, as per usual.</p>
      <p>Mum / manager <b>Kris Jenner </b>also shared some promotional pictures of Kylie’s holiday collection.</p>

      <p>With the internet being the internet, the DM’s yarn copped a lot of comments and the theory flew… and turned ugly. For example, this comment: “They’re all jealous of one another, big fallouts in the future and I cannot wait.”</p>
      <p>Christ.</p>
      <p>But to be honest, the family probably celebrated the big win privately <i>or </i>they’re gearing up for a public celebration, like what they did when Kendall landed the coveted September Vogue issue cover.</p>

      <p>Or, ya know, maybe they’re just waiting for Kylie to actually acknowledge it on Instagram because right now, she’s knee deep in promoting her Christmas collection.</p>

      <p>Also, <i>they’re all already fucking rich. </i></p>
