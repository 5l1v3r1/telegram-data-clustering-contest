      <h3>Leeds United could become the next, well, Leeds United if Paris Saint-Germain’s owners complete their purchase of the club.</h3>
      <p>Back at the turn of the century, the Whites splurged millions on huge signings such as Rio Ferdinand and Robbie Keane in a spree that might even be surpassed should Nasser Al-Khelaifi bring in the Qatari big bucks.</p>

      <p>As with any spend-happy new owner, the first signings will naturally be attackers.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa is very happy with his defence, currently the Championship’s best, and would thus focus his efforts on bolstering his frontline.</p>
      <p>This could lead to a very interesting line-up!</p>
      <p>26-year-old Jese Rodriguez is on his fourth loan spell away from Paris and could well benefit from the intense management of a coach like Bielsa.</p>
      <p>On the opposite flank, Leeds could satisfy both the demands for a statement signing and stay within Premier League homegrown squad limits by bringing English winger Jadon Sancho into their inevitable ascension to the top-flight.</p>

      <p>Borussia Dortmund have previously admitted the teenager won’t stay in Germany for ever and a rising Leeds side would need to bid at least £100million (A$189m).</p>
      <p>But the Qataris have shown that such an amount is small change.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Mesut Ozil would be the perfect partner for all-action midfielder Kalvin Phillips with Arsenal not likely to demand a huge transfer fee for the playmaker.</p>
      <p>Up top, Eddie Nketiah could join star defender Ben White and make his loan move to Elland Road permanent.</p>

      <p>And PSG’s owners moving in to Leeds, which could be sealed after talks this week according to latest reports, may even help them solve a big conundrum back in France.</p>
      <p>It is apparent that Neymar and Kylian Mbappe are incompatible as the big star names at Parc des Princes, so why not send the French youngster out to Elland Road to ease the tension - at least on loan?</p>
      <p>It’s all a bit fanciful but let’s be honest, it would be one Ell of a side!</p>
