      <p>Great to have you on this column again! Last week we shared the story of Sir James Dyson who, out of frustration with his Hoover vacuum cleaner, decided to invent his own. Recall that he was inspired by a 30-foot-high centrifuge at a local sawmill to infuse a cyclonic separation technology into a vacuum cleaner. After 5,127 prototypes, rejection from the manufacturers and distributors in the United Kingdom and a disastrous experience in the United States, his product, G-Force, was finally launched in Japan, where it later won the 1991 International Design Fair Prize. We also must not forget to mention that Sir Dyson’s real time net worth was $5.7 billion as of the last report of Forbes in 2019.</p>
      <p>Now that we have done a quick recap of the story, we can go immediately to the lessons as promised last week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your disposition to challenges matters: people have different attitudes to challenges; some ignore them, some complain about them while some face and change them. Wouldn’t it be ridiculous to think that Dyson was the only one who experienced discomfort by the use of his Hoover? He, however, decided that instead to playing the victim because he had no choice, he would do somethings about it. One way or the other, he could not shake off the idea of solving the problem until he did. The problem you notice and are passionate about may be an indication of your gift. Redirect your energy from complaining about it to solving it.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Look out for inspiration: inspiration works in strange ways. It sometimes comes when and where you least expect. That is why you need to be sensitive and pay attention. The centrifuge at the sawmill that inspired Dyson had been there for years and was seen by many. It was “common” to some but it held the solution Dyson was looking for. When your heart is searching for answers, even the wind may inspire you. With inspiration, ordinary things become special.</li>
        <li>Allow no limitation: Dyson had several reasons not to pursue the project and chief among them was his educational background. Ordinarily, one would consider it strange that someone who studied furniture and interior design at an Art School would venture into inventions. However, when you are consumed by an idea, you will find the knowledge required to bring it to live. The only reason you are still giving excuses about your dream is lack of passion. The success of the unlikely G-Force led to the establishment of Dyson Ltd, which now has about 60 consumer products. Don’t expect another idea when you have not done anything with the one you currently have. If you don’t take the first step, it is very unlikely that you will arrive at your destination.</li>
        <li>Don’t give up: you are not a failure until you stop trying. Dyson did not go to sleep hoping his idea will become a product one day. He worked hard at it and he had 5,127 prototypes to show for it. If you believe in it, don’t give up on it, but you must pay the price for it. It may appear like all your efforts are wasted but just keep at it. Someone may wonder, “So, when should I give up on a dead dream?” The answer is simple, “when the dream is dead!” For as long as it is alive, stay with it. Another thing that should keep you going is progress. Each of the 5,127 prototypes was an improvement on the previous. For as long as you are making progress, rest assured that you will achieve your goals.</li>
      </ul>
