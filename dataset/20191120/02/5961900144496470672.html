      <h1>COOL, NORMAL, ETC: Melbourne Might Cop Its Hottest November Day In 22 Years Tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:14:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:14</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>Fun as it may be to think of a world where the greedy corporate fat cats atop the oven and stovetop industries are sent to the poor house because people can cook shit by putting it outside, the various on-going weather crises in Australia look set to settle in for a particularly brutal summer. And tomorrow, Melbourne is staring straight down the barrel of copping its hottest November day in over two decades as a result.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology currently has the Victorian capital braced for a high of an eye-watering 39 degrees tomorrow, but there are fears the mercury could rise up over the 40 mark, which would make it the first time Melbourne has hit 40 or above in November since 1997.</p>
      <p>A furnace-like northerly is the culprit for this latest bout of high temperatures, which will arrive at some point this evening and push today’s temperature up above 30. It’s not expected to dip much below 25 overnight, which is huge news for anyone who didn’t think they’d have to organise a fan by bloody June or whatever this year.</p>

      <p>This comes after a day where vast tracks of South Australia, including Adelaide, are nudging up over 40 degrees, with some areas tipped to go as high as 45.</p>
      <p>That’s 45 degrees celsius.</p>
      <p>In <i>November</i>.</p>
      <p>Large portions of South Australia, including Port Lincoln and the Adelaide Hills, are under Catastrophic level fire warnings today.</p>
      <p>Victoria’s Mallee and Northern Country regions have been given Severe danger ratings for tomorrow.</p>
