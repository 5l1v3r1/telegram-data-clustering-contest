      <p>Devin Patrick Kelley fired at least 450 rounds inside the church, killing more than two dozen people and wounding 20 more, authorities have said. A nearby resident shot and wounded Kelley before the killer drove away and ultimately ended his own life, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>“Our South Texas community was rattled by the shooting in Sutherland Springs. Two years later this month, many survivors are still struggling from this tragedy,” said Cuellar in a press release. “These funds will go towards delivering support to the victims of this event. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to ensure survivors have the necessary resources to address the harms they have suffered and to rebuild their lives. I want to thank Senator Cornyn for his help securing these critical funds for our community.”</p>
