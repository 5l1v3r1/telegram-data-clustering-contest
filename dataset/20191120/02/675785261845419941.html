      <h1>Peter Crouch blasts Tottenham players following Mauricio Pochettino sacking</h1>
      <h2>The former Spurs forward thinks the club have been overly hasty in ditching the manager who led them to a Champions League final last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:22:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Ex-Tottenham striker Peter Crouch says he thinks some of their players need to have a 'look at themselves in the mirror' following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs announced the departure of the Argentinean manager on Tuesday evening, with Pochettino leaving after over five years at the club.</p>
      <p>Spurs sit in 14th place in the Premier League having only won three times in 12 games this season, but Crouch believes their players are more to blame for the poor form than Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703723/Flabbergasted-Peter-Crouch-reacts-Mauricio-Pochettinos-Spurs-sacking.html">Daily Mail</a> Crouch said: "I'm flabbergasted by Tottenham's decision.</p>
      <p>"I know results have been poor and I understand why the top teams act when their potential to qualify for the following season's Champions League is in jeopardy, but it is ridiculous to think Pochettino has suddenly lost his spark.</p>

      <p>"It never sits easy speaking about the demise of a manager because I have been in football long enough to know that a sacking is never just about one man and I would hope that there are some players in Tottenham's dressing room who are having a look at themselves in the mirror this morning.</p>
      <p>"The harmony, clearly, had been broken and it is obvious that a number of players have wanted to leave."</p>
      <p>Crouch also believes Spurs could live to rue their decision, arguing that Pochettino deserves more credit for his achievements.</p>

      <p>He added: "He led <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> into the Champions League final on June 1. Some clubs, who aren't accustomed to that stage, would build a statue for a manager who took them to the biggest game in club football, but all Pochettino has got is his marching orders. I fear it is a decision Tottenham will regret."</p>
      <p>Spurs are expected to announce the appointment of former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager Jose Mourinho within the next 24 hours, and he could be in charge by the time they face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
