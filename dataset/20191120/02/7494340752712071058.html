      <p>New submitter <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/~BeerFartMoron">BeerF</a> writes: <i>This past year has been <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/09/01/1921249/amazons-ring-may-also-be-working-on-facial-recognition">chock full</a> of <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/19/07/31/2055221/everything-cops-say-about-amazons-ring-is-scripted-or-approved-by-ring">uncomfortable revelations</a> about Ring, the surveillance social network and home security hardware company acquired by Amazon for a reported $800 million, including reports of potentially disastrous internal security practices, an apparent disregard for user privacy, and wave after wave of detail on secret partnerships with local police. Today, in a letter addressed to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/20/amazon-ring-security-senate/">five Democratic senators are asking for an explanation, citing potential threats to U.S. national security</a>.<br/><br/>Much of the letter focuses on allegations that Ring's Ukrainian office, where it conducts much of its research and development operation, allowed employees across the company to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-cops-say-about-amazons-ring-is-scripted-or-a-1836812538">access customer video data</a> whether they had any real need to or not. In January, The Intercept reported that this loose security atmosphere at Ring meant "if [someone] knew a reporter or competitor's email address, [they] could view all their cameras," per one source, who also recalled Ring engineers casually spying on and "teasing each other about who they brought home" after dates. "If hackers or foreign agents were to gain access to this data," the letter states, "it would not only threaten the privacy and safety of the impacted Americans; it could also threaten U.S. national security."</i></p>
