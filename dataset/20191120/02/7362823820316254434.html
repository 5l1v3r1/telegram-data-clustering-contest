      <h1>Reddit author confesses to being stoned at work 'all day every day'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:59:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:59</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/reddit-wrong-ways-to-eat-food">Reddit </a>user who confessed to being <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/pot-and-teens-im-a-mom-and-a-doctor-heres-what-i-tell-my-own-teenagers">stoned </a>at work “all day every day” is going viral.</p>
      <p>The anonymous author <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/dy3u8u/im_stoned_all_day_everyday_at_work/">admitted </a>to getting high before and sometimes during work because “I don’t think I could do my job without it.”</p>
      <p>Though the person admits to working a “very high stakes” job, where being under the influence is “absolutely” not allowed, the author said they’re stoned “from the moment I walk in to the moment I leave.”</p>

      <p>The author does not divulge what state he or she lives in, however, admits to working in a state where marijuana is not legal.</p>
      <p>“I like to think I hide it well,” the author wrote. “My eyes usually don’t get very red and besides that, I’m Asian and wear glasses.</p>
      <p>They also noted: “I use public transportation or Uber to get everywhere so I am not driving, no ones [sic] life is in danger.”</p>
      <p>“Sorry boss,” the person added.</p>
      <p>The anonymous post garnered hundreds of comments from Reddit users, who were mostly curious about what the author did for a living to be stoned all day at work.</p>

      <p>“Curious about this high stakes job,” one Reddit user commented. “It’s just a regular stakes job, but getting stoned makes it high stakes,” another user added.</p>
      <p>Most Reddit suspected the author worked in finance due to the “high stakes” reference.</p>
      <p>“I’m guessing he works in finance, likely trading/stocks/hedge funds,” one user posted.</p>
      <p>One Reddit user admitted to working in finance and being a stoner.</p>

      <p>“So much smoke in finance. I have the same confession but lord knows all of the departments I've worked in with financing is full of stoners,” the commenter said.</p>
      <p>“[Expletive] is stressful. Until you almost lose 100,000 of someone else's money only to find out its [sic] not even your fault or problem or even a real issue because it was on someone else's desk you just don't get it.”</p>
      <p>One person said there’s at least one job they hope the author doesn’t have.</p>
      <p>“Imagine getting prepped for brain surgery and as they're putting you under you hear your surgeon mutter under his breath, ‘Man I'm so [expletive] stoned,’” the commenter wrote.</p>

      <p>The author eventually edited his post to answer many of commenters’ burgeoning question once and for all.</p>
      <p>“Yes I work in finance,” the author confessed, “but that’s all I’m willing to say.”</p>
