      <p>Right-leaning TV network Sinclair Broadcast Group appears to have skipped Tuesday’s impeachment hearings in the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>Stephanie Ruhle of NBC was happy to jump into its abandoned seat. She posted a picture of her press pass on the vacant Sinclair seat on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Well–no risk of @WeAreSinclair popping up with comments,” she tweeted. “On this historic day, their decision not to come has resulted in me getting a seat.”</p>
      <p>A Sinclair spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
