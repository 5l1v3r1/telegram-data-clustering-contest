      <p>A theme park in central Taiwan has adopted four autonomous shuttle buses developed by Turing Drive, according to Turing CEO David Shen.</p>
      <p>Two of the autonomous buses running in the 200-hectare Lihpao Resort are six meters long and the other two are four meters, said Shen, adding that each of them is equipped with four core systems - positioning, sensing, decision-making and control -in fusion, and the sensing system mainly consists of automotive cameras, radars and LiDARs.</p>
      <p>Turing, for operation of the autonomous shuttle buses, adopts InVignal, a V2N (vehicle to network) platform developed by International Integrated Systems for sending traffic lights information to autonomous buses. The buses' running data are transferred to a platform of integrated information on operation of autonomous vehicles, with the platform jointly developed and established by Chunghwa Telecom and Wistron.</p>
      <p>The platform has accumulated autonomous vehicles' operating data for 200 hours, according to Wistron.</p>
      <p>The autonomous buses shuttle among Discovery World, Mala Bay (water-based), Sky Dream (the largest Ferris wheel in Taiwan), Escape Rooms, Lihpao Racing Park, Lihpao Outlet Mall and Fullon Hotel for 12 round trips a day.</p>
