      <h1>Chandigarh: Vendors in prohibited zones will be removed on or before Dec 5</h1>
      <h2>The UT Administration and Chandigarh Municipal Corporation on Tuesday told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that registered vendors currently operating in ‘no-vending’ zones including Sectors 1-6 and 17 will be removed on or before December 5.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:05:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>The UT Administration and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Municipal Corporation on Tuesday told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that registered vendors currently operating in ‘no-vending’ zones including Sectors 1-6 and 17 will be removed on or before December 5. The court was also told that anti-encroachment drives are continuously being carried out against unauthorised vendors in the city.</p>
      <p>While the court has asked the authorities to submit details of steps being taken against the encroachment of unauthorised vendors and details of unregistered vendors who have been dealt with so far, the court on Tuesday also observed that nobody was stopping the vending, but it was being regulated. “The Supreme Court has already said the vendors and hawkers have no right to vend at whatever place they want…This is city management and it is your own city,” the court said.</p>
      <p>The matter has been now adjourned to December 19</p>
      <p>An appeal against removal of vendors is also expected to come up before the Supreme Court next week. Traders of Sector 17 have already filed a caveat in the matter in apex court to prevent granting of any interim relief to vendors.</p>
      <p>During the resumed hearing of cases pertaining to street vending in Chandigarh before the division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Rajiv Sharma on Tuesday here, the counsels representing the DAV Model School, Sector 15, and residents of the area raised strong objections against setting-up of a vending zone in the area while submitting that the site for some 1,800 vendors is very close to a girls hostel of the institute where around 90 girls are put up.</p>
      <p>“How is the school going to function? There is no parking and no toilet facilities there. There will be a lot of noise. The site is just adjoining the wall of the girls’ hostel,” submitted a counsel representing the school. Another counsel also submitted that presence of 1,800 vendors alongwith customers will create a huge law and order problem in Sector 15. While the court declined to pass a stay order on the process of setting-up the vending site in Sector 15, it has asked the authorities to consider the grievances, including the contention that the site is “originally a green belt”, and take an appropriate decision.</p>
      <p>Senior Advocate Puneet Bali on behalf of the Sector 17 traders submitted that the vendors continue to remain in the sector in violation of the court orders, and contended that the authorities have bypassed court’s orders by issuing a notice to the vendors for 30 days. More than 500 vendors are still at Sector 17 market, the court was told, adding that authorities had been sitting for days before issuing the notice for re-location of registered vendors from Sector 17.</p>
      <p>When the court asked about the unregistered vendors, UT Senior Standing Counsel Pankaj Jain said all unregistered vendors have been removed and challans have been issued to 415 unauthorised street vendors and 42 challans have also been issued to registered vendors since October 17. A number of goods have also been seized from unlicensed vendors, the court was told. While the lawyers present strongly rebutted the submission that there are no unregistered vendors in the city now, the court said it can send a team from the court for inspection for a ground report.</p>
      <p>While the civic body’s status report only mentioned the drive undertaken against unregistered street vendors in no-vending zones, the court reminded the UT SSC that the undertaking for removal of unregistered vendors on last date of hearing was regarding the entire city. “This is not fair,” remarked the court.</p>
      <p>Jain told the court that a challan of Rs 10,000 is issued against unauthorized vendors. “Show us a single receipt where someday has paid the amount,” asked the court. While no clear answer was given, Jain responded that the vendors’ goods are also seized but many do not come to take back the goods.</p>
      <p>When questions were raised for creation of some 5,886 vending sites for a small city like Chandigarh, the Administration apprised the court that the same has been done in accordance with the law which allows 2.5 per cent of the population to get licenses for vending. Jain during the hearing said that other than the Sector 17 market — which is a heritage site, no other market can be declared a no-vending zone as per the law.</p>
      <p>The court also observed that every sector has some open space and a vending site is going to be set-up somewhere. “In the next hearing will we witness a fight among sectors? There has to be some end to this. Put in the shoes of authorities, you will also face the same situation,” said the court.</p>

        <b>‘Unauthorised vendors outside high court’</b>
      </p>
      <p>During the hearing, when the Administration made a claim that there are no unauthorised or unregistered vendors in the city now, a senior counsel while challenging the submission submitted they continue to remain even near the High Court, which falls in Sector 1 — a declared ‘no-vending’ zone. Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha then said the same has been “allowed” by the Bar Association. “If Bar gives a statement that they be removed, we will give them (authorities) a direction to get them (vendors) removed within an hour,” observed Justice Jha.</p>
