      <p>A North Okanagan teen eagerly awaiting the return of a missing angel will have it returned before celebrating her 17th birthday.</p>
      <p>Mother Robin Lessard said her daughter Corrina was distraught after the angel, painted by one of her aunts and placed upon her grandfather’s grave 10 years ago, went missing from the Armstrong Spallumcheen Cemetery.</p>
      <p>“We just want the angel back as it has a lot of sentimental value to the family,” said Lessard. “They were very close. Her grandpa was her rock up until the day he died. He was the only person who could calm her down immediately when she was little and she is very distraught that someone has taken it.”</p>
      <p>Lessard said the ceramic angel is about two-feet-tall and is hand-painted with a blue body and wings. The angel’s hands are together to hold a candle. Up until its disappearance, it rested upon the headstone of James Sweet.</p>
      <p>Originally presumed stolen, Armstrong Cemetery caretaker Mike Hodge said the item was removed for safe-keeping.</p>
      <p>"That one was removed because we didn't want it to get damaged," Hodge said.</p>
      <p>Lessard said her daughter can't wait for the angel to be returned.</p>
      <p>“It’s my daughter’s 17th birthday on the 30th, so it was very upsetting that her grandpa’s angel (went missing) right before her birthday, as it had been there for ten years,” Lessard said. “It means everything to her.”</p>
      <p>Hodge said the cemetery has been in contact with the family and has arranged pick up of the angel.</p>
