      <p>Tottenham and England midfielder Harry Winks gave his backing to Mauricio Pochettino just hours before the Argentinean was sacked as manager of Spurs.</p>
      <p>Pochettino leaves the club after over five years in charge in north London, with Spurs set to bring in former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Jose Mourinho as his replacement.</p>
      <p>It was Pochettino who first gave Winks a chance at the highest level, and speaking to <a href="https://talksport.com/football/631748/harry-winks-tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-speculation-future/">talkSPORT</a> on Tuesday afternoon he had nothing but praise for his manager, who was to be sacked later that evening.</p>
      <p>"I've said it many times and I will always say it, I've got everything to thank the gaffer for," Winks said.</p>

      <p>"He gave me the opportunity and I wouldn't be who I am today if it wasn't for him. Of course I've had to work hard to get here, but getting that opportunity in the first place is always difficult and I'm forever thankful to the manager for giving me that opportunity."</p>
      <p>Winks appeared to have no idea that Pochettino was due to be given his marching orders, and spoke with positivity about Spurs' upcoming fixture list.</p>
      <p>He continued: "Now I'm back at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> I want to get back on the field with the lads, and prepare for the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"We've got a lot of games coming up in as short space of time, as well as the Champions League where we've got a great opportunity to get through.</p>

      <p>"So it's going to be a tough period over the next couple of months with so many games, but it's an exciting time. It's time for us to really kick on now and start to get some wins and climb the table."</p>
      <p>Winks is likely to start in the game against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , although it is not yet clear whether Spurs will have a new manager in place by then.</p>
