        <b>Bigg Boss 13 saw its ugliest fight yesterday as best friends Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla fought with each other. They had a nasty fight which seems to have no end. Today, things will just get uglier</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 was bearable because of Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla's friendship. However, things got ugly yesterday as these two fought like enemies. It was during a task that Asim and Sidharth had an argument and it just doesn't seem to stop. Even today, these two will fight and say nasty things to each other. The house will get divided between who is right and who is wrong and on the other side, not paying heed to anything, Shehnaaz Gill will perform her own drama.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw Sidharth and Asim almost throttling each other during their fight with one saying mean things to another. They pushed each other quite a few times and other housemates had to barge in to stop their fight. Today, the fight shall continue. Knowing Sidharth's aggressive behaviour and Asim's motormouth, the fight will just get ugly. They'll say things to each other and it will lead to a big dent in their friendship. Surprisingly, Himanshi Khurana and Shefali Jariwala who have always been team Sidharth Shukla will pick their side and have a deep discussion with Asim Riaz about Sid's behaviour.</p>

      <p>Next, Shehnaaz Gill's drama will entertain the audiences. Shehnaaz asks Rashami Desai whether she'll get married or not in the task and the latter says you are better as a divorcee than being in a family like this. Shehnaaz seems to have taken it to heart as she goes on to destroy the mandap. Sidharth yell at her while she supposedly has a meltdown.</p>

      <p>Uff, that's too much to take in one episode. But we are quite curious to know Salman Khan's reaction to Sidharth Shukla - Asim Riaz's fight.Â </p>
