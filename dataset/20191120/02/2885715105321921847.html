      <p>To track down absconding Balraj Singh Randhawa, who was driving the BMW that ran over Akansh Sen, the crime branch of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Police have initiated the process of extradition through Letters Rogatory (LR), as they suspect he is hiding abroad.</p>
      <p>The process of sending Letters Rogatory is enabled under section 166 A of the CrPc, which allows an investigating officer to issue a letter of request to a court. The court can then issue such letter to the Central Government MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs), which will then send it to the courts of foreign countries.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Chandigarh Newsline, Manoj Kumar Meena, SP ,Crime Branch, Chandigarh Police, said, “Following a tip and ascertaining that he could be abroad, we have initiated the process of extradition and for which LR is being enabled.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since the accused has been declared a Proclaimed Offender (PO) by the court in 2017, Chandigarh Police have also submitted an application to attach the property of Randhawa. As per the application, Randhawa had a share in eight argicultural properties at Hansali village in Fatehgarh Sahib. He has two bank accounts in his name and a BMW, which was used in the crime. The bank accounts of Randhawa in India have been seized, while for the attachment of the property, the court is yet to release an order.</p>
      <p>“We are in contact with Interpol and a Red Corner notice has already been issued against Randhawa, which is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action,” said SP Meena.</p>
      <p>As per an investigating officer, after murdering Akansh Sen, the accused Farid and Randhawa escaped to Mohali, from where they separated. The last mobile tower location of both the accused is of Mohali.</p>
      <p>Randhawa is suspected to have meet his relatives at Khanna in Punjab, and later fled abroad. The BMW car was recovered from Mandi Gobindgarh, Punjab.</p>
      <p>An official said that a LOC (Look Out Notice) of accused Randhawa is also opened which is in continuation while the police are also taking help from CBI/Interpol to arrest the accused as the open arrest warrant has also been issued from the court.</p>
      <p>Harmehtab Singh alias Farid (now convicted) and Balraj Randhawa had been booked under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
