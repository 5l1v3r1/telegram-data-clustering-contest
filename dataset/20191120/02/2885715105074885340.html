      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:32:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Air India airline announced Tuesday that it will be putting its only early morning flight between <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> and Delhi on hold till January 15, 2020.</p>
      <p>The decision came almost a year after the airline told Punjab and Haryana High Court that it will not resume its direct flight to Bangkok from Chandigarh International Airport, but will instead reschedule its morning flights to allow passengers from the Tricity to connect with 25 European destinations via Delhi.</p>
      <p>A statement released by the airline said, “Due to operational reasons Air india flight AI 443/444 has been cancelled till 15 Jan 2020.” The flight would depart from Delhi at 0540 hours and will arrive at 0630 hours at Chandigarh. It would then depart from Chandigarh at 0705 hours and arrive at Delhi at 0800 hours.”</p>
      <p>An official said Air India has only 2 flights between Chandigarh and Delhi in a day.</p>
