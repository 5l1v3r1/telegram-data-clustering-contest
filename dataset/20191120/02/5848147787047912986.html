      <h1>Sweden drops Assange rape investigation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:00:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Swedish authorities have dropped an investigation into allegations of rape against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange after years of maintaining his innocence. </p>
      <p>Prosecutors decided that the Swedish woman who leveled the rape accusation against Mr Assange in 2010, had a faded memory of what happened on the night in question.</p>
      <p>While her statements were deemed “coherent, extensive and detailed”, Sweden’s deputy director of public prosecution Eva-Marie Persson said the evidence has “weakened considerably”. </p>
      <p>It was “to such an extent that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation”, Ms Persson announced on Wednesday morning (Australian time).</p>
      <p>Mr Assange, who is facing the threat of extradition from Britain to the US on espionage charges, is in Belmarsh Prison in Britain.</p>
      <p>There, he has been serving a 50-week sentence for jumping bail in 2012 and fleeing to the Ecuadorian embassy in London on an arrest warrant stemming from the alleged sex crimes. </p>
      <p>British lawyers have reportedly been unable to contact the 48-year-old to inform him that the rape investigation has been “discontinued”.</p>
      <p>Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said, “Sweden has dropped its preliminary investigation into Mr Assange for the third time, after reopening it without any new evidence or information.</p>
      <p>“Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.”</p>
      <p>Lawyer for the accused, Elisabet Massi Fritz said she and her client –who has never been identified – would discuss whether to request a review of the decision to drop the case.</p>
      <p>“After today’s decision my client needs time to process everything that has happened over these nine years in order to be able to move on with her life.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Assange’s legal team said: “From the outset of Sweden’s preliminary investigation, Julian Assange’s expressed concern has been that waiting in the wings was a United States extradition request that would be unstoppable from Sweden – and result in his spending the rest of his life in a US prison.</p>
      <p>“Now that the US does seek Mr Assange’s extradition to stand trial on unprecedented charges for journalistic work, it continues to be a matter of extreme regret that this reality has never been properly acknowledged and that the process in Sweden – with which Mr Assange has always expressed his willingness to engage and indeed did so – became so exceptionally politicised itself.”</p>
