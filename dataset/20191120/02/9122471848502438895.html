      <h1>Kirk Herbstreit Asked How Penn State Can Beat Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:10:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the College Football Playoff rankings were released. Although two undefeated teams went down last weekend, there was no change among the top-seven programs.</p>
      <p>Minnesota’s loss to Iowa helped the team the Gophers beat just two weeks ago. Penn State jumped up to No. 8 from No. 9 after the Gophers dropped down to No. 10.</p>
      <p>After the rankings were released, ESPN’s panel of college football experts broke down a major game coming up this weekend.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in the biggest game of the Big Ten season to date.</p>
      <p>Kirk Herbstreit was asked how the Nittany Lions can pull the upset. Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/big-ten-football/kirk-herbstreit-gives-early-breakdown-of-penn-state-ohio-state-matchup/">Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I think if Penn State has a chance here, they gotta go tempo because you’ve gotta get Ohio State’s defensive line fatigued. The only way they can do that is be aggressive. You’re on the road in Columbus, take some chances, Hamler’s gotta be out there. I think the biggest concern is defending Ohio State’s big play through the air, that could be a problem for Penn State in Columbus.”</blockquote>
      <p>Ohio State enters as a huge favorite over Penn State – 18 points to be exact. The Buckeyes have been one of the most dominant programs in the country this season.</p>
      <p>However, James Franklin’s team has played Ohio State tough over the past three years. Can his team keep it close this time?</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
