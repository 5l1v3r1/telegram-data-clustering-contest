      <p>The Sonia Gandhi-led Congress and the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) are likely to meet today to hold discussion and take a final call on forming the government in Maharashtra with Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Senior leaders of Congress and NCP are expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss about the possible tie-up about the common minimum programme (CMP).</p>
      <p>The two sides, Congress and NCP, have already deputed leaders for holding talks on a possible alliance.</p>
      <p>Earlier, this meeting was scheduled for Tuesday. However, the date was shifted after Congress requested the same due to prior commitment of party leaders on Indira Gandhi's birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>An NCP leader said the Sharad Pawar-led party and Congress are expected to discuss a myriad of issues -- from the name of the alliance if they join hands with Shiv Sena to the contours of their tie-up in the coming polls.</p>
      <p>Polls to several civic bodies, including the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation, are to be held in 2022.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the NCP are not comfortable with the name 'Maha Shiv Aghadi' (a grand alliance comprising the Shiv Sena), the NCP leader was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.</p>
      <p>"We don't want name of any party in the alliance. Even in the NDA and the UPA alliances don't have names of parties," the NCP leader added.<br/>The Congress-NCP alliance is known as 'Aghadi' (front) and the Shiv Sena-BJP-RPI and other smaller parties are known by the term 'Mahayuti' (the grand alliance).</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Sonia Gandhi met senior leaders Ahmed Patel, Mallikarjun Kharge, AK Antony and KC Venugopal to discuss the political situation in Maharashtra and the way forward. Sonia Gandhi's Tuesday meeting with Congress leaders comes after she met NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday.</p>
      <p>The Sharad Pawar-Sonia Gandhi meet on Monday, which lasted for around an hour, has been billed as a major step towards a tie-up with the Shiv Sena for government formation in the state.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference after his meeting with Sonia Gandhi, Sharad Pawar said if the NCP and Congress have to take a view on government formation, they first need to discuss it.</p>
      <p>In the October 21 Maharashtra polls, the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member assembly. The Congress and the NCP, pre-poll allies, won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>However, failing to evolve a consensus over the chief minister's post, the two saffron parties parted ways, with the Sena exploring the possibility of tying up with the Congress-NCP.</p>
