      <h1>Taiwan not to release 3.5 GHz frequency bands for private 5G vertical applications</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:03:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author">Bryan Chuang, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan will not reserve a dedicated frequency band range in 3.5 GHz spectrum for private enterprises or entities to implement their respective 5G vertical applications, according to government sources.</p>
      <p>Prior to biddings set to begin in December for 5G frequency bands, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) earlier suggested the government release the 3,700-3,800 MHz frequency band range under the 3.5 GHz spectrum to private enterprises or other entities for developing their own 5G vertical applications.</p>
      <p>However, officials from the National Communications Commission (NCC) have noted the 3,700-3,800MHz frequency band range is too close to the 3,300-3,570MHz range to be auctioned off and it will result in interferences if former is also released.</p>
      <p>Government sources said that transportation and communications minister Lin Chia-lung has rejected the MOEA proposal.</p>
      <p>Instead, the sources said that as the government is likely to adopt a two-pronged approach to solve the issue: private businesses or entities will be allowed to lease frequency bands available within the 3.5 GHz spectrum from telecom operators who have won the bid to use the specturm; or to lease frequency bands of non-3.5 GHz spectrum from the government to develop their own 5G vertical applications.</p>
      <p>The government is likely to release frequency bands available within the 4.8-4.9 GHz spectrum to private enterprises, indicated the sources.</p>
