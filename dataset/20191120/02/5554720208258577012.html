      <h1>‘Pirated copy of Arnab Goswami’ faces brutal trolling for bizarre tweet raising questions on JNU students</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T02:50:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 02:50</time> by <a rel="author">JKR Staff</a></address>
      <p>The commercial success of Arnab Goswami’s brand of TV journalism has prompted many to emulate his style in a bid to achieve the much-desired TV ratings. While Goswami remains an undisputed king amongst the English genre, the Republic TV founder appears to have ‘inspired’ many to become his pirated copies on Hindi TV channels. One TV anchor, who often faces grief from social media users for his bizarre utterances on TV and equally senseless tweets is News18 India’s Amish Devgan. Caught peddling fake news and abused by a Congress spokesperson on LIVE TV for biases, Devgan has found himself in the eye of a storm for his tweet questioning why JNU students needed to spend 20 years studying.</p>

      <p>The controversial anchor wrote, “In #JNU some students are studying for 20yrs till age of 40Yrs #JNUFact.”</p>
      <p>No sooner did he share his tweet, Devgan began to face social media roasting with many hurling the ‘pirated copy of Arnab Goswami’ jibe. Many including some journalists mockingly asked him to explain at what age did the Prime Minister acquire his alleged MA degree. His timeline got flooded with memes ridiculing the controversial Hindi TV anchor.</p>

      <p>Thousands of students from the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University on Monday staged an extraordinary march towards the parliament in protest against the fee hike, which the HRD ministry had said was withdrawn last week. In a dramatic development, students made desperate attempts to march towards parliament, where lawmakers gathered on the first day of the Winter Session.</p>
      <p>However, the JNU students’ union slammed the government for misleading the students with what they termed was an ‘eyewash.’ They complained that the rollback was only for students below the poverty line.</p>
      <p>JNU students have been staging protests against the administration’s decision to hike fees for hostel facilities.</p>
      <p>The one-time mess security fee, which is refundable, was hiked from Rs 5,500 to Rs 12,000. The rent for a single-bedroom was hiked from Rs 20 per month to a whopping Rs 600 per month. The rent for a double-seater room was hiked from Rs 10 per month to Rs 300 per month.</p>
