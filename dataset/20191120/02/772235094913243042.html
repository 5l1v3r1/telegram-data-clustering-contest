      <p><b>Renault</b> has finally added an automatic transmission to its big-selling <b>Trafic</b> van, reflecting a growing trend towards commercial buyers ditching three-pedal setups.</p>
      <p>The six-speed EDC (efficient dual-clutch) transmission is lifted from none other than the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/renault-megane-rs/">Megane RS hot hatch</a>, which seems a counterintuitive choice. Then again, it's clearly designed for high-torque applications in both vehicles.</p>
      <p>Rather than adding the dual-clutch transmission to the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/trafic/">Trafic's</a> existing <b>85kW/300Nm</b> and <b>103kW/340Nm 1.6-litre turbo-diesel engine</b> options – which remain on sale with the familiar six-speed manual – the self-shifter comes mated with a gutsier engine.</p>
      <p>The donk in question is a <b>2.0-litre</b> with Euro 6 certification, <b>125kW</b> at 3500rpm, and <b>380Nm</b> at 1500rpm. Torque is sent to the front wheels, the combined-cycle fuel consumption figure is <b>7.3L/100km,</b> and the peak towing capacity is <b>1630kg</b> (370kg less than the 103kW manual version).</p>

      <p>“[Trafic] has been the top-selling manual transmission mid-size van and one of the best-selling vans in the category altogether. With the arrival of a new, more powerful engine combined with the new EDC transmission, the Trafic will broaden its appeal in the market,” said Renault Australia managing director Anouk Poelmann.</p>
      <p>The Trafic is Renault's second most popular vehicle in Australia after the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/renault/koleos/">Koleos</a>, and despite being (until now) manual-only, is number four in its segment with 10.1 per cent share, behind only the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/hiace/">Toyota HiAce</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/iload/">Hyundai iLoad</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/ford/transit-custom/">Ford Transit Custom</a> – all sold with auto options.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the 2.0-litre EDC Trafic models are more expensive than their manual counterparts. The short wheelbase (SWB) costs <b>$43,490 before on-road costs,</b> the long wheelbase (LWB) is <b>$2000 more,</b> and the now auto-only LWB Crew version is <b>$52,490 before on-road costs.</b></p>
      <p>Renault has also given the existing <b>85kW</b> and <b>103kW</b> manual Trafics a running update, bumping up pricing by between <b>$1000</b> and <b>$1500</b> on certain derivatives in exchange for more features, and axing the base Trader Life derivative regularly sold for a bargain <b>$29,990 drive-away</b> for ABN holders.</p>

      <p>The tweaks include a new set of C-shaped LED daytime running lights, a new grille, new LED headlights that give 50 per cent greater light in high beam, an updated dash, new seat trim that's said to be harder-wearing, and 500-lumen LEDs in the loading area.</p>
      <p>All Trafics get six airbags, but unlike some rivals like the Transit Custom and HiAce, advanced features such as autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, active cruise control, or lane-departure assist aren't offered.</p>
      <p>The base Trafic Pro 85kW gets more features such as a rear-view camera, automatic headlights and wipers, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front fog lights, a foldable insert key, and under-bench seat storage.</p>
      <p>The Trafic Premium <b>103kW/manual</b> and <b>125kW/EDC</b> models gets extras such as a cabin work station bench, cabin bulkhead with load-through flap, a new 7.0-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone mirroring, rear barn doors, an additional sliding door on the driver’s side, an engine stop/start system, a mobile phone cradle, and security deadlocking.</p>
      <p>The Crew Lifestyle adds body painted bumpers, side door protection, a chrome grille, climate-control air conditioning, 17-inch alloy wheels, a heated driver’s seat, keyless entry and engine start, and rear privacy glass.</p>

      <p>The Trafic Pro is offered with an optional <b>Trade Pack</b> for <b>$1600</b> comprising a smartphone cradle, key with single door opening, wide view mirror, a wooden floor, full height wall lining, heavy duty battery, spare wheel basket, and LED ceiling lights.</p>
      <p>The Trafic Premium models offer a Business Pack comprising automatic air conditioning, tinted windows, 17-inch alloys, hands-free entry card, heated seats and colour coded bumpers and tail light pillars.</p>
      <p>All Trafics also now come with a three-year/unlimited km<b> factory warranty.</b> Servicing intervals remain up to <b>30,000km</b> or <b>annually,</b> with capped price servicing offered from <b>$549</b> for each of the first three scheduled visits to the dealership. Renault also provides roadside assistance for up to four years.</p>
      <p>“Our real world data shows us that the average van owner in Australia can quite easily do <b>30,000km</b> in a year so Renault Australia’s class leading service interval is a real world benefit for busy light commercial vehicle drivers and business operators,” the company says.</p>
      <p>Pricing listed below. Expect normal business to resume at some point, with subsidised drive-away pricing to be offered on certain grades. As ever, RRPs are just a guide.</p>
