      <h1>Michael Ferro sells 25% stake in Daily News owner Tribune Publishing</h1>

      <p>Michael Ferro, the former chairman of Tribune Publishing, is selling his 25% stake in the newspaper giant for $118 million to Heath Freeman’s Alden Global Capital — a New York hedge fund that has been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/09/alden-global-capital-throws-a-wrench-in-gannetts-merger-plans/">called a destroyer of local media</a>.</p>
      <p>The deal comes to $13 a share, a big premium over Tribune’s recent trading price. Tribune’s stock on Tuesday closed at $9.73.</p>
      <p>Tribune owns the Chicago Tribune, the troubled New York Daily News, the Hartford Courant and the Allentown Morning Call, among other papers.</p>
      <p>Ferro, the single-largest shareholder in Tribune, took over in 2016, and changed the name briefly to the widely ridiculed “Tronc” to emphasize digital media. He served as its chairman through May 2018, where he fought off a hostile takeover by Gannett that would have paid more than $15 a share. The stock has skidded since then.</p>
      <p>Alden’s MNG, which owns the Denver Post and the Boston Herald, had previously tried to make a $1.36 billion hostile takeover of Gannett, but was rebuffed earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“The Tribune Publishing board of directors looks forward to working with Alden to enhance our company’s value as the company continues to provide valuable journalism for our customers and communities,” Chairman David Dreier said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The news comes the same day that USA Today publisher Gannett finalized its deal to be taken over by New Media Investment Group, uniting the No. 1 and the No. 2 newspaper publishers in a $1.1 billion deal.</p>
