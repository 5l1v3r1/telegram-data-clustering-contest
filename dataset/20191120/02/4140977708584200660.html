          <p>It will be a battle between the heavyweights and a team who is yet to get their act together in the 41<sup>st</sup> match of Women’s Big Bash League when Sydney Sixers and Hobart Hurricanes lock horns later today. While Sydney Sixers are at the 3<sup>rd</sup> position in the points table, Hobart Hurricanes’ performance has gone haywire as the tournament has progressed and are currently stationed at the 7<sup>th</sup> position with just two victories under their belt.</p>
          <p>In the previous encounter between the two teams, it was Sydney Sixers who romped home by 9 runs.

          <h3>Pitch Condition</h3>
          <p>The North Sydney Oval has been a predominantly high scoring venue. The average score in women’s T20I’s has been 163 which goes onto prove the flatness of this pitch. It is expected to be a flat deck and we should expect a high scoring encounter on our hands. The team winning the toss might be tempted to bat which has been the tradition in this ground so far.</p>

                            <h3>Clean Hitters</h3>
                            <p>
                              <b>Hobart Hurricanes</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>Heather Knight, Nicola Carey</p>
                            <p>
                              <b>Sydney Sixers</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>Ellyse Perry, Erin Burns</p>
                            <h3>HB-W vs SS-W Dream 11 Wicket-keeper</h3>
                            <p><b>Alyssa Healy</b> has been a prolific run-scorer and a sound option when it comes to wicket-keeping. She has looked in good touch in the tournament and is a very important pick in any Dream 11 team.</p>
                            <h3>HB-W vs SS-W Dream 11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p><b>Ashleigh Gardner</b> and <b>Erin Burns</b> will be our first two picks in this segment solely due to their consistency in the tournament so far. They have been a nail in the coffin for the opposition and this duo will look to continue their good run. Gardner scored a fluent 28 of 26 deliveries in the previous clash while Burns also chipped in with a useful knock.</p>
                            <p><b>Corrine Hall</b> will be leading Hobart Hurricanes and will look to lead by example. She is definitely one of the most important players for Hobart if they harbour hopes of staging a comeback in the tournament.</p>
                            <p><b>Fran Wilson</b> is another important batswoman for the Hobart Hurricanes. Her form will be important to their chances. They have already lost 6 matches and one more defeat will leave them in a precarious situation.</p>
                            <p><b>Erin Fazackerley</b> will be our last pick in this segment. She hasn’t had a good tournament so far but a big knock should be around the corner given the class she posses.</p>
                            <h3>HB-W vs SS-W Dream 11 All-rounders</h3>
                            <p>Ellyse Perry won’t take any further part in the tournament and it should be kept in mind while picking this segment. <b>Heather Knight</b> given her reputation should be our first pick in this segment. She can provide the much-needed impetus later down and takes wickets consistently.</p>
                            <p><b>Dane Van Niekerk</b> will be our 2<sup>nd</sup> pick in the segment. She will be returning to the playing XI after missing out the previous few games.</p>
                            <h3>HB-W vs SS-W Dream Bowlers</h3>
                            <p><b>Marizanne Kapp</b> will be the first pick in this segment. She bagged a couple of important wickets in the previous clash and is also a death overs bowler.</p>
                            <p><b>Stella Campbell</b> will be the 2<sup>nd</sup> pick in this segment. She is a newcomer and hasn’t played too many matches but it might worth the gamble as she is a good frontline bowler who has the ability to trouble top-order batters. <b>Tayla Vlaeminck</b> will be our last pick.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Our captain for the day will be Allysa Healy and vice-captain will be Ashleigh Gardner.</p>
