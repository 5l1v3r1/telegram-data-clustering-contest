      <h1>Dracula’s Henchman ‘Renfield’ Getting His Own Film at Universal</h1>

      <p>Universal Pictures’ newly retooled Dark Universe is taking an interesting turn. Instead of focusing on one of their famous Universal Monsters, they’re focusing on a henchman, Dracula’s to be precise.</p>
      <p><i>Rocketman</i> director <b>Dexter Fletcher</b> is attached to direct <b><i>Renfield</i></b>, a monster movie centered on Dracula’s henchman and based on an original pitch from “The Walking Dead’s” <b>Robert Kirkman</b>, writes <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/">Variety</a>.</p>
      <p>In the original “Dracula” novel, R.M. Renfield was an insect-eating inmate at a lunatic asylum who was thought to be suffering from delusions, but was actually a servant of Dracula. Plot details are currently unknown, though it’s believed to take place during the present day and is not a period piece.</p>
      <p>Guaranteeing both horror and grounded sci-fi weirdness, the screenplay is being penned by “Rick and Morty” scribe <b>Ryan Ridley</b>.</p>
      <p>After cutting the cord on their shared Dark Universe plans, Universal aligned with Blumhouse on Leigh Whannell’s <i>The Invisible Man</i>, which debuts in 2020, while <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3591442/paul-feig-teases-james-whale-ish-universal-monsters-movie-dark-army/">Paul Feig is currently developing a monster movie</a> with the studio. And Universal is also meeting with directors for a new take on “Frankenstein” that James Wan (<i>Aquaman, Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious</i>) is producing.</p>
      <p>On a related note, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3413770/american-werewolf-london-remake-happening-max-landis/">Kirkman had been developing a remake of <i>An American Werewolf in London</i></a> for the past few years.</p>
