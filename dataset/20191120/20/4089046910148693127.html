      <p><b>WASHINGTON (AP) — </b>The FBI has requested an interview with the whistleblower whose complaint fueled the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a person familiar with the situation, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the FBI’s request with The Associated Press.</p>
      <p>An agent from the FBI’s Washington field office reached out to the whistleblower’s lawyers last month to seek an interview about the substance of the complaint.</p>
      <p>The person said it was clear from the FBI that the whistleblower was not regarded as the target of any investigation but rather a potential witness. It’s not immediately clear what specifically the FBI might be looking into.</p>
      <p>Spokespeople for the FBI did not immediately return a message seeking comment Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Yahoo News first reported the FBI’s request.</p>
