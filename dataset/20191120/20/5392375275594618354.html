      <p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> added yet another product dubbed Amazon Fire TV Blaster to its smart home lineup. As the name suggests, the Fire TV Blaster is an Infrared (IR) companion device that allows users to control home audio/video equipment. Since this is not a standalone device, you need a Fire TV Stick and an Echo device at your disposal. According to the brand, users will be able to control televisions, soundbars, set-top boxes and more using the voice functionality. Here is everything you need to know about the Amazon Fire TV Blaster.</p>
      <h3>Amazon Fire TV Blaster: Price, Availability</h3>
      <p>The Fire TV Blaster comes with a price tag of $34.99 when purchased standalone. You can also opt for the bundle that includes Fire TV Stick 4K, Echo Dot and Fire TV Blaster itself. The bundle will set you back around $79.99. Coming to the availability, the device is currently up for grabs in the US, Germany, and the UK as of now. We might see the product hitting other major markets in the near future. Interested buyers can purchase the product from the Amazon website. The device is currently on the pre-order stage while the shipping will begin from December 11.</p>
      <h3>Specifications, Features</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Amazon Fire TV Blaster is a basic Infrared device with no built-in speaker at all. This means that the device needs Echo products for the voice commands which in turn will control the compatible products. With the help of this product, you can control your television, A/V devices, set-up boxes, and soundbars easily. Since this is Infrared we’re talking about here, the target product needs to be in the line of sight. The e-commerce giant has also bundled an IR extender which can be used if the line of sight is a problem.</p>
      <p>Coming to the commands, you can say stuff like “turn off the TV”, “turn on soundbar”, “switch channels” to Alexa. The power on/off your TV feature will only work with the compatible models only which you can check on the product page on Amazon. The Fire TV Blaster will work flawlessly with Fire TV Stick 4K, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2017/11/08/toughest-rival-chromecast-arrived-amazon-fire-tv-stick-basic/">Fire TV Stick</a> with Alexa Voice Remote and Fire TV 3rd generation. Above all, the product will also work with any Echo device, even the Echo Smart display.</p>
