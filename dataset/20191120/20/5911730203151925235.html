      <h1>Burger King is running out of zesty sauce because of the global horseradish shortage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:25:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>Bad news for spicy fast food fans: A popular <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/12/business/burger-king-rebel-whopper/index.html">Burger King sauce</a> is in short supply because of the ripple effect of a global horseradish shortage.</p>
      <p>Burger King confirmed Wednesday that its horseradish-based Zesty Onion sauce might not be available to some customers.</p>
      <p>"We are working quickly with our suppliers to maintain continuity and keep offering our guests the zesty experience they love," a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The shortage stems from severe weather in the Midwest that hurt Silver Spring Foods' farms and suppliers ability to produce horseradish. The Wisconsin-based company is the world's largest horseradish producer.</p>
      <p>Eric Rygg, the company's president, said that this year's weather was a damaging "double-whammy" for horseradish growers.</p>
      <p>"While we've planted more horseradish than ever before, we've been unable to harvest it all on time due to the huge snow melt, a wet fall and an early frost," Rygg <a href="https://www.silverspringfoods.com/news/article/45/2019-WEATHER-IMPACTS-US-HORSERADISH-SUPPLY">said in a statement</a> . "And we are hearing the same from other horseradish farmers in the US, Canada and Europe."</p>
      <p>Restaurant Services, a Burger King supplier, <a href="https://www.rsiweb.com/Net/Communications/docs/default-source/default-document-library/10-25-19-zesty-onion-dip-cups-supply-update-nbd5fd609e72586b87855cff0000d9c8d3.pdf?sfvrsn=42a50bca_0">warned</a> that that its current stock of Zesty Onion dip cups is "expected to dwindle to a potential full outage by early next year." The company said it's working with "alternative supply solutions" until next year's horseradish harvest in April.</p>
      <p>Arby's makes a similar-tasting and popular horseradish based dip called Horsey Sauce. A company spokesperson said it's "working closely with our partners to ensure supply with no disruptions."</p>
      <p>Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/burger-king-zesty-sauce-running-out-horseradish-shortage-2019-11">first reported the Burger King news.</a> Horseradish is used in number of spicy condiments, cocktails and sauces.</p>
