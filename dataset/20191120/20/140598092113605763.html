      <p>Liverpool could be without Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/crystal-palace-vs-liverpool-premier-league-time-kick-off-tv/">Saturday’s Premier League game at Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>The pair were forced to pull out of international duty with ankle injuries and are now serious doubts for the trip to Selhurst Park.​</p>
      <p>But Jurgen Klopp is expected to have Joe Gomez available <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/16/gareth-southgate-backs-joe-gomez-come-back-stronger-training/">after the defender withdrew from the England squad before their 4-0 win over Kosovo on Sunday</a> after suffering a minor knee injury in training.​</p>
      <p>Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum, both of whom suffered some illness during the international break, are also expected to play.​</p>
      <p>Salah has been struggling with an ankle problem since a heavy challenge from Leicester’s Hamza Choudhury during Liverpool’s 2-1 win early last month.​</p>
      <p>It forced the Egypt forward out of Liverpool’s 1-1 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford – the only time they have dropped points in the Premier League this season – and he aggravated the problem after being caught by Fernandinho, the Manchester City midfielder, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/10/liverpool-vs-manchester-city-premier-league-live-score-latest/">during the 3-1 win at Anfield this month</a>.​</p>
      <p>Salah flew to Egypt to be assessed and returned to Merseyside wearing a protective boot after withdrawing from his country’s matches against Kenya and Comoros.​</p>
      <p>Robertson was also forced to withdraw from <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/16/five-five-john-mcginn-scotland-scrape-victory-cyprus-fume/">Scotland’s international games against Cyprus</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/john-mcginn-double-gives-scotland-comfortable-victory-kazakhstan/">Kazakhstan</a> with a swollen ankle sustained in the City win.​</p>
      <p>The potential loss of two highly influential players will be a blow as Liverpool bid to maintain or extend their eight point lead at the top of the Premier League.</p>
