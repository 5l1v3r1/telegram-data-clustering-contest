      <h1>Bitcoin.com Launches $200M Bitcoin Cash Investment Fund</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:34</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin.com, the Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>)-related firm backed by crypto evangelist Roger Ver, is planning to launch its $200 million Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-price-index">BCH</a>) investment fund.</p>
      <p>Ver has announced the news speaking at a Bitcoin Cash <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/LondonBitcoinCash/">meetup</a> in London on Nov. 19, as he <a href="https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1197146757777346569?s=20">tweeted</a> on Nov. 20. The event was hosted by major global crypto wallet <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/major-crypto-wallet-provider-blockchaincom-opens-office-in-lithuania">Blockchain.com</a>. The new Bitcoin Cash Ecosystem Fund will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-com-to-launch-200-million-bch-ecosystem-investment-fund/">focus</a> on payment solutions and non-custodial financial services for Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-cash-third-biggest-cryptocurrency-on-first-day-of-creation">emerged</a> from a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-cash-for-beginners/what-is-hard-fork">hard fork</a> of Bitcoin in August 2017.</p>
      <h3>The new fund will be investing in payment gateways and wallet acquirers</h3>
      <p>According to an official <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-com-to-launch-200-million-bch-ecosystem-investment-fund/">announcement</a>, details of the BCH Ecosystem Investment Fund are not yet finalized but it will allow participation from institutional investors. The fund will be investing in payment gateways, processors remittances, wallet and merchant acquirers.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin.com’s new CEO, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoincom-appoints-new-ceo-as-roger-ver-leaves-position">Stefan Rust</a>, has reportedly identified up to 20 potential institutional investors that share the company’s vision and are interested to invest alongside Bitcoin.com’s executive chairman Ver and the company itself.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin.com recently launched its own crypto exchange</h3>
      <p>Formerly <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoincom-opens-crypto-exchange-to-compete-with-coinbase-and-binance">known</a> as a website focused on covering BTC and BCH, Bitcoin.com now <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-cash-integrated-roger-vers-bitcoin-com-wallet/">provides</a> a number of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash services including crypto trading and storage. The firm behind the website has been gradually embracing more services since its domain name was <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/about-us/">acquired</a> by Ver back in 2014.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin.com <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoincom-opens-crypto-exchange-to-compete-with-coinbase-and-binance">launched</a> its own digital exchange in September 2019, allowing users to trade a number of cryptocurrencies including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, Litecoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ltc-price-index">LTC</a>) and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/eos-price-index">EOS</a>, among others.</p>
      <h3>Increasing emergence of new crypto funds </h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the number of new crypto-related funds appears to be surging. Yesterday, Michael Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/novogratz-launches-two-new-bitcoin-funds-targeting-wealth-of-america">announced</a> the launch of two Bitcoin funds, targeting “the wealth of America,” or people between the ages of 50 and 80. Last week, ConsenSys’ CSO Sam Cassatt <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/consensys-cso-seeks-to-raise-50m-for-new-blockchain-investment-fund">announced</a> that his new blockchain-oriented investment firm Aligned Capital is planning to raise $50 million for its first fund.</p>
