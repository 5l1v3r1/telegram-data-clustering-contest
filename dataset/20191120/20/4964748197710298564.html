      <p>According to researcher <b>Gilberto Castañeda</b> from the <b>Cinvestav</b>, at least 42 <b>pharmaceutical companies </b>that produce <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/sociedad/ranitidina-contiene-sustancias-cancerigenas-cofepris"><b>ranitidine </b></a>purchase raw materials contaminated with <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-and-press-announcements-ndma-zantac-ranitidine"><b>NDMA</b></a>, a substance that is believed to cause <b>cancer</b>, to produce the medicine. The contaminated ranitidine was purchased in <b>India </b>and <b>China</b>, where it is sold at a lower price because it is not entirely purified.</p>
      <p><b>Gilberto Castañeda </b>explained that there was a worldwide alert about <b><a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/questions-and-answers-ndma-impurities-ranitidine-commonly-known-zantac">NDMA </a>pollution </b>in <b>ranitidine </b>and that in <b>Mexico, </b>the pollution affected at least 42 Mexican companies that produce or commercialize the medicine in its generic version, mainly to cut costs.</p>
      <p>The researcher explained that in order to produce <b>ranitidine</b>, a drug that helps to treat <b>ulcers </b>and <b>heartburn</b>, pharmaceutics buy <b>chemical substances</b> that derive from petroleum in the international market.</p>

          <b>Mexico's new drug buying plan leaves hundreds without HIV treatment</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>These substances are then synthesized until they obtain <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/questions-and-answers-ndma-impurities-ranitidine-commonly-known-zantac"><b>ranitidine</b></a>. During these <b>chemical</b> <b>processes</b>, polluters such as <b>N-Nitrosodimethylamine</b> (<b>NDMA</b>) are created, which should be eliminated through purification processes, which is expensive.</p>
      <p><b>Gilberto Castañeda </b>explains that “in order to save and cut costs, many companies purchase the raw materials from suppliers in countries such as <b>India </b>and <b>China</b>; these companies, so that it's cheaper, carry out incomplete purification processes, then the <b>NDMA </b>concentration is above the accepted limits. It was detected in several countries and the alarm went off immediately.”</p>

      <p>He added that if you want to save <b>money</b>, they “carry out the processes without the necessary <b>quality </b>controls; they can save up to 50%, which has a direct impact on Mexican companies.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>This doesn't mean that the Mexican companies purchase the polluted <b>drug </b>to save costs, but rather that they don't carry out the necessary process to verify the <b>quality </b>of the <b>medicine</b>.</p>
      <p>In October 2019, the <b>Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks</b> (<a href="https://www.gob.mx/cofepris/articulos/la-cofepris-informa-sobre-los-productos-que-contienen-dentro-de-su-formulacion-al-principio-activo-ranitidina"><b>Cofepris</b></a>) asked people to stop consuming <b>ranitidine </b>after confirming the drug contained <b>NDMA</b>.</p>

      <p>In October 2019, there was a worldwide alert when the <b>FDA </b>announced that it had found <b>NDMA </b>in <b>ranitidine</b>. Countries such as the <b>U.S.</b>, <b>France</b>, <b>Spain</b>, <b>Australia</b>, <b>Austria</b>, <b>Belgium</b>, <b>Germany</b>, and <b>Sweden </b>ordered that the sale of this <b>drug </b>was halted.</p>

        <b>What is ranitidine?</b>
