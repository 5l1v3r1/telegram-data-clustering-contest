      <p>A strong earthquake shook a border area between northern Thailand and Laos on Thursday morning, swaying Bangkok highrises.</p>
      <p>Residents in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai felt a long period of shaking but saw no major damage. High-rise buildings swayed slowly for at least half a minute in the capital Bangkok, startling residents.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the 6.1 magnitude quake Thursday morning was about 10 kilometres below the surface. Moderate quakes of 4.6 and 5.7 magnitude shook the same area overnight.</p>
      <p>It was centred about 31 km from Chaloem Phra Kiat, which is about 280 km northeast of Bangkok.</p>
