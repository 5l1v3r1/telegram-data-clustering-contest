      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian’s</a> shapewear line, SKIMS, was fully restocked online on Wednesday afternoon, and the reality star celebrated by showing some of the products off. In a new photo posted to her Instagram account, Kim rocked a brown matching set from the collection, which perfectly showcased her hourglass figure.</p>
      <p>The photo showed Kim standing tall in front of a tan-colored backdrop. She wore a basic, tannish-brown bra that tightly hugged the shape of her chest and pushed a small bit of cleavage out of the top. Kim’s stellar and tan abs were on full display in between the bra and a pair of matching, high-waisted leggings that clung to the <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> star’s toned legs and shapely hips. The look did nothing but favors for Kim’s famous curves.</p>
      <p>Of course, the beauty mogul rocked a stunning makeup look to finish off her outfit, including smoky eye shadow, darkened and shaped brows, expertly contoured cheeks, a bright highlight, and a neutral color on her lips. Her black hair was pulled back into a sleek ponytail behind her head, with a few strands left out to frame her face.</p>
      <p>With her arms at her sides and her head up high, Kim stared powerfully into the camera.</p>
      <p>The post garnered over 393,000 likes and nearly 2,000 comments within one hour since it went live on Kim’s page. Fans left a ton of love for both the shapewear line and the mother of four’s flawless physique.</p>
      <p>“Can’t hate the hustle,” one fan wrote with a fire emoji.</p>
      <p>“I love you Kim,” another user added with a heart.</p>
      <p>“Please restock the bodysuits!!!” a third follower begged.</p>
      <p>“Kim I love your outfit,” said another follower.</p>

      <p>Kim revealed in an earlier <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5F6Hbkg-b1/">Instagram</a> post on Wednesday that SKIMS would be relaunching along with four new styles. She modeled one nude-colored bodysuit herself in a post that showed three other women rocking the new products, as well.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait for everyone to finally get this!!!” Kim wrote in the caption.</p>
      <p>Kim initially announced the pending restock last week, as <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5745271/kim-kardashian-skims/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported. In yet another stunning photo, the reality star rocked a black, thin-strapped, tank-top-style bodysuit with a high cut to show off her super-toned thighs. She explained the reasoning for the delay in restocking her products, but her fans didn’t appear to mind at all. That photo garnered over 3 million likes since it was posted, as well as more than 11,000 comments.</p>
