      <p>Delhi University students on Wednesday protested against the alleged police lathi-charge on their JNU counterparts during a demonstration over hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>They also protested against the New Education Policy and said it is an “attempt” to privatise education.</p>
      <p>The Left-backed All India Students’ Association (AISA), along with other students’ organisations, held a protest against the Draft New Education Policy and the “brutal repression of the protest by Delhi Police and the government“.</p>
      <p>Students gathered in large numbers in dissent of the “draconian New Education Policy which acts as a stepping stone towards privatisation of public education”, the parties said in a statement.</p>
      <p>They alleged that Delhi Police personnel were present in large numbers, barricading the boundaries of Arts Faculty to stop the students from marching in the campus. However, a senior police officer said police were only there to ensure that march goes off peacefully.</p>
