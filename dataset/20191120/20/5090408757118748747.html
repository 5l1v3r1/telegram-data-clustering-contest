      <h1>6 times the US military totally screwed up on Twitter, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:27:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fellman, Ryan Pickrell, Business Insider US</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>The military has codified the rules for managing these official accounts. But sometimes these social-media pros flub it.</li>
        <li>The screw-ups range from the Pentagon’s threat to bomb millenials converging near Area 51 to a “KnowYourMil” post about military systems that got it wrong.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every day, scores of US military commands reach millions with posts aimed to inform and inspire: videos of valor, motivational photos, and, yes, puppy pics.</p>
      <p>The military has codified the rules for managing these official accounts. But sometimes these social-media pros flub it – even the four-star command responsible for the US’s nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>Here’s a blooper reel of some of the military’s most embarrassing and dumb social-media mistakes since 2016.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>#KnowYourMil</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Department of Defense’s official twitter account shared this stunning image of an armored vehicle firing at a training exercise with the tag, #KnowYourMil.</p>
      <p>The only problem – they named the wrong armored vehicle.</p>
      <p>That’s a Stryker armored vehicle firing its 105mm gun, not a Paladin self-propelled howitzer as the DoD tweet identified it. One easy way to tell them apart is that the Paladin is a tracked vehicle like a tank, unlike the eight wheels on a Stryker.</p>

      <h3>‘The last thing #Millennials will see if they attempt the #area51 raid today’</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>On Sept. 20, 2019, the Pentagon’s Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS) tweeted out a warning to millennials planning to attend the “Storm Area 51” event that day, suggesting it was going to bomb them.</p>
      <p>“The last thing #Millennials will see if they attempt the #area51 raid today,” the tweet read. The accompanying image was a B-2 Spirit bomber, a highly-capable stealth aircraft built to slip past enemy defenses and devastate targets with nuclear and conventional munitions.</p>
      <p>The tweet prompted some backlash online, and the next day, DVIDS deleted the offending tweet and sent out a new one explaining that “last night, a DVIDSHUB employee posted a tweet that in NO WAY supports the stance of the Department of Defense.”</p>

      <h3>‘#Ready to drop something much, much bigger’</h3>

      <p>US Strategic Command, which oversees the US’s nuclear arsenal, ringed in 2019 with a reminder that they’re ready, at any time, to start a nuclear war.</p>
      <p>Playing off the image of the ball dropping in New York City’s Times Square, STRATCOM’s official account posted a tweet that included a clip of a B-2 dropping bombs. The command apologized for the message.</p>

      <h3>#BRRRT</h3>

      <p>In May 2018, the internet was debating whether the word heard on a short audio recording was “Yanny” or “Laurel.” Then the US Air Force joined the debate, referring to a recent strike on Taliban.</p>
      <p>“The Taliban Forces in Farah city #Afghanistan would much rather have heard #Yanny or #Laurel than the deafening #BRRRT they got courtesy of our #A10,” the official US Air Force Twitter account said.</p>
      <p>The A-10 gunship carries a fearsome 30mm cannon used to destroy buildings, shred ground vehicles, and kill insurgents. It can fire so rapidly – nearly 3,900 rounds a minute – that the sound of each bullet is indistinguishable from the previous one, blending into a thundering “BRRRT.”</p>
      <p>The US Air Force apologized for the tweet and deleted it, acknowledging it was in “poor taste.”</p>

      <p>In January 2018, President Donald Trump fired off a flurry a tweets defending himself in response to the headline-grabbing details in Michael Wolff’s book, “Fire and Fury.”</p>
      <p>Trump said he was “like, really smart” and “a very stable genius.”</p>
      <p>That prompted a tweet from comedian Mindy Kaling from her character in the office, with the caption: “You guys, I’m like really smart now, you don’t even know.”</p>
      <p>The US Army’s official Twitter account liked Kaling’s tweet, to which she replied: “#armystrong”</p>
      <p>By the following day, the US Army had unliked the tweet.</p>

      <p>In 2016, the US Navy celebrated the 241st year since the date of its creation with a tweet that combined three images into one: a warship, a fighter jet, and a painting of a historic battle.</p>
      <p>But the birthday message didn’t go over well with one audience on Twitter: Turks.</p>
      <p>The flag in that battle scene closely resembles that of Turkey, a NATO member and US ally, as <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/can-federal-agencies-really-just-delete-tweets.html">Muira McCammon detailed in Slate</a>.</p>
      <p>The Turkish community on Twitter sharply criticized the US Navy, and the Navy deleted it.</p>
