        <b>UNDER-fire Jeane Freeman issued a grovelling apology to families affected by the hospital water contamination crisis today.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Health Secretary off­ered her “deepest sympathies” and said parents deserved answers over the scandal.</p>

      <p>But rivals claimed the issue had been hushed up as it emerged two children died at Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth University Hospital two years ago after being treated on wards with dirty water.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman told MSPs: “To lose a loved one in any circumstances is hard, but I cannot begin to imagine the pain of losing a child in these circumstances, or the suffering and grief that will stay with them the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>“I also want to apologise to them that they feel they have not had their questions answered.</p>
      <p>“They are absolutely right to ask and pursue their questions, and they are entitled to have them answered and to receive the support they need.”</p>

      <p>Leukaemia patient Milly Main, ten, contracted an infection and died in August 2017. A boy aged three weeks with a rare genetic disease also died that month.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeman revealed four families contacted her over the weekend amid growing fears, plus 26 others in the last two months.</p>
      <p>Quizzed on how many patients were affected at the £842million superhospital, the Nats minister said: “I don’t know that. There could be a significant number of families who have had their chil­dren treated in the oncology ward since 2016.”</p>
      <p>Pressed again, she said: “Affected in as much as their children were treated in those cancer wards, then my understanding is somewhere between 100 and 150.”</p>

      <p>Ms Freeman told Holyrood she had ordered health chiefs to begin “escalation” procedures for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
      <p>But Labour MSP Monica Lennon said the crisis had been “cloaked in secrecy for too long”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Families and the wider public need to have full confidence in the health board and the cabinet secretary.</p>
      <p>"That’s why vague answers from Jeane Freeman are sorely disappointing.”</p>

      <p>Tory Miles Briggs urged her to resign. He said: “The buck stops with Jeane Freeman.”</p>
      <p>A whistleblower who contacted Labour MSP Anas Sarwar said an investigation by doctors found up to 26 cases of water supply infections in cancer ward kids in 2017.</p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: “Communication with families has not been good en­ough and we deeply regret this.”</p>
