        <b>Jose Mourinho put his Tottenham stars through their paces today for the first time since replacing Mauricio Pochettino as their new head coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese, 56, officially took charge of his third English club early this morning after Pochettino saw his five-and-a-half year reign come to an end last night.</p>
      <p>It has only been six months since the 47-year-old guided Spurs to their first ever Champions League final, but three wins from 12 in the Premier League this term was labelled “extremely disappointing” in a statement from chairman Daniel Levy confirming his sacking.</p>
      <p>And Levy has now turned to Mourinho, who carried out his very first Tottenham training session this afternoon.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on Spurs’ official Twitter page, the former Manchester United and Chelsea manager is seen working alongside the likes of Harry Kane, Son Heung-Min and Toby Alderweireld.</p>
      <p>The footage is also accompanied by Mourinho’s first interview as head coach, wherein he makes a promise to supporters.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t be happier, and if I was not as happy as I am I wouldn’t be here,” he said.</p>
      <p>“What can I promise? Passion - for my job, but also passion for my club.</p>
      <p>“It’s a privilege when a manager goes to a club and feels that happiness in relation to the squad he is going to have.</p>
      <p>“These are not words of the moment. They are not words of me being the Tottenham head coach.</p>
      <p>“These are words that I've been told and I've repeated in the last three, four, five years even as an opponent.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho was also full of praise for the facilities on offer, labelling Tottenham’s stadium the best on the planet.</p>
      <p>“When you say beautiful stadium you are too humble. You have to say the best stadium in the world,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think that is the reality. The training ground is second to none. It probably can only be compared with some American Football training grounds.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham’s woeful start to the 2019/20 campaign has left them down in 14th place, 11 points adrift of the top four.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho is adamant he will pull the club out of their slump, while insisting he is relishing the challenge.</p>
      <p>“In relation to the Premier League we know where we are and we know that we don't belong there,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We should just play match after match, the next match we want to win and that's the same about the next, and the next, and the next until the last.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the season we will see where we are but i know we are going to be in a different position to where we are now.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to the challenge, to the responsibility to bring happiness to everyone that loves the club.”</p>
