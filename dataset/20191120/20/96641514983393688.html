      <h1>Trump ‘opens’ Texas Apple plant that’s built Mac Pros since 2013</h1>
      <h2>The new Mac Pro is in production there now.</h2>

      <p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/17/president-trump-to-visit-apple-mac-pro-factory/">planned</a>, today Donald Trump took a tour of an Apple manufacturing facility in Texas alongside CEO Tim Cook. While impeachment hearings continued in D.C., the president <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197293250115014656">tweeted</a> that "Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America." While Apple did claim in September that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/21/apple-mac-pro-us-tariff-exemptions/">exemptions from tariffs the Trump Administration put in place</a> made it possible to produce the new Mac Pro in Texas, a company called Flex has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/10/apple-mac-pro-made-in-us/">assembling its high-end desktop computer there since 2013</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple also <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-expands-in-austin/">announced plans for a new 3 million square foot campus in Austin</a>, that will not be a manufacturing plant, didn't open today and wasn't a part of the tour. It said production of the new Mac Pro is now under way, although it didn't narrow down the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/mac-pro-availability-december/">"December" release window announced last week</a>. As far as any hopes for further tariff exemptions that could help Apple, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-apple/trump-considering-whether-apple-should-be-exempt-from-china-tariffs-idUSKBN1XU2SN"><i>Reuters</i></a> reports Trump responded "We're looking at that" when asked about it.</p>
