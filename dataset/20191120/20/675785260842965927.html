      <h2>I’m A Celebrity star Jacqueline Jossa is determined to prove she’s no “doormat” after her tumultuous marriage to Dan Osborne</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here star Jacqueline Jossa has been impressing campmates with her bravery and sass.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week she took a helmet full of spiders on the chin to win all her stars, and took the Snake Rock boys to task after they stole her idea of making a jungle stir fry and tried to pass it off as their own.</p>
      <p>And like her fiery former EastEnders character Lauren Branning, mother-of-two Jac isn’t backwards at coming forwards.</p>
      <p>Just last year the 27 year old had to be restrained after getting into a nasty row with a mystery man outside a Bromley nightclub.</p>
      <p>The shoeless star was seen grabbing the man’s t-shirt in a vicious argument, going nose to nose with him before being pulled away by pals.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what caused the bust-up but it came just hours after her husband <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/who-dan-osborne-towie-fame-13054898">Dan Osborne</a> told his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity </a><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> housemates that he was single.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Like any proud mum, she rightly doesn’t take kindly to anyone who criticises her daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, and went nuclear when a nasty troll posted a cruel comment about her eldest.</p>
      <p>Hitting back on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a>, she raged: "You look like a f***ing puffed-up spider!</p>
      <p>"Go f*** yourself, p****. Don't say anything about my kids.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Calming down slightly, she apologised to her fans for swearing but stood by her fury.</p>
      <p>"Actually don't care if you say anything I know she's gorgeous...” she continued. “Sorry for swearing, sorry to anyone who's under 18 but you shouldn't be on here anyway. Sorry Mum but I got it off you anyway."</p>
      <p>And in 2016 she again took the trolls to task when they took aim at her weight after Ella’s birth.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had people saying, ‘She looks pregnant again, maybe she is having baby number two’. I’d like those people to know I’m not having another baby. So screw you,” she sassily told the Daily Star Sunday.</p>
      <p>Closer to home, badboy Dan once revealed their marriage was plagued by fights about his partying.</p>

      <p>The former TOWIE star – who was forced to deny cheating with Love Island’s <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gabby-allen-celebrity-big-brother-10781186">Gabby Allen</a> and Alexandra Crane – walked out in 2018 when Jacqueline was heavily pregnant after non-stop rows.</p>
      <p>He told the Daily Star: “We were both having a lot of unhappy days.</p>
      <p>“I left because we were arguing and it is such a waste of energy.</p>

      <p>“I still obviously care for Jacqueline but if we can’t make each other happy then we shouldn’t stay together. Life is too short.”</p>
      <p>Upon leaving the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity Big Brother</a> house that summer though, he went back to Jacqueline, admitting the time apart had made him realise what he had.</p>
      <p>And before entering the jungle, Jac made it clear that she’s no-one’s “doormat”.</p>
      <p>"I think people think I am a pushover. I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will go for it and try my best,” she said.</p>
      <p>·       I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here continues tonight at 9pm on ITV</p>
