      <h1>Myles Garrett uses Texans’ 2013 helmet attack as suspension defense</h1>

      <p>Myles Garrett’s suspension defense revolves around a far less famous NFL helmet swing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28123180/source-browns-myles-garrett-points-13-antonio-smith-ban-appeal">According to ESPN.com</a>, the Browns defensive end and the NFLPA argued to the league that the Texans’ Antonio Smith received the harshest helmet-attack punishment in NFL history — two preseason games and one regular season game — for ripping off the helmet of Dolphins lineman Richie Incognito and swinging it wildly at him.</p>

      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">Garrett was suspended indefinitely on Friday</a>, at least the final six regular season games and 2019 postseason, after he was responsible for a similar attack on Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph. On top of the length of games, the point was made that Smith only missed out on one game check.</p>
      <p>Garrett’s attack received immediate national attention on Thursday night, when <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">the melee exploded</a> with eight seconds left in Cleveland’s 21-7 victory over Pittsburgh.</p>
      <p>He has to be reinstated by commissioner Roger Goodell before being allowed back in the league. The 23-year-old also argued that indefinite suspensions are not allowed by the collective bargaining agreement, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Garrett’s appeal started at 9:30 a.m. at the NFL’s Manhattan offices and concluded approximately two hours later.</p>
