      <p>A Pakistani human rights activist who was working on cases of human rights violations has been missing for more than a week.<br/><br/>Idris Khattak disappeared last week while traveling with his driver to the Swab district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, his family said on November 20.<br/><br/>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) watchdog has voiced concern, saying it was a "possibly enforced disappearance."<br/><br/>"It has now been a week since human rights defender and political activist Idris Khattak was abducted, allegedly by unidentified persons in the Swab district," the HRCP said in a tweet on November 20.<br/><br/>Idris Khattak, a resident of the Nowshera district in northwestern Pakistan, worked for Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International (AI).<br/><br/>There was no comment from Pakistani authorities, but Iqbal Afridi, a lawmaker from the ruling Tehirk-e-Insaaf party told RFE/RL that Pakistani security forces "never pick people up without a reason," adding that Khattak will probably be freed if there are no charges against him.</p>
