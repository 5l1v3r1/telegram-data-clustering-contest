      <p>Duplicate values can be a problem, especially if you’re dealing with a large dataset.</p>
      <p>What looks like a list of 100 items might only be 70 once you remove the items that are on the list more than once.</p>

      <h3>How to remove duplicates in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/excel">Excel</a> for a single column</h3>
      <p>When you have duplicate data that you want to remove from a single column in your dataset, start by clicking into the column you want to dedupe.</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Click “Data” in the top menu of the Excel window to open the Data menu ribbon.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Click on “Remove Duplicates.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> A window will pop up. If your column includes a header, make sure the box next to “My list has headers” is checked.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> A window will pop up telling you how many duplicates were removed and how many remain. Click “OK” to get rid of the window.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><b>5.</b> Excel will only remove exact duplicates. In this example, the second Square is misspelled as Squarre, so after duplicates are removed, both spellings of Square remain.</p>
      <p><b>6.</b> You can also highlight a range of cells and remove duplicates.</p>
      <p><b>7.</b> When you dedupe a range, only duplicates within the range are removed. In this case, Square is removed, but the duplicates of Circle and Triangle remain.</p>
      <p>You can also remove duplicates in more than one column.</p>
      <h3>How to remove duplicates in Excel for multiple columns</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> First, remove any duplicates in Column A. Place your cursor in the column and right-click to remove duplicates.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Click “Remove Duplicates.” When the box pops up, click “OK.”</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> Only duplicates in Column A are now removed, but the value “blue” still appears twice in Column B.</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> If you want to remove duplicates from multiple columns, start by clicking into one of the columns.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> Click “Remove Duplicates.” Click the box next to Column A to uncheck it. Click “OK.”</p>

        <figcaption>Uncheck the box next to Column A.<cite>Laura McCamy/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>6.</b> In addition to the three rows that had the same shape/colour combination, this time you also removed the value “Rectangle” from Column A because it was the second row that included “blue” in Column B. Now there are no duplicate shapes or colours.</p>
      <p>“Remove Duplicates” is a powerful tool. Use it with care. As noted above, you may miss duplicates if they aren’t exact or you could delete values you want to keep. However, if you make a mistake, you can quickly restore your data by holding “Control” + “Z” on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/pc">PC</a> or “command” + “Z” on your <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/mac">Mac</a> keyboard to undo the operation.</p>
