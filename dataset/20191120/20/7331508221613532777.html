      <p>PLAYA VISTA, Calif. -- After missing the previous three games, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> forward <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> is planning to play in his first game with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a> against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> on Wednesday, league sources told ESPN.</p>
      <p>Leonard has not played since last Wednesday against <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston</a> due to a left knee contusion he suffered in that loss. George made his Clippers debut last Thursday at <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans</a> and has played three games without Leonard.</p>
      <p>Leonard was seen after the morning shootaround getting shots up. Teammate <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4017837/ivica-zubac">Ivica Zubac</a> said he couldn't wait to play in the Clippers' first game with the two All-Stars in the starting lineup.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, finally," Zubac said at the morning shootaround, when asked what it will be like when Leonard and George play together. "It will be great. We are really good with only Kawhi [playing and George out]. We are really good with only PG [and Leonard out]. So you know when you put them two together, it's got to be good. So we'll see it tonight, but I'm really excited."</p>
      <p>Leonard has played in nine games this season and is averaging 26.8 points, 8.9 rebounds and 6.0 assists.</p>
