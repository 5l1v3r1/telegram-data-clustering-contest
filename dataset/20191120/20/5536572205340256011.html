      <h1>Tickets For Redskins-Lions Being Sold For As Low As $5.00 (PIC)</h1>

      <p>The Washington Redskins are fresh off being blown out at home by the New York Jets and having their fan base chant ‘sell the team’ in the second half.</p>
      <p>Some might wonder why Redskins fans even come out even more since they don’t like the product on the field as well as owner Dan Snyder, but if you look at the price of tickets to the game, you’d see why.</p>
      <p>For the upcoming Lions-Redskins game at <a href="https://gametime.co/nfl-football/lions-at-redskins-tickets/11-24-2019-washington-dc-fedex-field/events/5cb7daf250e1820014bf1ccf">FedEx Field</a>, you can find seats for as low as $5, $6, and even $9 to watch two professional football teams do battle on the field.</p>

      <p>The Redskins are currently 1-9 on the season, while the Lions are 3-6-1. Not exactly the sexiest matchup of teams fans would want to waste three hours to see.</p>
