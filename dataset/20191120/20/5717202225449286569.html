      <h1>Eddie Gray lauds Leeds United loanee Ben White</h1>

        <b>Eddie Gray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQxAPwt6Xg">has told the Talking Shutt Podcast</a> that he has been surprised that Leeds United loanee Ben White has not yet been bought by a big Premier League club as he has the potential to be top class.</b>
      </p>
      <p>White has proved to be an outstanding signing for Leeds. Despite having no experience of playing in either of the top two divisions before this season, the Brighton loanee has arguably been the best player within Marcelo Bielsa’s squad so far.</p>

      <p>It is easy to forget how concerned some supporters were when Pontus Jansson was sold in the summer. White was already through the Elland Road door at that stage. But few could have imagined just how much of a masterstroke the move would prove to be.</p>
      <p>And Leeds legend Gray has admitted that based on what he has seen so far, he cannot quite understand how the 22-year-old was available to Leeds in the first place. He also praised Bielsa for the faith that he has shown in the Englishman.</p>

      <p>“There’s no doubt that one of the most popular players in the last few seasons at Elland Road has been Pontus Jansson. When Pontus fell out with him or whatever, he was on his way. He’s got a great belief in what he does,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQxAPwt6Xg">he told Talking Shutt</a>.</p>
      <p>“He brings a young centre-half in now who’s playing tremendous. It just surprises me some of the big teams in the Premiership haven’t bought him. It really does, because I think he looks as if he’s going to be top class.”</p>
      <h3>Orta’s success story</h3>
      <p>Bielsa definitely deserves praise for White’s start to the season. But it must not be forgotten that White is also arguably the greatest success story of Victor Orta’s tenure.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/marcelo-bielsa-leeds-united-ffp-16720665">As reported by Leeds Live</a>, Bielsa confirmed that Orta wanted White ahead of last season. He has come in for criticism for some of the decisions he has made during his time at Leeds.</p>
      <p>But there is no question that White has been a sensational signing. And as Gray suggests, it can only be a matter of time before he is playing at the very highest level.</p>
