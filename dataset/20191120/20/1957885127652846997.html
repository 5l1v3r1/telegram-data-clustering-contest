      <h1>Nintendo details free-to-play Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp's two new subscription plans</h1>
      <h2>£6 or £2 a month, the choice is yours.</h2>

      <p>It might look adorably wholesome, but Nintendo's free-to-play mobile offering Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is home to some of the company's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-31-animal-crossing-pocket-camps-latest-event-left-fans-in-despair">most egregious monetisation practices</a>. Not content with its current level of nickel-and-diming, however, Nintendo has now fully revealed two new optional subscription plans launching for the game today.</p>
      <p>The first of these, called the Cookie and Depot Plan, grants subscribers five free fortune cookies a month. Cookies, if you're unfamiliar, are essentially Pocket Camp's take on loot boxes, each costing around £3 and rewarding a single random piece of themed furniture or clothing - although, inevitably, duplicates are possible and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-04-26-you-can-pay-for-a-chance-at-owning-a-nintendo-switch-in-animal-crossing-pocket-camp">drop rates for rarer items are extremely low</a>. Nintendo says the plan will feature cookies from select older sets no longer in circulation.</p>
      <p>Additionally, those running out of in-game storage space for accrued items are also being firmly nudged in the direction of the Cookie and Depot Plan. The subscription, which costs $7.99 USD (around £6) a month, will provide an expanded inventory too. Here's a video in which Nintendo tries to wrap its latest mobile monetisation gambits up in a cute bow:</p>

      <p>Pocket Camp's second new subscription service, the Happy Helper Plan, is a little cheaper at $2.99 USD (around £2) a month. This one promises to mitigate some of the mobile game's relentless busywork and grind, giving players a digital camp caretaker that will collect event items and assist with animal requests, reducing the frequency players are required to log in. The plan includes 60 premium currency Leaf Tickets a month too.</p>

      <p>Both plans, which follow in the tyre tracks of a similar offering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-25-mario-kart-tour-has-gbp4-99-monthly-subscription-option">added to Mario Kart Tour after launch</a>, also claim to significantly reduce item crafting times and provide access to the Pocket Camp Club Journal, detailing information about the various characters in-game.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, those itching for an Animal Crossing fix could always hang onto their cash and wait for Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-05-animal-crossing-new-horizons-trailer-shows-off-more-idyllic-island-life">next proper series entry</a>, New Horizons, which is coming to Switch, hopefully unfettered by microtransactions, in March next year.</p>
