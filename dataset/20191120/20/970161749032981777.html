      <p>Ian Wright is among the favourites to be crowned King of The Jungle in the current series of I’m A Celebrity 2019.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal and England striker was seen braving it <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-faces-a-snakepit-and-its-not-the-kardashians-in-hardest-bush-tucker-trial-yet-11180627/">through a tough Bushtucker trial on Tuesday night,</a> having to deal with a helmet full of scorpions as he made his bid to win meals for camp.</p>
      <p>And having now arrived in the main camp after a difficult few days in Snake Rock – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/im-celebrity-first-look-bosses-bring-back-terrifying-high-rise-challenge-ahead-years-series-11075506/">and that terrifying high-rise challenge</a> – we’re hopefully set <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebritys-ian-wright-reveals-bad-sleeping-habit-could-cause-havoc-for-campmates-11165957/">to see more from Ian</a> – who spoke before going into the jungle <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/ian-wright-admits-he-will-miss-football-more-than-his-wife-nancy-in-im-a-celebrity-jungle-11081853/">of missing both his family and his football.</a></p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about him and his other half.</p>
      <h3>Is I’m A Celebrity’s Ian Wright married?</h3>
      <p>Ian, 56, has been married to wife Nancy Hallam since 2011.</p>

      <p>‘My missus didn’t know anything about football,’ he explained. ‘I met her in a pub in Notting Hill, it was the biggest kind of mugging off in respect of meeting someone. I’m not saying I’m Brad Pitt but she mugged me off so beautifully I knew she was the one.’</p>
      <p>Prior to going into the jungle, Ian suggested he might miss his beloved football more than he misses Nancy – but added it would be tough without both of them.</p>
      <p>He explained: ‘I am definitely going to miss football. I don’t think I have ever been in a situation where I have been that isolated from the game in my life.</p>
      <p>‘I am also going to miss my family. I speak to my missus every day and it’s going to be a test.’</p>

      <h3>Does Ian Wright have any children?</h3>
      <p>The couple are parents to two daughters – Lola, 10, and seven-year-old Roxanne.</p>
      <p>However Ian, who is 5 feet 9 inches tall, is father to eight children in total, from four different relationships.</p>
      <p>Writing in his 2016 memoir, A Life In Football: My Autobiography, he revealed: ‘I’ve got eight kids with four women. Two I married, two I didn’t.</p>
      <p>‘Sharon (Phillips) is mum to my eldest boys, Shaun and Bradley Wright-Phillips. My third son is Brett.</p>

      <p>He went on: ‘My daughter Coco was born in 2006 and I support her but play no other part in her or her mother’s life.</p>
      <p>‘And I married Nancy in 2011, and we have two daughters, Lola and Roxanne.’</p>
      <p>Ian’s two oldest sons, Shaun and Bradley, have gone on to follow in their dad’s footsteps, playing football for the New York Red Bulls.</p>
