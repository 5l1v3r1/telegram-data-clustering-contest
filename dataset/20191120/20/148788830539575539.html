      <h1>‘Renfield’ Movie Will Focus on Dracula’s Bug-Eating Henchman While James Wan-Produced ‘Frankenstein’ Heads to the Lab</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:30:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>Renfield, the lunatic who loves to eat bugs and pal around with Count Dracula, is getting his own movie. Having failed with their original Dark Universe plan, Universal is now taking risks on stranger projects. One is Leigh Whannell’s creepy-looking and very modern <i>Invisible Man</i>. The other is Paul Feig’s <i>Dark Army. </i>And now here comes <b><i>Renfield</i></b>, with <i>Rocketman</i> director <b>Dexter Fletcher</b> at the helm. In addition to that, there’s apparently a <b>James Wan</b>-produced <b><i>Frankenstein</i></b> in the works, too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/">Variety</a> has the scoop on the <i>Renfield</i> movie, stating that the idea comes from a pitch via <i>Walking Dead</i> creator <b>Robert Kirkman</b>. <i>Rick and Morty</i> writer <b>Ryan Ridley</b> will write the script, while Dexter Fletcher will direct. Plot details aren’t available at the moment, but in Bram Stoker’s original novel Dracula, R. M. Renfield is a patient at a lunatic asylum who has a connection to the bloodsucking count. In various film adaptations, the bond between Dracula and Renfield was enhanced, making him a solicitor who first tried to sell Drac on some property in the U.K. Dwight Frye memorably played Renfield in the 1931 <i>Dracula</i>, and Tom Waits stole the show as the character in 1992’s <i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i>.</p>
      <p>Is there enough material to make an entire movie around Renfield? Or will this film be a retelling of <i>Dracula</i> from Renfield’s point-of-view? We’ll have to wait and see. I thought <i>Rocketman</i> was surprisingly good, but while watching it, I didn’t stop and think, “I sure hope Dexter Fletcher makes a horror movie next! This guy has what it takes to make something scary!” Still, I’m willing to give it a shot just because I love the Universal Monsters so much.</p>
      <p><i>Renfield</i> is the latest attempt from Universal to bring their classic monsters back to life. They had mapped out an entire cinematic universe that was supposed to kick-off with <i>The Mummy</i>, starring Tom Cruise. But after that movie tanked, the so-called Dark Universe was returned to the grave. Now, rather than worry about interconnected cinematic universes, Universal is instead focusing on individual movies. The first to arrive will be <i>Invisible Man</i>, starring Elisabeth Moss. Paul Feig is currently working on <i>Dark Army</i>, which is said to feature both classic Universal monsters and new characters as well. And, perhaps most interesting of all, the Variety story about <i>Renfield</i> casually tosses off that James Wan is producing a new take on <i>Frankenstein</i>, and that the studio is currently “meeting with directors” for that project.</p>
