      <h2>Developers and industry figures publicly shared feelings of loss and mourning.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:25:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Axon</a></address>
      <p>Brad McQuaid, the lead developer for the groundbreaking massively multiplayer online (MMO) game <i>EverQuest</i>, has died, according to an update from his development team. He was 51.</p>
      <p>Details about the circumstances of his death have not been shared publicly, other than a mention that he passed away in his home. The Twitter account for <i>Pantheon</i>, McQuaid's project at the time of his death, and Visionary Realms, the company behind it, <a href="https://twitter.com/PantheonMMO/status/1196943965028802561">tweeted</a> out the following announcement:</p>
      <blockquote>It is with deep regret we share that Brad McQuaid passed away last night. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered by gamers worldwide. <br/><br/>Thank you for bringing us together through your worlds. Rest in peace <a href="https://twitter.com/Aradune">@Aradune</a>. <br/><br/>VR offers our deepest condolences to Brad’s family.</blockquote>
      <p><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,13586/">McQuaid</a> worked as a game programmer and designer starting back in the late 1980s, but he is most well-known for his role as lead programmer, producer, and designer (at various times) on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/everquests-long-strange-20-year-trip-still-has-no-end-in-sight/"><i>EverQuest</i></a>, the 1999 massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that defined the genre to this day. <i>EQ</i>, which adapted the DikuMUD formula from text games for a 3D persistent graphical virtual world, was a breakthrough moment for MMORPGs. Its success codified that model for the genre as other, different ideas of what MMORPGs might look like (such as those posited by <i>Meridian 59</i>, <i>Underlight</i>, or <i>Ultima Online</i>) largely faded into memory.</p>
      <p>McQuaid was involved in designing some of the very first raids as we know them today, and his work had significant influence on later games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/"><i>World of Warcraft</i></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/final-fantasy/"><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i></a>, <i>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/elder-scrolls/">Elder Scrolls</a> Online</i>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/destiny/"><i>Destiny</i></a>, and many more.</p>
      <p>He later went on to co-found Sigil Games, which developed and launched the hardcore MMO <i>Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</i>. The game found a niche audience seeking demanding, group-oriented content—a focus of McQuaid's work over the years—amidst a market of increasingly casual and solo-friendly MMOs. Most recently, McQuaid was working at Visionary Realms on the above-mentioned <i>Pantheon</i>, which marries that model to some newer game-design ideas. <i>Pantheon</i> is still in development.</p>
      <p>Visionary Realms communications chief BenD shared these notes <a href="https://www.pantheonmmo.com/content/forums/topic/11315/with-deepest-regrets-aradune-has-passed-away/view/post_id/219996">on the <i>Pantheon</i> forums</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Brad was a visionary, a mentor, an artist, a trailblazer, a friend, a husband, a father. He touched thousands of lives with his dreams and concepts. He changed the landscape of video games forever. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered in life and in Pantheon. <br/><br/>Thank you, Brad, for bringing us together through your worlds. Rest in peace, Aradune. <br/><br/>All of us at Visionary Realms offer our deepest condolences to Brad’s family and during this most difficult time, we kindly ask that you respect the privacy of Brad’s family.</blockquote>
      <p>McQuaid's passing resulted in an outpouring of mourning and memories from other notable online game developers such as <a href="https://twitter.com/raphkoster/status/1196952262616088576">Raph Koster</a> (<i>Ultima Online, Star Wars: Galaxies</i>), <a href="https://twitter.com/ZenOfDesign/status/1196969230157135872">Damion Schubert</a> (<i>Meridian 59</i>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/star-wars-the-old-republic/"><i>Star Wars: The Old Republic</i></a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/EveOnline/status/1197104476689195014">the <i>EVE Online</i> team</a>, and former Sony Online and <i>EverQuest</i> boss <a href="https://twitter.com/j_smedley/status/1196945326583607297">John Smedley.</a></p>
