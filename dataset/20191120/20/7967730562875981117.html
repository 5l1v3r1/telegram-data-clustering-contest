      <p><b>New York:</b> World No.1 Brooks Koepka has withdrawn from the United States' Presidents Cup team with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Koepka re-injured his left knee during the CJ Cup in South Korea in October and has been unable to regain fitness in time for the biennial contest at Royal Melbourne from December 12-15.</p>

      <p>US captain Tiger Woods has selected Rickie Fowler to replace him in his 12-man team.</p>
      <p>"I notified captain Tiger Woods that despite constant medical care and rehab, I am not able to play golf at this time," Koepka said in a statement issued Wednesday.</p>

      <p>"I consider it to be a high honour to be part of the 2019 team and I regret not being able to compete.</p>
      <p>"Since my injury in Korea I have been in constant contact with Tiger and assured him that I was making every effort to be 100 per cent in time for the Presidents Cup in Australia.</p>
      <p>"However I need more time to heal."</p>
      <p>Woods previously said overlooking Fowler for a wild card was his toughest call, the 15-time major winner picking himself, Tony Finau, Patrick Reed and Gary Woodland.</p>
      <p>"These team events have been some of the most memorable weeks of my career," Fowler said.</p>
      <p>"To be picked by Tiger to compete with him and the rest of the team is very special.</p>
      <p>"It is impossible to replace the world's No.1 but I can assure my teammates and American golf fans that I will be prepared and ready to do my part to bring home the Presidents Cup."</p>
