      <p>RIYADH: Commercial activities are a “vital part” of the Saudi-US relationship, Alan Hallman, the US Embassy’s agriculture attache, said while inaugurating the Discover America festival at LuLu Hypermarket in Riyadh on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The week-long festival showcases high-quality food products from the US.</p>
      <p>“To deepen our economic and commercial ties, the US Mission supports the bilateral relationship by helping US products to enter the Saudi market,” Hallman told Arab News.</p>
      <p>“Saudi Arabia has a growing and increasingly diverse economy that presents rich opportunities for US firms in the food sector.”</p>
      <p>While touring the festival, Hallman said: “US food producers are the world leaders in quality, safety and innovation. I’m happy to see the wide range of healthy US food products on display.”</p>
      <p>He added: “This is another fantastic example of the strong commercial relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia.”</p>
      <p>Last year, the Kingdom imported some $1.8 billion worth of US food and agricultural products, a third of them consumer-ready.</p>
      <p>Hallman said this highlights the robust and growing economic relationship between the two countries, a key component of the strong bilateral partnership.</p>
      <p>The festival’s opening ceremony concluded with an announcement of the winners of a competition organized ahead of the event. The winners will go on a sponsored trip to the NASA center in the US.</p>
