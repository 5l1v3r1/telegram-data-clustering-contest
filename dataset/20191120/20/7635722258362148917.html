        <b>Irish airline Ryanair has criticised a ruling by a Spanish court over its baggage policy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It centered around a woman who was charged €20 on a flight from Madrid to Brussels.</p>
      <p>The passenger had a bag weighing 10 kilograms and did not have a 'Priority' ticket.</p>
      <p>The Provincial Court of Madrid said it considered the charge "abusive".</p>
      <p>It said it "condemns" the company for forcing the passenger to pay a supplement at the time of boarding even though the carry-on bag, by its size and weight, "could be perfectly transported in the cabin".</p>
      <p>The court has also ordered Ryanair to return the €20 fee to the passenger, plus interest.</p>

      <p>It has ordered Ryanair to remove the clause from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>However the judge dismissed a claim of 'moral damages' against the airline.</p>
      <p>The sentence cannot be appealed.</p>
      <p>In response, Ryanair said: "This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy.</p>
      <p>"It is an isolated case which misquoted the [Court of Justice of the European Union] and misinterpreted the airlines' commercial freedom to determine the size of their cabin baggage".</p>
      <p>It comes after an Italian regional court in Lazio recently ruled against Italy's Competition Authority.</p>
      <p>It found that Ryanair's policy was fully compliant with EU law.</p>
