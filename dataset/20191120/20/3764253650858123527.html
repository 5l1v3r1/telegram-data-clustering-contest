      <p>The former Beitar Jerusalem forward has now explained the circumstances which forced him to quit football at the time when Chelsea wanted to sign him.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I had problems with my feet, even during the tournament in 2009. If you remember, I often played in the second half because the pain was unbearable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“After the World Cup, I could not play at all because I had pulled too much on the hamstring playing with pain. Then I had to stop my career. Even today, it still hurts on the front of the foot.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“I tried to contact a lot of Nigerian international players, but I never got an answer and it was very difficult to cash,''</i> Sani Emmanuel told Leero Sports News.</p>
