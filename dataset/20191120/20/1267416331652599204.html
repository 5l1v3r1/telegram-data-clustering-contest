      <p>The government of Saskatchewan is notifying drivers that <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2019/november/19/distracted-driving-penalties">distracted driving penalties</a> will become stricter in February 2020.</p>
      <p>A ticket for distracted driving currently costs drivers $280 with four demerit points. Once the new regulations go into effect, drivers will have to pay $580 for a distracted driving ticket.</p>
      <p>If a driver commits a second offence within a year of first being convicted, they are going to receive a $1,400 ticket. They will also receive an additional four demerit points with an immediate seven-day vehicle seizure.</p>
      <p>Additionally, if a driver commits a third offence within a year of being convicted for the first one, they are going to receive a $2,100 ticket along with another seven-day vehicle seizure and four demerit points.</p>
      <p>Drivers are responsible for the towing and impound fees, which the government says are typically around $400.</p>
      <p>The Saskatchewan government says distracted driving is one of the <a href="https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2019/november/19/distracted-driving-penalties">top causes of accidents and fatalities</a>. It says that in 2018, distracted driving was a factor in more than 6,000 accidents, 774 injuries and 22 deaths.</p>
      <p>Under <i>The Traffic Safety Act</i>, distracted driving occurs when a driver uses “electronic communications equipment (cell phone)” while driving, or when a person drives without care and attention.</p>
