      <p>I'm A Celebrity star Myles Stephenson has been savagely taken down by his Love Island ex Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/love-islands-gabby-allen-confirms-16804256">Gabby and Myles</a> were together for just over a year, before they split after Rak-Su singer Myles reportedly cheated on her.</p>
      <p>Last night Myles was chatting to his I'm a Celebrity campmates about looking for love.</p>
      <p>Myles said he worried that he found it hard to work out if a girl liked him for him as person or for who he was.</p>

      <p>Ian Wright said: "You have to go to places that are more obscure, you can’t be going to places where the girls all like your music. </p>
      <p>"My missus didn’t know anything about football.  I met her in a pub in Notting Hill, it was the biggest kind of mugging off in respect of meeting someone.</p>
      <p>"I’m not saying I‘m Brad Pitt but she mugged me off so beautifully I knew she was the one.”</p>

      <p>"Apparently he was on about 'meaningful relationships' I'm not sure what the guy knows what he's on about tbh.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know cheating, lying and a whole load of other (poo emoji) came under 'meaningful' who knows? Each to their own."</p>
      <p>Earlier this year there had been rumours that things were not right with the pair, after they stopped posting pictures together.</p>
      <p>And in August there were reports that Gabby, 27, had split with Myles after she discovered he'd been messaging other girls.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv2-love-islands-gabby-allen-16539108">Gabby has confirmed</a> the news in an emotional Instagram story post.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "The newspaper articles are true.</p>
      <p>"I am no longer in a relationship.</p>
      <p>"I hope youse have all had a better week than me.</p>
      <p>"If anyone else has anything they need to tell me, please do. x."</p>
      <p>Gabby and Myles were initially inseparable and Myles moved into Gabby's flat earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But she had grown suspicious of his behaviour in recent months and he moved back in with his mum to give the pair space.</p>
      <p>Gabby, starred in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cbb-big-brother-cancelled-after-15151274">last ever series of Celebrity Big Brother</a> and was rumoured to be seeing Myles during her time on the show.</p>
      <p>Scouser Gabby <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cbb-housemates-accuse-gabby-allen-15065168">was linked to Dan Osbourne,</a> with CBB viewers accusing the pair of flirting during the show, but Gabby told the girls she was seeing someone on the outside - which turned out to be Myles - as she posted photos of a night out together when she walked out of the house.</p>
      <p>Captioning a video of Myles drinking and dancing in a club "Happy Birthday Baby", Gabby then posted a video of the pair snuggling up to each other, as she kissed him on the cheek.</p>

      <p>Speaking about Gabby's new man to <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/1467902/gabby-allen-confirm-romance-rak-su-myles-stephenson-dan-osborne-cbb">OK! Magazine,</a> Gabby’s mother Paula said: “It’s really early days.</p>
      <p>"Gabby is selective about who she goes out with now because she doesn’t want to get hurt again.</p>
      <p>“She’s not jumping into a relationship, but she deserves to be with someone who’s nice to her.”</p>
