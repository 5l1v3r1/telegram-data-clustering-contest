        <b>The Republic of Ireland still have a chance to reach Euro 2020 despite finishing third in Group D behind Switzerland and Denmark.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Monday night, Denmark confirmed their spot at Euro 2020 at Ireland’s expense thanks to the 1-1 draw in Dublin.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy’s side must now beat Slovakia away in a one-legged playoff semi-final on March 26, 2020.</p>

      <p>Should the national team navigate that tricky tie, they will come up against either Northern Ireland or Bosnia and Herzegovina in the final of the mini-tournament on March 31, with the winner advancing to Euro 2020. The venue for the final will be decided at a draw on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the seeding for Euro 2020 was <a href="https://twitter.com/UEFAEURO/status/1197136273103867904">announced</a>, with the draw due to take place on Saturday, November 30. Ireland are one of 12 co-hosts and Dublin will stage four games at the tournament.</p>

      <p>Ireland, should they qualify, will come through Playoff Path B and will be placed in Pot 4.</p>

      <p>As a host country, <b>Ireland</b> – should they come through the playoffs – will be in <b>Group E</b> alongside <b>Spain</b>. They will take on the former world and European champions in <b>Bilbao</b>, and play their other two group games at home in the Aviva Stadium. The fixture details will be confirmed at Friday’s draw. However, Ireland – again, should they qualify – look set to be placed in a daunting group.</p>
      <p>In addition to top seeds Spain, they will face one of France, Poland, Switzerland or Croatia, who are all in Pot 2 for the draw, and one of Portugal, Turkey, Austria, Sweden or the Czech Republic, who are in Pot 3.</p>
      <p>As Ireland and Spain are both host nations, <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0253-0d7f8240ecb7-b63cbbe97026-1000--wembley-to-stage-uefa-euro-2020-final/?referrer=%2fuefaeuro-2020%2fnews%2fnewsid%3d2151146">they will not be drawn alongside another host nation</a>.</p>

      <p>So, Ireland could end up in a group with Spain, France and Portugal – which would, undoubtedly, be the toughest group McCarthy’s side could find themselves in. The top two from each of the six groups at the tournament will advance to the last-16, as well as four of the best third-placed teams.</p>
      <p>The host nations for the tournament are London, Dublin, Glasgow, Rome, Bilbao, Amsterdam, Budapest, Baku, Munich, Copenhagen, Bucharest, and St Petersburg.</p>
      <p>The playoff draw takes place on Friday and the draw for the tournament will take place next Saturday.</p>
