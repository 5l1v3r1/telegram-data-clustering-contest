      <p>AAP MPs protested at Parliament on Wednesday alleging that the BJP has been cheating people in the name of regularisation of unauthorised colonies in Delhi.</p>
      <p>AAP MPs Sanjay Singh, Bhagwant Mann, ND Gupta and Sushil Gupta staged a protest near inside the Parliament complex against the BJP for not bringing a Bill in the Winter Session of the Parliament to regularise the unauthorised colonies of Delhi despite the Central government having promised to do it.</p>
      <p>“You [BJP] are lying. You think that lakhs of people are fools. Pass the Bill, just passing comments will not do. Why are you cheating people?” Mr. Singh said.</p>
      <p>The MP said that the BJP had given a list of 27 Bills at Parliament and a Bill to regularise the unauthorised colonies of the Capital was not part of it.</p>
      <p>The MPs were also heard shouting slogans: “You will have to come up with the Bill”, “We will not allow cheating” and held posters during the protest.</p>
