They vowed a £50billion 'Remain bonus' if Britain stays in the EU to fund public services, and promised to freeze all peak train fares. Jo Swinson's party also says they will raise £35billion by putting a penny on income tax, and will hike taxes on flying to help save the planet. After a flurry of announcements, The Sun Online looked at some of their pledges to see if the experts reckon they would work. Read our full report here.</li>

She mistakenly endorsed Boris Johnson instead of her own leader, Mr Corbyn. Speaking to ITV she said: “‘Boris Johnson talked about the NHS with compassion, he talked about nurses and doctors. “He talked about schools. He talked about all the policies that’s going to make the difference in real peoples’ lives.”</li>

It emerged he claimed British Jews returning from Israel were “brainwashed extremists”. The Tories confirmed earlier he's been suspended from the party and his candidacy has been withdrawn.</li>

Marie Van de Zyl said earlier: ““The only response to the disgusting antisemitism exhibited by Waheed Rafiq, by the Liberal Democrat candidate for Birmingham Hodge Hill, is to immediately drop him as a candidate for the constituency. It is utterly inexcusable to share a hideously antisemitic cartoon of a hook-nosed, bloodthirsty Jew or to rant about people using 'Zionist' websites and apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp.”</li>
