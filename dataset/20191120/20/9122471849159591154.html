      <h1>Chicago Bears Issue Injury Update On QB Mitch Trubisky</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:45:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Matt Nagy created quite the controversy on Sunday night, when the head coach of the Chicago Bears took out Mitch Trubisky with only a few minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. It generated a bunch of questions about whether or not the former No. 2 pick would remain the starter.</p>
      <p>Trubisky is struggling mightily this season for the Bears as he only has 1,580 passing yards and nine touchdowns in nine starts.</p>
      <p>Chicago used Chase Daniel earlier this year because of a shoulder injury to Trubisky. However, the coaching staff went right back to the former UNC star once he was healthy.</p>
      <p>Even though many people thought Nagy benched Trubisky because of his lack of production on <i>Sunday Night Football</i>, he said that it due to a hip injury.</p>
      <p>Despite suffering a hip injury just three days ago, the Bears listed Trubisky as a full participant during Wednesday’s practice.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, there are a bunch of football fans on social media questioning the legitimacy of his injury.</p>

      <p>The Bears entered this season with championship expectations. It’s no secret that Khalil Mack and the defense are good enough to win games on their own, but the thought was that Trubisky would progress nicely in his third season.</p>
      <p>For those wondering if Nagy decided to bench Trubisky because of production, you’ll find out in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Chicago will be on the road this weekend as it takes on the New York Giants.</p>
      <p>Do you think Mitch Trubisky will start this Sunday?</p>
