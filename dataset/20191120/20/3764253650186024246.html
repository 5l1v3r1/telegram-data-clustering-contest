      <p>Legendary singer, Akon, is gunning for the 2024 US presidential run and might even collaborate with popular American rapper, Kanye West, as reports suggest.</p>
      <p>Yahoo reports that the I Wanna Love You crooner on Monday, November 18, spoke about his stepping back from the 2020 presidential race.</p>
      <p><i>“I know what the issues are. And as a person, as an immigrant, as a black man, as whatever you want to call it, I kinda know or feel like I know that I can take the country and move it forward. I really believe so,”</i> he said.</p>

      <p>He also spoke about how he has been watching closely and how he feels so much unsafe and unempowered under President Trump’s administration, and how running might be a tough fight.</p>
      <p><i>“I feel a lot more unsafe. I feel unempowered. Honestly, I feel it's gonna be a fight. I've been thinking about running for 2020 very seriously,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>When asked what he thought about Kanye West, who has also shown interest in running, he said that he does not see it as a competition.</p>

      <p><i>“I honestly need him to run, I want him to run. My thing is, if he does run, it’s great for the culture. Now, whether or not you think he’s fit is another thing, that’s why you got me as another choice,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>The Smack That crooner also added that though his political belief is different from West's, the difference will make for a good team as he does not mind running as his vice president.</p>
