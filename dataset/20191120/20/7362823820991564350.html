      <h1>Here's how many Mustang Mach-Es Ford can build</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/make/ford">Ford’s</a> hoping the Mustang Mach-E will be a sales hit when it goes on sale late next year, but it definitely won’t be as big as the original pony car</p>
      <p>Ford sold over 400,000 Mustangs in the 12 months following its April 1964 debut and more than a million by the end of 1965, but it only has the capability to produce about 50,000 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/interesting-facts-ford-mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-Es</a>, regardless of the demand for the all-electric SUV.</p>

      <p>That’s according to Ford President Joe Hinrichs, who said battery availability is the limiting factor for the Mexican-made model, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Thibodeau/status/1196993418473484288">Detroit News reporter Ian Thibodeau reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Ford began taking orders on Sunday for the Mustang Mach-E, which has a starting price of $44,995, but hadn't previously revealed how many would be available.</p>

      <p>Tesla will be ramping up production of the similarly priced Model Y crossover at about the same time the Mustang Mach-E goes on sale. The California factory where the Model Y will be built has a proven capability to manufacture nearly 400,000 cars per year, which could increase in 2020, but Tesla hasn’t said how much of that capacity might be allocated to the Model Y.</p>
