      <p>An advocate has claimed that he was attacked by a man after an argument over security checking inside Saket district court premises Wednesday. The advocate, identified as Dilshad Ahmad Saifi, was treated at a local hospital in South Delhi, following which he forwarded his complaint to the local police.</p>
      <p>DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, “Action will be taken as and when we receive the complaint.”</p>
      <p>Saifi sustained injuries to his head and left-hand index finger. The man fled the court premises after the incident, Saifi claimed. The incident took place Wednesday afternoon, when Saifi, who was attending a matter at the family court, left to escort his client to the main gate. He returned to find the accused arguing with a security officer outside the entrance for advocates.</p>
      <p>“A litigant was arguing with a security officer. The officer kept telling the man that if he was a government servant, he could show the card and enter. He declined and even refused to allow the security officer to check his bag before barging inside,” Saifi told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>.</p>
      <p>The man moved towards courtroom number 2, where he was stopped by Saifi.</p>
      <p>“I told him he must get his bag checked, but he took out something from the bag and hit me on the head and hand. He ran away from the court premises before anyone could catch him,” Saifi said.</p>
      <p>The advocate has demanded that the police ramp up the security at the court premises.</p>
      <p>The Saket District Bar Association president Karnail Singh said that he will write to senior police officers and other officials regarding security arrangements at the court.</p>
      <p>“Some police officers have started coming back to Saket district court. The Naib courts are also present for duty. The injured lawyer’s complaint will be handed over to the police,” Singh said.</p>
