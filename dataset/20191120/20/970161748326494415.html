      <p>A cruel school worker was fired for sending a note home with a five year-old boy telling his mom to put him on a diet.</p>
      <p>Francesca Easdon, from Kingwood in Texas, was stunned by the note in son Kyler’s bag, which she had originally sent in to try and cheer Kyler up.</p>
      <p>Francesca had written a note to Rocking Horse Day Care saying: ‘Please tell Kyler that his mommy loves him so much and I’m thinking about him.’</p>
      <p>But an unidentified person – whose handwriting looked too advanced to belong to one of Kyler’s classmates – annotated it with ‘No! Put him on a diet &amp; go away!’</p>
      <p>Francesca told <a href="https://abc7ny.com/family/day-care-worker-fired-for-leaving-nasty-note-in-boys-lunch/5703376/">KTRK</a>: ‘It took a minute to register, what I even saw and I just kept re-reading it and I just stood there for a minute.’</p>

      <p>She said that Kyler is a picky eater, and that she had started putting healthy options in his lunch, but wanted to include the note to cheer him up.</p>

      <p>Francesca added: ‘For the record, I feel that Kyler is absolutely perfect the way he is, I’m just helping him make healthier choices.</p>
      <p>‘Instead of his school being supportive I am in absolute shock at what happened.’</p>
      <p>Rocking Horse are believed to have identified the worker who wrote the note, and fired them, but have not named the worker involved.</p>
      <p>But Rocking Horse spokesman Jacques Verron later refused to confirm the dismissal, saying he did not want to be sued.</p>
      <p>Easdon said the facility, which Kyler attended for three years, has shown ‘zero remorse for their actions.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I am disgusted that I put my trust in these people to care for my child and this is what I get in return.’</p>
      <p>The mother is now considering withdrawing Kyler from Rocking Horse.</p>
