      <h1>Michael Dawson fears Harry Kane exit from Tottenham Hotspur</h1>
      <h2>Former defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-dawson/"><b>Michael Dawson</b></a> fears that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a> may opt to request an exit from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Early on Wednesday morning, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> had been appointed as the replacement for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, who was officially removed from his position less than 12 hours earlier.</p>
      <p>While Kane holds a long-term contract at the north London outfit, Dawson suggests that the forward may require some convincing to continue his long-term association with the club.</p>
      <p>Dawson told <i>talkSPORT</i>: "The first thing Mourinho has to do now is convince the players to stay. That group of players loved Pochettino. What he has done for the last five years is absolutely incredible.</p>
      <p>"He made Harry Kane, and all I would say is I hope that doesn't make him go, 'now I want to leave'. You look at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toby-alderweireld/"><b>Toby Alderweireld</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jan-vertonghen/"><b>Jan Vertonghen</b></a>, do they want to stay?</p>
      <p>"Those kind of players, having your contract running out can be unsettling and once one leaves, it can maybe have a knock-on effect."</p>
      <p>Chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> has allegedly assured Mourinho that Kane will not be sold during the summer transfer window.</p>
