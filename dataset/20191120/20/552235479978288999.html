      <p>A jealous WAG who smashed a glass over her footballer boyfriend's head after she caught him kissing another woman in a nightclub escaped custody.</p>
      <p>Lauren Dinse, 31, struck former Aberdeen player Josh Walker with the tumbler when she spotted him in a romantic clinch with a woman at the trendy Lulu club in Edinburgh last year.</p>
      <p>Dinse left the love rat midfielder bleeding heavily from a deep gash to his head and he was taken to the city's Royal Infirmary for treatment where he received 11 stitches to the wound.</p>
      <p>Dinse, who has two children with Walker, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/jealous-wag-smashed-glass-tumbler-20736194">admitted the attack</a> when she appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last month and she returned to the dock for sentencing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Neil Martin told the court his client had been involved in an abusive relationship with the midfielder and she had suffered "emotional and physical abuse" by him.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Martin said Walker had recently become "more vindictive" towards Dinse and that she has been "subjected to abusive behaviour" by her ex-partner.</p>
      <p>The lawyer said that the abuse suffered by his client included Walker being unfaithful to her and the footballer spiking her drink with medication after he had contracted a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
      <p>Mr Martin said Dinse had been "under the influence of alcohol" at the time of the glassing and that she had spent "a harrowing" weekend in the cells following the incident.</p>
      <p>The court was also told Dinse is now seeking help from the Women's Aid organisation and has been "remorseful" about the attack.</p>
      <p>He added: "The narrative in the case was that the complainer Mr Walker was standing speaking to another female but what can be seen clearly [in the CCTV] is that he is kissing another female in the nightclub.</p>

      <p>"This does not justify what she did but it adds some context.</p>
      <p>"But the relationship was clearly toxic and is now over."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Sheriff</a> Adrian Cottam said: "The information that has come out since does not excuse your actions which could have been even worse for Mr Walker but fortunately they weren't."</p>
      <p>The sheriff ordered the receptionist to be placed on an offender's supervision requirement for the next 12 months as an alternative to custody.</p>
      <p>Previously prosecutor Alistair Millar gave a short narration to the court and said Dinse was in a relationship with Walker at the time of last December's assault.</p>
      <p>Mr Millar said: "This incident took place in a nightclub where the accused has witnessed the complainer speaking to another female.</p>
      <p>"Her reaction to this was to hit him over the head with a glass."</p>

      <p>The fiscal added Mr Walker's injury was described as "a deep laceration to the head which was five centimetres in length" and required 11 stitches.</p>
      <p>Dinse admitted to assaulting Joshua Walker by striking him to the head with a glass to his severe injury at Lulu nightclub, George Street, Edinburgh, on December 9 last year.</p>
      <p>Walker, 30, recently retired from the game due to a serious knee injury and is remembered for scoring the opening goal for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Dons</a> against Bayern Munich in a UEFA Cup match at Pittodrie in 2008.</p>
      <p>He also played in the English Premiership for Middlesbrough at just 17 and captained England at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Walker also played for Watford, Bournemouth, Rotherham and Indian side Bengaluru and was captain of Scottish League Two side Edinburgh City after joining the club in 2017.</p>
