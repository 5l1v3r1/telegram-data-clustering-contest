        <b>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has declared the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), David Lyon, as the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276529-bayelsa-election-inec-declares-apc-winner-governorship-poll.html">winner of the Bayelsa governorship election.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Taking over Bayelsa state from the PDP after 20 years of dominance is something the APC should celebrate.</p>
      <p>However, as this analysis shows, the party still has some heavy legal tasks ahead if it wants to sustain the gubernatorial victory and avoid a repeat of the Zamfara scenario.</p>
      <p>Though the APC won the 2019 governorship election in <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/zamfara-state-news-today.html">Zamfara state</a>, and other elections in the state, the party lost all its seats to the PDP when Supreme Court ruled that it did not conduct valid primaries in the build-up to the elections.</p>
      <p>According to the apex court's ruling, a political party that has no valid candidate cannot be said to have emerged winner of an election.</p>
      <p>Thus, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1240032-zamfara-election-court-nullifies-apc-votes-declares-pdp-winner.html">the court sacked all APC winners </a>and ordered that the candidates with the second-highest number of votes (the PDP) be declared winners of the elections which include governorship, National and state assembly elections.</p>

        <b>The Bayelsa scenario:</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, November 12, a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1274939-breaking-court-disqualifies-bayelsa-apc-deputy-governorship-candidate.html">disqualified the APC running mate </a>for the election, Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo.</p>
      <p>The court gave the verdict on the grounds that the APC deputy governorship candidate provided false information regarding his educational qualifications which he submitted to INEC.</p>
      <p>If the judgement had stood, the APC would have been disqualified from participating in the election because the Nigerian constitution does not permit a governorship candidate to contest in an election without a valid deputy.</p>
      <p>However, the<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275821-just-in-appeal-court-clears-apc-participate-bayelsa-governorship-election.html"> party secured a stay of execution on the judgement</a> on Thursday, November 14.</p>
      <p>The court issued an interim order of stay of execution of the judgement of the Federal High Court of November 12, 2019, pending the determination of “the motion on notice for an order of interlocutory injunction filed on 13 November 2019.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as the party resolved the candidature of its running mate, another court, a Federal High Court in Yenagoa, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275637-bayelsa-election-apc-candidate-poll-court.html">nullified its September 4, 2019 governorship primary</a> that produced Lyon as its governorship candidate.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to the court's ruling, the primary conducted by the APC was outside the rules of the party.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Zamfara versus Bayelsa: Like Marafa, like Lokpobiri</b>
      </p>
      <p>The suit, which led to the nullification of the APC primary, was filed by Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, who was also governorship aspirant of the party.</p>
      <p>Lokpobiri had sued the party, seeking a declaration that he was the winner of the primary election.</p>
      <p>When the court nullified the primary, Lokpobiri's lawyer explained that the court’s declaration was not part of their prayers.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Lokpobiri only asked the court to pronounce him the winner, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275773-bayelsa-election-i-prayed-court-nullify-primary-lokpobiri.html">not to nullify the primary.</a></p>
      <p>It is instructive to note that the APC's loss in Zamfara was also caused by one of its key members and also a 2019 governorship aspirant: Senator Kabiru Marafa.</p>
      <p>Marafa's challenge of the Zamfara APC's primaries led to the Supreme Court judgement which sacked all the APC winners in the election.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Back to Bayelsa, if the judgement nullifying the primary election had also stood, the APC would have fielded no candidate in the November 16 gubernatorial election.</p>
      <p>However, the party also <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276115-bayelsa-election-court-appeal-clears-lyon-apc.html">secured a stay of execution of the judgement. </a>The appeal court sitting in Abuja stated that Lyon remains the candidate of the APC for the poll until the determination of an appeal he filed against the decision of the Federal High Court.</p>
      <p>Now that the APC has participated and won the election, the bigger task ahead now is to win the two court cases in court.</p>
      <p>The one concerning the deputy governorship candidate is not critical as the governor-elect can choose a new deputy governor provided his current deputy governor-elect loses in court.</p>
      <p>This is the position of Chief Emeka Ngige (SAN), according to a report filed by ThisDay newspaper on whether or not the APC could participate in the election.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, the main hurdle the party has to cross now is the court ruling which nullified its primary.</p>
      <p>Should the APC lose this case in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the party will suffer a disastrous repeat of the Zamfara scenario!</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, following its victory in the governorship election in Bayelsa and Kogi states, the APC leadership has proposed Friday, November 22, as <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276985-apc-fixes-friday-november-22-nec-meeting.html">the date for its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting.</a></p>
      <p>According to a source in the APC national secretariat in Abuja, the party’s national caucus will meet on Thursday, November 21, while the NEC might be held on Friday.</p>
