      <p>The annual KidSport charitable campaign has launched in Penticton.</p>
      <p>"Give the Gift of Sport" has run for eight years now, helping kids in the community get involved with organized sports. </p>
      <p>Over 30 per cent of Canadian youth under the age of 18 cannot afford to play organized sport.</p>
      <p>With the help of Canadians across the country, the campaign aims to get more kids off the sidelines, into the game, and experience the gift of sport.</p>
      <p>“As the 20th year of KidSport Penticton winds down, the committee is looking to gain some ground in 2020,” said committee chair Dave Lieskovsky. “Although 2019 proved to be successful in providing support to kids for sport, the need continues to surpass the funds available.”</p>
      <p>An average donation of $250 can provide one child with a full season of sport. KidSport is hoping to raise $250,000 nationally this year. </p>
