        <b>Kristen Stewart gave us punk princess gold as she posed away in a coat with her co-stars during the Charlie’s Angels premiere in London.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actress, 29, told us all whose boss as she confidently strutted down the red carpet for cameras wearing her signature smoky eye and gelled back short hair.</p>
      <p>She definitely looked like one of Charlie’s Angels in a sparkly black bardot gown, and she was quick to put on her coat after taking photos because – it is winter after all.</p>
      <p>Kristen was joined by her co-stars Ella Balinska, Naomi Scott and Elizabeth Banks who also kept to the theme of intimidating but sexy businesswoman in their black attires.</p>
      <p>Naomi swept the red carpet as she rocked a latex bodysuit and looked every bit the glamorous cat burglar.</p>
      <p>She wore Richard Quinn’s Devil Dress and the name is fitting so well now.</p>

      <p>What better way to prove a fashion point than to finish off the look in some Christian Louboutin’s.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Ella kept her look simple, but never underestimate the power of a black turtle neck dress with a thigh-high slit because, that ensemble will make you look like royalty.</p>
      <p>The dress was backless and was accessorised with diamond chains keeping it together.</p>

      <p>It seems like all three Angels never got out of character as they looked like they were still in their elaborate disguises before the usual intense fight scene appeared</p>
      <p>It was recently revealed that Elizabeth – who donned a classy black dress – was so <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/behind-scenes-elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-nearly-shut-movie-11189949/">ill during shooting they almost had to shut down production</a>.</p>

      <p>But when you’re an Angel, that’s not an option.</p>
      <p>The make-up artist for the film, Melanie Hughes-Weaver, told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘There was a scene where Banks was working and she had a 103 fever (39.5°C) and was directing and acting in the scene.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘There was an explosion and Sabina (played by Kristen) was being treated for some wounds. Banks’ character comes walking in.</p>
      <p>‘Like, she’s got a 103 fever and literally laying down (between takes) and we were trying to determine whether we should shut down production. She was so ill and going for it while on camera.’</p>
