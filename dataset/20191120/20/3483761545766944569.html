      <p>A new and free community service has been established to offer older people in the Hunter access to legal advice, thanks to an almost $700,000 State Government grant.</p>
      <p>Newcastle Law School in Newcastle and Gosford has used the $696,000 in funding to set up the Older Persons Legal Clinic which will focus on increasing access to justice for older people, improving legal outcomes, and reducing the load of legal work on Government and community-based free legal services.</p>
      <p>The Older Persons Legal Clinic is located with the University of Newcastle Legal Centre in the Newcastle CBD and offers a 'pop up' clinic on the Central Coast at the Australian Taxation Office in Gosford's CBD one day a week.</p>
      <p>Legal education for older people, health services and the legal profession form a key part of the new clinic.</p>
      <p>Director of the University of Newcastle Legal Centre, Mr Shaun McCarthy, said a significant source of disempowerment for older people was the isolation and physical restrictions they faced.</p>
      <p>"Older people have particular legal needs and the Older Persons Legal Clinic will offer legal advice, representation and community education," Mr McCarthy said.</p>
      <p>"The clinic supports older people with matters such as wills, powers of attorney, enduring guardianship, mental health law and social security, as well as providing community legal education to older people and legal professionals."</p>
      <p>For people aged 60 years and over, the clinic also supports older people in areas such as family law, neighbourhood disputes, and tenancy issues through mediation.</p>
      <p>Common issues older people face include consumer matters, financial abuse, planning ahead for the future (enduring guardianship appointment, enduring power of attorney, wills, advanced care directive) and accommodation matters and driver's licensing.</p>
      <p>The clinic runs on Wednesdays at University House in Newcastle, while the pop up clinic at Gosford operates on Thursdays.</p>
      <p>To find out more information about the clinic and operating hours, community members can contact 1800 314 792, or visit <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.newcastle.edu.au_older-2Dpersons-2Dlegal-2Dclinic&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&amp;r=aY9hBqbp9XDoykpagqqfe7l1fELLkj9EuZfwq6Ghyu8&amp;m=VAv8dKyz-PC61YyFE_8kLtB-WBK_QxTL5MXuwhzDLes&amp;s=XVvpbpyRjmQZNyQmc7K7Kf7Z86MjT843H0MisXONcTQ&amp;e=">www.newcastle.edu.au/older-persons-legal-clinic</a>.</p>
