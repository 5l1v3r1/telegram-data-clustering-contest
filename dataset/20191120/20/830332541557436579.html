      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:25:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Hanna and David Close, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph has apologized for his role in Thursday night's in-game brawl in which opponent Myles Garrett ripped off Rudolph's helmet and hit him in the head with it.</p>
      <p>The violent incident toward the end of the Steelers' 21-7 win over the host Cleveland Browns moved the NFL to suspend Garrett for at least six games and two other players for less time.</p>
      <p>The NFL hasn't announced a punishment for Rudolph, who tussled with Garrett on the ground -- and himself appeared to pull at Garrett's helmet -- before Garrett pulled off the quarterback's headgear and clocked him with it. But Rudolph told reporters Wednesday that he should have kept his composure.</p>
      <p>"As for my involvement .... there's no acceptable excuse," the Steelers quarterback said. "The bottom line is that I should have done a better job keeping my composure in that situation, and (I) fell short of what I believe it means to be a Pittsburgh Steeler and a member of the NFL.</p>
      <p>"I have no ill will towards Myles Garrett. Great respect for his ability as a player, and I know that if Myles could go back, he would handle the situation differently," Rudolph said.</p>
      <p>Asked if he expected the NFL to fine him, Rudolph said: "I'm sure whatever the league hands out, I'm going to comply with that."</p>
      <p>Garrett, who also apologized, is appealing his indefinite suspension, which the NFL said would last at least the rest of this regular season and the playoffs.</p>
      <h3>How the fight happened</h3>
      <p>The fight started with seconds left in the game, when Garrett -- a defensive end and first overall pick in the 2017 draft -- took Rudolph to the ground after Rudolph completed a meaningless screen pass.</p>
      <p>They tussled on the ground, with Rudolph appearing to tug at the back of Garrett's helmet.</p>
      <p>Then Garrett got to his feet and pulled off Rudolph's helmet.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh guard David DeCastro pushed Garrett away, but Rudolph got up and chased them. Then Garrett swung the helmet onto the former Oklahoma State quarterback's head.</p>
      <p>Obviously not pleased, Pittsburgh's Maurkice Pouncey punched and kicked Garrett, who had fallen to the ground with DeCastro.</p>
      <p>Cleveland's Larry Ogunjobi then pushed Rudolph to the ground from behind.</p>
      <p>Garrett, Pouncey and Ogunjobi were all ejected from the game.</p>
      <p>Besides suspending Garrett indefinitely, the NFL on Friday suspended Pouncey for three games and Ogunjobi for one.</p>
      <h3>How Rudolph described his actions</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday, Rudolph described his role in the fight this way: "As I released the ball, I took a late shot, did not agree with the way he then took me to the ground. And my natural reaction was just to get him off from on top of me."</p>
      <p>"And again, I should have done a better job handling that situation," he added.</p>
      <p>A reporter noted that it appeared Rudolph tugged the back of Garrett's helmet before the defensive end removed Rudolph's own.</p>
      <p>Rudolph's answer: "Like I said, I thought the way he took me down late, it was basically the last play of the game, and I was just trying to get him off from on top of me."</p>
      <p>Garrett's punishment could be considered, depending on how you examine it, the longest suspension levied by the NFL for a single on-field incident.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict was suspended for the rest of his season -- amounting to 12 regular season games and the playoffs -- for a helmet-to-helmet hit on a player on September 29. But the NFL made clear that his previous suspensions and violations of unnecessary roughness rules played a factor in the length of the punishment.</p>
      <p>Burfict was suspended twice previously for on-field incidents.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the longest suspension for an in-game violation was that of Albert Haynesworth, who was suspended five games in 2006 after the then-Tennessee Titan stomped on a player's head.</p>
