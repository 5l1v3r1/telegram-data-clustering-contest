      <h3>Now playing on a Nest Hub and Hub Max near you</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://whatson.sling.com/announcements/nest-hub-nest-hub-max/">blog posting</a>, Sling confirmed its Sling TV streaming service can now be accessed via a Google Nest Hub or Hub Max.</p>
      <p>Sling also explained this expansion further adds to the service's ever-growing list of supported devices. A list that now includes more than 20 different platforms.</p>
      <p>The Google Nest Hub or Hub Max are the latest smart displays to come from Google. Replacing the Google Home line, Nest Hub displays only recently became <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/09/nest-hub-max-officially-available-next-week.html">available to buy</a> following their <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/05/nest-hub-max-hands-on-google-i-o-2019.html">Google I/O announcement</a>.</p>

      <p>With these being Google smart displays, both the Nest Hub and Hub Max rely heavily on Google Assistant to provide users with a hands-free experience. With the smart displays having now extended their support to Sling TV, that voice support has also now been extended.</p>
      <p>Sling TV subscribers can now issue voice commands to the Nest Hub or Home Max to play any channel that's available through the live TV service. In addition to physically watching Sling TV on Nest Hub and Hub Max, users can also issue voice commands to further control the playback. This includes pausing, stopping or skipping forward.</p>
      <p>Sling has also confirmed Nest Hub Max gestures are also supported for quick pausing and resuming actions.</p>

      <h3>How to get started with Sling TV on Google's smart displays</h3>
      <p>First of all, you will obviously need an active <a href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-5881789-13261876">Sling TV subscription</a>. Sling TV plans start at $25 per month although the company does offer the first month for $15.</p>
      <p>You will also need to have the Sling TV app downloaded on a compatible device, such as a smartphone. The Sling TV app is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sling&amp;hl=en_US">available to download</a> for free from the Google Play Store.</p>
      <p>With the app downloaded and a Sling TV subscription activated, users simply need to connect their Google and Sling TV accounts.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>To do this, open the Google Home app on the smartphone and tap on settings. Then scrolls down to the Google Assistant services section and tap on "TV and video" before linking to the Sling TV account.</p>
      <p>Coinciding with this launch, Sling is offering a 3-day free trial to those who sign up through the Google Home app.</p>
