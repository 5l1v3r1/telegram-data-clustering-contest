      <p>A gin distillery situated in a former brothel in the CBD plans to make a new batch using water from the Yarra River.</p>
      <p>The innovative idea from Little Lon Distilling emerged when it was named as one of the finalists in the City of Melbourne’s small business and social enterprise grants scheme.</p>
      <p>Other inspired ideas to make the shortlist include a podiatry business designing football boots for women’s feet, a skills development agency for disadvantaged women and a program to authenticate Aboriginal art.</p>
      <p>Lord Mayor Sally Capp said it was fantastic to see so many ideas come to life.</p>
      <p>“From new ideas that need investment to get off the ground, to established businesses wishing</p>
      <p>to expand, these grants help foster our city’s strong culture of enterprise and innovation across</p>
      <p>many sectors,” Ms Capp said.</p>
