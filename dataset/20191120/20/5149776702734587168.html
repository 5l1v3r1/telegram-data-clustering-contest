      <h2>Nottingham Forest transfer news | The Reds could be looking to bolster their attacking ranks during the January window - and Dwight Gayle has been continually linked</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:07:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Murray</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest were interested in a summer move for Newcastle United striker Dwight Gayle - but that interest might not be at an end yet.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> could reportedly be tempted to make a move for the 29-year-old when the window reopens in January, as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> looks to bolster his ranks for a promotion push in the second half of the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/lewis-grabban">Lewis Grabban</a> currently leads the Reds' top scorer list for the campaign, with seven to his name so far.</p>
      <p>But could Gayle provide a deadly strike partner for Grabban at the City Ground?</p>
      <p>We take a look at all the latest around Forest's Gayle interest.</p>
      <h4>'Front of the queue'</h4>

      <p>Gayle enjoyed a stunning loan season in the Championship in 2018-19 with West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>He scored 24 goals in 41 appearances as the Baggies made it to the play-off semi-finals.</p>
      <p>West Brom were linked with a second move for Gayle in the summer, when Forest were also interested.</p>
      <p>But The Athletic's report last month suggested the Reds could look to "position themselves at the front of the queue for the Newcastle striker" once January comes around.</p>

      <h4>Steve Bruce on Gayle</h4>
      <p>While Gayle has made only two appearances so far in this Premier League season.</p>
      <p>Both were substitute outings, in the 1-0 win over Chelsea and a 1-1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>But Newcastle boss Steve Bruce still insists the 29-year-old forward get his chance at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>"What happened last year or the past, I am not really interested in when it comes to Dwight," Bruce told The Chronicle last month.</p>
      <p>"The thing for Dwight is that whatever number he has on his back he's got the ability to score goals.</p>
      <p>"I am delighted that he's around us because he is a very, very good player.</p>
      <p>"And I am delighted he's here. He can knuckle down now and fight for his chance."</p>

      <h4>Lamouchi on January</h4>
      <p>“January, for me, is so far away. There’s no point talking about players who are not in my squad."</p>
      <h4>China move a possibility</h4>
      <p>Reported Forest target Gayle has been linked with a big money move to China.</p>
      <p>While Forest and second-tier rivals West Brom could yet look at a January move themselves, the Sunday People report that a transfer to the Chinese Super League could be a possibility.</p>
      <p>The report says Gayle and teammate Jonjo Shelvey are "willing to consider" a switch to the Far East.</p>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion, where Gayle had a successful loan spell last season, are also said to be eyeing up the striker again.</p>
