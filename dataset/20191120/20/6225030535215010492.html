      <p>Super stud Into Mischief and champion-to-be <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Mitole">Mitole</a></b> could soon top the pedigrees of Quarter Horse foals.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/237148/into-mischief-and-mitole-available-to-quarter-horses?utm_source=BHTW&amp;utm_medium=social"><b>a Blood-Horse report</b></a>, leading sire Into Mischief and recent Breeders’ Cup Sprint winner Mitole are available to breed to Quarter Horse mares via artificial insemination during the upcoming season. Breeding to Into Mischief, who tops the 2019 Bloodhorse leading sires list and commands a Thoroughbred fee of $150,000 at Spendthrift Farm, will cost $10,000 for quarter horse mares. For Mitole, who will stand his first season for $25,000 at Spendthrift, the price is $4,000.</p>
      <p>Unlike quarter horses, artificial insemination is precluded in Thoroughbred breeding as The Jockey Club requires a “live cover” for a Thoroughbred foal to be registered.</p>
      <p>A cross between a quarter horse and a Thoroughbred is known as an “appendix horse.” The Blood-Horse noted there have been previous high-profile Thoroughbred stallions to make an impact in quarter-horse racing including top sire Storm Cat, 1997 Horse of the Year Favorite Trick and Grade 1 winner Hennessy, all of whom sired stakes-winning quarter horses.</p>
      <p>While its been done to some extent in the past, Spendthrift Stallion Manager Mark Toothaker told Blood-Horse, “This is something new. It’s never been done before in this type of scale.”</p>
      <p>Toothaker said the idea was hatched by Bill and Corrine Heiligbrodt, who campaigned Mitole. The Heiligrodts who, along with Mitole trainer Steve Asmussen have ties to quarter horse racing, had been approached about possibly breeding to this year’s expected sprint champion. The owners brought the idea to Spendthrift headr B. Wayne Hughes, who is “always wanting us to think out of the box,” Toothaker said.</p>
      <p>As the deal was being completed, Into Mischief was added to the plan.</p>
      <p>"He's been a breed-changing stallion in the Thoroughbred world," Toothaker told the Blood-Horse. "Why couldn't he have tremendous influence on the Quarter Horse world?"</p>
      <p>Robicheaux Ranch in Breaux Bridge, La., will handle the frozen semen samples as well as the booking of mares. Farm manager Ryan Robicheaux said quarter horse breeders are looking for the pedigree outcrosses stallions like Into Mischief and Mitole can provide.</p>
