      <p>When you picture traditional <a href="http://www.insider.com/popular-thanksgiving-side-dishes-ranked-2017-11">Thanksgiving foods</a>, you probably think of turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, and yams. But since America is a melting pot, it only makes sense that multicultural traditions have made their way onto the <a href="http://www.insider.com/category/thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> table in different regions around the United States.</p>
      <p>Insider has rounded up 16 of the most popular regional Thanksgiving foods around the country, some of which you may have never heard of. From purple yams in Hawaii to hasty pudding in New England, we’re drooling over some of these culinary traditions that we may want to add to our own Turkey Day tables.</p>

      <p>There’s nothing quite like a deep-fried turkey.</p>
      <p>Eric Thayer/Reuters</p>
      <p>Frying turkey is a notoriously dangerous activity, and <a href="http://www.propertycasualty360.com/2012/11/21/top-10-us-states-for-turkey-fryer-fires?page_all=1&amp;amp;slreturn=1510867569">according to</a> State Farm, Texas is the worst offender of turkey-frying accidents. Nonetheless, fried turkey is a delicious Southern delicacy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Hasty pudding – also known by its politically incorrect name, <a href="https://newengland.com/today/food/indian-pudding-1978/">Indian pudding</a> – is a deliciously simple dessert made with cornmeal, molasses, brown sugar, and spices. It’s usually topped with a dollop of whipped cream or scoop of ice cream.</p>

      <h3>What else would you find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.wideopeneats.com/recipes/new-england-oyster-stuffing/">In New England</a>, stuffing is often made with clams or oysters instead of just breadcrumbs. You might also find a side dish of <a href="https://newengland.com/today/food/side-dishes/vegetables/creamed-onions-2/">creamed onions</a> made with pearl onions and heavy cream.</p>

      <h3>Maryland: Sauerkraut</h3>

What may seem odd to outsiders is an essential side dish for the large German-American population of Maryland.</p>

      <h3>New York and New Jersey: Manicotti</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The Italian-American Thanksgiving is perhaps the most gluttonous of all, and New Jersey and parts of New York just happen to have large populations of Italian Americans. Before the turkey is served, nonna will <a href="http://www.writeonnewjersey.com/tag/italian-american-thanksgiving-family-traditions/">dole out servings of manicotti</a> (ricotta-stuffed crepe pasta topped with marinara sauce).</p>
      <h3>What else would you find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p>Pasta is usually served as a pre-cursor to turkey in <a href="http://nj1015.com/turkey-dinner-with-lasagna-ridiculous-poll/">Italian-American Thanksgiving traditions</a>, but it doesn’t have to be manicotti: lasagna and baked ziti with meatballs are known to grace the table as well. The Italian host family will also have a plate of antipasto with cured meats, cheese, olives, and pickled vegetables ready for when guests arrive.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cranberry relish or sauce may seem like a universal Thanksgiving food, but homemade (not canned) sweetened cranberry relish seasoned with orange zest has its origins in the <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/usa/travel-tips-and-articles/regional-thanksgiving-foods-of-the-us/40625c8c-8a11-5710-a052-1479d2778c5e">Northeastern quadrant</a> of the country.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Frog eye salad may sound bizarre to anyone from the East Coast, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/frog-eye-salad-map-dishes-favorite-thanksgiving-sides-by-state/">but for people from the West</a> and Southwest regions of America, it’s a must-have for Thanksgiving. This sweetened, fruity pasta salad is made with acini di pepe pasta, pineapples, mandarin oranges, Cool Whip, and marshmallow topping.</p>

      <p>If you’re eating frog eye salad, you may also be <a href="https://www.templesquare.com/blog/utah-food-mormon-recipes/">partial to Jell-O salad</a>, which is universally accepted as an important Thanksgiving side dish in Utah. In the Southwest, you’re more likely to find Latino flavors like <a href="http://www.bhg.com/recipe/poultry/blue-cornmeal-chorizo-stuffing/">blue cornbread stuffing with chorizo.</a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>Green bean casserole may be a staple on many Thanksgiving plates, but you’ll mostly find it in the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/11/24/456237098/green-bean-casserole-the-thanksgiving-staple-we-love-or-loathe">middle of the country</a>. Midwesterners consider the canned cream of mushroom soup, fried onions, and green bean dish to be an important part of the November holiday.</p>
      <h3>What else would I find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p>In the Midwest, regular cornbread is replaced by the creamy <a href="https://themom100.com/recipe/spoonbread-corn-pudding/">spoonbread corn pudding.</a> In certain regions, you’ll also find <a href="http://www.midwestliving.com/recipe/salads/german-potato-salad/">German potato salad</a> on the table, as well as <a href="http://www.midwestliving.com/recipe/pies/cherry-pie">cherry pie</a> instead of pumpkin pie for dessert.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Midwest, specifically Minnesota: Wild rice casserole</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Out of all the regional Thanksgiving flavors we’ve mentioned, the strongest traditions probably come from the South. The Southern half of the United States prides itself on unique (and heavy) Thanksgiving dishes like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/">sweet potato pie</a> instead of the typical pumpkin pie.</p>
      <h3>What else would you find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>

A <a href="http://www.deepsouthdish.com/2008/01/thanksgiving-recipes.html#axzz4ydR05SKJ">typical Southern Thanksgiving</a> table buckles under the weight of one or several types of macaroni and cheese, okra pickles, cornbread, and sweet potatoes with marshmallow topping. It also wouldn’t be a Southern meal without generous portions of collard greens.</p>

      <h3>Kentucky: Derby pie</h3>

      <p>In Georgia, besides all of the aforementioned Southern staples, you’ll find peaches in abundance, especially in the form of <a href="http://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/georgia-peach-pie">peach pie.</a></p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Southeast, especially Florida: Key lime pie</h3>

      <h3>What else would I find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p>Canned cranberries <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-what-your-part-of-america-eats-on-thanksgiving/">are more common</a> in the Southeast than fresh cranberry relish. Much of the Southeast also celebrates <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/holidays-events/a-cajun-thanksgiving-feast-menu">its Cajun roots</a> on Thanksgiving with dishes like gumbo, crawfish, deviled eggs, and fried oysters.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>California: Sourdough stuffing</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.businessinsider.my/assets/placeholders/ap-image-placeholder.jpg"/>

      <p>There are many varieties of the California-based sourdough stuffing recipe. <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/northern-california-oyster-stuffing-5011">Some versions</a> are mixed with turkey sausage or fresh oysters, <a href="http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/artichoke-parmesan-sourdough-stuffing-350186">while others</a> are artichoke or kale-based.</p>
      <h3>What else would I find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p>Surprisingly, one of the more popular California side dishes for Thanksgiving is salad, often made with bright, fresh citrus and vegetables. <a href="http://www.delish.com/holiday-recipes/thanksgiving/a44887/signs-youre-having-a-california-thanksgiving/">Californians also prefer</a> their turkey grilled instead of baked or fried, and, of course, paired with local wine.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Pacific Northwest: Mushroom gravy</h3>

      <h3>What else would I find on this Thanksgiving table?</h3>
      <p>There’s no question that many Hawaiian Thanksgiving traditions are different than those of the coastal United States. Here, it’s not Thanksgiving without fresh poke or sashimi, and the turkey is often <a href="https://apps.ksbe.edu/kaiwakiloumoku/makalii/recipes/meat/kalua_turkey">smoked, kalua-style.</a></p>
