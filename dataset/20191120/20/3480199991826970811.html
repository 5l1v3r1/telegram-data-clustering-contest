      <p>Written and created by Joe Parham and Joe Markham and produced by Tiger Aspect, the show is expected to air on Sky One in spring 2020.</p>
      <p>It will be the pair’s first foray into scripted comedy.</p>
      <p>Parham and Markham said: “We can’t believe that something which has been knocking around inside our heads for so long has been brought to life by two of the funniest people in the country, along with a load of our other comedy heroes.”</p>
      <p>Commissioning editor for Sky Comedy Morwenna Gordon will executive produce the series.</p>
      <p>She said: “We are thrilled to have Mel and Sue back on our screens, in their first ever scripted comedy series.</p>
      <p>“We have a brilliant cast, featuring many well-known faces, in a number of unexpected and potentially life-threatening circumstances that Fran and Jamie find themselves in along the way.</p>
      <p>“Joe Parham and Joe Markham have created a world that’s ruthless, funny and heart-warming all at the same time.</p>
      <p>“The series joins a host of fantastic Sky original comedies we have coming to Sky One next year which we can’t wait for our audience to enjoy.”</p>
      <p>Tiger Aspect producer Arnold Widdowson said: “Hitmen is a real treat for Mel and Sue fans – a surprising version of the two that for all the thrill of the action still retains their hilarious and mischievous dynamic.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an absolute privilege and joy to work with such an iconic double act, and with our brilliant writers Joe Parham and Joe Markham, on a show that allows them to flex new muscles they never knew they had.</p>
      <p>“Mainly in their trigger fingers.”</p>
