      <p>Young people in Nigeria have been urged to participate fully in the country's democratic governance space and public service delivery.</p>
      <p>The advise was given by Nigeria's foremost activist, Hamzat Lawal during a town hall meeting organised by Connected Development and Action Aid Nigeria in Abuja, the Nigerian capital recently.</p>
      <p>Lawal, chief executive officer of CODE and founder of FollowTheMoney, an online community for passionate young people who are holding their government accountable in order to increase government service delivery across Africa.</p>
      <p>His words: <i>“As tax payers, it is your entitlement to enjoy service delivery as young people A lot of you who think you don't pay tax because you are not employed actually pay.</i></p>

      <p>
        <i>“You should show interest in how the government spend our resources always for the benefit of the society.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>He opined that young people must be active stakeholders, consulted and fully mobilised to influence public choices and implement government projects for the benefit of the society.</p>
      <p>He urged them to take interest in the budgeting processes of their council areas to cause elected officials to attend to their community needs.</p>
      <p>At the event, stakeholders comprising representatives of local council administrators, the national assembly and civil society, stressed the need for young people to ask relevant questions on how local council budgets are appropriated so as to check incidents of misuse.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>gathered that apart from the Federal Capital Territory, the townhall meetings were also held in Enugu, Kaduna and Lagos states.</p>
