      <h1>A DIY Dual-Screen Laptop That Doesn't Sacrifice the Keyboard Is My Perfect Portable</h1>

      <p>I rarely use an external monitor with my laptop for the simple fact that I don’t want to get used to all the extra screen space which isn’t available when I travel with my computer. My ideal solution to this problem would be exactly what Matt from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQo7nzH1sXVpzL92VesANw">YouTube’s DIY Perks channel</a> has created: a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2aY6cvk-WI&amp;feature=youtu.be">laptop with an extra screen</a> that <a href="https://theawesomer.com/diy-dual-screen-laptop/548508/">flips up to eye level</a> to double the size of your desktop.</p>
      <p>Companies have been dabbling with dual-screen laptops for quite a few years now. Back in 2008, Lenovo revealed its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-the-dual-display-works-in-the-ibm-thinkpad-w700ds-5118215">ThinkPad W700ds</a> which featured a second but considerably smaller screen that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r0ZlmLBCjQ">slid out of the side</a> of the mobile workstation’s main display. More recently, devices like the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/08/hps-omen-x-2s-is-proof-dual-screen-laptops-can-be-awesome/">HP Omen X 2S</a> and the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/asus-wildly-ambitious-zenbook-pro-duo-is-the-most-dual-screen-laptop-yet/">Asus ZenBook Pro Duo</a> have integrated a small secondary display into the laptop’s keyboard area, or in the case of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/microsoft-doubles-down/">Microsoft Neo</a>, have replaced the keyboard altogether with an extra display – but that’s not what I’m after.</p>
      <p>We’ve even seen laptops that automatically <a href="https://gizmodo.com/onkyo-dx-laptop-gives-you-two-screens-for-under-1000-5423424">deploy side by side screens</a> when opened, but that’s a deal-breaker for anyone who’s ever tried to use a laptop on a cramped plane, a crowded coffee shop, or even had to work while precariously balancing their computer on their lap. My ideal solution is a laptop with two screens stacked atop each other, and that’s exactly what Matt has created here – more or less. Given how thin modern flat-screen displays can be manufactured, a second flip-up screen potentially wouldn’t necessarily add a huge amount of thickness to a laptop. But given companies like Apple have billions of dollars to sink into R&amp;D to develop new hardware, while DIY Perks does not, Matt’s creation isn’t exactly svelte, but functionally it’s quite clever.</p>

      <p>After sourcing an LCD display and a controller board (necessary for it to interface with an existing laptop) for under $100 (£77) on eBay, aluminium panels were used to create a rigid backing for the second display, while a 3D printer churned out custom plastic bezels, a housing for the board, and a pair of hinges that allow the second screen to fold behind the main display for easy transport.</p>

        <i>Not exactly a piece of hardware Tim Cook would be proud to show off on stage. (Screenshot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQo7nzH1sXVpzL92VesANw">DIY Perks</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2aY6cvk-WI&amp;feature=youtu.be">YouTube</a>)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Given the laptop being upgraded lacked USB-C ports which could have been used to deliver both power and a signal to the second screen, a portable battery pack had to be used instead, which regrettably further adds to the bulk and thickness of this hacked machine. The results aren’t pretty, I can’t see myself performing similar surgery on my computer, but having a second screen that sits at eye level is a feature my horribly crooked spine would be eternally thankful for. More importantly, the added screen space doesn’t come at the cost of sacrificing the laptop’s physical keyboard: a trade-off I hope companies stop making.</p>
