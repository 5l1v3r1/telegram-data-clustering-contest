      <h1>Delhi: Rides made free, jump in number of women taking DTC bus</h1>
      <h2>On October 30, 35% of the total DTC ridership was made up of women, while the share was 27% in the case of cluster buses. Delhi has 3,781 DTC and 1,900 cluster buses.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:29:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sourav-roy-barman/" target="_blank">Sourav Roy Barman</a></address>
      <p>The number of women taking public buses in Delhi has seen a sizeable jump — from a daily average of 33% of the total ridership to 44% — after the implementation of the free rides scheme, according to official data.</p>
      <p>The share of women commuters in the total ridership figures has remained consistently above 40% since November 5, after the scheme that allows women to travel free on DTC and cluster buses was implemented. In fact, since November 11, there have been six occasions when Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) registered a 44% women ridership.<br/>The Delhi government has been emphasising that apart from ensuring safety, the scheme will help bring more women into the labour force, which stands at around 11% at the moment.</p>
      <p>On October 30, 35% of the total DTC ridership was made up of women, while the share was 27% in the case of cluster buses. Delhi has 3,781 DTC and 1,900 cluster buses.</p>
      <p>On November 19, the share of female ridership in DTC buses was 44%, while that in cluster buses was 38%. A transport department official said that women ridership in cluster buses may not have crossed 40% yet, but the substantial increase seen in case of DTC buses “was a positive”.</p>
      <p>“DTC buses cover more areas than the ones under the cluster scheme. These buses connect the urban and rural areas of Delhi. So the DTC ridership is more representative when it comes drawing a conclusive picture,” the official said.</p>
      <p>The figures crossed 40% at a time when odd-even car restrictions were in force. However, there has been no dip in the share since November 15, when the restrictions were lifted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in a setback, the Delhi Transport department’s tender to procure 385 electric buses, which were to be inducted in the cluster fleet, has failed as the bidders did not meet the required “technical qualifications”, another official said.</p>
      <p>The tender, which was floated in March, had received bids from around three private players. “Initially, not much happened due to the Lok Sabha elections. The evaluation of the bids started in August. It is definitely a setback,” the official said.</p>
      <p>The plan to get 1,000 low-floor AC buses, for which three separate tenders were floated, will also see a delay. While the tender for 400 AC buses has gone through and their delivery will begin next month, two separate tenders for 350 and 250 buses each of this category have failed.</p>
