      <p>A 29-year-old doctor allegedly committed suicide at her Gurgaon residence Monday, following which a case of abetment of suicide has been registered against her husband, who is a doctor at AIIMS.</p>
      <p>Sonam Motis, an anaesthetist at Fortis hospital in Gurgaon, was found lying on the floor of her room, Gurgaon Police PRO Subhash Boken said, adding that police are probing the contents of pill bottles found nearby. Her father, Onkar Lal Motis (64), alleged that Sonam’s husband, a resident doctor at AIIMS, was responsible for her death.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, he claimed: “The couple often fought over his lifestyle choices.” The husband’s phone remained switched off on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The two met at AIIMS in 2017 and got married in May 2018. “In January 2018, Sonam told me about him and we approved of the relationship. Since it was a love marriage, we believed they wouldn’t have too many problems,” said Onkar, a Kota resident and a retired BSNL official.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed that the FIR names both Sonam’s husband and his family.</p>
      <p>Onkar said that on the day of the incident, he called his daughter around noon. When she didn’t take his calls, he called police and the watchman. “We speak over the phone every day; she would tell me about how she was depressed… On Monday, when I called her, she didn’t pick up. I called the watchman, who then told me that Sonam hadn’t come out of her house since morning and wasn’t opening the door. I called police, and was eventually informed that she was dead.”</p>
      <p>Police said her body has been sent for a post-mortem to ascertain the exact cause of the death. “We are checking whether there was forced entry inside the house. No suicide note was found from the spot. A case has been registered against her husband and his family and we are probing the matter,” said PRO Boken.</p>
      <p>Onkar said that of late, Sonam had been living alone at a rented apartment in Gurgaon’s Sector 43, while her husband had left his house in South Extension and shifted to a hostel near AIIMS.</p>
