      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/ant-mcpartlin-way-keen-reunite-best-mate-declan-donnelly-im-celebrity-troubled-year-11169522/">Ant and Dec have been reunited on </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> – and that means we can expect the return of jokes about Dec’s height.</p>
      <p>The presenter’s stature has long been the subject of gags on the show, peaking in 2018 when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/fans-loving-ant-mcpartlin-back-im-celebrity-miss-holly-willoughby-11172667/">Holly Willoughby – who co-hosted the show</a> while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/didnt-ant-im-celebrity-last-year-holly-willoughby-11171456/">Ant was taking a year off</a> – coined the catchphrase: ‘He’s loads of fun and he’s five foot one.’</p>
      <p>All of which led to his Wikipedia page being changed accordingly – with that exact phrase – but how tall is Dec really?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>How tall is Declan Donnelly?</h3>
      <p>Dec is actually 1.68m tall – or 5 ft 5in in feet and inches.</p>
      <p>Dec’s height came into question last year when he was hosting with Holly, who is 1.7m tall – making her only marginally taller than Dec.</p>

      <p>However her choice of shoes could make her look a lot taller than him, and she appeared to be towering over him in the promotional photos for the show – leading to the jokes.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Holly’s quip on the season opener in 2018 led <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/19/im-a-celebrity-fans-hack-declan-donnelly-by-changing-his-height-on-wikipedia-after-holly-willoughby-mocks-him-8156869/">to Dec’s Wikipedia page being changed,</a> to read: ‘Declan Joseph Oliver Donnelly OBE (born 25 September 1975) is an English television presenter, producer and actor who is loads of fun and only 5’1.’</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The joke was picked up by former I’m A Celebrity winner Georgia Toffolo who quipped: ‘OMG someone changed Dec’s Wikipedia already.’</p>
      <h3>How tall is Ant McPartlin?</h3>

      <p>By contrast to Dec, Ant is 1.73m tall, making him 5ft 9in.</p>
      <p>Gags about height have never been far from I’m A Celebrity, with Ant and Dec describing 2017 contestant Dennis Wise as ‘a very small man’, even though he is actually 5ft 6.</p>
      <p>All of which was ultimately settled when Dennis was voted out of the jungle – and was revealed to actually be that little bit taller than Dec.</p>
      <p>Awkward.</p>
