      <p>John Legend is known for his music, while Stephen Curry is recognized for his skill on the basketball court.</p>
      <p>And now the musician and the athlete will be adding a side gig to their day jobs to become movie producers, with the pair teaming up to produce a new sports drama called “Signing Day”.</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/stephen-curry-john-legend-signing-day-1203410951/">Variety</a> </i>reports, Curry’s Unanimous Media and Legend’s Get Lifted Film Co. will partner with Sony Pictures for the new drama, with screenwriter Adam Hoff tapped to write the script.</p>

      <p>“Signing Day”, notes <i>Variety</i>, is one of the first films to be put into development under the first-look deal that the NBA star signed with Sony last year.</p>
      <p><i>Variety </i>compares “Signing Day” to “Jerry Maguire”, and “follows an extremely driven sports agent trying desperately to sign a young, coveted basketball star as her client. In her desperation and determination, she considers resorting to illegal and unethical means to book the client.”</p>
