      <h1>The Clippers needed Paul George more than they thought</h1>

      <p>Kawhi Leonard wasn’t heading to the Clippers until they were able to trade for Paul George.</p>
      <p>Yet the fact that the two have not stepped on the floor together shows why a second superstar was needed.</p>
      <p>After entering the season seemingly healthy after battling various injuries with the Raptors, Leonard has missed five of the season’s first 14 games, including the last three.</p>
      <p>“Last year I was going in with an injury I was dealing with the year before,” Leonard told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/30/blessed-with-kawhi-leonard-paul-george-clippers-still-dont-want-lose-gritty-identity/">Washington Post</a> at Clippers Media day. “It still was lingering. We knew that I had to be healthy throughout the season and into the playoffs. This year I’m feeling good, feeling way better than I was at the start of last season. There’s really no [load management] plan laid out yet to discuss.”</p>
      <p>Yet Leonard’s management of a <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2863326-report-kawhi-leonard-day-to-day-tests-reveal-no-further-damage-to-knee-injury">knee contusion</a> he suffered last week means the two have yet to share the court, and George has been thrust into a leading role after returning from shoulder injuries that sidelined him until last week.</p>
      <p>When Leonard sits this season, George — as he’s displayed in his first three games back — will be a world-class insurance policy tasked with maintaining the team’s place in a top-heavy Western Conference.</p>
      <p>Since his return from injury, George is scoring 29.3 points per game in just 24.3 minutes per night as the Clippers ease him back into action.</p>

      <p>George has also kept the Clippers afloat defensively, leading the team to a 99.4 defensive rating in 73 minutes on the court (which would be the best team mark in the league). In the remaining 599 minutes this season without George — including five games where the Clippers were missing Leonard as well — the team has been significantly worse on the defensive end, allowing 105.3 points per 100 possessions, which would push them outside of the top 10.</p>
      <p>That gap is the difference between a stingy underdog like last year’s Clippers team and the defensive behemoth that is expected to terrorize opponents when Leonard and George share the court.</p>
      <p>Leonard has become the face of the league’s load-management dilemma. He sat out 22 games last season for the Raptors, who had enough depth on their roster — led by point guard Kyle Lowry — to go 17-5 without him and land the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Leonard then put together a postseason for the ages in leading the Raptors to the franchise’s first championship.</p>
      <p>George, who has led the 9-5 team to two wins in his three games, gives Leonard the opportunity to take that type of time off again this season.</p>
      <p>While the Clippers have performed like a title contender with just Leonard on the court (outscoring opponents by 13.3 points per 100 possessions), the picture gets a lot uglier with both him and George on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>The Clippers’ most-used lineup without their two stars — Pat Beverley, Patrick Patterson, Landry Shamet, Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac — has been outscored by 7.3 points per 100 possessions in 30 minutes this season.</p>
      <p>Lineups with Montrezl Harrell have fared a lot better, but the Clippers are simply a much worse team if they’re ever forced to play without Leonard <i>and</i> George for an extended amount of time.</p>
      <p>If George’s job alongside Leonard is to elevate them to a championship contender, his job right now is to simply keep the wheels from falling off.</p>
      <p>While Leonard’s injury is considered “day-to-day,” his load management will likely result in George leading the team at various points this season.</p>
      <p>The early signs show that he’ll have little trouble keeping the team churning under those circumstances.</p>
