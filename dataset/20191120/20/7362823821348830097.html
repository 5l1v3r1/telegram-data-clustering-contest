      <p>A large food order at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">fast-food restaurant</a> reportedly resulted in one customer chasing another around with a knife.</p>
      <p>A woman was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly threatening and chasing her friend with a pocket knife outside of a Wendy’s in Nashville, Tenn. The pair reportedly got into an argument over the amount of food that one of them ordered.</p>

      <p>Julia Dueease drove her friend to the restaurant expecting the other woman to pay, <a href="https://www.wkrn.com/news/crime-tracker/warrant-woman-chases-friend-with-knife-after-argument-over-food-order-in-nashville-drive-thru/">WKRN</a> reports. According to police reports, the other woman became angry at Dueease for ordering too much food at the drive-thru.</p>
      <p>The pair reportedly pulled into a parking space and continued to argue. At this point, Dueease allegedly pulled out a pocket knife and told her friend to exit the vehicle.</p>

      <p>As she was getting out of the car, the unnamed woman claimed that she dropped a five-dollar bill. When Dueease picked up the bill, another argument erupted.</p>
      <p>Dueease allegedly threatened to kill her friend and then chased her around the car with the pocket knife. The unnamed woman eventually made it to a nearby gas station, where she called for help.</p>
      <p>Dueease was taken into custody on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

      <p>Tuesday's incident marks the latest in a string of violent altercations observed at fast-food restaurants. Most notably, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">Popeyes</a> customer in Wisconsin received an unexpected side of mayhem when a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/7-popeyes-employees-fired">wild brawl between employees</a> erupted moments after he walked into a Milwaukee location of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">the chicken chain.</a></p>
      <p>"Honestly, I wasn't even going to get the chicken sandwich," customer Richard Fourté told <a href="https://fox6now.com/2019/11/15/7-employees-were-terminated-vicious-brawl-at-milwaukee-popeyes-caught-on-cellphone-video/">Fox 6 Now</a> of his intended order when visiting Popeyes on Nov. 13. Fourté said he ultimately left empty-handed, as an “out of control” brawl between workers caused chaos.</p>
