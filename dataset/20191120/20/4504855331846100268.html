      <p>(CNN) — A 16-year-old who allegedly used a remote-controlled car to attempt to smuggle methamphetamine across the US-Mexico border has been arrested by US Border Patrol agents, the agency announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The teenager, a US citizen, was arrested Sunday after agents spotted him carrying two large duffel bags and ducking in-and-out of an agent’s view, US Customs and Border Protection <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/smuggler-uses-remote-controlled-car-transport-meth#">said in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>He was found hiding in thick brush along the border. When they searched him, agents found a remote-controlled car and 50 packages of methamphetamine, CBP said.</p>
      <p>The agency says the 55.84 pounds of methamphetamine seized has an estimated street value of $106,096.</p>
      <p>The teenager faces drug smuggling charges, the CBP statement said.</p>
      <p>“I am extremely proud of the agents’ heightened vigilance and hard work in stopping this unusual smuggling scheme,” said San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Douglas Harrison.</p>
      <p>A similar event occurred in August 2017, when agents arrested a 25-year-old man for attempting to smuggle drugs across the border <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/smuggler-using-drone-busted-border-patrol">with a remote-controlled drone</a>.</p>
      <p>The man was found with 13.44 pounds of methamphetamine, the agency said.</p>
