      <p>The BC Ferries fleet is expanding to take on two hybrid ships in their Island Class.</p>
      <p>Two hybrid electric vessels departed Constanta, Romania on Nov. 20 on a semi-submersible vessel to embark on a 10,305 nautical mile journey that will take 40-45 days.</p>
      <p>The journey includes one stop for refuelling and going through the Panama canal before coming to the ferries’ new home in B.C.</p>

      <p>The Island Class are battery-equipped ships designed for full electric operation. They are hybrid vessels set to bridge the gap until more charging infrastructure is in place on shore.</p>
      <p>BC Ferries will take over ownership of the ferries after a final inspection at Point Hope Maritime.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the ships will be sent to run the Powell River-Texada Island and Port McNeill-Alert Bay-Sointula routes by mid 2020.</p>
