      <p>As if <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482327/looks-like-kevin-feige-will-be-sticking-with-marvel-after-all">reigning as king over all things Marvel</a> wasn’t enough, Kevin Feige is also lending his talents to a galaxy far, far away. It was reported in late September that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481008/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-is-working-on-a-star-wars-movie">Feige is developing a new <i>Star Wars</i> movie</a>, and naturally there a lot of fans who are eager to learn what he’s bringing to the table. Whatever this <i>Star Wars</i> movie ends up being about, it sounds like we shouldn’t expect it to hit theaters for a while.</p>
      <p>Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy was recently asked how Kevin Feige came into the <i>Star Wars</i> mix, and this was her response:</p>
      <blockquote>Kevin has been a huge fan of <i>Star Wars,</i> and he’s made that pretty clear. And I think when he went off to do a couple of the <i>Spider-Man</i> movies, he realized that he could kind of step in and out of what he’s doing specifically with just Marvel. He talked to us, and he talked to the studio and said, ‘You know, is there any chance I could step in and do one of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?’ And I thought it was a pretty cool idea. So we’re just beginning to talk about what that might be and when that might be. But it’s a ways off.</blockquote>
      <p>So even though Kevin Feign has managed to carve out time to work on things other than the Marvel Cinematic Universe (<a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484842/mark-ruffalo-is-psyched-about-spider-mans-return-to-the-mcu">which Spider-Man is part of</a>, but Sony Pictures handles the making of his solo movies), it takes more time putting together a <i>Star Wars</i> movie than your average blockbuster. So per Kathleen Kennedy’s comment to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/lucasfilm-president-kathleen-kennedy-interview-rise-skywalker-future-star-wars-912393/">Rolling Stone</a>, don’t place your bets on Feige’s <i>Star Wars</i> movie arriving in the next several years.</p>
      <p>Kevin Feige has reportedly already figured out some of the specifics about what he wants in his <i>Star Wars</i> movie, like who he wants to play the lead role and what kind of role that will be. He’s also expressed excitement at <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484422/kevin-feige-reveals-what-hes-excited-to-explore-in-star-wars">“exploring new people and new places in that universe,”</a> but we’ll just have to play the waiting game to learn what he intends to deliver.</p>
      <p>Frankly, the cinematic future of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise following <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> is clouded in uncertainty other than there’s still a film scheduled for 2022. Originally the plan was for <i>Game of Thrones</i> showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to tackle a trilogy, which would unfold from 2022-2026. However, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483358/the-game-of-thrones-showrunners-are-no-longer-doing-a-star-wars-trilogy">the duo exited last month</a> to focus on their Netflix deal and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483534/game-of-thrones-creators-reportedly-left-star-wars-over-fear-of-toxic-fandom">reportedly avoid toxic fandom</a>.</p>
      <p><i>The Last Jedi</i> director Rian Johnson also has <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481963/wait-is-rian-johnsons-star-wars-trilogy-not-a-sure-thing">his own <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy in the works</a>, but according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but he is not involved with the movie that’s scheduled for 2022. That same report also states that Jon Favreau, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484827/the-mandalorians-jon-favreau-is-already-sharing-season-2-set-pics">who is currently working on <i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, is expected to become a bigger player when it comes to guiding the future of the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, but exactly how he’ll do so wasn’t specified.</p>
      <p>Supposedly there will be a <i>Star Wars</i> movie announcement made next January, after <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> has soaked up enough of the limelight. Whatever ends up being revealed to the masses, be it Feige-related or connected to another creative mind, we here at CinemaBlend will let you know about it.</p>
      <p>As for Kevin Feige, you can keep checking out his handiwork over in the MCU when <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476948/Which-Marvel-Reveal-Is-The-Most-Exciting-Ahead-Of-Phase-4-CinemaBlend-Weighs-In">Phase 4 launches</a> next May with <i>Black Widow</i>. He’s also working on Marvel’s upcoming Disney+ shows, starting with <i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</i> in late 2020.</p>
