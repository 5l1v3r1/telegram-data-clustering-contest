      </p>
      <p>The public beta was released on November 6.</p>
      <p>Apple's release notes for this update only mention the following new Networking feature:</p>
      <blockquote>Certain top-level domains (TLDs) such as <code>.dev</code> and <code>.app</code> are now in the Foundation <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession"><code>URLSession</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlconnection"><code>NSURLConnection</code></a> HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preload list. An app which uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/urlsession"><code>URLSession</code></a> to visit a matching URL will always navigate to the URL as <code>https://</code>, and never as cleartext <code>http://</code>. See the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Specification</a> for more information about HSTS. (56247242)</blockquote>

      <ul>
        <li>There are mixed reports that the notorious <a href="https://wccftech.com/ios-13-2-is-killing-background-tasks-way-too-frequently-are-you-affected-too/">RAM management bug from iOS 13.2</a> has been fixed in this update. In our testing, we found that the issue does not occur as often anymore. Safari tabs do not refresh when you switch between apps, like they happen on iOS 13.2, however, some third-party apps still do not work as expected due to this issue.</li>
        <li>Communication Limits are finally available in Screen Time with this update, even though it was originally supposed to be a part of iOS 13. The feature was removed during beta testing. With Communication Limits, parents can set limits on phone calls, FaceTime, Messages and iCloud contacts for their kids.</li>
        <li>If you do not like the new Memoji Stickers, you can now disable them by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboards and scrolling down to find the toggle.</li>
        <li>Haptic menu for messages has been updated.</li>
        <li>Apple Watch app icon has been updated.</li>
        <li><a href="https://wccftech.com/beats-solo-pro-wireless-headphones-announced-features-noise-cancelling-h1-chip-bluetooth-5-more/">Beats Solo Pro</a> do not play well with iOS 13.3 beta, because the operating system does not recognize them.</li>
      </ul>
