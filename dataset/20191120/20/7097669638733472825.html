      <h1>Biden just sent out a post-debate email hours before the debate starts</h1>

      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden is getting a little ahead of himself.</p>
      <p>Hours before the fifth Democratic debate was set to begin, Biden's campaign on Wednesday sent out a fundraising email obviously not intended for release until the debate ended. The message hit inboxes roughly eight hours early.</p>
      <p>"I'm leaving the fifth Democratic debate now," read the very first sentence of this email, sent long before the debate even started. "I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important." Well, he made clear why sending prepared emails at a time that actually makes sense is so important, at least.</p>

      <p>Spoiler alert: expect some more slams on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) from Biden this evening, something supporters were presumably supposed to have already seen before they read, "we need more than plans" in his email</p>
      <p>With the White House having <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/867641/white-house-accidentally-emailed-ukraine-talking-points-nancy-pelosi">accidentally sent</a> <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/871264/white-house-accidentally-sent-ukraine-talking-points-house-democrats-again">talking points</a> to Democrats at least two times in recent months, should Biden defeat President Trump in 2020, the White House tradition of totally incompetent email use may continue for years to come.</p>
