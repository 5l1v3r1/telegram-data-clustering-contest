      <p>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) — Syracuse University’s chancellor says reports that a white supremacist manifesto was sent to some students’ cellphones “was probably a hoax.”</p>
      <p>Kent Syverud told the University Senate on Wednesday authorities haven’t found anyone who directly received the screed, which had seemed to further a series of racist episodes on the central New York campus.</p>
      <p>Authorities said Tuesday they’d gotten reports that the document was posted in an online forum and that attempts were made to send it to students’ cellphones at a campus library Monday night via AirDrop. It’s a file-sharing service that lets iPhone users send files to iPhones or iPads near them.</p>
      <p>Officials said the manifesto appeared to be copied from one written by a man accused of killing 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in March.</p>
