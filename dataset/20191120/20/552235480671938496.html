      <h1>Parents warned wearing a coat in a car seat could put your child's life at risk this winter</h1>
      <h2>Children's jackets should be removed before being strapped in.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:02:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/, Blathin de Paor</a></address>
      <p>As temperatures plummet this winter in Scotland <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parents</a> are being warned against putting their children in the car still in their winter coats.</p>
      <p>This is because if your <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/children">child</a> is in their coat while strapped in there could be a large gap between them and the straps.</p>
      <p>If you are involved in an accident your children may not be restrained properly if you crash.</p>
      <p>Instead for safety reasons your child's coat should always be removed, and you should place the coat or a blanket over them to keep them warm instead, RSVP Live reports.</p>
      <p>Safety experts have warned that parents may actually save their child's life by doing so.</p>

      <p>The Good Egg Safety video shows a boy being strapped in a seat while wearing his coat. When he takes the coat off and puts the straps back on, they are loose.</p>
      <p>Margaret Bolt, Good Egg Safety car seat expert, says: "Without adjusting the harness and doing the buckle back up, you can see how much movement there is in those straps and how much slack there in fact still is.</p>
      <p>"Now if they wear a winter coat in a car seat and the car is involved in a crash, all the padding in the coat will be compressed and effectively this is how loose the straps are and the child could be ejected from the seat."</p>
      <p>So it is very important to ensure you take your child's coat off when strapping them in even if you're in a rush or stressed out.</p>
