      <p>Donald Trump sought Wednesday to distance himself from <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/trump-never-discussed-ukraine-aid-freeze-with-me-us-diplomat-gordon-sondland-263472">US envoy Gordon Sondland</a>, after he told an impeachment hearing he had followed the president's orders in seeking a "quid pro quo" deal with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"I don't know him very well. I have not spoken to him much," Trump told reporters at the White House, before reading from notes which he said showed that he wanted "nothing" from Kiev.</p>
      <p>In an October 8 tweet, Trump had described his ambassador to the European Union as "a really good man and great American."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, US diplomat Gordon Sondland said that President Donald Trump never spoke to him about stalled military aid to Ukraine or any alleged link to Trump's demands for political investigations.</p>
      <p>"I never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement of (the investigations)," Sondland told a congressional impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>"I don't recall President Trump ever talking to me about any security assistance, ever," he added.</p>
