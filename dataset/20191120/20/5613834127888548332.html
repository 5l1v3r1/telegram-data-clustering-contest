      <h1>James Wan Assembling New Take on “Frankenstein”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:20:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>Hiding within an article on <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/">Variety</a> (that has since been removed) was news that Universal Pictures is meeting with directors for a new take on <b>Mary Shelley</b>‘s <b>“<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/tag/Frankenstein/">Frankenstein</a>”</b> that will be produced by <b>James Wan</b> (<i>Aquaman, Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious</i>) and his Atomic Monster.</p>
      <p>It was rumored back in July of 2016 that Javier Bardem was in talks to star as Frankenstein’s monster in Universal’s “Dark Universe”, which had its plug pulled after the lackluster debut of<i> The Mummy</i> with Tom Cruise.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what direction Wan will take, but we’re all still hoping to see the return of the Bride in some way shape or form. The tale of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster has been told to death in dozens of films, and even CBS has a new series based on Shelley’s characters.</p>
      <p>This story comes on the heel of news that Universal hired <i>Rocketman</i> director Dexter Fletcher to direct <i>Renfield</i>, a monster movie centered on Dracula’s henchman. Leigh Whannell’s <i>The Invisible Man</i> appears in theaters next year, while <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3591442/paul-feig-teases-james-whale-ish-universal-monsters-movie-dark-army/">Paul Feig is currently developing a monster movie for the studio</a>.</p>
