      <h1>What Jose Mourinho has said about Liverpool and Man City's title challenge</h1>
      <h2>Spurs have appointed the former Manchester United boss as their new manager</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:21:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/aidan-mccartney/" target="_blank">Aidan McCartney</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is the new Tottenham Hotspur manager.</p>
      <p>He has returned to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> after being appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's replacement.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had spent the season working for Sky Sports on their Super Sunday which included covering <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on several occasions.</p>
      <p>His last appearance came as Liverpool moved eight points clear at the top of the Premier League with an impressive 3-1 victory over Man City.</p>
      <p>Mourinho offered his verdict on Klopp's side at full-time as the Reds move clear of the reigning Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>He said: “The message you give the players is a similar message to what Jurgen is giving his team and, if you’re in Pep’s position, the message is the same message that he is giving his players.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just the message but the feeling. If you’re behind, you have to feel like you can reach them, if you are top with an advantage, you have to feel like it is not over. But I’m not there, I’m here and here, from my position, I think it’s done.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-news-transfers-live-qatar-17284632">Jose Mourinho reaction</a> and latest Liverpool news and transfer rumours</h3>
      <p>“Unless something dramatic happens in terms of an injury situation that breaks the team but I think Liverpool are a complete puzzle.</p>
      <p>"They play exactly the way that I think is adapted perfectly to the quality of the players, what they do tactically to leave Mane and Salah in that position, the work that Firmino does for them, the work that Wijnaldum does, the puzzle is really, really good.</p>
      <p>“City are capable of winning seven, eight, nine matches in a row but I don’t see how Liverpool can lose the nine-point advantage.”</p>
