      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Massachusetts' highest court has vacated a murder conviction because of language used by the prosecution during trial.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Judicial Court ruling issued Tuesday states the first-degree murder conviction against 31-year-old Jonathan Niemic must be vacated because the lead prosecutor made improper statements during closing arguments.</p>
      <p>Niemic was convicted in the 2010 stabbing death of 34-year-old Michael Correia in New Bedford. The men had a dispute over a woman they had both dated.</p>
      <p>Niemic's attorney argued the killing was self-defense.</p>
      <p>The high court said the lead prosecutor appealed to jurors' emotions, used facts that weren't in the evidence, misstated facts and improperly stated his opinion.</p>
      <p>It was the second time Niemic's murder conviction was tossed.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors can either accept a verdict reduction to manslaughter or retry Niemic.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are reviewing the ruling.</p>
