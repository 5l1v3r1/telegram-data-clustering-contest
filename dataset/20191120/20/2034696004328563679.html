        <b>A follow-up to the DC blockbuster remains just an idea at this stage</b>

      <p>A sequel to the new<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/joker-review-a-melancholic-psychodrama-punctuated-by-splashes-of-shocking-violence"><i> Joker</i></a> film is not happening – yet.</p>
      <p>The DC origin story, released in October, recently became the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/joker-is-now-the-most-profitable-comic-book-movie-ever-2566179">most profitable comic book movie ever</a> as well as <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/ryan-reynolds-reacts-as-joker-overtakes-deadpool-to-become-biggest-r-rated-movie-ever-2561459">highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Earlier today (November 20)<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255"><i> The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> stated that Warner Bros. had officially signed off on <i>Joker 2</i>. Now, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/"><i>Deadline</i></a> reports that this is false, writing “at this point there are no deals for a sequel, nor even any negotiations”. This is not to say that a sequel will never happen; rather, nothing has been confirmed to date.</p>
      <p><i>THR</i> originally reported that, after <i>Joker</i>‘s massive opening weekend (the film <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-secures-biggest-october-box-office-opening-of-all-time-2554473">secured the biggest October box office opening of all time)</a> director Todd Phillips spoke to Warner Bros. in a meeting about making more DC films with him at the helm.</p>
      <p>But <i>Deadline</i> reports that “multiple sources said no such October 7 meeting between Phillips and [Warner Bros. film chief Toby] Emmerich occurred, and that Phillips doesn’t want to follow <i>Joker</i> by overseeing other DC character films.”</p>

      <p>Why so sad? Joaquin Phoenix applies the famous Joker makeup</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-sequel-possible-director-joaquin-phoenix-2540518">Phillips, however, talked about a <i>Joker</i> sequel</a> even before the new film was released, and has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joker-director-todd-phillips-details-direction-potential-sequel-2567644">recently been discussing where a follow-up movie could go narrative-wise</a>, telling <i>The Los Angeles Times </i>that a sequel would “have to have some thematic resonance”.</p>
      <p>“It couldn’t just be this wild and crazy movie about the ‘Clown Prince of Crime,’” he said. “It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that [‘Joker’] does.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/joaquin-phoenix-says-hes-open-potential-joker-sequel-2555233">Phoenix has also said that he’s open to starring in a <i>Joker</i> sequel</a>, stating: “I wouldn’t have thought of this as my dream role. But now, honestly, I can’t stop thinking about it.</p>
      <p>“I talked to Todd a lot about what else we might be able to do, in general, just working together, but also specifically, if there’s something else we can do with <i>Joker</i> that might be interesting.”</p>
