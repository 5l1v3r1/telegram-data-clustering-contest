      <p>Star Plus has confirmed the launch date of its much awaited cookery reality show ‘MasterChef India’.</p>
      <p>The show produced by Endemol Shine Group, returns after a three-year gap. The new series, which kicks off on Saturday 7th December, will run for 26 episodes. In India, the show will air at 21:30, while in UK, it has been slotted at 19:00 – incidentally replacing ‘TED Talks India Nayi Soch’. The latter will move to 21:30 in the UK.</p>
      <p>Endemol Shine India CEO Abhishek Rege said, “MasterChef is the world’s most popular cookery show and we are thrilled that India will once again be part of the success story after a three-year break. The culinary culture in India is renowned worldwide for its treasure trove of spices and flavours and with an impressive line up of judges and casting for contestants underway, we firmly believe the show has all the right ingredients to be a sure-fire hit for Star Plus.”</p>
      <p>The judging line-up for ‘MasterChef India’ includes India’s finest chefs including Michelin star award-winning Vikas Khanna; Ranveer Brar, whose passion for food made him the country’s youngest executive chef and India’s first Michelin star winner, Vineet Bhatia, who gained fame with his Michelin starred restaurants including Zaika and Rasoi.</p>
