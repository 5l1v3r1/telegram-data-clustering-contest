      <h1>RHOC – Tamra Judge’s Husband Eddie Says The Show Is ‘Not Reality’ After Fans Slam Him For Insensitive Comments In Recent Episode</h1>

      <p><i>Real Housewives of Orange County</i> star <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/rhoc-tamra-judge-shows-her-support-for-meghan-king-edmonds-amid-divorce-drama-334818/">Tamra Judge’s</a> husband Eddie has found himself under fire from fans after he made comments about Tamra’s son Ryan Vieth on a recent episode that some viewed as insensitive. But Eddie isn’t keeping quiet and has instead fired back, telling fans that the show is fake and fans need to back off.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Blast</i>, a number of <i>RHOC</i> fans were disgusted after a recent episode that featured Tamra talking about Ryan going to therapy, and she expressed her concern that Ryan could be suicidal.</p>

      <p>Tamra revealed that she went to therapy with Ryan, and she told Eddie that she was struggling emotionally because it was hard to hear Ryan’s negative feelings about himself. She said she feels like she has failed her son, who she gave birth to when she was just 17 years old.</p>
      <p>“It just makes me want to die,” said Tamra. “I struggled with depression, I was sad, I had no self-worth. To hear Ryan say that, it scares me. I worry that one day Ryan might commit suicide. That’s my biggest fear.”</p>
      <p>But, after Tamra told Eddie about what went down in therapy with Ryan, Eddie said in his confessional that when you’re struggling with childhood issues as a man, you’re not a man, and that infuriated fans, who immediately went to social media to express their disgust with his supposedly insensitive comment.</p>
      <p>Some fans called Eddie “cruel” and “careless,” while others called him a “douche” who lacked empathy.</p>
      <p>In response, Eddie posted a statement on his Instagram Story telling fans that they need to understand that the show isn’t real, and they need to back off.</p>
      <p>“Time to move on… just because you see it on TV doesn’t mean it’s real!” wrote Eddie. “I’m happy most of you understand this and those that do not, you need to learn how it works. Reality TV is not Reality. These shows are designed to get maximum reaction from the viewers.”</p>

      <p>Eddie went on to compare reality shows to scripted shows, saying that there are writers and scripts for reality TV shows. He pointed out that people don’t go after villains on scripted shows and call them names because someone wrote a script, and he believes fans should have the same approach to reality TV.</p>
      <p>“I stand behind what I said and never did I say that people with a mental illness need to man up. I understand mental illness. I also understand when someone uses mental illness as a scapegoat,” said Eddie.</p>
      <p>He also said that Ryan is not mentally ill, but he is struggling with life. Eddie noted that you don’t have to be mentally ill to feel depressed, but a reality TV show will figure out how to get max reaction by editing a touching moment in such a way to get viewers to keep watching.</p>
      <p>“If they do not, then we have no show. Get it? The end!” wrote Eddie.</p>
      <p>New episodes of <i>Real Housewives of Orange County</i> air Tuesday nights on Bravo.</p>
