      <p>The CEO of influential magazine publisher Conde Nast says he hopes Apple News+ will be a success, but so far "the jury is out," and his company hasn't seen the expected impact.</p>

      <p>Roger Lynch, CEO of publisher Conde Nast, says its magazines —including Vanity Fair and Conde Nast Traveler —have yet to see the success on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple+News+">Apple News+</a> that was expected. The company, whose titles regularly reach 84 million readers across print and digital services, had an initial burst of new subscribers but that interest failed to continue. <br/><br/><a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/conde-nast-roger-lynch-apple-news-plus-1203409485/">According</a> to <i>Variety</i>, Lynch was talking at the <i>Recode</i> Code Media conference about issues including both publishing and streaming. <br/><br/>"I hope Apple News+ is wildly successful," he said. "[However] I think the jury is out."<br/><br/>Conde Nast was one of the original publishers on Apple News+ when it launched in the US and Canada in March 2019. Lynch says that, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/14/apple-news-fails-to-bring-in-new-subscribers-despite-impressive-launch">as reported on <i>AppleInsider</i></a> within the first 48 hours of that launch, Apple News+ signed up 200,000 subscribers, but has struggled to grow further.<br/><br/>Apple News+ subscriptions begin with a free month's trial, but Lynch said he was specifically talking about paying ones, so people who continued after that initial period. Users pay a single subscription and publishers earn part of their revenue through a share of that fee —the rest through advertising and selling direct subscriptions —though Lynch declined to say how much the company had earned.<br/><br/>He did speak to an issue that has previously concerned other publishers, that of the comparatively low price Apple News+ subscription undercutting other firms. Lynch was asked about how it affects publishers trying to build their own services, and whether it meant users could circumvent paywalls.<br/><br/>"We haven't seen that effect," he said.</p>

      <p>Lynch joined Conde Nast in April, so after the firm negotiated terms with Apple for the service, but says the publisher could ultimately quit Apple News+ if necessary. "Over time, we have options," he said.<br/><br/>While Apple News+ has been <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/25/apple-debuts-subscription-apple-news-integrating-magazines-other-publications">available in the US and Canada</a> for most of the year, it only began in the UK and Australia countries in September. Publishers in Europe have reported that the service is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/07/apple-news-is-beginning-to-pay-off-for-some-european-publishers">paying off for them</a>, if not dramatically.<br/><br/>"We're seeing quite good traffic from Apple News," said one <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/08/07/apple-news-is-beginning-to-pay-off-for-some-european-publishers">unnamed publishing executive</a>, "but the revenue is not show-stopping."<br/><br/>Nonetheless, rival organisations are seeing the potential value of a news service and CNN is reported to be planning its own <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/23/cnn-to-compete-with-apple-news-via-own-news-subscription-service">competitor to Apple news+</a>, as is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/07/06/mozilla-teases-launch-of-apple-news-competitor">Mozilla</a>.</p>
