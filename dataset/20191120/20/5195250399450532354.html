      <h3>The upcoming next-gen Hyundai Creta gets the new design theme along with luxurious interior design</h3>
      <p>Hyundai commenced works on the next generation Creta last year based on the same platform from Kia Seltos that launched recently and becomes India’s best selling SUV with monthly sales crossing 12,000 units mark. Early this year, the company has revealed the iX25 at the Auto Shanghai and launch recently in the Chinese market. It is basically the Creta for our market which due for launch at upcoming 2020 Delhi Auto Expo with BS6 petrol &amp; diesel engines.</p>
      <p>Here are the top 5 changes expected on the next-generation Creta.</p>
      <h4>1. Front Design</h4>
      <p>Hyundai has completely redesigned the 2020 Creta as it gets the latest design language and the major changes are at the front as the signature Hyundai grille is big. The 2020 Creta gains split headlamp setup in which LED DRL is placed on top and projector headlamps are positioned below it with a new bumper along with the fog lamps at the lower part. The side turn indicators are placed on the hood along with the DRL’s.</p>

      <h4>2. New Alloy wheels</h4>
      <p>Currently, the company is offering the Creta with 17-inch alloy wheels and we can expect the 2020 model to come with 18-inch two-tone alloy wheels. The design theme of the alloy wheel is different from the one which is currently available on the Creta and seems inspired from recently launched Hyundai Venue.</p>

The centre console gets a vertically placed huge touchscreen infotainment and the company has given a gloss black finish for the centre console, which gives a premium feel for the cabin. The instrument cluster is also expected to be completely digital.</p>
