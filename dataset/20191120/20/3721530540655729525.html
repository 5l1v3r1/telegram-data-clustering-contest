      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:18:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:18</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Lee</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><i>Pokémon Go</i></a> is closing out the year by bringing back all the Community Day Pokémon back for one special weekend.</p>
      <p>On Dec. 14 and 15, all the Community Day Pokémon from this year will spawn in the wild more frequently from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m. in your local time zone. Pokémon from 2018 Community Days will spawn in raids during this time period.</p>
      <p>Any Pokémon evolved during this time period will also learn their respective Community Day moves, so if you nabbed any of these Pokémon with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/2019/4/1/18290722/iv-individual-values-check-find-appraisal-system-stats">good IVs</a> or missed your chance to get the move, you should remember to evolve them during this time period.</p>
      <p>From 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. in your local time during these Community Days, there’ll also be doubled catch Stardust, doubled catch XP, and half egg hatch distance when eggs are put into Incubators. A handful of featured Pokémon will get an even bigger spawn rate during this time.</p>
