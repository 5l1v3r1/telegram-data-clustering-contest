      <p>Many walked down memory lane and remembered infamous Pakistani journalist Chand Nawab. In a similar video, Chand Nawab was interrupted by passengers during his reporting session on a railway station.</p>
      <p>Nawab, however, made several attempts to sign off but failed hilariously. The viral video of Chand Nawab also inspired a scene in a Bollywood movie called “Bajrangi Bhaijaan”.</p>
