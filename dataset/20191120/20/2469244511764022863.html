      <p>A Devon family are backing a national campaign to fund travel for young cancer patients after their son was diagnosed with a rare cancer when he was just two years old.</p>
      <p>Adam and Natalie Holder, who live in the small village of Ashford, just outside Barnstaple, initially faced a 200-mile round-trip from their home to a hospital in Bristol after their son Toby was diagnosed with cancer in his liver, which had also spread to his lungs and some bones, in September 2017.</p>
      <p>His first cycle of chemotherapy, which lasted six weeks, was in Bristol, and his following chemotherapies were given at Exeter hospital as it was closer to home.</p>
      <p>However, it was still a 112-round mile journey and each trip cost £45. While he was receiving chemotherapy Adam and Natalie spent up to £1,500 on fuel and vehicle maintenance alone, without taking into account parking, food and other irregular living costs.</p>

      <p>Toby, now aged four, has been in remission since April 2018, but the family continue to travel to Exeter hospital for follow-up blood tests and various scans which will continue for another 18 months.</p>
      <p>They estimate that since his diagnosis they have spent around £3,000 on getting Toby through his treatment and remission.</p>
      <p>Adam, who works in a marketing agency, said: “We experienced extra costs that we wouldn’t have incurred normally – pretty much all costs were unexpected.</p>
      <p> “We would not have coped without CLIC Sargent. They made the difference for our family between coping and just not coping at all. We wouldn’t have been able to travel up from North Devon to Bristol every day.</p>
      <p>“It’s a two-hour journey each way so travelling each day wasn’t an option. We would have been at hotels or B&amp;Bs and we couldn’t have afforded to do it. That’s got to be £50 to £100 a night and we were there for extended periods.”</p>
      <p>When Toby was diagnosed with cancer, Adam, 38, and Natalie, 34, were told he had been born with it.</p>
      <p>Adam explained: “As the cancer had been with him since he was in the womb, there were not many signs until a weeks or so before diagnosis when he passed out in the bath.</p>
      <p>“Then my wife noticed a lump under his ribs when he was in the shower after swimming, and finally he passed out again when dropping our daughter at school.</p>
      <p>“The cancer he had was very rare. While they had a treatment protocol for it they didn’t know how he or the cancer would react. Until we were halfway through the treatment we had no idea whether or not it was working.</p>
      <p>“It was very scary not knowing and just hoping it was working. His liver was full of tumors and we were told that he may need a transplant. Luckily it wasn’t too bad at the end and is continuing to heal.”</p>

      <p>During those difficult times, Adam and his family were supported by a CLIC Sargent social worker who provided practical, emotional and financial support.</p>
      <p>They were also referred them to one of CLIC Sargent’s Homes from Home, CLIC House, where families can stay for free to be near their child. This meant they were both able to be Bristol-based throughout Toby’s cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>Revealing the financial toll it had on the family, as well as emotionally, Adam said: “We were fortunate that my employer was very supportive and continued to pay me throughout. I know that not all families get this.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of pressure though as all the costs were on top of our regular living expenses, and it did mean we spent far more than we had coming in.</p>
      <p>“My wife had left her job not long before Toby was diagnosed. It was very fortunate as there is no way she could have worked while he was so unwell.</p>
      <p>“When he was neutropenic (a low level of white blood cells help the body fight infection) we had to keep him away from anyone with the slightest cold.</p>
      <p>“If he had a temperature of 38 or above he had to go straight into Barnstaple hospital and then to Exeter in an ambulance. This happened a few times as he was at his worst through the winter cold season.”</p>
      <p>Research from CLIC Sargent shows one in three families are struggling to afford to pay their rent or mortgage. Some families are even threatened with eviction from their homes because they are left to choose between travelling to hospital or paying for basic, day-to-day essentials. </p>
      <p>Although it didn’t come to that for the Holder family, and the financial impact is now manageable, they are determined to help others struggling with the costs of travelling to hospital for their child’s treatment by sharing their story.</p>
      <p>They are also backing CLIC Sargent’s campaign calling for all party leaders to commit to a Young Cancer Patient Travel Fund if they become the next prime minister.</p>
      <p>Adam said: “If you’re a family living in London, Bristol or any major city, a travel fund isn’t really something you’d worry about because it’s not hard to go. But for families that live in remote parts of the UK, they can be a big distance away from hospitals where childhood cancers can be treated.”</p>
      <p>Adam and Natalie, who also have a seven-year-old daughter Ella and another child on the way, are hoping their future will be one with as few hospital trips as possible.</p>
      <p>Adam said: “Toby is about 18 months in remission now. They said that if it is going to come back it would be within three years, so we’re about halfway through.</p>

      <p>“He’s doing really well. His bloods are done every two months and he has X-rays and scans every three months.”</p>
      <p>CLIC Sargent claim families are facing an average round-trip of 60 miles to get to and from hospital for treatment, spending at least £180 a month on petrol. Other families are forced to pay out hundreds in taxi fares or public transport costs.  </p>
      <p>Laura Cowcher, CLIC Sargent fundraising engagement manager for North Devon, said: “At a time when families are already going through the unimaginable stress of their child being diagnosed with cancer, it’s not right that they should have to worry about whether they can afford to take their child to hospital for life-saving treatment.</p>
      <p>“Parents are relying on financial grants from charities or borrowing money from friends and family just so that they can put fuel in the car and get their child to treatment. It is an unacceptable reality that cancer costs for young cancer patients and their families in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Now has to be the end of the road for travel costs. I’m calling on the kind people of North Devon to get behind our campaign and write a message to all party leaders, asking them to commit to a Young Cancer Patient Travel Fund.” </p>
