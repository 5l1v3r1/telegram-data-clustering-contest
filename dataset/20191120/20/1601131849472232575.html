      <h1>Samsung announces 4th Experience Store in the US, right next to Apple’s</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:07:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Mihai M.</a></address>
      <p>In anticipation of the holiday season, Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-experience-stores-palo-alto-this-holiday-season/">announced the opening</a> of a fourth <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/samsung-experience-store/">Experience Store</a> in the United States. The new store is located in San Francisco’s Bay Area at the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, and it’s scheduled to open its doors to the public on December 12.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto is also the home of one of the more renowned Apple Stores, and with the opening of its fourth Experience Store in the country, Samsung wants to expand upon its strategy and begin catering to small and medium businesses as well regular consumers.</p>
      <h4>The fourth Samsung Experience Store in the US will offer new services for business customers</h4>
      <p>The company revealed that it’s going to use the new Samsung Experience Store not only to allow customers to test new products first-hand but to also offer more services to small and medium business owners in the Bay Area. Therefore, Experience Store visitors will have the opportunity to test Samsung’s latest products first-hand, while enterprise customers will be able to buy new devices for their employees and learn more about Knox solutions with the help of Samsung representatives.</p>
      <h3>Samsung is bringing the challenge to Apple</h3>
      <p>The company claims that it first realized there’s an unsatisfied demand from business customers after it launched the first three Experience Stores in the US. They <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/02/15/samsung-opening-three-retail-stores-usa-february-20/">opened earlier this year</a> on February 20 and they are located at The Americana at Brand in L.A. California, in Long Island, and Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>The fourth Experience Store set to open on December 12 is located very close to Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, not to mention the Apple Store located in the same venue, and it’s interesting how this very same Experience Store will be the first in the US to offer solutions to regular consumers as well as business owners. Coincidence? Probably not. The holiday shopping season is closing in fast, and it looks like Samsung is willing to take the fight to Apple’s home turf this year. The store will also focus on exploring and explaining the benefits of 5G to customers, so the company is seemingly preparing to fight hard for its 5G market share in the US come next year.</p>
