      <p>A <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Belfast">Belfast</a> city centre apartment complex may have to be demolished due to structural defects, the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=High+Court">High Court</a> has heard.</p>
      <p>More than 50 owners of flats in the Library Square development are taking a class action over the alleged flaws.</p>
      <p>Located in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kent+Street">Kent Street</a>, the nine-storey building opened in 2006.</p>
      <p>Writs were issued by the owners in 2016 seeking compensation against the builders and engineers.</p>
      <p>The claims are for losses due to alleged structural and design defects.</p>
      <p>In court on Wednesday it was indicated that the case was close to a resolution. But there is still dispute on whether the complex can be economically repaired.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Gerald+Simpson">Gerald Simpson</a> QC, for the builders, said: “The only issue is whether or not the apartment block has to be taken down or can be remediated.”</p>
      <h3>Compensation</h3>
      <p>Some experts in the case believe the issues cannot be fixed, the judge was told.</p>
      <p>A hearing on the level of compensation to be paid out to the apartment owners is due to get under way later this month. However, a last-minute wrangle among insurance companies involved in the case has led to a delay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Justice+Horner">Mr Justice Horner</a> gave the parties more time to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>Adjourning the case to the start of December, he told lawyers: “You can either settle it in the next two weeks or it’s going on for trial.”</p>
