      <h1>Twitter lets some lucky users schedule tweets on desktop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:15:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/brenda-stolyar/" target="_blank">Brenda Stolyar</a></address>
      <p>Twitter is testing a new tool for select users. Unfortunately, it's not an edit button.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Twitter took to its own platform to announce a new scheduling feature on desktop.</p>
      <p>In the GIF below, the new tool looks pretty straight forward. Craft your tweet, tap on the icon with the three dots, and select Schedule Tweet. Then, choose the date and time you want the tweet to go live, tap Continue followed by Schedule, and you're all set.</p>

      <p>The feature was originally exclusive to <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/11/07/tweetdeck-beginners-guide/">TweetDeck</a>—Twitter's dashboard app that displays tweets, hashtags, trends, and more, in columns. That way, you can see more tweets at once. With the ability to link multiple accounts, it's mostly used by content creators and social media managers.</p>
      <p>But aside from the GIF, Twitter remains vague with the details. It's unclear whether you can schedule multiple tweets, if/when the feature is coming to the mobile app, and who the lucky beta testers are. </p>
      <p>While the company promotes it as a handy "time-saving" feature, it does put TweetDeck's future into question.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>We too can't help but wonder if this is the company's way of discretely migrating TweetDecks' features over to the main Twitter app before announcing its demise.</p>
      <p>We've reached out to Twitter for additional information and will update this story if the company responds. </p>
