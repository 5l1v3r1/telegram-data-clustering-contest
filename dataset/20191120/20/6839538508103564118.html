      <p>Smoke from the Yorketown bushfire drifted across Adelaide this morning, causing a thick haze that alarmed many metropolitan area residents and prompted health and poor visibility warnings.</p>
      <p>The MFS was deluged with calls from worried members of the public but the weather bureau said they should not be alarmed as the foggy conditions were predominantly smoke coming from the <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/a1f5e89b087c3978b7f7e1fddbd96a2a">Yorketown bushfire on Yorke Peninsula</a>.</p>
      <p>Paul Bierman, Senior Meteorologist for BOM SA, said when the wind changed to a westerly direction this morning, the smoke was pushed towards Adelaide.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably going to stay fairly hazy for the morning,” Mr Bierman said earlier.</p>
      <p>“As the morning progresses the smoke should dissipate... and we should see some sun in the afternoon.”</p>
      <p>By mid morning the smoke had cleared and sun was shining.</p>
      <p>Motorists were urged to take care as visibility caused by the smoke and raised dust was reduced.</p>
      <p>The Department for Health and Wellbeing also warned people with heart or chest conditions to stay indoors.</p>
      <p>Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said high levels of bushfire smoke exposure could aggravate conditions such as asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases.</p>

      <p>“We also know that high levels of smoke inhalation can be associated with an increased risk of cardiac events such as heart attacks,” Assoc. Prof Spurrier said.</p>
      <p>“We advise people with these medical concerns to avoid exposure to the smoke, stay indoors, take medication as usual and avoid exercise in areas of high dust.</p>
      <p>“If you are inside and have air-conditioning running, switch the air flow to recycle or recirculate to reduce the smoke coming inside.</p>
      <p>“It is also a good idea to avoid vigorous activities, especially if you have asthma or other chronic lung or heart conditions.”</p>
      <p>South Australians received much-needed relief from Wednesday’s scorching temperatures when a cool change swept the state early this morning.</p>
      <p>According to the weather bureau, the 25 to 40 km/h north-westerly winds shifted to cooler south-westerly 25 to 45 km/h winds through central districts before sunrise then moved through the eastern districts later in the morning.</p>
      <p>After reaching a record breaking 41.6C yesterday, and a stifling night in which temperatures hovered around the low 30s overnight, 21C is forecast for the CBD today.</p>
