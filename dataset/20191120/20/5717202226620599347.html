      <h1>Moise Kean admits he ‘does not know’ truth about potential Everton exit</h1>
      <h2>Everton only signed the striker in the summer from Juventus.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:15:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>It has been a difficult start to life at Everton for Moise Kean since<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/everton-sign-moise-kean-juventus"> his reported (The Guardian) £29 million </a>summer move from Juventus. </p>
      <p>He has struggled for goals and was recently dropped for disciplinary reasons. A move back to Serie A is already being mooted in the Italian press. AC Milan and Sampdoria have been mentioned, as have Roma.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/16-63433453/kean_alla_roma_petrachi_allassalto_ecco_il_piano/">As reported by Corriere dello Sport,</a> Roma are readying a loan deal until the end of the season, at which point they would buy Kean for a fee in the region of €23 million (£19.7m). </p>

      <p>The report suggests Everton have a ‘willingness to negotiate’ as they are ‘very disappointed’ with Kean and want to minimise the potential financial damage of him continuing to struggle on Merseyside and leaving down the line.</p>
      <p>But what does Kean say?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/19-63560653/kean_roma_io_mi_alleno_al_resto_ci_pensano_gli_altri_/">Speaking to Rai Sport, as relayed by CdS,</a> after scoring twice in Itay under-21s 6-0 win over Armenia, he admitted he does not know about the rumours, suggesting it is in the hands of others.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I don’t know what’s true, I concentrate on training, the rest is for others to think about</b>
        <b>.” </b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>By others, he will mean his agent Mino Raiola and the Everton hierarchy. Undoubtedly Everton will want to give Kean as much of a chance as possible but will also be wary of the large fee they paid for the Italian. </p>
      <p>As for Raiola, <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/milan-torna-l-idea-kean-per-gennaio-contatto-con-raiola-la-situa-34490">it was reported by Calciomercato </a>last week that he was already looking for a new club for Kean, as he was unhappy with his start to life in England. </p>
      <p>It will certainly be interesting to see if Kean does remain at Everton by the end of January. </p>
