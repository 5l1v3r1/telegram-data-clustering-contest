      <p>Over two thousand members of the All Progressive Congress, APC, has decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Oviorie-Ovu, Ethiope East local government area of Delta state.</p>
      <p>Those who decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party were received last weekend by the state party chairman, Barr. Kingsley Esiso, during the 10th year remembrance ceremony of late Chief Humphrey Irikefe Idisi.</p>
      <p>The leader of the APC members who spoke to newsmen at the country home of late Chief Humphrey Idisi, Oviorie-Ovu, Chief Sunny Akpobi aka Escobar said he and his family were once in PDP and that they are now returning back to their former home.</p>
      <p>Akpobi said PDP has been his party before he left but now he has not only returned back on his own but with multitude of APC members across the local government and that he hope they all will be accommodated as others are still coming.</p>
      <p>He said he, his family and followers left APC because of internal crises and lingering issue of leadership that has rocked the party, adding that they sat and took a decision that they cannot continue be in a party where there is no focus and direction.</p>

      <p>The Delta state PDP Chairman, Barr Kingsley Esiso, while receiving the APC members said they are overwhelmed that they have realized their mistakes and have decided to come back to the ruling party, saying that in PDP there is no first to come that everybody is treated equal, assuring them that the message will be convened to the governor.</p>
      <p>Esiso said though the defection of the APC members coincided with our brother’s late father’s 10th year anniversary ceremony, late Chief Humphrey Idisi, an Oil and Gas icon, but it also go a long way to show that Rt. Hon. Lovette Idisi has paid his dues in the party.</p>
