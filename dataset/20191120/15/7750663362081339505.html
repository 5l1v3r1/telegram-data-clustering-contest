      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alisson-becker/"><b>Alisson Becker</b></a>'s early-season injury thrust <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adrian/"><b>Adrian</b></a> into the starting role at Anfield, and it is thought that the Reds are looking for a new long-term back-up to their current number one.</p>
      <p>Cakir, who <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/transfer-talk/news/liverpool-tracking-trabzonspor-goalkeeper_370318.html">has been linked</a> with a switch to Anfield over the last few months, is a target for the Champions League holders, according to the stopper's agent <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/engin-kirkpinar/"><b>Engin Kirkpinar</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"Liverpool are one of four English sides keeping close tabs on Ugurcan. Liverpool are among the sides interested in Cakir, and they have been monitoring his progress," Kirkpinar told <i>Turkish-football</i>.</p>
      <p>"Trabzonspor value Cakir as being worth a minimum Â£18m, and will not sell him in January. An end-of-season move could however be on the cards."</p>
      <p>The Turkey international has conceded 24 times in 18 appearances for Trabzonspor during the 2019-20 campaign, managing just one clean sheet in the process.</p>
