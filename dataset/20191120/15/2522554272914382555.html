      <h1>Taylor Bennett Connects With LGBTQ Community by Empowering People to Be Different</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:23:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/trentfitzgerald/" target="_blank">Trent Fitzgerald</a></address>
      <p>For the past few years, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/taylor-bennett/">Taylor Bennett</a>, brother of Grammy-winning rapper Chance The Rapper, has been pushing his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/07/taylor-bennett-be-yourself-ep/">Be Yourself</a> campaign, which encourages people to love who they are and to never conform to outside pressures.</p>
      <p>"It's just about empowering people to [feel that] it's OK to be different," says the 23-year-old rapper, who's part of the Swisher Sweets Artist Project Class of 2019. "I think that very often artists [and people in general] we find ourselves in situations where the general opinion weighs so much pressure on us that we feel like we have to be someone else and I think that's one of the biggest problems with the world."</p>
      <p>This is why <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/07/taylor-bennett-be-yourself-ep-interview/">Taylor</a>, who <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/01/taylor-bennett-bisexual/">came out as bisexual in 2017</a>, continues to advocate for self-love and awareness in his music.</p>
      <p>"With my music, I've always wanted to bring people together," he states. "So, you know, I wanted to stand on something that, you know, I'm very strong about, which is being a member of the LGBTQ community. I'm openly bisexual, I'm African-American. I've experienced and, you know, kind've been in some situations and walked in different shoes that I think a lot of people want insight on and people might not have a platform to speak on."</p>
      <p>The Chicago MC, who cites Kendrick Lamar and Twista as his major music influences, showcases his lyrical skills on his second EP, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMERICAN-REJECT-Explicit-Taylor-Bennett/dp/B07RT8RM29?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07RT8RM29"><i>The American Reject</i></a>, which he released via his <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/10/taylor-bennett-starts-indie-label/">independent label Tay Bennet Entertainment</a> in May. The eight-song collection boasts guest appearances from Ty Dolla $ign, Bianca Shaw, Mr. Hudson, Chance The Rapper and more.</p>
      <p>When asked what sets himself and his brother Chance apart as artists, Taylor believes it's how they choose to express themselves creatively.</p>
      <p>"From a music standpoint, I think me and Chance are pretty similar artists," he explains. "I think we share a lot of the same views because one, we are family, but then two, we were both raised the same way. I think something that's definitely different is Chance's music is a little bit more on the artsy side. My music is a little bit more of the MC, critical thought, conscious-kind-of vibes to it. And a little bit more rock and roll."</p>
