      <p>According to <i>Daily Mail</i>, the two European giants have joined the long list of clubs interested in Rennes youngster Eduardo Camavinga.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old, who was born in Angola but moved to France at the age of two, has made headlines in Ligue 1 this season.</p>
      <p>He was named UNFP Player of the Month in August following his superb start to the 2019/20 campaign, which included a Man of the Match-performance against giants Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

      <p>Camavinga turned 17 this month and had attracted interested from the likes of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, but United and Barca reportedly joined the long list of suitors.</p>
      <p>"If it only depended on me, I would like to keep him for another 10 years," Rennes president Olivier Letang told <i>Telefoot</i>.</p>
      <p>"But there's a market and also the player's desires, we will find a balance later on, probably at the end of the season."</p>
