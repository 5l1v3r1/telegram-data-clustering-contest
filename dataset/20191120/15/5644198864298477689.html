      <p>BEIJING: China's foreign ministry on Wednesday (Nov 20) summoned a top US diplomat over the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-rights-bill-passed-us-senate-protests-12109450">Senate's passing of a Hong Kong rights Bill</a>.</p>
      <p>It warned of "strong" countermeasures against the United States should the legislation be signed into law.</p>

      <p>"We strongly urge the US side to immediately take effective measures to prevent this bill from becoming law" and stop meddling in China's internal affairs, the statement said.</p>
      <p>"Otherwise, the Chinese side will take strong measures to resolutely counter it, and the US side must bear all the consequences," it added.</p>
      <p>The US Senate unanimously adopted legislation on Tuesday supporting "human rights and democracy" in Hong Kong and threatening to revoke its special economic status.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers also approved a measure that would ban the sale of tear gas, rubber bullets and other equipment that have been used by security forces to suppress pro-democracy protests for nearly six months.</p>

      <p>A US embassy spokesman said Klein "relayed that we are watching the situation in Hong Kong with grave concern" during the foreign ministry meeting.</p>
      <p>The Senate's Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would require the US president to annually review the favorable trade status that Washington grants to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>It also mandates sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials who commit human rights abuses including "extrajudicial rendition."</p>
      <p>The Senate "sent a clear message to Hong Kongers fighting for their long-cherished freedoms: We hear you, we continue to stand with you and we will not stand idly by as Beijing undermines your autonomy," Republican Senator Marco Rubio said.</p>
      <p>Passage of the bill marks "an important step in holding accountable those Chinese and Hong Kong government officials responsible for Hong Kong's eroding autonomy and human rights violations."</p>
