      <p>Lewis Capaldi has received his first Grammy nomination in a year dominated by rising stars Lizzo, Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X.</p>
      <p>The Scottish music star received a songwriting nod for his breakthrough hit Someone You Loved, which has topped the charts in both the UK and the US, along with co-writers Tom Barnes, Pete Kelleher, Benjamin Kohn and Sam Roman.</p>
      <p>Capaldi’s song was a sleeper hit and finally reached number one last month after 24 weeks, making him the first Scottish artist to achieve the US chart feat in nearly 40 years.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old – who jokingly refers to himself as “America’s sweetheart” – will compete with Always Remember Us This Way from A Star Is Born, Bad Guy by Billie Eilish, Bring My Flowers Now by Tanya Tucker, Hard Place by HER, Lover by Taylor Swift, Norman F****** Rockwell by Lana Del Rey and Truth Hurts by Lizzo in the song of the year category at the US awards ceremony, which will take place in January.</p>
      <p>Another British artist to receive a nod is Ed Sheeran, whose latest album No.6 Collaborations Project is up for best pop vocal album.</p>
      <p>But the Grammy nominations were dominated by pop and R&amp;B singer and rapper Lizzo, who received the most nominations overall with eight.</p>
      <p>Among her nods are album of the year for her breakthrough record Cuz I Love You, record of the year and the song of the year songwriting award – both for Truth Hurts – and best new artist.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old star has also been included in the best pop solo performance category for Truth Hurts, and the best R&amp;B performance category for Exactly How I Feel featuring Gucci Mane.</p>

      <p>Eilish, 17, has received six nominations along with 20-year-old rapper Lil Nas X.</p>
      <p>The pair are both nominated in the best new artist category and album of the year – Eilish for her chart-topping debut When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and Lil Nas X for his debut EP 7.</p>
      <p>Eilish will also compete with the likes of Beyonce, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande in the best pop solo performance category for her single Bad Guy.</p>
      <p>Lil Nas X, whose debut single Old Town Road has topped the charts both in the UK and his native US, is also up for best pop duo/group performance alongside Billy Ray Cyrus, who featured on the song.</p>

      <p>Music star Alicia Keys, who will host the Grammy Awards, hailed the category for being comprised of a diverse and “really powerful group of artists” after reading out the names during the live nominations announcement.</p>
      <p>British artists FKA twigs and the Chemical Brothers will also compete against each other for best music video, for Cellophane and We’ve Got To Try respectively.</p>
      <p>The Grammy Awards will take place on January 26 2020 in Los Angeles.</p>
