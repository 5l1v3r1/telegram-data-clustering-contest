      <p>German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Heiko Maas says the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine's territory should continue after 2019.</p>
      <p>"We support negotiations on gas transit through Ukraine. We believe that transit should continue after 2019," he said a joint press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko in Kyiv on November 19.</p>
      <p>Maas emphasized he wants to dispel certain speculations around the "gas" topic that have arisen recently.</p>
      <p>"I want to dispel certain speculations that have been spread in recent days. The German Bundestag adopted the <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10755675-ukraine-welcomes-implementation-by-bundestag-of-eu-gas-directive.html">European Gas Directive</a> exactly as we promised," he said.</p>
      <p>"We want to be a good and reliable partner for Ukraine in the future, and we support the Ukrainian government on its path of reforms," Maas summed up.</p>
