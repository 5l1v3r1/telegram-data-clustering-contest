        <b>The Fortnite v11.20 update included game files for three weeks of challenges. Take a look at what’s coming next to Fortnite Chapter 2.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fortnite v11.20 brought <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-v11-20-update-leaked-skins-and-cosmetics/27874/">a ton of leaks</a> and the first appearance of <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-v11-20-update-official-patch-notes-revealed/27875/">Fortnite patch notes</a> since Chapter 2 began. Included in those leaks were three weeks of challenges that will be coming to the game.</p>
      <p>According to some of the data-mined files, we’ll have<a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-end-date-has-been-extended/27880/"> a lot more time to finish</a> these challenges than we originally thought. Here are the upcoming Fortnite challenges courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/lucas7yoshi">@Lucas7Yoshi</a> on Twitter.</p>
      <h3>Week 7: Trick Shot</h3>

      <p>The Trick Shot challenges should go live soon, and while most of these will be unlockable as you play, you’ll have to try for a few of them.</p>

      <p>“Eliminations while at 50 Health or less” seems annoying, but it will be relatively easy to complete in Team Rumble. You’ll need a guide for the hidden ‘T’ location as well as the Pipeman, Hayman, and Timber tent locations, but we’ll have you covered when the challenges go live.</p>
      <h3>Week 8: Dive</h3>

      <p>Epic are back on their BS with the Dive challenges. This is one of the more grind-heavy weeks of challenges we’ve seen this season, as we’ll have to complete swimming trials at Lazy Lake and Hydro 16.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>We’ll also have to get hip-fire kills and complete several other specific challenges that will require us to go out of our way. This is an annoying week.</p>
      <h3>Week 9: Chaos Rising</h3>

      <p>Weeks eight and nine for Fortnite Chapter 2 are bringing us back to the old Battle Passes with time trials and skydiving through rings. We’ll also have to use ziplines in this one, which are relatively scarce around the new map.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>By week 9, all of the Fortnite letters will have been collected. After that, it looks like we’ll start to find XP drops in the loading screens. These challenges might be a tad annoying, but we’ll keep you posted with our guides.</p>
