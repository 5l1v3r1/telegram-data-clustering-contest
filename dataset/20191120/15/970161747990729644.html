      <p>Ranger the German shepherd is two – but you’d be forgiven for thinking he’s still a puppy.</p>
      <p>He has pituitary dwarfism – which means he looks young for much longer than is normal for his breed.</p>
      <p>Ranger was diagnosed with a parasite called giardia and his owners initially thought that was why he was smaller than the rest of the litter.</p>
      <p>After recovering from the infection, his owners noticed Ranger, who lives in Phoenix, Arizona, wasn’t growing at the same rate a German shepherd should.</p>
      <p>They took him to their vet who thought he might have the pituitary dwarfism mutation.</p>
      <p>Shelby Mayo, who is Ranger’s guardian, said: ‘When we originally got Ranger from the breeder, he was smaller than all his other littermates, but we figured that was because he had a parasite.</p>

      <p>‘In the weeks following we took him home and he was parasite free but later on ended up getting a parasite called giardia.</p>

      <p>‘At the same time, we also discovered that Ranger had a large infection on his neck.</p>
      <p>‘We were eventually able to get the infection under control, fast forward a few months later we were finally able to get rid of giardia.</p>
      <p>‘During this time Ranger remained very small, the vet had suspected that he may have pituitary dwarfism, a genetic mutation.</p>

        <figcaption>After sorting out some health conditions, he’s now doing well (@ranger_thegshepherd/SWNS)</figcaption>

      <p>‘But we were still sceptical as this condition is very rare.</p>
      <p>‘Over time Ranger still did not get much bigger, and at this point, we are certain he does have this condition.’</p>
      <p>Although the condition makes him look cute, it has also caused various health issues including shedding fur and flaky skin caused by hypothyroidism.</p>
      <p>But his owners and some of his online followers have helped with treatment. and he now has his health issues under control.</p>
      <p>After a few more months we got him neutered and that’s when we started to see big changes.</p>
      <p>Shelby adds: ‘He lost his appetite, started to lose weight, lost almost all of his fur, and had extremely dry and flaky skin.</p>

      <p>‘Many people on our Instagram page warned us that pituitary dwarfs can have many medical issues, but up until that point we hadn’t experienced any.</p>
      <p>‘One of our followers ‘Guardians Farm’ is a small company that makes handmade soaps, lotions, etc and they sent us goat milk soap, which ended up helping Rangers skin immensely.</p>

      <p>‘At the same time, another one of our followers who also has a Dwarf German Shepard told us to get his thyroid levels checked as many dwarfs suffer from hypothyroidism.</p>

      <p>‘So our vet checked his thyroid levels and sure enough, he was low, this can cause hair loss and a loss of appetite.</p>
      <p>‘After getting Ranger on Levothyroxine and using this soap his fur grew back and the dryness went away.’</p>
      <p>Now Ranger is healthy and loves playing with his sisters Hazel the Labrador and fellow German shepherd, Jessie.</p>
      <p>He’s become a star on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ranger_thegshepherd/">Instagram</a> with over 65,000 followers.</p>
