      <p>Wolfgang Puck has revealed the names of the Golden Knights players he’s partnering with in the rebranding of his Downtown Summerlin restaurant, along with the name and additional details on the project.</p>
      <p>The celebrity chef is joining forces with Alex Tuch, William Karlsson, Deryk Engelland, Reilly Smith and Shea Theodore to create Wolfgang Puck Players Locker. It will occupy the space that is now Wolfgang Puck Bar &amp; Grill, just a short walk from the Golden Knights’ practice facility, City National Arena.</p>
      <p>The new venture, which is expected to launch by the end of January, is described as “an inclusive, family friendly community restaurant for all Vegas Golden Knights fans.” It will include a new menu focused on “traditional sports fare” and a redesigned beverage program. The interior will also be redesigned to accommodate a floor-to-ceiling display of more than 100 custom glass lockers that fans can rent to store their favorite high-end spirits.</p>
      <p>“We are thrilled to be partnering with members of the Vegas Golden Knights here in Las Vegas, the new hockey capital of the world,” Wolfgang Puck says in a news release announcing the venture.</p>
      <p>The Wolfgang Puck Bar &amp; Grill will remain open through mid-January, with the makeover expected to last about a week.</p>
