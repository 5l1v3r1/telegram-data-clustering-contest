      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 20 — Continental confirmed today it would slash 5,500 jobs by 2028, as the German car parts giant seeks massive savings to confront a stuttering global economy and weaker demand for combustion engines.</p>
      <p>The jobs cull affecting Germany, Italy and the US would support Continental’s “urgently needed technological transition and thus the strengthening of our competitiveness and future viability”, CEO Elmar Degenhart said.</p>
      <p>The company has set itself the goal of saving €500 million (RM2.3 billion) annually from 2023.</p>
      <p>The drive comes as Germany’s mighty car industry — employing 800,000 people — is battered by global trade conflicts, stricter emissions limits and a costly switch to electric and autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>In its statement, Continental said it would close plants in Roding, Germany and Newport News, Virginia by 2024 as it stops making hydraulic components for petrol and diesel engines.</p>
      <p>Around 520 jobs will be lost in Roding, and 720 in Virgina.</p>
      <p>By 2025, Continental will axe 1,800 posts at its German plant in Babenhausen.</p>
      <p>By 2028, 750 more jobs will go in Pisa, Italy and 850 in Limbach-Oberfrohna, Germany due to the discontinued hydraulic components manufacturing.</p>
      <p>The latest round of job cuts come on top of a cull announced in September that will see Continental scrap 650 jobs in North Carolina and 270 in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Continental, with a global workforce of 240,000 people, stressed in its statement that some employees would be offered a chance to retrain “for other tasks” to find alternative roles in the group.</p>
      <p>Last month, the group reported a net loss of €1.99 billion for the third quarter of 2019, and forecast a full-year loss as well. — AFP</p>
