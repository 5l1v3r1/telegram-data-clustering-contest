      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> viewers were heaping praise on a heartwarming interview from the show about a married couple with a very remarkable story.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> met Barbara and Jane. who have stayed married despite Jane transitioning from male to female.</p>
      <p>Barbara initially thought Jane was having an affair when she found women’s clothes hidden away in their wardrobe, before her then-husband Jane actually surprised her by coming out to her as transgender.</p>
      <p>‘It certainly wasn’t [what I was expecting],’ Barbara said of Jane’s confession. ‘I was a bit relieved. This wasn’t as scary as losing [our] relationship.’</p>

      <p>In another tender moment that captured viewers hearts, Jane explained her fears prior to her transition about her secret being discovered.</p>
      <p>‘Trans people have two great fears,’ she said. ‘Fear of rejection by those they love, their family and friends, and fear of humiliation by other people.</p>
      <p>‘It’s only when you get the courage to come out…and when you do, life is suddenly in colour instead of in black and white.’</p>
