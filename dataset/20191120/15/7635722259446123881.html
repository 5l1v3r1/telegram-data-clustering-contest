      <h1>Ireland slips in global LGBT safety poll</h1>

        <b>Ireland's reputation among LGBT holidaymakers has fallen slightly, according to a new global poll.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gallup asked 1,000 Irish participants 'Is the city or area where you live a good place or not a good place to live for gay and lesbian people?'</p>
      <p>In 2017, 84% of respondents said it was a "good place", while the latest 2018 poll saw 82% of people say the same thing.</p>
      <p>It is part of a wider survey using data from a variety of international sources, which makes up an <b><a href="https://www.asherfergusson.com/lgbtq-travel-safety/">'LGBTQ+ Danger Index'</a></b> for 150 countries.</p>
      <p>The index, compiled by travel website Asher &amp; Lyric, is calculated using eight factors - such as legalised same-sex marriage, criminalisation of hate-based violence and illegal LGBTQ+ relationships and propaganda/morality laws.</p>
      <p>Ireland stands at 15th overall, beating other nations such as Australia, Germany, Hungary and Italy for perceived LGBT safety.</p>
      <p>The top five countries are Norway, Portugal, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Finland.</p>

      <p>Countries at the bottom of the index include Nigeria, Qatar, Yemen and Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>The index notes: "There are some places on the planet where it's perfectly ordinary to kiss or hold hands with a same-sex partner in public, but in other places, that action could result in fines, imprisonment, hard labour, whipping, or, in some cases, death.</p>
      <blockquote>"These countries where homosexuality is illegal are also often severe human rights violators, usually penalising male/male sexuality and/or trans women most harshly."</blockquote>
      <p>"Unfortunately, some countries where it's illegal to be gay or trans also happen to be popular vacation spots.</p>
      <p>"For instance, it's illegal to be gay in Jamaica; the 'buggery law,' which is leftover from the colonial era, allows for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison including hard labour."</p>
      <p>Jamaica was called 'the most homophobic place on Earth?'<b> <a href="http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1182991,00.html">by <i>Time</i> magazine </a></b>back in 2006.</p>

      <p>The index also says that those looking for trans- and gay-travel-safe countries should "reconsider" destinations like Malaysia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Myanmar, and Egypt - as well as some of the more popular beaches in the Caribbean, like Saint Lucia and Barbados.</p>
      <p>While the index also says that 45 of 67 countries that have illegal same-sex relationships were part of the former British Empire.</p>
      <p>The authors say: "This isn't a coincidence. In almost all cases, the laws outlawing consensual gay sex were put into place under British rule and were left in place following independence.</p>
      <blockquote>"India is an example country that has only in 2018 managed to annul Section 377, a British colonial-era law prohibiting 'unnatural acts,' in order to legalise consensual gay sex."</blockquote>
      <p>Another country that does not rank highly on the list is the United States.</p>
      <p>"One reason for that is, of course, that there is a great deal of variation in gay rights depending on the state you're in.</p>
      <p>"There are also no constitutional or broad protections for LGBTQ+ rights under federal law in the US.</p>
      <p>Also, in some states, LGBTQ+ youth do not have access to helpful information, with these so-called 'no-promo homo' laws counting in the 'propaganda/morality' category.</p>
      <p>"The US might have come far, but it has a long way to go in terms of LGBTQ+ rights, especially for young transgender people."</p>
      <p>The US ranks 24th overall on the index.</p>
