      <h1>Liverpool's stunning new £50m training ground in Kirkby takes shape</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool began work on the new facility last year and it remains on course to be completed in time for next summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:15:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Toby Durant</a></address>
      <p>Work at Liverpool’s new Kirkby training facility is picking up steam.</p>
      <p>The European champions have a long history of turning local talent into world-class players, with the current squad boasting more than a few home-grown heroes.</p>
      <p>That feeder system is only set to improve when the new Kirkby training facility comes online.</p>
      <p>Work began on the 9,200 square metre facility in September 2018 and is on pace to be completed on time in summer 2020.</p>
      <p>The facility will bring the first team and development squad together in one location, yet the impressive training ground will also give each part of the whole the space it needs.</p>

      <p>The state-of-the-art facility will comprise of two gyms, a hydrotherapy complex, specialist sports rehabilitation suites, TV studios, press conference facilities and three full-size pitches. Everything you need to create a team that can conquer both the Premier League and Europe.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s twitter account provided a look at the development of the area as well as impressions of what the inside of the facility will look like when it finally opens.</p>
      <p>This move takes Liverpool away from their iconic Melwood home, but the benefits of the new training ground are sure to outweigh any historic feeling they leave behind.</p>

      <p>Included in the project of the new training complex is the redevelopment of the Eddie McArdle community pitches at the north end of the site, which has now been completed and handed over to the local community.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the project, Liverpool’s Chief Operating Officer Andy Hughes said; “It has always been our aspiration to provide a clear pathway for progression for our youngsters from the club’s Academy to the First Team, and the two facilities are now intrinsically linked.</p>

      <p>“Work at the training ground is on track for completion in summer 2020 when will see the first team and youth football operations come together on one site for the first time in the club’s history.”</p>
      <p>It is this link that should worry other teams in the Premier League. While Liverpool have flexed their financial muscles to bring in players like Alisson and Naby Keita recently, their ability to produce world-class home-grown players like Joe Gomez and Trent Alexander-Arnold has helped push them back to European glory, and just maybe that elusive first Premier League title.</p>
