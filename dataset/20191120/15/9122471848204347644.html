      <h1>Charles Barkley Apologizes For “Inappropriate” Comment To Female Reporter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:53:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Late Tuesday night, a reporter accused former NBA star and current analyst Charles Barkley of threatening to hit her.</p>
      <p>Axios reporter Alexi McCammond called out Barkley on Twitter for his alleged actions.</p>
      <p>“Just FYI Charles Barkley told me tonight ‘I don’t hit women but if I did I would hit you,’ and then when I objected to that he told me I ‘couldn’t take a joke,'” <a href="https://twitter.com/alexi/status/1197011837767827458">McCammond tweeted Tuesday night</a>. “There are almost no times I will beak an OTR [off the record] ‘agreement’ but this is not OK.”</p>
      <p>Not long after McCammond’s tweet went viral, Barkley apologized for his “inappropriate” comments.</p>
      <p>“My comment was inappropriate and unacceptable. It was an attempted joke that wasn’t funny at all. There’s no excuse for it and I apologize,” Barkley said in the statement.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time Barkley has been in hot water for inappropriate comments.</p>
      <p>His apology comes nearly 30 years after Barkley was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-26-sp-4120-story.html">forced</a> to apologize for telling reporters after a win, “This is a game that if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids. Did you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That’s because she knew I wasn’t going to beat her.”</p>
      <p>It’s unclear if Turner plans any further punishment for the former NBA star.</p>
