      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:54:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Mikey Smith, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mikey-smith/</a></address>
      <p>A legalised cannabis tax would draw £1.5 billion to fight crime, the Lib Dems have said.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson's party confirmed they would create a regulated cannabis market if they won the election - as they slammed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> and the Tories' "prohibitionist attitude to drug use."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> ' manifesto, launched today, says the party would draw on emerging evidence on models from the US and Canada.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health would lead on drugs policy, rather than the Home Office - and the party pledged to invest more cash in addiction services and support for drug users.</p>
      <p>Licensed outlets would be permitted to sell cannabis to adults over the age of 18, with limits placed on how strong the weed can be.</p>

      <p>The party say this would help to "break the grip of the criminal gangs" on drug distribution.</p>
      <p>Launching the manifesto, Ms Swinson said: "This manifesto is a bold plan to build a brighter future for our country, and that starts with stopping <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>“Labour and the Conservatives can’t offer the country a brighter future because they both want Brexit.</p>
      <p>“We know that will be bad for our economy, bad for our NHS and bad for our environment."</p>
      <p>She added: “Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and invest in our mental health services, give free childcare to working parents, put 20,000 more teachers into classrooms and take ambitious action to tackle the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>“Our politics has been dominated by the two, tired old parties for too long.</p>
      <p>“This election provides an opportunity to change the future of our country and build a brighter future with the Liberal Democrats.”</p>
