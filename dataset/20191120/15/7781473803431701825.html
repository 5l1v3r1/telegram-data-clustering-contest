      <h1>2019 LA Auto Show: Mini JCW GP unveiled with 306PS</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:02:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Mini has taken the wraps off its fastest road-going car yet at the ongoing 2019 LA Auto Show. The Mini JCW is only the third such car to come from the brand after the JCW GT kit from 2006 and the last-gen GP from 2013. Only 3,000 units will be made of the two-door hatch.</p>

      <p>The 2.0-litre four-cylinder twin-scroll turbo petrol has been updated with new model-specific enhancements like a reinforced crankshaft, new pistons, connecting rods, and a vibration damper with enhanced cooling. A new turbo, air intake and oil sump help improve outputs further.  This helps bump up power by 76PS from the standard JCW to 306PS between 5,000 and 6,250 rpm. Torque stands at 450 Nm from 1,750 to 4,500 rpm. This lets the GP get from 0 to 100 kmph in 5.2s and reach a 265 kmph top speed.</p>

      <p>Extensive changes have been made to other components too. There are a new exhaust and heat management system, reinforced chassis, a revised suspension system lowered by 10mm and larger brakes.  Aero changes include a new front lip, front apron with larger intakes, a double-wing rear spoiler and carbon-fibre reinforced plastic wheel-arch bits.</p>

      <p>In terms of styling, the JCW GP gets a Racing Grey metallic body colour contrasted with a Melting Silver roof. There is bespoke gloss black trim, GP logos, and red highlights all around. On the inside, the GP is a two-seater and gets more red, black and silver trim. Mini has used 3D printing for the numbered plaque and new steering wheel components. Paddle shifters have been provided too.</p>
