      <p><b>PARISÂ (AP)</b> - French investigators are seeking to determine which dogs bit and killed a pregnant woman in a forest during a hunt with hounds last weekend.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor in charge of the case, Frederic Trinh, said the autopsy showed that the 29-year-old woman died of bleeding as a result of multiple dog bites.</p>
      <p>DNA tests have been made on 93 dogs, including the five owned by the victim.</p>
      <p>The woman's body was found on Saturday by her companion in the forest of Retz, northeast of Paris, where she was walking one of her dogs.</p>
      <p>He told BFM television Wednesday that she called him to say she was concerned about the presence of so many other dogs.</p>
      <p>When he arrived at the scene, he said he saw about 30 dogs coming toward him.</p>
