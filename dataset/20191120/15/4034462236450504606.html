      <p>It's been 50 years since Dodge first launched the original <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger">Challenger</a>. That's an occasion worth celebrating, and that's just what FCA is doing at the 2019 LA Auto Show this week with the launch of the new 50th Anniversary Edition.</p>
      <p>"Editions," plural, we should say, because the Challenger specials will be offered in an array of powertrains and trims, including the Challenger GT, R/T, R/T Scat Pack, and R/T Scat Pack Widebody. Each features a body-colored Shaker hood, which is being offered on the Scat Pack Widebody for the first time. And there's a range of other enhancements to go with it.</p>

      <p>All versions get a special Nappa leather and Alcantara interior with Sepia stitching, real carbon-fiber trim, a special instrument cluster, and of course special 50th-anniversary logos inside and out.</p>
      <p>Together with the celebratory trim, Dodge is also introducing a new paint option called Gold Rush. Only 70 individually numbered examples of each of the four models will be offered in Gold Rush and each of the six other "high-impact paint" colors: Frostbite, Hellraisin, Sinamon Stick, TorRed, F8 Green, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/dodge-is-reviving-one-of-its-best-muscle-car-colors-of-all-time">Go Mango</a>. All told, that makes for 1,960 units, in honor of the year in which the original Challenger first hit the scene.</p>

      <p>The package adds an extra $4,995 to the sticker price. And though the special edition won't be offered on other models like the base SXT or the all-wheel-drive GT, the "already heavily equipped" <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/dodge/challenger-srt-hellcat">SRT Hellcat</a> and Redeye will get the special anniversary badges.</p>
      <p>"2020 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Dodge Challenger, one of the most storied muscle cars in history," said Tim Kuniskis, head of FCA passenger cars. "That history was built on a few key things: big attitude and big muscle, loud colors and loud exhausts, and an enthusiast community that is as unique and diverse as our special editions. So, to commemorate the 50th, we're celebrating with a cool new special edition that checks all of these boxes."</p>
