      <p>Jim Cornette has come under fire after NWA were forced to pull their latest episode of Power following his racist remark during a match.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old commentator was calling the contest between Nick Aldis and Trevor Murdoch when he made his offensive statement.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to describe how tough Murdoch is as a wrestler, Cornette said: ‘He’s the only man I’ve ever known that can strap a bucket of fried chicken on his back and ride a motor scooter across Ethiopia. Trevor Murdoch can take care of himself.’</p>
      <p>NWA subsequently apologised for the remark and pulled the episode to edit out Cornette’s remark.</p>
      <p>‘On tonight’s episode of NWA Powerr airing on November 19th 2019, one of our talents made comments which some viewers found offensive. We deeply regret the error and apologize,’ read a statement from NWA.</p>

      <p>Aldis also issued an apology to fans for Cornette’s remark.</p>
      <p>‘This is no way speaking on behalf of the NWA, I am absolutely speaking for myself: I thought the comment was in poor taste and unnecessary,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I totally understand why it caused many to be upset.</p>
      <p>‘It was a lack of judgment or sensitivity.</p>
      <p>‘I have worked really hard along with many others on this team to make this brand mean something again and this is not how I want NWA to be trending.’</p>
