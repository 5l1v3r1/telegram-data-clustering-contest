      <p>Excitement is building as plans for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s City Ground redevelopment continue to gather pace.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ home is set to get a significant facelift as the club look to transform the stadium into a world-class venue in a multi-million pound project.</p>
      <p>The Peter Taylor Stand will be rebuilt in phase one of the plans, to cater for an increased capacity of 10,000 fans.</p>
      <p>New state of the art dressing rooms, club shop, executive boxes and media suites will also be included, while improvements will be made to the other three sides of the ground, with the Bridgford Stand extended too, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-very-aware-challenges-3556518">as part of the project.</a></p>
      <p>And with the club having one eye on what looks to be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-worrall-3557979">a very exciting future,</a> we asked Forest fans what improvements they would like to see made to the stadium.</p>
      <p>It was a question which generated plenty of debate.</p>
      <p>And here are some of the responses. Let us know what you think in the comments section below.</p>

      <p><b>Tim Wedgewood:</b> “Restaurant, Greggs &amp; Costa coffee. Definitely better PA system.”</p>

      <p><b>Matthew Walker:</b> “Some toilets that aren’t so medieval.”</p>
      <p><b>Rick Ingamells:</b> “Better food options at a reasonable price. Proper bars in lower Trent End &amp; opening up the concourse.”</p>
      <p><b>Gill Gamston:</b> “More toilets for ladies around the ground &amp; more cubicles in the toilets. Sick of spending all half-time queuing for the loo.”</p>
      <p><b>Steven Currier:</b> “A bigger singing section to intimidate away teams, pyrotechnics, a great atmosphere all the way round ground.”</p>
      <p><b>Alasdair Quinn:</b> “Sort out the sound system. It’s terrible. The speakers are blown.”</p>
