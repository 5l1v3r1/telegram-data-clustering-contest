      <p>NEW DELHI: Triggering speculation that the much-awaited <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> deal is more or less closed, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Shiv-Sena">Shiv Sena</a> strategist <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Raut">Sanjay Raut</a> said that there will be good news soon. "As soon as the Congress-NCP meeting is over, we will meet Pawar sahib", said Raut.</p>
      <p>Congress President <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonia-Gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a> appears to have come around and finally given the green signal to the coalition with Shiv Sena and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/NCP">NCP</a> for government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Congress leader Prithiviraj Chauhan added ballast by saying that they hope to form the government in Maharashtra soon. Certain specifics need to be thrashed out, he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nawab Malik of NCP quickly added that only these three parties can form the government.</p>
      <p>The formula is 16:15:12, with 16 Cabinet Ministers for the Shiv Sena, 15 for the NCP and 12 for the Congress plus Speaker of the Assembly.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister will be on a rotation basis with Shiv Sena holding the CM post for the first 2.5 years and NCP to hold the CM post for the second half of the term.</p>
