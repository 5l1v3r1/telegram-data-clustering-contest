        <b>A couple have gone on trial accused of the genital mutilation of their one-year-old daughter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple, who cannot be named to protect their daughter's identity, are accused of carrying it out at an address in Dublin three years ago.</p>
      <p>In his opening address on Wednesday, prosecuting barrister Shane Costelloe told the jury they will hear evidence of the couple arriving at hospital with their then one-year-old daughter on September 16th 2016.</p>
      <p>She was bleeding and they sought assistance.</p>
      <p>He said the paediatric surgeon who performed the procedure to stop the bleeding came to the conclusion that her injury was not an accident, and Garda√≠ were called.</p>
      <p>Her parents, it will be alleged, claimed she hurt herself when she fell on a toy.</p>
      <p>Mr Costelloe gave the jurors a detailed explanation of the law surrounding female genital mutilation, and he told them it is not a defence to say it was consented to - or that it was done for customary or ritual reasons.</p>
      <p>He said it was not the State's case that they actually performed the mutilation, but rather that they aided, abetted or procured the act, and must have present when it was carried out.</p>
      <p>Both accused deny the charge.</p>
