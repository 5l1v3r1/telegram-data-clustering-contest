      <h1>Arkane Founder Opens New Studio WolfEye, Debut Title to Be Shown at The Game Awards</h1>
      <h2>Interaction, physics, and AI prioritised</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/Quintumply" target="_blank">Stephen Tailby</a></address>
      <p>Arkane Studios quickly made a name for itself with the <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/dishonored">Dishonored</a> series, and it's now well established as part of ZeniMax Media. But for the developer's founder, Raphael Colantonio, the games industry is far too focused on using cutting edge technology to push high-end graphics. A while ago, he left Arkane, but has now returned with a brand new team named WolfEye Studios.</p>
      <p>As stated on <a href="https://wolfeye-studios.com/">the company's website</a>, it will put the focus on interactive elements, art direction, and simulation rather than gunning for realistic visuals. "Simplified visual production pipeline allows us to be more agile and focus on what really matters: player experience as a whole," reads WolfEye's mission statement. "We want players to live their own adventures in rich simulated worlds that respond to actions and decisions in ways that is unique to each playthrough."</p>
      <p>It sounds to us like this new developer will be making games similar to Dishonored; immersive sims with rich worlds and interconnected systems. Other Arkane alumni join Colantonio at this new studio, so the pedigree is already pretty good.</p>
      <p>Whatever the studio's first game is, we'll catch a glimpse of it at <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a> 2019, where it'll be announced to the world. We're pretty interested to see what WolfEye comes up with.</p>
