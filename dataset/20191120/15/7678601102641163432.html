      <h1>Scan and pay: MRT Jakarta soon to accept QR code payments for tickets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>MRT Jakarta will introduce QR code scanning to speed up payments on Dec. 1, alongside existing payment methods, such as debit cards.</p>
      <p>MRT Jakarta financial director Tuhiyat said the company was currently testing the software and hardware for the new payment method, which should be done by the end of this month.</p>
      <p>“Commuters will be able to download the MRTJ app on Android and iOS app stores [to pay using QR codes],” Tuhiyat said on Wednesday, <i>kompas.com</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Tuhiyat said QR codes could speed up and ease transactions as a cardless method, using a two-dimensional matrix code.</p>
      <p>Other payment methods include Multi Trip Ticket (MTT) to be launched on Nov. 25, Single Trip Ticket, and debit cards.</p>
      <p>Tuhiyat said MTT cards functioned just like debit cards, with commuters able to store credit on them.</p>
      <p>He said MRT Jakarta had also received the permit for the MTT from the central bank.</p>
      <p>The permit, Bank Indonesia No. 21/447/DKSP/Srt/B, is valid for five years until Nov. 14, 2024.</p>
      <p>MRT Jakarta has produced 950,000 MTT cards, which it claims only seen 0.2 seconds for tapping in or out at passenger gates, faster than debit cards that need 1.2 to 2 seconds.</p>
      <p>The MTT cards can also be used on other modes of public transportation in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>The cards will be available at every MRT station for Rp 25,000 (US$1.77) each.</p>
      <p>Currently, only STT cards are available for commuters, besides the approved debit cards: Bank Mandiri’s e-money, BNI’s Tap Cash and Jak Lingko, BRI’s Brizzi, BCA’s Flazz and Bank DKI’s Jakcard.</p>
      <p>“We expect that, by January 1, all four methods of payments will work smoothly without any problem,” Tuhiyat said. (ami)</p>
