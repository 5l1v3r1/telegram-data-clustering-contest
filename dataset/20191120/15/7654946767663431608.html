      <p>This Thanksgiving, porn site CamSoda wants families to let online voyeurs watch them get stuffed . . . with turkey.</p>
      <p>The adult entertainment website is offering to pay up to $250 to anyone willing to livestream their dinner. The competition, called “CamSoda Voyeur Thanksgiving,” has no other rules besides that all participants be 18 or over, so it doesn’t appear that nudity is a requirement to show off your supper.</p>
      <p>It’s apparently more about creating community on the family-focused holiday.</p>
      <p>“Those who are lonely this holiday can now livestream dinnertime shenanigans and enjoy the company of others from afar with the quick click of a button,” CamSoda writes in a press release.</p>
      <p>The most popular dinner broadcasters will receive an additional prize: Free tokens to use on CamSoda and access their, um, less-wholesome content.</p>
      <p>CamSoda vice president Daryn Parker tells The Post via email that despite the family-friendly preface of a Thanksgiving meal, the platform expects the broadcasts to be compelling.</p>
      <p>“[Whenever] you have so many people gathered at one dinner table — the drunk uncle, the insecure cook, the nosy aunt and that one random cousin, among others — things can escalate quickly and make for entertaining content,” says Parker, “We think there is a healthy appetite for this type of voyeurism. People enjoy watching the antics of others — as evidenced by the popularity of video content on social platforms like Instagram and TikTok and on our main Voyeur Cams page.”</p>
      <p>This isn’t the porn site’s first off-kilter promotion. In 2015, CamSoda <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/12/15/porn-pioneer-to-debut-live-virtual-reality-show/">debuted a live virtual reality show</a>, they’ve offered online linguistics courses <a href="https://nypost.com/video/sexy-cam-girls-help-you-get-over-the-hump-of-learning-a-language/">taught by webcam models</a> and in September <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/18/gardner-minshew-gets-1-million-offer-to-rep-penis-puppets-for-porn-site/">offered Jaguars quarterback Gardner Minshew</a> an up to $1 million endorsement deal which would include being tapped as a brand ambassador for CamSoda’s penis puppet line.</p>
