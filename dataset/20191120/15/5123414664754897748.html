      <p><a href="https://www.emilyeizen.com/">Emily Eizen</a> is a queer multimedia artist working in the mediums of painting, sculpture, photography, modeling, and performance. Her ‘60s psychedelic inspired works showcase the beauty, freedom and diversity <a href="https://www.instagram.com/emilyeizen/">Eizen</a> considers essential to establishing equity in the cannabis space and beyond. Emily’s portfolio and commissions highlight her ability to adapt to different styles and aesthetic across spectrums of gender and sexuality, defying convention.</p>
      <p>With her connection to music, performance and cannabis, we asked her to make us a <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/weedsday/">Weedsday</a> playlist that has iconic stoner acts like <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a> and <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/tame-impala">Tame Impala</a>. </p>

        <b>“I Wanna Be Down” by Brandy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every smoke sesh playlist needs at least one ‘90s R&amp;B throwback. “I Wanna Be Down” by Brandy is a nostalgic bop about being young and in love. I loved Brandy as a kid (especially as Cinderella). This song also features verses from powerful female emcees Mc. Lyte, YoYo, and Queen Latifa. </p>

        <b>“Doin’ Time” by Lana Del Rey</b>
      </p>
      <p>This Lana cover of a Sublime classic is exactly what summer 2019 needed — perfect for cruising down the beach on roller-skates with some sativa. The music video is a whole mood in which Queen Lana embodies 1960s LA culture at its peak. </p>

        <b>“New Person, Same Old Mistakes” by Tame Impala</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tame Impala is a band that really changed my life. I got into their music right when I fell in love with cannabis — those early highs that made music sound like you were hearing it for the first time. The message of this song is so powerful to me. It is about how things change so fast and we grow into new people, but if we don’t fix our inner self, problems will always follow us.</p>

      <p>
        <b>“Tea Leaf Dancers” by Flying Lotus</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another must for any stoner playlist is a really trippy song. Play this jam at the height of your high, (headphones recommended) for a sense-tingling euphoric vibe. </p>

        <b>“Bart Simpson” by Princess Nokia</b>
      </p>
      <p>This song really embodies what it feels like to be a young girl creative in the educational system. This line pretty much describes me in any school environment, which is why I had to go my own way and make my own path as an artist. “Writing on my sneakers / Being sneaky with my teachers / Smoking weed under the bleachers / Cutting out and gluing pictures / Carrying my CD player / Sucking on a Now or Later / Sour Apple was the flavor / Scribbling on doodle paper / Trying hard to pay attention / But I have no real direction / So I say, "yo, fuck this lesson" / Spark the leaf, my back is stressing...” <i>#relatable</i></p>
