      <p>Sword-y fighting game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/17/soulcalibur-vi-review/">SoulCalibur VI</a> launched just over a year ago for PS4, Xbox One and PC, reviving the dormant sword-y fighting game series with a few tweaks and changes to its popular formula. Version 2.00 is a big overhaul of the game’s balance, introducing new moves for all characters, adding new combos and ways to overcome sticky situations.</p>
      <p>Two new battle mechanics are also coming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Soul Attack, a strengthened strike that can turn the tide of a battle.</li>
        <li>The Resist Impact, the ultimate defense move capable of repelling any attack including the currently unblockable ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Alongside adding support for Season Pass 2, Hilde and Creation Parts Set C, all of which drop on 26th November, Version 2.00’s patch notes look a little like this:</p>
