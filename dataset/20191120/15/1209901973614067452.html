      <p>The annual pace of inflation held steady in October as the consumer price index rose 1.9 per cent compared with a year ago, matching its moves in August and September, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The result was also in line with the expectations of economists, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>The overall rise in prices came as food prices rose 3.7 per cent compared with a year ago. Fresh fruit prices rose 7.9 per cent and fresh vegetable prices climbed 7.5 per cent.</p>
      <p>Compared with a year ago, the price of gasoline was down 6.7 per cent in October compared with a 10.0 per cent decline in September. Natural gas prices rose 3.3 per cent compared with a year ago following a 5.8 per cent increase in September.</p>
      <p>Statistics Canada said although global demand for oil remained low in October, there were slight price increases on a monthly basis due to temporary supply disruptions in the Middle East and a drop in crude oil inventories in the United States.</p>
      <p>Excluding gasoline, the annual pace of inflation was 2.3 per cent in October, down from 2.4 per cent in September.</p>
      <p>The average of Canadaâ€™s three measures for core inflation, which are considered better gauges of underlying price pressures, was 2.07 per cent compared with a revised figure of 2.03 per cent in September.</p>
      <p>The core readings are closely monitored by the Bank of Canada, which adjusts its key interest rate target to manage inflation.</p>
      <p>Regionally, prices were up 2.3 per cent compared with a year ago in Quebec, while Manitoba and B.C. both saw increases of 2.2 per cent. The annual pace of inflation was 1.7 per cent in Ontario.</p>
