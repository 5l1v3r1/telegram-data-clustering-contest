      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite Will Give the S10 a Run for Its Money Based on Leaked Specs</h1>

      <p>Weirdly, the specs for the S10 Lite are significantly better than we'd expect.</p>
      <p>Twitter leaker Ishan Agarwal is at it again, this time sharing details of the upcoming Galaxy S10 Lite and S11, with specs for the former garnering some measure of surprise because they're not just a bit on the shit side, like they should be.</p>
      <p>He tweeted that the S10 Lite will house the Snapdragon 855 processor, and will sport a 48MP main camera, 5MP depth, and 12MP ultra-wide, as well as a 32MP front-facing camera.</p>

      <p>The S10 contains an Exynos 9820 chipset here in the UK, and the Snapdragon 855 in the US, so there's no huge difference there. The cameras are another story, with a much lower pixelcount than the S10 Lite. The S10 features just a 1oMP main camera, and 16MP + 12MP + 12MP rear camera.</p>
      <p>It seems odd that the specs for a 'lite' version of anything should be better than the original, but the leaker is generally spot on, so if they say it's the S10 Lite and not some version of the S11, than that's what it is. For now.
