      <p>Actor Lou Ferrigno doesn’t care for the latest incarnation of the Hulk in the MCU.</p>
      <p>Ferrigno, who played the role on “The Original Hulk” TV series for five seasons from 1978 and 1983, says he was “disappointed” by the version of Mark Ruffalo’s character in the last Avengers movie. As “Smart Hulk” aka Professor Hulk in “Avengers: Endgame”, Hulk and alter ego Bruce banner have merged into an endearing glasses-wearing character whose split-personalities were now balanced.</p>
      <p>While the majority of audiences seem to be on board with the new Hulk, Ferrigno is not.</p>

      <p>“What’s happening is that the first two Hulk movies, the CGI was improving, but the last one, ‘Endgame’, I was disappointed. Because the Hulk needs to be hideous, he needs to be a creature,” he told Hamilton Comic-Con attendees over the weekend.</p>
      <p>According to <i><a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/16/lou-ferrigno-disappointed-hulk-avengers-endgame-blames-mark-ruffalo-disney/">ComicBook.com</a></i>, Ferrigno says he suspects the change in character may have something to do with portraying a Disney-friendly version of Hulk.</p>
      <p>“You see in ‘Endgame’, Mark Ruffalo – I think it has a lot to do with him and Disney – I didn’t like the way it portrayed [Hulk]. It took away that beauty, that quality of the Hulk. That’s why a lot of people liked the series,” he adds.</p>
      <p>It’s not just “Endgame” that Ferrigno took issue with.</p>

      <p>The actor says the movie was too “extreme with the spaceships, the shooting, the outer space.”</p>
      <p>“We need good stories. Good elements, good messages about life,” he continues. “Because when you see the series, even like ‘The Twilight Zone’, the original ‘Twilight Zone’, you learn something from every episode. The CGI, I mean, it’s all different. People like it that way because it’s bigger entertainment on the screen.”</p>
      <p>Ferrigno previously voiced his displeasure at what the character has become during a panel at Montreal Comic-Con, where he said of all the actors who have taken on the role of the green menace, Ruffalo’s take was his least favourite.</p>

      <p>“Mark is a wonderful actor. But we’ve had three different actors – we’ve had Eric Bana, Edward Norton and Mark Ruffalo. I like Bill Bixby the best, I like Edward Norton. But Ruffalo – I think he’s a wonderful actor, he blends in with the Marvel aspect of the Avengers – but I can’t take him seriously enough,” he explained. “Bill has that intensity, and you knew that when he was in danger, you could feel that intensity. But because of Marvel and Disney, they’ve taken a different direction. You can’t take it as seriously as the original series.”</p>
