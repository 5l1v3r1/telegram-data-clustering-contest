      <p>A former public schoolboy who bludgeoned three pensioners to death was suffering from delusions that led him to wrongly believe he was uncovering a paedophile ring, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Alexander Lewis-Ranwell, has gone on trial charged with killing Anthony Payne, 80, and twins Dick and Roger Carter, 84, at their homes in Exeter on February 10 this year.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the 28-year-old may have wrongly believed the men were part of a child sex ring when he attacked them.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the trial, the judge, Mrs Justice May, told the jury of eight men and four women that Mr Lewis-Ranwell had denied the murders of the three pensioners on a "special basis" - by reason of insanity.</p>
      <p>She told them: "The question you are going to be asking yourselves on each of the three counts of murder.</p>
      <p>"Is it more likely or not that when he killed each of the three men, Alexander Lewis-Ranwell did not know what he was doing was against the law?</p>
      <p>"If your verdict is yes, you will find him not guilty by reason of insanity. If the answer is no, you will find him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter."</p>
      <p>Outlining the case, Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, said Mr Lewis-Ranwell had first bludgeoned Mr Payne with a hammer in an upstairs bedroom of the pensioner's home.</p>
      <p>Less than three hours later, he said, the defendant had attacked the Carter twins with a spade inside their home.</p>
      <p>But he told the jury that Mr Lewis-Ranwell suffered from "delusions - a genuine belief something is the case when it was not so at all.”</p>

      <p>Mr Smith explained that the defendant had believed the men he attached were involved in a paedophile ring, but added: "They were the victims of course and not involved in any such things."</p>
      <p>Mr Smith described how on the afternoon of February 10, Mr Lewis-Ranwell had been walking around the streets of Exeter.</p>
      <p>"At about 12.30pm his wanderings took him down Bonhay Road in the St David's area of the city," Mr Smith told the jury.</p>
      <p>"At No 65, a rundown small terrace house where an elderly man called Anthony Payne lived.</p>
      <p>"The defendant stopped at Mr Payne's house and read a note on the door which spoke about the occupant being an elderly man of 80 years of age.</p>
      <p>"The defendant went in through the front door of No 65 Bonhay Road. He found or followed Mr Payne upstairs to a bedroom where the defendant took a hammer and bludgeoned Mr Payne to death with blows to the head.</p>
      <p>"Moments later the defendant was back out and walking the streets again."</p>
      <p>Mr Smith went on: "About two-and-three-quarter hours later on the same Sunday afternoon, the defendant was by then walking down Cowick Lane in the St Thomas area of the city - about one-and-a-half miles from where the first killing had taken place.</p>
      <p>"At 109 Cowick Lane lived the elderly Carter twin brothers. Rather like 65 Bonhay Road, it had the appearance of being unkempt and rundown. The Carter twins were 84 years of age.</p>
      <p>"One of the Carter brothers ushered the defendant out of the property when he tried to get in through the front gates.</p>
      <p>"Undeterred, this defendant went around the back of the house and scaled a wall.</p>
      <p>"He took up a spade from the garden and went into the Carter brothers' house. Once inside, the defendant beat both brothers to death with blows to the head from the spade."</p>

      <p>Mr Smith added: "There is no dispute in this case that the defendant killed all three elderly men. </p>
      <p>There is also no dispute about this defendant did the killing. These circumstances are not in dispute and are agreed."</p>
      <p>Mr Smith told the jury that Mr Lewis-Ranwell had visited pubs in Exeter before sleeping rough by the old castle in the city centre following the attacks.</p>
      <p>At around 5am on Monday, February 11th, he had gone to the nearby Rougemont Hotel where he allegedly carried out another violent but non fatal attack on a night porter.</p>
      <p>Two other hotel staff were confronted by the defendant who chased them around the hotel car park with a lamp stand.</p>
      <p>Police were called he was Tasered and restrained before being sent to a local mental health unit for assessment.</p>
      <p>At the same time Devon Police were launching their murder investigation and CCTV identified Mr Lewis-Ranwell as the suspect.</p>
      <p>He was arrested at the psychiatric unit late on February 12 and taken into police custody.</p>
      <p>The Crown said Mr Lewis-Ranwell  had a history of mental illness which was treated with medication, but when he did not take his medication "he could and did fall mentally ill".</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and delusions.</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis-Ranwell has denied three counts of murder and was accompanied in the dock by five members of nursing staff.</p>
      <p>Wearing a white shirt, blue trousers and a grey sweater, he used a hearing loop to listen to the opening of the case.</p>
      <p>The trial continues</p>
