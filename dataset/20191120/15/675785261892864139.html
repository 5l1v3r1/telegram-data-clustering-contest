      <h1>Woman spots very x-rated detail in church's window featuring Jesus and Mary</h1>
      <h2>The people of social media have been left stunned by a rather unfortunate design flaw on a colourful church window featuring Mary and Jesus</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:25:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>When in a place of worship, you wouldn't be surprised to see artwork depicting stories from the bible on the windows.</p>
      <p>But one woman did get a big surprise recently, after noticing something wasn't quite right about a church window depicting Jesus and Mary.</p>
      <p>The woman, named Rosie, took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/funny-tweets">social media</a> to share her discovery and ask fellow users if they were seeing what she was seeing on the glass.</p>
      <p>In a post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , Rosie shared a snap, which looks a lot like a reimagining of Michelangelo's The Pietà statue (1498/99) which shows Mary cradling her son Jesus in her lap after the crucifixion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She captioned the tweet: "What, exactly... is Mary holding??"</p>
      <p>Her confusion is caused by a rather unfortunate design error the artist made when adding colour to Jesus' leg.</p>
      <p>In attempt to give the piece a little definition, the top of his inner thigh was made a darker colour - but people think the way it was done makes the whole thing look rather x-rated.</p>
      <p>The post went <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/viral">viral,</a> garnering over 1,000 retweets and hundreds of comments.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>One person said: "You can’t spell resurrection without... erm... urrection."</p>
      <p>Another joked: "The second coming?"</p>
      <p>A third person wrote: "Oh dear. Unfortunate. Divine sausage."</p>
      <p>Someone else added: "It's a holy phalice... I mean chalice."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Rosie's photo inspired others to share the rude things they'd seen on church windows.</p>
      <p>A user named Will shared a photo from his local church which depicted John the Baptist.</p>
      <p>He said: "What's John the Baptist up to here!"</p>
      <p>In the image John was stood in water, with a man kneeling in front of him.</p>
