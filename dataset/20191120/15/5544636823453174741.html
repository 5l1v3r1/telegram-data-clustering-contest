      <p>The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare says the issue of contract extension for Super Eagles coach, <a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Gernot Rohr</a> lies with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF).</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the minister gave the clarification on Wednesday in Abuja at a brief meeting with Rohr before dashing for the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the presidential villa.</p>
      <p>The media have been awashed with news of a log jam on <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/18/super-eagles-coach-gernot-rohr-speaks-on-signing-new-contract/">the extension of the coach’s contract</a>.</p>
      <p>Rohr’s current contract expires in June 2020 which will fall to the middle of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Dare, however, stressed that the ministry would continue to give the coach all the necessary support as the NFF finalises its meeting on the contract talks.</p>
      <p>“The issue of contract (with Rohr) will be best handled by the NFF. I understand the need to work the fine lines.</p>
      <p>“I understand there is a contractual arrangement with the NFF, I will allow the NFF to work through its process, ” the minister said.</p>
      <p>Dare charged the coach not to be distracted but intensify efforts to take Nigerian football to the pinnacle.</p>
      <p>“Are we happy about where our football is at the moment, not exactly but we know there’s an ongoing process that we make this country a better football nation. That process is on and you are part of the process”,he added.</p>
      <p>He  tasked the coach on working with stakeholders to develop the Nigeria Professional League (NPL) in line with international best practice.</p>
      <p>”More importantly your knowledge and support for the domestic league will be very important because you can share your experience with our local coaches, ” the minister said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Rohr congratulated the minister on his appointment and efforts to reposition Nigerian sports.</p>
      <p>He pledged to work more closely with the minister going forward as the Super Eagles strive to pick the AFCON 2021 ticket.</p>
      <p>High point of the event was the presentation of an autographed Super Eagles jersey by the coach to the minister.</p>
      <p>Nigeria currently top group L of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers with six maximum points ahead of Benin Republic, Sierra Leone and Lesotho.</p>
