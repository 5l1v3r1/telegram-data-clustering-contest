      <p>A 31-year-old man has been arrested after police used a helicopter and stinger to track and stop a suspected stolen lorry.</p>
      <p>The vehicle had been tracked from Northamptonshire after it was spotted being driven on what were believed to be false registration plates.</p>
      <p>Police believe it is linked to the theft of a lorry at Watford Gap services.</p>
      <p>Officers from Northamptonshire Police were pursuing the vehicle and asked for assistance from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Police as it travelled into the two areas.</p>
      <p>It was eventually stopped by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police </a>after deploying stingers in Bingham on the A46 toward Newark at 1.44am on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>The arrested man is being questioned on suspicion of driving while disqualified, failure to stop, dangerous driving, driving without insurance, theft of a motor vehicle and theft from a motor vehicle.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Claire Rukas, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police</a>, said: "This is an excellent demonstration of working with our colleagues across borders to target criminals using our road network.</p>
      <p>"Our highly-trained officers within Operational Support use a range of tactics and resources, from automatic number plate recognition cameras, specialised fast-response vehicles and stingers to stop road-based criminals, whether they commit crimes here or travel through <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Nottinghamshire</a> after committing a crime elsewhere."</p>
