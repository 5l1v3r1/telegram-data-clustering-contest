      <p>If you enjoy attention, don’t like spending money and harbour a desire to visit the southern Japanese city of Fukuoka, then we have some very good news for you.</p>
      <p>But for anyone else, this might sound a little dystopian: the <a href="https://website-2466167782178721348122-hotel.business.site/?m=true">Business Ryokan Asahi</a> hotel is offering travelers the opportunity to stay in its rooms for a mere $1 (77p) a night. But there’s a catch, obviously.</p>
      <p>In order to get this deal, you have to consent to having your every moment in the room filmed and then broadcast live to the hotel’s Youtube channel, where a surprising number of people watch and comment in real-time.</p>
      <p>I say ‘surprising’ because there’s no microphone in the room and nudity and sex are banned, and as a result, the live-stream is not exactly riveting entertainment.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But you can check it out on YouTube if you fancy watching someone look at their phone for a couple of hours and maybe, if you’re really lucky, hold up a sign that says ‘hi’.</p>

      <p>If this all sounds like something that doesn’t make financial sense, there’s a rationale behind it: the deal only applies to one room, which was the least booked to begin with.</p>
      <p>This way, the hotel is able to fill up the room and drum up some viral publicity at the same time – although some online booking sites are reluctant to list it.</p>
      <p>Given the high cost of travelling in Japan, the $1 offer is certainly tempting, but there’s something sinister about the set-up, which feels like the beginning of a high-concept horror film.</p>
      <p>And might I direct the hotel management towards a little-known novel called 1984? Written by some obscure old scribbler named <i>George Orwell</i>? Ringing any bells, gentlemen?</p>
      <p>It’s been a while since I read it, admittedly, but I seem to recall it took rather a dim view of installing cameras in peoples’ personal space in order to spy on them.</p>
      <p>But then again, perhaps the most chilling aspect of the arrangement is having to go 24 hours without having a w*nk – now <i>that</i> is Orwellian.</p>
