      <p><b>WARWICK, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A Rhode Island State Police trooper who pleaded no contest to punching a man in a holding cell has asked a court to vacate his plea on the grounds it was coerced by the former chief of the department.</p>
      <p>The Providence Journal reports James Donnelly-Taylor filed a motion Monday seeking to vacate the plea he made to a charge of simple assault in the June 2014 beating of a 36-year-old man.</p>
      <p>Donnelly-Taylor said former state police Col. Steven O'Donnell said he would be protected and allowed to keep his job if he pleaded. O'Donnell has denied that.</p>
      <p>Surveillance video shows Donnelly-Taylor throwing several punches.</p>
      <p>His attorney says the detained man swing his elbow first.</p>
      <p>If the plea is vacated, the case would go to trial.</p>
      <p>Donnelly-Taylor is currently on medical leave.</p>
