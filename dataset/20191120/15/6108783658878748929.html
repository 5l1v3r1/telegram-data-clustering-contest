      <h3>"Once we have our wonderful PC game... we'll start looking at other ways that we can show up."</h3>
      <p>While Microsoft is focused on PC development, it hasn’t ruled out an <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/age-of-empires-4/">Age of Empires 4</a> </i>console release on Xbox One or Project Scarlett.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Microsoft’s Shannon Loftis and Adam Isgreen at X019 in London, Stevivor asked if <i>Age of Empires 4</i> will release on console as well, mirroring cross-platform development of other first-party titles like <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-infinite/"><i>Halo Infinite</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard, as a PC game,” Loftis said in reply. “We want to make it great on PC. But then, I think the whole concept of platform is about to change with Xbox.</p>
      <p>“We are working hard to make sure to visualize all the different ways that people are going to want to experience <i>Age </i>[<i>of Empires</i>]<i>.</i> But our number one priority is to make it work great with keyboard and mouse.”</p>

      <p>I pointed out that the recent release of 2K’s <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/sid-meiers-civilization-vi/">Civilization 6</a> </i>on Xbox One and PS4 shows there’s an obvious demand for RTS games on console. Isgreen nodded in agreement.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to explore our options,” he replied. “Once we have our wonderful PC game, then we’ll start looking at other ways that we can show up.”</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/age-of-empires-4/">Age of Empires 4</a> </i>was announced back in August; a release date has not yet been confirmed.</p>
