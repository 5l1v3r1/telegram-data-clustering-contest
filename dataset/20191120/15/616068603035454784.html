        <b>UPDATE 3:45 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The CEO of Okanagan Regional Library is being asked to attend diversity and inclusivity training after comments he made pertaining to Drag Queen Storytime.</p>
      <p>Don Nettlton circulated an internal memo stating the event was controversial and potentially divisive.</p>
      <p>"The announced program, while claiming to be promoting diversity and acceptance, will be offensive to a significant segment of our society," Nettlton wrote.</p>
      <p>The board on Wednesday made several decisions based on the memo.</p>
      <p>"Within the first two weeks of December, the CEO along with the senior management team and the board of director will all participate in diversity and inclusivity training," said ORL board chair Karla Kozakevich.</p>
      <p>"Next spring, the CEO will attend the BC Library conference, where they are having some workshops and sessions specifically around inclusivity and diversity. He is also releasing a written apology letter to the staff and board."</p>

      <p>The controversial Drag Queen Storytime will not be removed from libraries throughout the Okanagan.</p>
      <p>Despite vocal opposition, the Okanagan Regional Library board voted Wednesday to continue with the popular children's story program.</p>
      <p>"It was unanimously decided in the policy committee meeting that the current mission and values of ORL are sufficient, and we are leaving it up to community head librarians in each branch to make the decision based on what is best practice for programming in that community," said board member and Kelowna councillor Loyal Wooldridge.</p>
      <p>The library received several hundred pieces of correspondence from the public after Drag Queen Storytime debuted in September.</p>
      <p>Wooldridge said letters and emails were split 50-50 for and against the program.</p>
      <p>And despite, or perhaps because of the controversy,Â about 300 people attended the hour-long program at the downtown Kelowna library last Saturday, he added.</p>
      <p>Only two people were seen outside protesting.</p>
      <p>"I am pleased with the outcome. I believe it is up to educated professionals like head librarians to make the choices of programming that best suits their community," he added.</p>
      <p>"Further, I believe parents and guardians have the right to choose what programming they attend and send their children to."</p>
