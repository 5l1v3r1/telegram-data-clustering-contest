      <p>Only 0.2 percent of all Ripple’s XRP transactions are associated with illegal activity, according to <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ex-coinbase-data-manager-elliptic-raises-23-million/">Elliptic</a>, a cryptocurrency tracking company that works with law enforcement agencies. Based on available blockchain forensic data, their analysis found that only a tiny percentage of transactions to exchanges were from illicit sources.</p>
      <p>Although the proportion of XRP transactions dedicated to illegal purchases is low, about $400 million of the digital coin has already been spent this year on the so-called dark web. While researchers have linked bitcoin illegal transactions with crimes such as hacks, money laundering and the drugs, a large portion of XRP criminals are operating Ponzi schemes.</p>

      <p>“The type of activities they found were primarily scams, like Ponzi scams, thefts. A smaller category is the sale of credit card details,” said Tom Robinson, chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic.</p>
      <p>The good news for XRP enthusiast is that the sheer popularity of the cryptocurrency amongst financial institutions is a major contributor to pushing criminals away since they “do not want to be associated with any mechanism related to that use.”</p>

      <p>Although Ripple is regularly grouped with other cryptocurrencies, its purpose is different ‎as it also operates a ‎decentralized payment settlement solution for banks and financial institutions that is fast and ‎scalable.‎ Ripple was in the news recently after it announced a $30 million investment in global <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/fintech/payments/chinas-ant-financial-snaps-moneygram-880-million/">money transfer company MoneyGram</a>.</p>
      <p>As of this writing, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ripple/">Ripple ranks third</a> on the list of top cryptocurrencies by market cap, behind bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
      <p>Elliptic’s findings from their most recent part of the research sample, suggested that around 0.5% bitcoin market participants use the cryptocurrency “primarily for illegal purposes”. Still, the low figures are a reminder of the regulatory risks surrounding the crypto space, which is beloved by criminals looking to preserve some degree of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Based in London, Elliptic has recently raised $23 million in a funding round led by Japan’s SBI Holdings to fuel expansion plans into Asia. The company sells <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/elliptic-refutes-coinbases-allegation-of-data-leakage/">blockchain analytics tools</a> to cryptocurrency platforms, as well as banks and law enforcement.</p>
