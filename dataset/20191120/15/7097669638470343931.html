      <p>Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday rubbished European calls to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, saying that such ideas could lead to humans living in caves again.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an investment forum in Moscow, Putin also slammed shale gas production through fracking as dirty and environmentally damaging, saying Russia -- one of the world's top gas producers -- would never use this technology.</p>
      <p>Asked what he thought of Europe's moves to reduce use of gas, for which it is heavily dependent on Russia, Putin said that "in my view, disdaining such a clean hydrocarbon as gas is absolutely strange".</p>
      <p>The European Union's investment arm last week said it would stop funding fossil fuel projects -- including gas -- from 2022.</p>
      <p>"When people suggest such ideas, I think that mankind could end up back in caves again," Putin saod.</p>
      <p>The Russian president said that "the way technology is today, without raw hydrocarbons, without nuclear power, without hydroelectric power, mankind can simply not survive, cannot preserve its civilisation".</p>
      <p>He boasted that Russia's relatively intense use of gas and hydroelectric power had an energy balance that is "one of the greenest in the world".</p>
      <p>The extraction of shale gas through fracking -- banned in many countries but booming in the United States -- is "without any exaggeration barbaric", Putin said.</p>
      <p>The extraction techniques "destroy the environment", he said. "In some places where shale oil is being extracted, people don't have water coming out of their taps, but black slush.</p>
      <p>"Despite all the possible economic advantages, we don't need such extraction, we won't do this ever."</p>
