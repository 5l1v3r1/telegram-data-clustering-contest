      <h2>A complaint had been made about Frank Anderson after he shared the material</h2>

      <p>AN SNP councillor has been suspended for three months after sharing allegedly “anti-semitic” material online.</p>
      <p>Frank Anderson, a Nationalist councillor in West Lothian, was sanctioned after a hearing by an ethics watchdog.</p>
      <p>The SNP is now facing calls for him to be expelled from the party.</p>
      <p>The row related to a controversial blog on the pro-independence Grouse Beater website about GMB Scotland organiser Rhea Wolfson, who is Jewish.</p>
      <p>Entitled ‘GMB - a cockney clique’, the blog cited Mein Kampf to claim Wolfson was making the most of Hitler’s fascist ideology.</p>
      <p>In one section called “Hitler’s view”, the blog made the claim that Hitler had alleged that Jews gradually had assumed leadership of the trade union movement:</p>
      <p>“Whether or not Wolfson is intellectually aware of Hitler’s outlook is unknown, but she certainly knows how to make the most of it”.</p>
      <p>The blog also said: “The people of Glasgow voted for independence without caveat. They did not invite fifth column English unionists to come to their city to divert that just ambition.”</p>
      <p>The SNP suspended and expelled Edinburgh-based Gareth Wardell, the blog’s author.</p>
      <p>When the post was circulated online, Wolfson tweeted that she had “honestly never expected to see such outright support for such obviously anti-Semitic views”.</p>
      <p>However, it also emerged that the blog was shared on social media by Anderson.</p>
      <p>Anderson initially doubled down in comments to a newspaper: “I don’t accept that it was an anti-Semitic article, nor was I aware of any of Miss Wolfson’s Jewish heritage.</p>
      <p>“The article was, in context, about the self-serving attitude of Labour.”</p>
      <p>He later apologised “unreservedly”.</p>
      <p>A complaint was later made about Anderson and the Standards Commission for Scotland held a hearing today.</p>
      <p>It is understood he was suspended as a councillor for three months.</p>
      <p>GMB Scotland Secretary Gary Smith said: “The SNP must now take a strong stance by expelling Councillor Anderson, just as they did with the author of the Grousebeater blog.</p>
      <p>“The Standards Commission found Councillor Anderson’s actions to be “offensive and gratuitous” and suspended him from his elected post from three months. We believe his position is untenable. </p>
      <p>“We expect the SNP to be consistent in their approach and to send a loud and clear message that there is no place for anti-Semitism in Scotland.”</p>
