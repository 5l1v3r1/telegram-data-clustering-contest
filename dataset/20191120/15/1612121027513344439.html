      <p>You can never have too many chargers, and they make great stocking stuffers now that we’re getting close to the holidays. Amazon’s running a sale on all kinds of charging accessories right now, so if you’re thinking about stocking up, now’s the time.</p>
      <p>There’s quite a bit to dig through here, including portable batteries on big discounts, like Mophie’s power banks down 50%, iOttie car mounts over 30% off, and wireless charging pads for about $20. Aside from that there are cables, Qi charging stands, docks, and a few other things, too.</p>
      <p>Definitely worth checking out.</p>
