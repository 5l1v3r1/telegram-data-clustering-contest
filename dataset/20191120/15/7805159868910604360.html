      <h1>Galaxy S10 Lite confirmed via Samsung’s FCC filing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:01:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>Back in October, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-lite-affordable-rumor/">we covered a rumor</a> that claimed Samsung was working on a more affordable phone called the Galaxy S10 Lite. This was in addition to a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-note-10-lite-affordable-rumor/">rumored Galaxy Note 10 Lite.</a> Thanks to a new FCC filing from Samsung, we can confirm the existence of this mysterious device.</p>
      <p><a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=N&amp;application_id=KYZ1q5d2DWpt6Iy1NEt2Mw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=A3LSMG770F">This FCC filing</a> is for a phone called the “Galaxy S10 Lite” with model number SM-G770F. This is the same model number that was mentioned in the previous rumor. The FCC filing also includes some connectivity details: LTE Cat. 14 download speeds, 3xCA maximum, and no 4×4 MIMO. Interestingly, the IMEI included in the filing is identified as belonging to a “Galaxy R5” device, according to Ting’s IMEI database. R5 was the rumored name of the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-a91-45w-fast-charging/">Galaxy A91</a>, which is what the earlier rumor claims will launch as the S10 Lite. From the earlier rumor, the S10 Lite is said to have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, 48 + 12 + 5MP cameras, a 32MP front camera, a 4,500 mAh battery, 45W charging support, and a 6.7-inch Full HD+ display.</p>
      <p>The display size is corroborated by the FCC filing, as the display diagonal size is mentioned as 170mm, approximately 6.69-inches. The overall diagonal is 172mm and the length and width are 160mm by 75mm. One page also says the device supports the EA-TA845 charger, which is the 45W fast charger from the Galaxy Note 10+. Lastly, we spotted evidence in the FCC filing that the device might have a microSD card slot.</p>

      <p>The biggest question about this device is what exactly makes it a “Lite” Galaxy S10. Samsung already released the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-exynos/">Galaxy S10e</a> which had a 5.8-inch flat display. A 6.7-inch display would be the same size as the Galaxy S10 5G. So it doesn’t seem to be “Lite” in terms of size, and a Snapdragon 855 and 8GB of RAM isn’t “Lite” on performance either. The specifications sound like a flagship phone that could easily compete with the other S10 devices.</p>
      <p>Samsung will have new devices to show off in February, though XDA’s own Max Weinbach claims we’ll see this device get unveiled next month. We’ll have to wait and see what happens with this Galaxy S10 Lite.</p>
