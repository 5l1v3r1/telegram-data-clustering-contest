      <p>Last week we threw a competition at your face, asking you to guess the clues as to which movie we were talking about. The competition is simple: Take a gander at the video below in which I am <i>hilarious </i>according to myself, or just peek at the images instead! Those images should give you more than enough information as to which film will be showing soon at Ster Kinekor, and we’ve got a double ticket ready and primed for you to use so that you can see it.</p>
      <p>Here’s the catch: This competition is running for three weeks. We’re on week two right now, so it’s time to put on your favourite deerhunter hat and put that grey matter of yours to the test. Here’s this week’s video:</p>
