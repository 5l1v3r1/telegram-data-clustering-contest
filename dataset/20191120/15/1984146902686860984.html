      <h2>Award-winning healthcare provider launches interactive education scheme in schools</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:54:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author">Evening Chronicle</a></address>
      <p>As the UK’s largest healthcare charity, Nuffield Health is proactively responding to key health issues facing young people today through its School Wellbeing Activity Programme (SWAP).</p>
      <p>Developed after a two-year research project, which identified the importance of having a dedicated resource in schools with a responsibility for wellbeing, SWAP uses academic research and behavioural change theory to address the four main areas of wellbeing: physical activity, diet, sleep and emotional resilience.</p>
      <p>Nuffield Health Newcastle and Tees Hospitals launched the nationwide programme in the North East during October, and are now running sessions in schools across the region.</p>
      <p>The six-week programme involves volunteer professionals from Nuffield Health’s hospitals and health and wellbeing clinics visiting schools on a weekly basis. They deliver interactive workshops that delve deeper into the understanding of feelings and emotions, the environmental factors which affect sleeping habits and look at how we move and how what we eat can affect our general health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>The target age range is 9-12 years old, but the programme is adaptable for other school age children and is free to participating schools. The first North East school to take part is Benton Dene Special School in Longbenton, which supports primary-age children with a range of complex learning difficulties and additional needs or Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD).</p>
      <p>Members of staff from Nuffield Health Newcastle Hospital in Jesmond and Nuffield Health Fitness &amp; Wellbeing Gym in Gosforth delivered the SWAP sessions.</p>
      <p>Helen Milburn, assistant head teacher at Benton Dene Special School, said: “The wellbeing of our pupils is of paramount importance. We are proud of our Healthy Schools Award and always seek opportunities to further support our pupils’ wellbeing.</p>

      <p>“As a school we are very aware of the struggles our young people face, with many elements of modern-day life affecting their physical and emotional wellbeing. In addition, we know that children with learning difficulties are more likely than their peers to experience poor mental health and wellbeing; therefore we ensure we offer a variety of opportunities to our pupils.</p>
      <p>“The SWAP programme builds upon knowledge that we teach in school through our Personal, Social, Health and Economic curriculum. We feel this programme enriches the learning for our pupils. The volunteer experts worked hard to make each workshop appropriate for our children with lots of hands-on learning which was really well received.”</p>
      <p>Through its SWAP programme and partnerships with local schools across the country, Nuffield Health is aiming to reach 50,000 young people by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>Matt Lamb, Nuffield Health Newcastle Hospital Director, explains: “Young people today are growing up in a time of massive change and experiencing significant wellbeing challenges both inside and outside of school. Through SWAP, Nuffield Health is hoping to address these issues nationwide to help embed real change in the next generation.”</p>
      <p>For the last 60 years, Nuffield Health has been working for the public benefit to help make the nation fitter, healthier, happier and stronger. In addition to its flagship community programmes like SWAP, Nuffield Health is also the leading provider of corporate wellbeing services in the UK through its network of 31 award-winning hospitals, 112 fitness and wellbeing clubs, healthcare clinics, and over 200 workplace wellbeing services.</p>
      <p>What also makes Nuffield Health unique is the breadth of expertise available to provide fully connected care. This ranges from Health MOTs, personal training and supporting people on their fitness journeys, to helping patients recover with physiotherapy or emotional wellbeing counselling, or providing hospital treatments for illness and serious conditions like arthritis or cancer.</p>
      <p>In the North East, Nuffield Health Tees is the only private hospital with an ‘Outstanding’ Care Quality Commission (CQC) rating north of Leeds. Specialist areas of treatment include spinal surgery, vascular surgery, eye care and orthopaedics.</p>
      <p>Nuffield Health Newcastle Hospital specialises in orthopaedics, men’s health and women’s health, ophthalmology and physiotherapy. The hospital also provides a wide range of outpatient services including GP clinics and diagnostic scans.</p>
