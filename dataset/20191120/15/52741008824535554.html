      <p>A charge has been laid following an alarming incident in Cambridge.</p>
      <p>Waterloo Regional Police allege a school bus, which had children on it, got too close to a railway crossing at Coronation Boulevard and King Street East the afternoon of October 29.</p>
      <p>They say the driver did perform all safety checks, as required.</p>
      <p>But as those checks were being done, the driver noticed a train approaching in the distance at a slow speed.</p>
      <p>That's when police say the bus came into close proximity to the tracks.</p>
      <p>There was no contact between the bus and train, as well no one was injured.</p>
      <p>Police say they launched their investigation the following day, when they were made aware of the incident.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, November 20, police announced they had charged a 72-year-old woman - under the Highway Traffic Act - with stopping a school bus at the wrong place at a railway crossing.</p>
