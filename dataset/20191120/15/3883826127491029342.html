        <b>A man was stabbed to death in a fight outside a block of east London flats in a "particularly vicious attack".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was found by police responding to reports of a disturbance outside Owen Waters House, in Fullwell Avenue, Ilford, on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The victim died at the scene and his next of kin have been informed.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made but the Met said "the possibility that the murder is gang-related is a very strong line of inquiry".</p>
      <p>Police are establishing if the stabbing is linked to a fire at some nearby garages where a car was found burnt out.</p>
      <p>The Met said fire crews had been called to the blaze at about 22:20 GMT while traces of blood had also been found around the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Det Ch Insp Chris Soole described the killing as a "particularly vicious attack" and appealed for witnesses.</p>

      <p>A Section 60 Order - giving police stop-and-search powers - was put in place for the whole of the Redbridge borough until 06:30.</p>
      <p>There have been five murder investigations in the borough in 2019 - three of which have been as a result of fatal stabbings.</p>

      <h3>At the scene - Greg McKenzie, BBC London</h3>
      <p>A forensic tent is outside the tower block marking the spot where the teenager died.</p>
      <p>Residents have been telling me about rising tensions in the last few weeks. The block - just off a main road in Ilford - is known as a meeting point for drug dealers and people said the issue is "rampant".</p>
      <p>They have also described a lot of "youth disturbance and violence" in the area and expressed their fear, anger and shock.</p>
      <p>Officers have been coming in and out of the flats and they are trying to work out whether a burnt-out car is linked to the fatal stabbing.</p>
