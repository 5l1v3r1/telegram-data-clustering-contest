      <p>Boris Johnson has hinted the Tories are planning a big cut in National Insurance (NI) for low-paid workers when they unveil their General Election manifesto.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister appeared to blurt out the plan to raise the threshold at which workers start paying NI from £8,628 a year to £12,000, during a campaign visit to Teesside.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a question-and-answer session with staff at an engineering plant in Middlesbrough, he said the Conservatives were committed to a policy of “low tax for… working people”.</p>
      <blockquote>We are cutting tax for working people<cite>Boris Johnson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He went on: “If you look at what we’re doing and what I’ve said in the last few days, we are going to be cutting National Insurance up to £12,000, we are going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses.</p>
      <p>“We are cutting tax for working people.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson originally raised the idea of upping the threshold for NI contributions during the Conservative leadership contest last summer – although at that stage he did not put a figure on it.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) calculated that for each £1,000 that it was raised, 600,000 workers would be lifted out of NI altogether.</p>
      <p>If just employee and self-employed thresholds were lifted the cost to the Exchequer would be £3 billion a year rising to £4.5 billion if the employer threshold was raised as well.</p>
      <p>To raise the threshold to £12,500 – as Mr Johnson’s then leadership rival Dominic Raab was proposing – was put at £11 billion, rising to £17 billion if the employer threshold was included.</p>
      <p>The IFS said that 2.4 million workers would be taken out of NI.</p>
