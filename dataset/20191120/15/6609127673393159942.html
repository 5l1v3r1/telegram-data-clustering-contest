      <p>And police confirmed they are currently treating the death as unexplained.</p>
      <p>Inspector Rachael Burns, from Glenrothes Police Station, said: “Officers were called to an address on Balbirnie Street, Markinch, on Wednesday November 20, following the sudden death of a man.</p>
      <p>“The death is being treated as unexplained.</p>
      <p>"Enquiries are ongoing.”</p>
      <p>We told earlier today how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4974922/oban-alex-carter-missing-body-found-search/">a body was found</a> in the search for missing Oban man Alex Carter.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old had vanished without a trace after leaving for work yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>And yesterday <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4971797/helen-maider-missing-body-found/">a body was found in the search for a pensioner</a> who had vanished amid freezing conditions.</p>
      <p>An appeal was launched to help trace Helen Maider, 89, from the Bishopbriggs area after she disappeared around 6am.</p>
      <p>But cops later confirmed a body had been found as part of their efforts.</p>
