      <h1>Organization plans to install 100 trash booms to protect Bali's waterways</h1>

      <p>It is estimated that about 80 percent of plastic waste in the oceans comes from rivers and other streams. With that in mind, Make a Change World, a media organization that shares inspirational contents about sustainability, made a plan to install 100 trash booms in waterways around Bali under a project called Sungai Watch. Founded by brothers Sam and Gary Bencheghib, Make a Change World launched several environmental initiatives, including #PlasticBottleCitarum, when they spent two weeks cruising the world’s most polluted river on plastic-bottle canoes. This time, Sam and Gary, who grew up in Bali, decided to install the first trash boom on the Yeh Poh River two weeks ago.           View this post on Instagram                   ...</p>
