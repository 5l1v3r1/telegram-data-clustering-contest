      <p>The Chairman of the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) Tony Elumelu has said job creation, and inclusive growth are areas which African development agenda should be focused on.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Elumelu who is also the Chairman, United Bank for Africa Group (UBA) said this recently in a high-level panel with President of Senegal Macky Sall and President of Mauritania Mohamed Ould Ghazouani.</p>
      <p>According to him, “We know, and we say, that poverty anywhere is a threat to mankind everywhere.</p>
      <p>“What manifests itself in what we call security breakdown or terrorism, or extremism is actually deeply rooted in poverty, in joblessness.</p>
      <p>“So with due respect, we can have 101 seminars like this but unless and until we begin to address these issues of poverty, joblessness amongst our young ones, they will continue to allow themselves to be brainwashed by people who see no future, and they will continue to engage in extremism.”</p>
