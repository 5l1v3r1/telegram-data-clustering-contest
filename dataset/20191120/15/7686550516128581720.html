      <p>Charities and institutions have been distancing themselves from Prince Andrew in the wake of his Newsnight interview in which he discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>BT was the latest to publicly cut ties when it announced on Wednesday that they will only work iDEA which promotes digital skills if the award drops the Duke of York as a patron.</p>
      <p>Andrew is facing a barrage of criticism, with the royal accused of a lack of empathy with Epstein's victims and a lack of remorse for his friendship with the disgraced financier during the interview that was shown at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the duke to tell US authorities what he knows.</p>

      <p>During the interview, the duke, questioned by Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, twice stated his relationship with Epstein had some "seriously beneficial outcomes", giving him the opportunity to meet people and prepare for a future role as a trade envoy.</p>
      <p>Andrew denied that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage, and the alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>The American said the same alleged sexual liaison began with the duke sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp.</p>
      <p>But the duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>
      <p>He said he had no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here are the organisations who have been distancing themselves:</b>
      </p>
      <h3>BT</h3>
      <p>BT is the latest company saying it will only continue to work with iDEA which promotes digital skills if the award drops the Duke of York as a patron.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the telecoms firm said: "We have been working with the company since its launch in 2017 and our dealings have been with its executive directors not its patron, the Duke of York.</p>
      <p>"As a leading provider of online digital skills training, iDEA was a natural partner for our new Skills for Tomorrow programme.</p>
      <p>"However, in light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage."</p>
      <h3>KPMG</h3>
      <p>The company's contract with Andrew's Pitch@Palace - a mentoring scheme for tech start-ups and entrepreneurs - expired at the end of October and will not be renewed.</p>
      <h3>British Universities</h3>
      <p>Sudents at Huddersfield University launched a campaign for Andrew to resign as chancellor, saying he is 'not the sort of role model students should have'.</p>
      <p>A statement released by the Huddersfield Student Union said that, following the unanimous passing of the motion, its staff would now work with the university to see how it could be taken forward.</p>
      <p>The University, however, backed Andrew, saying his 'enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit with the work of the university'.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University also revealed it was reviewing the Duke's role as its patron.</p>
      <p>Andrew's position will be considered as part of the agenda at the university's board of governors meeting next week.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "The university opposes all forms of discrimination, abuse, human trafficking and any activity that is contrary to the university's values."</p>
      <h3>Australian University</h3>
      <p>Murdoch University has joined the list of Australian educational organisations severing ties with Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace initiative.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "Murdoch University has today advised Buckingham Palace it would not continue its participation in Pitch@Palace in 2020.</p>
      <p>"We remain committed to supporting innovators and entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>"However, in the current circumstances we have decided that our efforts in this area are best served through other means.</p>
      <p>"Over the last two years, we have built strong relationships with other Western Australian supporters of innovation and entrepreneurship and look forward to working with them to offer alternative events for WA entrepreneurs."</p>
