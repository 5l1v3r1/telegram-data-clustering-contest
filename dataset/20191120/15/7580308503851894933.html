      <p>The popular book by Michelle Obama titled “Becoming” has been nominated under the category of Spoken word which includes poetry, audiobooks, and storytelling, for Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p><a href="https://becomingmichelleobama.com/">“Becoming”</a> is a memoir which details a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address.</p>
      <p>Warm, wise, and revelatory, “Becoming” is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.</p>
      <p>With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms.</p>
      <p>The book is in the same category as books such as <i>Beastie Boys Book, I.V., 20 Years As A Two-Time Cancer Survivor, Mr. Know-It-All, and Sekou Andrews &amp; The String Theory.</i></p>
      <p>Should she win, Michelle will join the many world leaders that have been winners under this category. Michelle’s husband, Barack Obama is a two-time Grammy winner. He won in 2006 and 2008.</p>
      <p>Fellow ex-president Jimmy Carter won three Grammy awards in the category: one in 2007, another in 2016 and the most recent one in 2019.</p>
      <p>Bill Clinton won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word Album in 2005. His wife Hillary Clinton won the category back in 1997 and was nominated again in 2004. That year, she lost to another Democrat politician, Al Franken.</p>
