The magnetic 31-year-old Lizzo debuted in 2013 but truly burst into the public eye this year with her third studio album “Cuz I Love You,” which scored a nomination for the prestigious Album of the Year category for the Grammys, which will take place on January 26.

      <p>Singer and rapper Lizzo scored eight Grammy nominations Wednesday to lead a field packed with newcomers, including bold pop iconoclast Billie Eilish and overnight sensation Lil Nas X, for music’s biggest honours.</p>
      <p>The magnetic 31-year-old Lizzo debuted in 2013 but truly burst into the public eye this year with her third studio album “Cuz I Love You,” which scored a nomination for the prestigious Album of the Year category for the Grammys, which will take place on January 26.</p>
      <p>Eilish also nabbed a shot at the best album for “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” to bring her total nomination count to six, as the genre-bending meme king Lil Nas X rode the fame of his viral smash “Old Town Road” to also snag six chances at Grammy gold.</p>
      <p>The newbies will square up against some superstar challengers.</p>
      <p>Ariana Grande — whose album “thank u, next” missed last year’s Grammy deadline — bagged five nominations this year.</p>
      <p>Beyonce earned four nods on the strength of her Netflix concert film about her dazzling 2018 Coachella performance and the album accompanying this year’s “Lion King” film remake.</p>
      <p>The enigmatic R&amp;B prodigy H.E.R., who won two Grammys last year, also got five nominations this year, including for Album of the Year.</p>
      <p>Once a perennial favourite, Taylor Swift was once again largely snubbed from the major categories for her new album “Lover,” except for Song of the Year — which honours the best songwriting — for her title track.</p>
      <p>She is up for just three awards this year, the two others coming in the pop categories.</p>
      <p>Along with the nomination leaders, the nominee list includes a mix of pop newcomers and veteran alt-leaning acts including Lana Del Rey, Bon Iver and Vampire Weekend.</p>
