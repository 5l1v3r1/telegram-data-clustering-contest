        <b>Four of the five males are currently detained for questioning</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, November 13, the shocking news emerged of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/gardai-investigating-seven-attacks-sex-workers-343106">seven attacks</a> on sex workers occurring since mid-October nationwide.</p>
      <p>The assaults involved physical violence against male or female sex workers who were robbed by several males. Gardai believe the main motivation behind these attacks was for monetary gain.</p>
      <p>As part of ongoing investigations, a search operation was carried out on Tuesday, November 19, resulting in the arrests of four men, aged between 18 and 37.</p>
      <p>Three addresses were searched under warrant in the West Dublin area. All four males are currently detained for questioning under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at Garda Stations in Dublin.</p>
      <p>A fifth male was arrested on foot of a bench warrant and is now before the District Court.</p>
      <p>"Operation Quest", as it is so called, was conducted by Gardai from the Garda National Protective Services Bureau (GNPSB), along with units from Dublin Metropolitan South Central, Western and Northern Divisions, and Longford/Roscommon Divisions.</p>
      <p>An Garda Siochana is appealing to any sex workers who may have exeperienced a similar attack to come forward.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for An Garda Siochana said:</p>
      <p>"Anyone who comes forward will be treated confidentially with compassion and sensitivity.</p>
      <p>"An Garda Siochana is also appealing to any person with information on these callous, targeted attacks to please contact Gardai to assist in bringing these dangerous attackers to justice.</p>
      <p>"Anyone with information is asked to contact the Garda Confidential Line 1800 666 111 or any Garda Station."</p>
