      <p>Ransomware operators are moving away from mass volume attacks and partnering with specialists who use APT techniques to provide stealthy infiltration and network-wide encryption capabilities.</p>
      <p>When ransomware exploded in 2013 with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information">CryptoLocker</a>, threat actors typically operated using a spray and pray approach where they attempted to infect as many people as possible, hoping that some of them would pay.</p>
      <p>This approach, though, was always of concern to other threat actors who looked at hacking as an elitist field where there activities took patience, skill, and an art-like grace. To them, ransomware was only low-quality malware that would bring unwanted law enforcement attention to their community's actions.</p>
      <p>This was seen in 2017 when underground hacker and malware forums were toying with the idea of <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/underground-hacking-forum-admins-having-second-thoughts-about-selling-ransomware/">banning ransomware related topics</a> as if they allowed "ransomware operators on the forum, we are digging our own grave."</p>
      <p>Fast forward to the end of 2018 and through 2019. We now see that ransomware operators are joining forces with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sodinokibi-ransomware-builds-an-all-star-team-of-affiliates/">specialized affiliates</a> or partners who have the skills needed in targeted attacks that require network-wide access.</p>
      <h3>APT + Ransomware = $$$</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/post/digital-pharmacusa-supply-chain-attacks-for-ransomware-intrusions">new report</a> by cybersecurity and intelligence firm <a href="https://www.advanced-intel.com/">AdvIntel</a>, we explore how ransomware operators are partnering with actors who utilize APT methods to gain access to networks and perform network-wide ransomware attacks or supply-chain attacks.</p>

      <p>Network breach actors illegally gain access to networks, and over time, slowly take control by installing backdoors, gaining the credentials of administrative accounts, ultimately gaining control over domain controllers.</p>
      <p>Depending on the size of the compromised network and its potential value to other threat actors, AdvIntel states that network access costs between $10,000 to $15,000 USD, on average.</p>
      <p>AdvIntel has noticed a new trend where network breach actors are starting to partner with ransomware operators either as affiliates or by selling them access to the controlled networks for as little as $1,000 to $5,000.</p>
      <p>"At this point, ransomware collectives act as patrons. Being on the top of the underground food-chain, they hunger for expansion and conquest of new realms. They know how resourceful a supply-chain breach can be when it comes to locking multiple systems and are eager to invest in the rising talents which can lead them to even further success. Therefore, these syndicates offer the highest rewards which can easily cover any time and expenses spent on maintaining the persistent presence. For this reason, hackers who can accomplish sophisticated third-party attacks compete in searching for the sponsor."</p>
      <p>For example, an English-speaking threat actor named 'bc.monster' has been seen approaching the Russian-speaking ransomware community in order to sell access to networks bc.monster controls.</p>
      <p>This actor claims to have access to the network of a US energy company that would allow an attacker to not only infiltrate the company's network, but also their vendors' and customers' networks.</p>

      <p>AdvIntel believes bc.monster may be working as an affiliate for two Ransomware-as-a-Service operations. While it is not known what ransomware they are affiliated with, based on private discussions, AdvIntel told BleepingComputer that they think it's one of the Rapid, Buran, or JSworm ransomware gangs.</p>
      <p>Another actor going by the name 'x444x0' claims to have breached an Australian telecommunication providers network with over 9,000 computers on it and wants to sell it for $5,000. x444x0 appears to be working with Buran and other large ransomware operations.</p>

      <p>By partnering with ransomware operations, these network breach actors can sell the networks they have access to a lost easier, as well as to potentially gain much greater revenue by becoming an affiliate of a RaaS.</p>
      <h3>Specialized affiliate crews</h3>
      <p>Instead of partnering with network breach actors, some ransomware affiliates are creating specialized teams of actors for their operations.</p>
      <p>AdvIntel describes a cybercrime group named 'amiak' that includes numerous actors that each perform different functions in the team. This includes a web inject manager, botnet manager, exploit kit developer, and a ransomware specialist.</p>
      <p>"Collaboration with external affiliates is often helpful, but not every ransomware group relies on this support. Some prefer to accomplish the supply-chain attacks all by themselves. “amiak” a Russian-speaking ransomware collective formed in June 2015 which specializes in targeting corporations, refuses to rely on others, even though third-party attacks and other offensive operations requiring persistency are their ultimate specialization."</p>
      <p>By keeping all of the tasks in-house and not relying on external actors, the team is able to have tighter coordination by working more often together and therefore generate greater revenue.</p>
      <p>This type of teamwork has allowed this team to gain access to numerous networks, including to one belonging to a Canadian point-of-sale (POS) software provider in order to perform supply-chain attacks against the victim's customers.</p>

      <p>Whether a ransomware affiliate partners with an external threat actor to gain network access or creates an in-house crew specialized for this purpose, one thing is clear: integrating APT techniques into ransomware operations leads to <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/attackers-earn-over-1-million-in-florida-ransomware-attacks/">far greater ransoms</a> as proven by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mexicos-pemex-oil-suffers-ransomware-attack-49-million-demanded/">recent targeted ransomware attacks</a>.</p>
      <p>As can be seen, ransomware tactics have changed considerably since 2013 and threat actors who encrypted entire networks did it using an APT approach. This means that these actors most likely had a foothold in their victims' networks for quite a long time and only executed the ransomware payload after they squeezed it dry of anything else of value.</p>
