      <p>Ethiopia caused the first real shock of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers when they came from behind to stun the Ivory Coast with a 2-1 victory in their Group K clash in Bahir Dar on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Serge Aurier gave the Ivorians an early lead when he knocked in a rebound after Max Gradel’s free-kick had been parried into his path by home goalkeeper Abel Mamo.</p>
      <p>Yet Ethiopia was level on 16 minutes as Surafel Dagnachew’s free-kick was deflected in off the wall before Shemeles Bekele shrugged off two defenders, and a shout for handball, to score the winner midway through the opening period.</p>
      <p>Madagascar continued their fine recent form in the other game in the pool with a thumping 6-2 victory over Niger in Niamey.</p>
      <p>The win is the biggest ever on the road in Nations Cup qualifiers for Madagascar and puts them top of the group with a full haul of six points from their two games.</p>
      <p>Madagascar was 4-1 up at halftime thanks to a brace by Lalaina Nomenjanahary, and goals from Anicet (penalty) and Andria.</p>
      <p>Paulin Voavy and Jerome Mombris added two more in the second period.</p>
      <p>Niger had taken an early lead through Amadou Wonkoye before being stung by six unanswered goals. Yusif Moussa grabbed a late consolation for them.</p>
      <p>A brace from striker Khama Billiat sealed a precious 2-1 away victory for Zimbabwe in Zambia.</p>
      <p>Patson Daka had equalised for the Zambians in the opening period, but Billiat profited from a defensive lapse to net the winner 10 minutes from fulltime.</p>
      <p>Noussair Mazraoui scored the first-ever goal for Morocco as they eased to a 3-0 victory in Burundi, with Youssef En-Nesyri and Achraf Hakimi netting the others.</p>
      <p>The other match in Group E saw Mauritania claim a 2-0 home win over the Central African Republic as Moctar El Hacen and Diallo Guidileye scored.</p>
      <p>Wahbi Khazri scored the only goal as Tunisia moved to the top of Group J with a full haul of six points following a victory over Equatorial Guinea in Malabo.</p>
      <p>In the other game in the pool, Libya rallied from a goal down to defeat Tanzania 2-1 in neutral Monastir.</p>
      <p>Mbwana Samata put Tanzania ahead with a penalty in the first half, before the home side were also awarded a spot-kick that Sand Masaud converted. Anis Saltou netted the winner on 81 minutes.</p>
