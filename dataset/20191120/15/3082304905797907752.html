        <b>In a major boost to Manchester United and their players’ fitness, three key players from the squad have been spotted training with the club ahead of this weekend’s Premier League action.</b>
      </p>
      <p>United will take on Sheffield United at Bramball Lane on Sunday, and just might have Axel Tuanzebe, Luke Shaw and Nemanja Matic fit and available for selection for that game.</p>
      <p>The trio was seen training at the AON training complex, per <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11865632/luke-shaw-nemanja-maitc-and-axel-tuanzebe-back-in-man-utd-training">Sky Sports</a>, and this could be the perfect time for them to return considering the busy period coming up.</p>

      <p>Luke Shaw has been ruled out with a thigh injury suffered in a game against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford earlier in the season, and has since seen his left back spot in serious jeopardy with the emergence of young Brandon Williams.</p>
      <p>Nemanja Matic has also been out with a long-term injury, but could return this weekend, and might be thrust right into the first team after an injury to Scott McTominay before the International break.</p>
      <p>Finally, Axel Tuanzebe is back as well, returning from a hip problem suffered in the 1-1 draw that the Red Devils played out at Old Trafford against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Crucially, however, Paul Pogba is yet to fully recover from an ankle injury and is unlikely to return this weekend.</p>
