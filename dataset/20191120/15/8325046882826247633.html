        <li>A new robot vacuum is on the market for $499 per month from Japanese tech giant <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/softbank">SoftBank</a>, aimed mostly at office spaces.</li>
        <li>SoftBank is the company that has taken over WeWork, and has also heavily invested in Uber and Slack.</li>
        <li>The vacuum, called Whiz, uses LIDAR sensors, the same technology used in self-driving cars.</li>

      <p>These days, SoftBank might be best known for its role in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/wework">WeWork</a> debacle, taking over the coworking company following a failed IPO and the ousting of its CEO, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/adam-neumann">Adam Neumann</a>. But the Japanese giant has other projects in the works, too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/us/whiz">Whiz</a> is the company’s newly released robot vacuum. SoftBank calls it a “fully autonomous vacuum sweeper,” similar to a Roomba, but with a much heftier price tag at $499 per month.</p>
      <p>The vacuum works using LIDAR technology, in which sensors use pulses of light to detect objects and determine how far away they are. This is the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-softbank-toyota-autonomous-vehicle-tech-investment-2019-3">same technology</a> used in self-driving cars. SoftBank says Whiz is programmed to avoid “people, glass walls, cliffs, and other hazards.”</p>
      <p>The first time Whiz is used in a new area, you guide the route to teach it where to go. Then, SoftBank says, Whiz can clean the route on its own – “no downtime, no extra work required.”</p>

      <p>After each cleaning, Whiz provides a report about how, when, and where a space was cleaned. It can clean for about three hours on a single charge, and cover up to 15,000 square feet in that time.</p>
      <p>Because of the high price, SoftBank is marketing the vacuum to offices, positioning the product as a replacement to a cleaning staff. SoftBank says it is an opportunity to free up janitorial staff to “focus on higher-value work that often goes neglected.”</p>
      <p>In reality, though, automation often leads to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/">unemployment.</a> This might be particularly attractive to a company like SoftBank – in the case of WeWork, the company has had issues relating to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-criticized-by-tenants-letter-cleaning-contractors-fired-push-union-2019-9">recognizing cleaning staff unions</a>, and has been accused of unfairly firing cleaning contractors.</p>
