      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> star Kristofer Hivju has said that he wants Tormund and his partner in crime Brienne to get their own spin-off series of the show.</p>
      <p>The pair of characters have long been adored by fans, and were placed in a love triangle with Jaime in the show.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Hivju was speaking as part of <i>Game Of Thrones: A Celebration</i> at the BFI in London on Monday (November 18), which featured a Q&amp;A with him, Isaac Hempstead Wright (Bran Stark) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy) along with a screening of behind the scenes footage from the show.</p>
      <p>During the panel. Hivju responded to the love triangle that Tormund and Brienne found themselves in, stating his desire for their story to continue in a spin-off.</p>
      <p>“I’m up for it,” he says. “You’d have Castle Black and [us] trying to run it together. It’s 19 minutes per episode.”</p>

      <p>Game of Thrones came to a close back in May after its eighth season</p>
      <p>At the same talk, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-star-isaac-hempstead-wright-why-bran-stark-had-best-storyline-2569222">Isaac Hempstead Wright spoke about Bran Stark’s ascension to the Iron Throne</a>, saying: “In the very first episode you think he’s toast – he’s dead.</p>
      <p>“He grows and learns the hard way about a lot of things. He goes from being this traditionally vulnerable character to the most powerful person there is.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I was pretty happy with just him becoming the Three-Eyed Raven, but what a great story where this boy – this disabled 10-year-old in the harshest world ever – [comes] to triumph. And so to see him become king and be victorious is so…it’s brilliant to have a disabled character win the whole of <i>Game of Thrones</i>.”</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/game-of-thrones-sequel-starring-naomi-watts-has-been-cancelled-by-hbo-2562428">HBO scrapped an upcoming <i>Game Of Thrones</i> prequel, set to star Naomi Watts, even though a pilot episode had already been filmed</a>.</p>
      <p>In its place, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/house-dragon-hbo-confirms-new-game-thrones-prequel-2562527">a full series for a separate <i>Game Of Thrones</i> spin-off titled <i>House Of The Dragon</i></a> is instead set to begin production with HBO.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The final season of Game of Thrones and the full series boxset is available on DVD and Blu-ray from 2nd December.</b>
