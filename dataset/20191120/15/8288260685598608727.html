      <h1>The dangers of 'buy now, pay later' - man with £22 debt charged £400 interest</h1>
      <h2>Resolver eventually got the man his money back, but many won't be as lucky</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:28:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:28</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, James Andrews, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A man was charged £400 interest on a £22 debt as the dangers of buy now, pay later are laid bare.</p>
      <p>Pressing the "spread the payment interest-free" button on a shop's website is very far from risk free.</p>
      <p>The man was sent the bill after the firm said he had just £22 of debt.</p>
      <p>James Walker, founder of free complaints service  <a href="https://www.resolver.co.uk/">Resolver.co.uk</a> , told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/man-charged-400-interest-22-20879295">Mirror Money</a> : "I've helped sort out problems with many of the big retailers where people have been hit by bills of hundreds of pounds for backdated interest.</p>
      <p>"In once case, a man owed just £22 yet he was hit with £400 interest. And he’d paid the full amount his account told him to on time too."</p>

      <p>Sarah Megginson, from credit experts  <a href="https://www.clearscore.com/">ClearScore</a> , said: "The lure of a buy now pay layer schemes online and in-store can be very attractive. However, the reality is that many carry eye-watering interest rates, fees and charges at every turn."</p>
      <p>Resolver eventually got the man his money back, but many won't be as lucky.</p>
      <p>Worse, as purchases pile up, keeping on top of exactly what is owed, where and when it's due can become an almost impossible task.</p>
      <p>"Imagine you’ve bought a few items over six months from an online retailer. Each one has a ‘free period’ but you can’t tell when one begins and ends," Walker said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"How do you manage that? What gets paid off first or does it all go in to a pot? Do you get a clear warning what you have to pay off and when?"</p>
      <p>"When you take out a loan, you sign documents, have to indicate you’ve seen the terms and conditions and know that you’re borrowing cash," he added.</p>
      <p>"These deals don’t even feel like debt and it’s easy to sleepwalk your way in to owing huge amounts of money."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>ClearScore's Megginson added: "They are instantly available at store counters and through online retailers, which means people don’t often have time to consider their options or look at the terms and conditions before taking them out.</p>
      <p>"Plus, many of these lenders won’t run a credit check to see if you can actually afford to take out credit, which can leave many people in tough circumstances."</p>
      <p>Resolver's Walker has a simple rule to keeping yourself out of trouble.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The best thing you can do as a customer is be cynical! If a deal sounds to good to be true then it is," he said.</p>
      <p>"We all believe we can beat the system and not pay interest – but most of us fail and pay the price. Remember, this is a gamble – and the house always gets the best odds!"</p>
