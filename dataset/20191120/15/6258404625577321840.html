      <p>When Apple launched its new <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/iphone-11-ram-and-battery-details">iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro</a> smartphones back in September, the company impressed with its blazing fast A13 Bionic SoC, incredibly bright display, and top-notch image quality from its new dual- and triple camera arrays. More importantly, Apple managed to boost battery life by up to 5 hours compared to the previous generation models without a significant increase in thickness.</p>
      <p>For those that still aren't satisfied with the battery life improvements (+1, +4, and +5 hours respectively on the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max), then Apple has just officially launched new <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/apple-shimpi-schiller-a13-bionic-iphone-11-smart-battery-case">Smart Battery Cases</a> for all three smartphones. Like previous generation Smart Battery Cases, these latest offering are recharged via Lightning port, and have a cutout for the rear cameras (this time around, it's a square-shaped cutout). New this year is the inclusion of Qi wireless recharging as well.</p>

      <p>The cases feature a silicone outer covering which makes it easier to insert and remove your smartphone, while a microfiber lining ensure that your device won't get scratched from repeated manhandling. According to Apple, the Smart Battery Cases will boost battery life for the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/apple-shimpi-schiller-a13-bionic-iphone-11-smart-battery-case">iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro</a> range by up to 50 percent over their already impressive runtimes. Battery status can be quickly obtained by looking in Notification Center or by glancing at the lock screen.</p>
      <p>This year, however, Apple is throwing in an added bonus with the Smart Battery Case: there's now a dedicated camera shutter button on the lower right-hand side of the case. The positioning is perfect for holding the iPhone in landscape mode to take a picture, and takes the place of hitting the shutter button on the screen (or one of the volume buttons). A single press will capture an image, while holding it down will result in a QuickTake video.</p>
      <p>Apple says that the new Smart Battery Cases will ship on November 25<sup>th</sup>, but you can pre-order then today. The price of entry is $129 no matter if you're purchasing one for an <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVH2LL/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVL2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11 Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVQ2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-white">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>.</p>
