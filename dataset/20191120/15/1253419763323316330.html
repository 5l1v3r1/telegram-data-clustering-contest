      <p>Epic Games has released a brand new update for Fortnite. According to the release notes, update 11.20 adds support for Microsoft’s DirectX 12 API. Theoretically, this should improve overall performance on systems with older CPUs. To use Microsoft DirectX 12, players will have to select it in the Advanced Graphics section of the Video settings.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this latest patch allows players to adjust the UI contrast. To do this, players will have to use the User Interface Contrast setting in the Graphics section of the Video settings.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this patch increases the Effective Health given from Slurp Tankers. It also brings back Daily Challenges (that players can complete for XP) and adjusts the headshot multiplier of the Tactical Shotgun.</p>
      <p>Lastly, this patch comes with numerous bug fixes.</p>
      <p>As always, the Epic Games Store launcher will download this patch the next time you launch it. You can also find below its complete changelog.</p>
