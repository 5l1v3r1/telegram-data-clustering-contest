          </p>
          <p>Tottenham surprised after <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-tottenham-hotspurs-confirms-departure-of-manager-pochettino-from-club/">sacking Mauricio Pochettino</a> and in a few hours announced that they have <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-tottenham-manager/">replaced the Argentine International with Jose Mourinho</a>.</p>

                      <p>In the goal-post, Paulo Gazzaniga is certain to start as club captain <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/brighton-vs-tottenham-watch-hugo-lloris-commits-a-blunder-and-suffers-horrific-injury/">Hugo Lloris is ruled out with an elbow injury till Decembery end</a>. Further, the back four will most probably of Serge Aurier, Toby Alderweireld, Davidson Sanchez and Danny Rose (Ben Davies an option too).</p>
                      <p>In the midfield, Harry Winks and Tanguy Ndombele are predicted to guard the defence line with Victor Wanyama an alternative to them. Moreover, Giovani Lo Celso is also an option over here.</p>

                          <p>Heung-Min Son would be an undisputed player on the left-wing, in the number 10 position, there is the most amount of competition as Dele Alli, Lucas Moura, Lo Celso and Christian Eriksen all are fitting players for there, but it seems work rate of Alli will overpower all of them.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>On the right, Lucas Moura has a strong contention to start with Tottenham having no natural player at the right-wing. Ahead, there is no competition to Harry Kane in the lineup, as he is certainly among the best strikers in the world, and have all the traits to be a favourite player of Mourinho.</p>
