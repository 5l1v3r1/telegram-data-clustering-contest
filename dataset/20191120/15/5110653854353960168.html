      <p>McCammond is a reporter who is covering the 2020 presidential election. She was in Atlanta to cover Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate, and she was interviewing Barkleyabout his support forformer Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p>
      <p>Barkley made his comment off the record, butMcCammond explained why it was important for her to break that agreement.</p>

      <p>McCammond also <a href="https://twitter.com/alexi/status/1197013446417682432">tweeted</a> a photo of Barkley as proof he was there.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, Barkley sent an apology statement throughTurner Sports.</p>

      <p>Before Barkley's statement,McCammond <a href="https://twitter.com/alexi/status/1197023045749219328">sent a series of tweets</a> further explaining why she broke the off the record agreement.</p>
      <blockquote>"I hate being part of a story so here's a reminder that this is so much bigger than me: nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the US. 1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner physical violence.It's not about me or my feelings — though I'm grateful for the many friends who have reached out. But it's about refusing to allow this culture to perpetuate because of silence on these issues. It's easier and less awkward to be silent, but that helps NO ONE but the perpetrator.I encourage you to consider how you'd respond if a friend said something similar to what Barkley said tonight. And then challenge yourself to ask the same of yourself if a stranger (or 'celebrity') said that. I hope the answers are the same. Everyone should be held accountable."</blockquote>
      <p>AfterMcCammond's tweet starting gaining attention, other social media users began to find similarlymisogynistic quotes from Barkley's past. For instance, when the NBA was looking to hire female referees, Barkley said, "This is a man's game, and it should stay that way."Another quote of his that gained a lot of attention was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-11-26-sp-4120-story.html">something he said</a> in 1990 after a win against the Nets.</p>
      <p>"This is a game that if you lose, you go home and beat your wife and kids,"Barkley said at the time. "Did you see my wife jumping up and down at the end of the game? That'sbecause she knew I wasn't going to beat her."</p>
      <p>Barkley had the same response back then as he does now, claiming it was a bad joke.</p>
      <p>As for anyrepercussions for Barkley, it appears he'll avoid any harsh punishment from Turner Sports. The company's release Wednesday morning just added Barkley's statement and made no mention of a potential suspension.</p>
