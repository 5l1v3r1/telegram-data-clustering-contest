      <h1>Cleveland Browns’ Offense Receives Huge Boost Before Dolphins Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:10:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>When the Cleveland Browns take the field on Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, a familiar face could be back on the field.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, tight end David Njoku suffered a scary fall against the New York Jets, breaking his wrist. After the injury, the Browns placed Njoku on Injured Reserve, where he’s been for the majority of the season.</p>
      <p>However, that’s all about to change. On Wednesday morning, the Browns announced Njoku has been designated to return from IR and will practice this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“The Browns have 21 days to activate Njoku or he must remain on the injured reserve list for the remainder of the season. He missed the required eight games, and upon activation, would be eligible to return as soon as this week’s game against the Miami Dolphins,” the team said in a statement.</p>
      <p>ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler revealed Njoku is unlikely to play this weekend, but could return soon.</p>

      <p>Njoku caught just four passes for 37 yards and a touchdown through the first two games of the season.</p>
      <p>It’s great news for a Browns offense that appears to have finally found its footing. Star quarterback Baker Mayfield lit up a talented Pittsburgh Steelers defense and now faces one of the worst defenses in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Cleveland and Miami kick off at 1:00 p.m. ET.</p>
