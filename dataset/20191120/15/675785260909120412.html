      <h1>Disney World tourists' get heartbreaking souvenir from grieving couple</h1>
      <h2>Kara and Kyle are trying to trace a kind couple they met at Disney World, Florida, to thank them for gifting their daughter a gold ring</h2>

      <p>A family are searching for a couple they met at Disney World who gave their daughter a ‘moving’ present that changed their trip.</p>
      <p>Kara and Kyle Geiselman visited the park with their twin daughters to commemorate that little Belle had started eating without a tube and travelling without a breathing mask at 18 months old while visiting the theme park.</p>
      <p>During the trip, the family were having a picnic when Belle, now three, shadowed her dad to put something in the bin and ran directly into a couple.</p>
      <p>The couple stopped in their tracks and asked Kyle whether his daughter liked gold.</p>
      <p>They then gifted her a glistening <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mickey-mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> ring, because she reminded them of their own daughter who, ‘was adorable like their little girl,’ Kara wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>

      <p>The grieving couple were visiting Orlando, Florida, to mark the one-year anniversary of their daughter’s Make-a-Wish trip.</p>
      <p>On their initial family holiday, they had bought two gold rings, one for their daughter and one with the hope of gifting another child.</p>
      <p>Little did they know, Belle had struggled with her own health, having been born prematurely at 30 weeks, her dad told <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/little-girl-gifted-gold-ring-grieving-parents-disney-t167333?utm_campaign=likeshopme&amp;cid=sm_npd_td_in_td-bio_180511&amp;utm_medium=instagram&amp;utm_source=dash+hudson&amp;utm_content=www.instagram.com%2Fp%2FB45hHdtJNsb%2F">Today</a> , last week.</p>
      <p>Belle - who is an identical twin - had to live with a feeding tube until she was 18 months old.</p>
      <p>Kyle said: “When Belle was 5 days old, her doctors were like, ‘We don’t know if she is going to live.’ She actually almost died.”</p>
      <p>Now Kara and Kyle are trying to trace down the generous couple to thank them ‘properly’ and to offer their own condolences for their loss, as the act of kindness left them speechless at the time.</p>

      <p>Writing on Facebook, Kara, said: “Moved beyond belief that they chose our daughter to memorialize their daughter with, Kyle was at a loss for words. He wanted to tell them so much, that he was sorry for their insurmountable loss and about our own little warrior but in the moment only thank you came out.</p>
      <p>“The fact that they choose Belle without knowing her struggles in life brings tears to my eyes.”</p>
      <p>The couple say they will cherish the ring as a ‘priceless gift’.</p>
      <p>Social media users have been quick to share their own stories of losing a child with Kara’s Facebook post wracking up 6,000 views and shared 2,000 times.</p>
