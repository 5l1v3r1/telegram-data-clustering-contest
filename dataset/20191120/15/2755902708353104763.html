      <p>Hugh Chivingwa Makumbe met his untimely death last month after was he brutally stabbed by Chengetai  Jimu after he caught him in a compromising position with his fiance, Rumbidzai Mangandu.</p>
      <p>The gruesome murder occurred in Bindura. Makombe and Mangandu were both students at Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University (ZEGU) students in Bindura.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/varsity-student-murdered/">H-Metro</a>, efforts to get a comment from the university were futile. ZEGU Dean of Students, only identified as a Mr Zunguze, told the publication that he had nothing to comment on the issue before hanging up the phone.</p>
      <p>Mashonaland Central acting police spokesperson Tonny Nyandoro confirmed the incident.</p>
      <aside>I can confirm a murder case in Bindura, where a ZEGU student was reportedly killed in a love wrangle by Mutare man who is still at large. Investigations are still in progress.</aside>
      <p>A witness, Koga Gatsi, told the publication that the now deceased was stabbed on the forehead and neck after he was found seated with Mangandu by the suspect who is still at large. Jimu is reported to have shifted his rage and went on to pour a bucket of acid on Mangandu accusing her of cheating on him while he was in Mutare.</p>
      <p>Mangandu is battling for her life at a hospital in Bindura from the burns she sustained from the acid attack.</p>
