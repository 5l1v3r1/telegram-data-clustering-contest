      <p>FRANKFURT: Strikes at Lufthansa units Eurowings, Germanwings Cityline and Sunexpress remain possible despite arbitration talks at the German carrier, a spokesman for trade union UFO said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Small scale arbitration talks continue. But there is no chance that these will pacify the situation," an UFO spokesman said.</p>

      <p>A Lufthansa spokesman said that after UFO decided strikes could still take place, Lufthansa's subsidiaries group management would pull out of a wider arbitration process, only offering talks about a limited number of topics.</p>
      <p>Last week, Lufthansa and UFO agreed to enter large-scale arbitration talks over pay and pensions, averting further strikes.</p>
