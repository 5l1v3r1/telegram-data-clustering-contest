      <p>An English socialite who briefly dated <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-interview-firms-cut-ties-list-2019-11">Prince Andrew</a> says she felt like she was "being watched" by hidden cameras while staying at Jeffrey Epstein's apartment when she was in her 20s.</p>
      <p>Lady Victoria Hervey <a href="https://twitter.com/GMB/status/1197060810759118848">spoke to "Good Morning Britain"</a> about Epstein in an interview that aired Wednesday morning, in which she also defended <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/watch-prince-andrew-interview-about-epstein-connection-bbc-2019-11">Prince Andrew's decision to speak publicly</a>.</p>
      <p>She said that because <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ghislaine-maxwell-father-epstein-family-history-yacht-images-2019-8">Epstein's ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, was her longtime friend, she was invited to dinner parties hosted by the couple, and even stayed at one of the financier's New York apartments when she was in town for a modeling job.</p>
      <p>"I did feel very uncomfortable staying there at the time. I cut my trip short, I felt like I was being watched, like there were cameras, hidden cameras. I left after about ten days or so and moved in with a friend of mine," Lady Hervey, now 43, said.</p>
      <p>She said that around the same time in the late 1990s, she had also gone to a dinner party attended by Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew hosted by Epstein, who in July was arrested on sex trafficking charges and later died by suicide in his jail cell.</p>
      <p>"I was very young and very impressionable. Jeffrey was a very charismatic man. He would walk into a room and people would take notice. With him and Ghislaine, it was kind of like teamwork. He had the finance, she had the black book. They were a great pair together and, kind of together, they were taking over the world," she told the TV show. "I was excited to be there, I remember it. There were some other businessmen I've known over the years. I guess I was there to look pretty, you know."</p>
      <p>She said that Maxwell kept her "protected" from Epstein because she was her friend and that she was "completely shocked" by Epstein's arrest and his eventual suicide. She said she didn't believe it was "sex trafficking" that Epstein was doing.</p>
      <p>"I saw things but I didn't see the truth," she said. "I had no idea what was really going on."</p>
      <p>Lady Hervey also spoke about her brief period of dating Prince Andrew, saying she went to a "couple dinners" with him in 1999 and 2000.</p>
      <p>She defended <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-bbc-interview-reputation-crumbling-2019-11">Prince Andrew's BBC interview</a>: "I watched it and I thought first of all, there is no way if he is guilty that he would go onto television and do an interview like that. There's no way. I think the public already made their decision a long time ago and thought he was guilty… he didn't really give the public what they wanted in respect to, you know, actually having any kind of remorse about these girls and things. That's why there has been a backlash. I actually think he didn't do it because there's no way he would go on television and put himself in that position."</p>
